# Proper Sunday Laws.

have overtaken our people, and this is the most disheartening problem presented to the body politic at the present time. The day seems to have gone by when the cry of the oppressed or the weak arouses the sense of justice in the hearts of our people. Especially is it set to see the religious press, supposed to represent the spirit of the Reformers (which struggled against such fearful pernment of other days), now as stout what fellowmen are being ground between the millstones for conscience' sake, to view this case of our greatest religious papers.

But "ENFORCEMENT" has arrived, grandly for feeding, as will be seen by the following extract:---

We have again, and again, during the last few years, had occasion to express our profound indignation at the renewed persecuting of Sabbath observers in the State of Tennessee. A Seventh-day Adventist who, after having rested on the Sabbath day in which the week, and goes to work on the first day of the week, . . . The first in the line has been on the attention of a jury, a few minutes ago, and sixty some two years of age were convicted and fined for doing quiet work on their farms which was not in the nature of a disturbance or alarming on the common highway. They refused to pay the fine, nor were they allowed the alternative of paying the fine, but were worked out as they were released. We have said it before and we say it again, that this is inhuman and bad religion.

Another religious organ, the Baptist *Church Builder*, gives these suggestive words of warning:---

Let us be heard we let in the camel's nose of religious legislation, next we shall have its ugly body form in and occupy the whole shop. If we do not stop here, the next step will be to set up the country set up a religious creed and enforce it. Where was the origin of the old Inquisition, in the Baptists and Quakers *Protest against* this modern desire to build once. Since has as a good, as some of the present Sunday Laws were.

As a rule, however, the religious press disregard the whole affair.

A nation can sometimes afford to err on the side of mercy, but no nation can afford to be unjust to her loveliest citizen. If one of those to believe mere blindly and constantly that every us, whether constituted by an individual, a State, or a nation. If we join one more commensurate or inevitably as the violation of a physical law but life in evil results. I believe that nothing against the moral character as to bear that individual, in evil community, and believing that all men are created equal, believe that this must for some time have passed in the hands of every citizen to be a just and liberty-loving American! Then upright, whole-hearted Americans, like the early Christians and the children of the Reformation, were tried. In those voices of conscience, were chained to depraved and brutalized criminals.

The outrage will not call for such examinations in the recent, were in not for the fact that in recent years in Tennessee and Arkansas

are these conscientious, Christian people, known as Adventists have been so terribly, actually persecuted. The case above noted is only one of a number of similar instances where price-loaded, Adventists Christians have been cruelly persecuted for conscience sake; and it would seem the very systematic persecution and the heartless ferocity with which just and upright persons have been punished, that they are victims of an organized effort, which has for its ultimate aim the destruction of the religious liberty calculated to further all the determined moral sentiments of the people, and State and abridges the rights of American citizenship. I wish to raise my voice as a citizen in behalf of these men, also to request to preserve, My whole soul recoils at the barbarism and ferocious savagery which seeks by persecuting coercion to law-resort in a measure the tragedies of the past and which through harsh legislation calcifies ignore the constitutional guaranties of Tennessee.

EDITOR AMERICAN SENTINEL. Your reply of my articles under the title of "The only Proper Sunday Law," is read with much interest. Allow me to use one word in the article you criticize; the word is "consideration." The State should have nothing to do with concerning consideration. Notice the word "offence" in the article. The whole authority of government based at last on the consummated power moral convictions of the majority of the people. But the State can not control consideration.

Those men, *That* and really and surely get to enforce a reasonable observance of Sunday law, provided they do their work in such a fair and apt way as the neighbors won't complain.

Sunday laws are religious law of the ordinary kind. Other Sunday laws are and are not religious like other laws. All law, and law, and should be founded on the moral convictions of the people, and the moral convictions are not in such that their religious convictions. Laws opposed to their convictions become dead letters. When all laws against bigotry, perjury, etc, like the laws against treason and the law against murder, follow the moral conviction of the people and leave them to choose. The moral convictions of the people are and must govern the relations between the first day and the other days of the week. But the commandment does not forbid bigamy, perjury, stealing, etc., because they are morally or religiously wrong, but because they are injurious to the community. So the Government does not forbid Sunday work because Sabbath-breaking is a sin. The argument does not forbid Sunday work because Sabbath-breaking is a sin, but the American law punishes the sin of Sabbath. Any Sunday work injures the people, intellectually, morally, and physically.

The course of THE SENTINEL, tends to destroy your people of their supply day. From this it follows, that no more can deny people's right to a weekly rest without denying them the right to their day Sabbath. Would it not be better for THE SENTINEL to make a stand for a rest day law, rather than to labor, indirectly it may be, to deprive you of a Sabbath and our weekly rest day?

## Editor Christian Patriot.

The foregoing is published at the request of the editor of the *Christian Patriot*. It will be noticed that the writer refuses to change the word "consideration" or have it expressed from his articles published by THE SENTINEL on November 24, on the ground that "the State should have nothing to do with conviction and consideration," and yet is quite further on to make on the plain statement that---

All laws are and should be, founded on the moral convictions of the people, and the moral convictions are not in their religious convictions.

The gentleman has surely knocked the props from under his own "argument," for he first states that the "Government should have nothing to do with the conscience and so close it follows up it with a claim that all laws should be based upon the religious convictions of the people. Now if religious and religious convictions are not matters pertaining entirely to the conscience, it might be well for the *Christian Patriot* to give us some light on the subject. But if they are, and since all authority of government is based at last upon the moral convictions, upon the convictions of the majority of the people, but the State is not control consideration. Whatever may be the writer of the foregoing may think or believe, it remains a but fact a
