# Turning Things Upside Down.

THE *Economist* (Baptist) says that the demonstrations multiply that the rejoicing over Sunday closing of the Chicago Exposition was premature:---

"It is high time," remarks the *Economist*, "for the advocates of a Sunday rest to bestir themselves." But what now can the advocates of a Sunday rest do? They have already counted as petitioners against closing the entire active membership of all the churches, both Protestant and Catholic, and surely they still will not have to further "stuff" their petitions. They have not only exhausted their resources in petition material, but exhausted them so as to more than create a suspicion that their petitions were fraudulent. "What can people" find themselves in a very awkward situation, but for which they have only themselves to blame.

The *Economist* complains that "the press is active" in the interests of Sunday opening, "not only the daily secular press, which has a pecuniary stake in every question of local and national interest, but the religious and local, but this specifically part of the so-called religious press. This powerful agency for the moulding of public opinion against closing is to use the Sunday closing of the Fair." "Read" this gives the great weight of his nature to this subject. All good citizens who would destroy the day of rest, and are clamoring for the Sunday closing or opening of the Fair as a long step in the direction of fulfilling their purpose.

One very noticeable thing in this contest is that fealty to Sunday is made the test of Christianity; an institution known without a shadow of divine authority, a day known to Holy Writ only as the "first day of the week," a day which no inspired writer ever called the Sabbath, and to which the early Church was as total strangers as was this nation at the veriest infancy of its history. On the overturned vestiges of the gospel of Christ, a day brought in to take the place of the Sabbath, whose abrogation for their ancient custom citadels looking for the honor of the ring god, has now become the symbol of all true religion. To honest it to be a Christian! to disregard it is to be an apostate from the rank of real Christianity! "religion!" Surely this is turning things upside down.
