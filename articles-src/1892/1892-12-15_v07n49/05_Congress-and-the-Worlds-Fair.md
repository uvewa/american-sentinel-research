# Congress and the World's Fair.

ON Sunday of machinery, unnecessary labor, and all merchandising, and at the same time give opportunity for the study of the highest standard of artistic mechanical excellence; that the architectural horticulture buildings and all buildings in which exhibits of mechanical art are displayed shall be open to the public every day; and that each employee shall be given one day each week for rest, study and recreation.

Mr. Durborow's resolution, it can be seen, does not lay the question on the matter of moral right and constitutional law, where it belongs; however, it is as absurd for Congress to require the Commission to excuse employees from operating the machinery on Sunday than for Congress to require the Commission and the Managers to close altogether? What jurisdiction has Congress in that at all? Nevertheless this is the phase which the question has assumed at the opening of the session.

A reporter for the *Washington Post* interviewed Mr. Durborow on this matter November 28.

We shall make a dignified appeal to members to keep the Fair open on Sunday. We oppose all merchandising or selling of liquor on the grounds and buildings, but there should be music on the grounds every Sunday, conducted by eminent leaders. The employees of the park are to work only six days in the seven; they will be permitted to work in shifts so as to give each one a day of rest; there will be from 4,000 to 50,000 visitors in the park, and a quieter, more refined crowd never visited any similar institution. It seems to us almost criminal to deny these people their only opportunity to see the Exposition. All efforts to securing a repeal of the provision, and offering amendments to Durborow's measure's legislation for Sunday closing.

This is the complexion which the popular question has assumed at the opening of the session.

The following is a copy of the petition which the World's Fair Sunday Opening Committee is now circulating:
