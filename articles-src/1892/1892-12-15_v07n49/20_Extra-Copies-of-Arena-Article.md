We have no apology to offer for making the masterly article from the Arena for December, prominent in this number of THE SENTINEL. The Arena is a prince among magazines, and this article though not on a popular subject is second to none in power or dignity, and can not fail to receive wide attention. Let no reader of THE SENTINEL pass it by. Read it and ask your friends and neighbors to read it. Anticipating a demand for this article we have had a limited number of extra copies printed and will furnish them at one dollar per hundred. Those desiring extra copies must order at once.
