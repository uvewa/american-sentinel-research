# Uncertainties Log - v07n49 (1892-12-15)

## General Notes

The OCR transcription from Mistral was generally clear and readable. No significant obstructions, stamps, or damage noted in the source material.

## Specific Uncertainties

### Page 1, Line 9
- **Issue:** Word appears as "Perguagion" (likely OCR error for "Persuasion")
- **Context:** "Equal and Exact Justice to all Men, of Whatever State or Perguagion, Religious or Political.—Thomas Jefferson."
- **Transcribed as:** "Persuasion"
- **Confidence:** HIGH - This is Thomas Jefferson's famous quote; the correct word is well-documented
- **Reason:** Standard OCR confusion of 's' and 'g' characters; the original quote uses "Persuasion"

### Page 6, Line 404
- **Issue:** "WEIGHT—Without Oase ! I Pounds 12 oz."
- **Context:** Advertisement for Munson typewriter specifications
- **Transcribed as:** "WEIGHT—Without Case 11 Pounds 12 oz."
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM - "Oase ! I" appears to be OCR error for "Case 11"
- **Reason:** Common OCR errors with 'C' as 'O' and '11' as '! I'; makes logical sense in context of typewriter weight

### Attribution Notes
- B. O. Flower article clearly marked as editorial from Arena for December 1892
- J. B. Converse identified by signature at end of letter
- W. H. McKee signed two articles with "W. H. M." and location "Washington, D. C."
- C. P. Bollman signed article with "C. P. B."
- A. T. J. (Alonzo T. Jones) signed opening editorial

## Conclusion

Overall transcription quality was high. The main uncertainty involved standard OCR character recognition issues rather than damaged or obscured text. All uncertainties were resolved through context and knowledge of historical sources.
