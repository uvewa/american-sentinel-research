We have just been informed by a correspondent, that on Friday, September 30, a Seventh-day Adventist saw two women fighting. The next day the Adventist was summoned to appear as a witness in the case, before the Justice of the Peace. It being the Sabbath, he refused to go, whereupon the constable was sent back to arrest him. Being thus forcibly brought before the court, the justice inquired why he did not appear. He told him that he could not conscientiously come on that day, because he regarded it as the Sabbath. The justice then said that the United States Government acknowledges one Sabbath, and that that was the first day of the week, and fined the gentleman $5.00 and costs, which amounted to $7.50. The gentleman refuses to pay the fine, and he is now threatened with imprisonment. We shall await with some interest the developments in the case.
