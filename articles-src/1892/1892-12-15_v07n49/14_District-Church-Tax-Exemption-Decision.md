A DECISION has just been rendered by the assistant attorney for the District of Columbia, upon a request for the refunding of money assessed for street improvements, against the Trinity Catholic Church, of Georgetown, D. C. The assistant attorney holds that the statute of the District exempting church and school property from taxation and assessment, has been repealed by the act of March 8, 1892, in so far as relates to assessments for new sidewalks and curbing.

According to this holding, church property in the District of Columbia stands upon the same footing with all the rest—that is, on the sidewalk and curb.
