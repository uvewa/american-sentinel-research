The Examiner (Baptist) says that "indications multiply that the rejoicing over the action of Congress regarding the Sunday closing of the Chicago Exposition was premature."

"It is high time," remarks the Examiner, "for the advocates of a Sunday rest to bestir themselves." But what now can "the advocates of a Sunday rest" do? they have already counted as petitioners several times over the entire membership of all the churches, both Protestant and Catholic, and surely they will not have the face to further "stuff" their petitions. They have not only exhausted their resources but they have so far exceeded them as to more than create a suspicion as to their honesty. Surely "the Christian people" find themselves in a very awkward situation, but for which they have only themselves to blame.

The Examiner complains that "the press is active" in the interests of Sunday opening; "not only the daily press, which has a pecuniary stake in every question of this kind, but the periodicals, and even a part of the so-called religious press. This powerful agency for the moulding of public opinion is almost wholly arrayed against Sunday closing of the Fair." "Even the clergy have been divided. Bishop Potter has given the great weight of his name and influence to those who would utterly destroy the day of rest, and are clamorously demanding the Sunday opening of the Fair as a long step in the direction of fulfilling their purpose."

One very noticeable thing in this connection is that fealty to Sunday is made the test of Christianity: an institution without a shadow of divine authority, a day known to Holy Writ only as the "first day of the week," a day which neither our Lord nor his apostles observed and to which the early Church was a stranger until apostasy had seriously perverted the gospel of Christ, a day brought into the Church by unconverted heathen tenacious for their ancient customs and jealous for the honor of the sun god, has now become the symbol of all true religion! To honor it is to be a Christian!! to disregard it is to be an apostate from the faith, or at best, a Christian only "so-called"!!! Surely this is turning things upside down.

C. P. B.
