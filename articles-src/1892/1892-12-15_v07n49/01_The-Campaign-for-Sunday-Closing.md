# The Campaign for Sunday Closing.

THE campaign now in progress over the question of Sunday and the World's Fair is in fact simply a continuation of the same unconstitutional steps already taken by Congress.

Instead of insisting without any qualification that the question of opening or closing the Fair on Sunday is entirely beyond its jurisdiction; instead of condemning the unconstitutional action of Congress, instead of denouncing the unconstitutional repeal of the "Sunday provision" adopted at Chicago, or as to put the whole question back where it was before Congress touched it, and keep it there; the demand is made that what that body legislated to open the Fair for the same reasons precisely that it legislated to close the Fair.

Congress was required to close the Fair on Sunday because Sunday is the "Christian Sabbath;" because it would promote the "proper" observance of that day as such; because of its benefits to religion in general; and because "this is a Christian Nation." And now Congress is required to open the Fair on Sunday, because Sunday is the "Christian Sabbath;" because it will as well catch an ample of proper Sabbath observance as nothing else could; because it will be a "powerful promotion of religion;" and because "this is a Christian Nation."

The City Council of Chicago, as officially representing that city, sends up the memorial and petition to Congress "that the gates of the World's Columbian Exposition be closed on Sunday," and says that all machinery be stopped "to the end that quiet may prevail which is in keeping with the Sabbath" and "that suitable accommodations be provided within the Exposition grounds for holding religious services on the Sabbath day, to the end that all the denominations may have worship conducted according to their several customs without obstruction or hindrance."

"In support of the foregoing petition" the council cites "considerations," among which the following are prominent:---

> We recognize and rejoice in the fact that the United States is a Christian Nation. We believe that the United States, as a Christian country, should open the gates on Sunday as a recognition of the fact that in no branch of Christian enterprise or thought has there been more genuine energy during that four hundred years than in the Christian Church.

> Another great reason why the Exposition should be open Sunday is to be found in the opportunity that would thus be provided for religious service on a grand scale on that day within the Exhibit buildings. The multitudes could worship together according to the dictates of their own consciences and in the mode of their own preference.

> It would not be a good thing to serve the sanctity of Sunday to keep the park closed and have it dedicated to the things of use and beauty! . . . Should not the people of this Christian land be to their homes more pleasure and finding enrichment in these displays of Christian enterprise than merely finding what sort of exclusive service they might have attend?

> Finally, would it not be a grand object lesson to so people of all phases of religious belief not already within the main grounds and other walks of the same roof? Such a thing would be without precedent.

This petition and reasons given by President Higginbotham of the Fair Directory, for the opening of the Fair on Sunday are substantially the same as those given by the City Council of Chicago.

It is so, likewise, with the petition and reasons of the Sunday opening associations of which the Chicago *Herald* is the leader.

So that the aim and object and the sum of the whole matter is well expressed by the New York *Tribune*, December 5, in reporting the letter of Cardinal Gibbons in favor of Sunday opening. It says:---

> The preparations for a series of religious services at the park become more and more elaborate. With the leading religious and moral teachers of Europe and America to conduct services every Sunday, with sacred music produced by charmed voices, perhaps thousands of trained singers, Sunday at the World's Fair will be one of the grandest triumphs of the Sabbath known to this generation.

Another significant phase of the contest is, that while Archbishop Ireland, Cardinal Gibbons and other church dignitaries, favor Sunday closing of the Fair, most of the bishops of the Protestant Episcopal Church, and ministers of other professed Protestant churches demand Sunday closing, Bishop Potter, of the Protestant Episcopal Church and other prominent ministers of that, and other so-called Protestant churches, demand Sunday opening. But whether the demand be for Sunday closing or for Sunday opening of the Fair, it is made by all them in the interests of Sunday, to promote its observance and the more to exalt it as the great "Christian" institution.

THEREFORE the conclusion of the whole matter is, that instead of there being a movement to have Congress abandon the usurpation which it has practiced upon the Exposition, the effort is now simply to repeal its unconstitutional legislation, and take the same position where it belongs; this is a movement to have Congress continue in its usurpation, multiply its manipulation of religion, and confirm itself in the unconstitutional position which it has taken. Instead of Congress being asked to have no power, having anything at all to do in any way with the question as to whether Sunday shall be observed at all, or at all; this is only an effort to have Congress decide what will best and most powerfully promote the observance of that day which Congress has already unconstitutionally and irreversibly decided is "the Christian Sabbath." This movement to repeal the legislation which it demands is just as much in the interests of the church power, and is just as much to please the church power, as was the original legislation of Congress on the subject. And the effect which it will have, the only effect which it can have, is only the more fully to confirm in the hands of the church power, the governmental authority of which, that same power has already robbed the people.

BECAUSE of all these facts THE AMERICAN SENTINEL has seen fit to put in this Sunday campaign. Our position is just what it always has been. We do not, and we never did, care whether or not the World's Fair be open or shut on any day, or on every day. There have been, more than can be told, difficulties enough without the church's interfering to tell the government what days should or should not be holidays; and whether the Government should thus be surrendered into the hands of the church power. Against this we have always protested; and we shall with equal vigor both before and since it was done. Our demand is, that all Sunday legislation of all kinds everywhere be unconditionally repealed. For there is no possibility of this ever being done away otherwise. That we know; consequently our position is one of justice, unconstitutionality, and everlasting protest against all Sunday legislation. All this Sunday legislation is being done, and against all that ever shall be done, whether it be to open the Fair, or to close the Fair, or any thing else under it.
