THE National Reform Association is without an organ, and so has appointed a committee to confer with Rev. W. F. Crafts and Dr. T. P. Stevenson to arrange, if possible, to combine the Christian Statesman and the Christian State, making one paper to be the official and responsible organ of the Association.

It was stated in a meeting of the Executive Committee of the Association, held in Philadelphia on the 7th inst., that if this result, namely, the uniting of these two papers, could be accomplished in a year, it would be a year well spent. The committee has good reason to apprehend some difficulty in dealing with Mr. Crafts, for he has shown a disposition to take an independent course. Indeed, as was stated in committee, he is not even a member of the National Reform Association, and it would be a little incongruous for him to have entire control of the organ of the Association. As a matter of fact, it was plainly said by a member of the Executive Committee that the Christian Statesman under its present management does not correctly represent the Association. Indeed it represents only Mr. Crafts and his Reform Bureau. It is not at all likely that the crafty man will be caught with any National Reform chaff. Mr. Crafts was shrewd enough to capture an old and well-established paper instead of starting a new one, and he is not likely to relinquish his vantage ground. The committee appointed to effect the consolidation of the two papers evidently has a difficult task to perform.
