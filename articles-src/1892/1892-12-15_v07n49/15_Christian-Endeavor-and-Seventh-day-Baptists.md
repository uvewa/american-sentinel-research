THE officers of the Christian Endeavor Society have given notice that they decline to represent the Seventh-day Baptists, because they are "at variance on a vital point with the other churches."

This is not a small responsibility which the officers of the society are taking. They virtually say to the tens of thousands of young people under their religious tutelage, throughout the country,—These Seventh-day Baptists, and all who understand that the "seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord" are heretics and ought to be excommunicated. Be ye separate from them.

Henceforth, it seems, the seventh-day keeper is to be to the Christian Endeavor as a heathen man and a publican.
