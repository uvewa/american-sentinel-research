EDITOR AMERICAN SENTINEL: Your review of my article under the title of "The Only Proper Sunday Law," is read with much interest. Allow me to change one word in the article you criticise; the word "conscientiously." The State should have nothing to do directly with consciences. Notice the word "directly." The whole authority of government is based at last on the consciences and moral convictions of the majority of the people. But the State can not control consciences. The extract will read:—

Those who truly and really observe any other day as a Sabbath should be exempted from the Sunday law, provided they do their work in such a way and at such a place as not to interfere with the Sabbath quiet of the first day of the week.

Sunday laws are religious as other laws are and non-religious like other laws. All laws are, and should be, founded on the moral convictions of the people, and these moral convictions are in turn based on their religious convictions. Laws opposed to these convictions become dead letters. So, like the laws against bigamy, perjury, stealing, incest, murder, you may call the Sunday laws religious if you choose. The moral convictions of the people, of the vast majority, make a difference between the first day and the other days of the week. But the Government does not forbid bigamy, perjury, stealing, etc., because they are morally or religiously wrong, but because they are injurious to the community. So the Government does not forbid Sunday work because Sabbath-breaking is a sin, but because Sunday work injures the people, intellectually, morally, and physically.

The course of THE SENTINEL tends to deprive your people of their Saturday Sabbath, as well as the rest of us our Sunday Sabbath. Would it not be better for THE SENTINEL to try to amend our Sunday laws, rather than to labor, indirectly but effectively, for the total abolition of our weekly rest day?

J. B. CONVERSE,
Editor Christian Patriot.
Morristown, Tenn.

The foregoing is published at the request of the editor of the Christian Patriot. It will be noticed that the writer desires to change the word "conscientiously" or have it expunged from his article published in THE SENTINEL of November 24, on the ground that "the State should have nothing to do directly with conscience," and yet a little farther on he makes the plain statement that—

All laws are, and should be, founded on the moral convictions of the people, and these moral convictions are in turn based on their religious convictions.

The gentleman has surely knocked the props from under his own "argument," for he first asserts that the Government should have nothing to do with the conscience, and at once follows it up with a claim that all laws should be based upon the religious convictions of the people. Now if religion and religious convictions are not matters pertaining entirely to the conscience, it might be well for the Christian Patriot to give us some light on the subject. Again we notice that "the whole authority of government is based at last on the consciences and moral convictions of the majority of the people; but the State can not control conscience." Whatever the writer of the foregoing may think or believe, it remains a sad but undisputable fact that whenever the "moral," i.e., "religious convictions" of the majority have shaped legislation, the State has controlled or sought to control the consciences of the minority.

The Christian Patriot sagely remarks:—

Those who truly and really observe any other day as a Sabbath, should be exempted from the Sunday law, provided they do their work in such a way and at such places as not to interfere with the Sabbath quiet of the first day of the week.

Permit us to ask the writer of this profound article that even if the principle of Sunday legislation were right, would the minority have no rights? Would it not be equally just for the law to provide that all labor done on the seventh day by Sunday keepers be performed in such a manner and at such places as not to interfere with the religious devotions of those who observe another day?

We are also told that Sunday laws are "non-religious" but that they should be based on the "religious convictions" of the people. How the editor of the Christian Patriot reconciles such contradictory statements, is beyond the comprehension of ordinary minds.

"The Government does not forbid Sunday work because Sabbath-breaking is a sin." Why then is an open Bible with the fourth commandment, marked, presented to the clerk of the Senate as a reason for closing the World's Fair on Sunday? Why did the Supreme Court of the State of Tennessee decide that "Christianity is part of the common law" of that State? The editor of the Christian Patriot surely has not read of the frantic efforts of the American Sabbath Union to have Sunday laws enacted because we are a "Christian Nation;" has not read of the threats of boycott against Sunday law violators made by ministers' meetings; has not read of threats to prevent the reelection of certain congressmen, should they fail to vote on the side of Sunday laws.

"The course of THE SENTINEL," does not "tend to deprive" any one of their "Saturday Sabbath" for God gave that to man and no one can deprive him of it. THE SENTINEL is opposed to religious legislation as unconstitutional, un-American and unchristian. It stands for a principle and not for the easiest method of getting around a difficult question.
