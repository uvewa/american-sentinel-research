# NATIONAL RELIGIOUS LIBERTY.

A MASS-MEETING was held in Bath, Maine, in the interests of Sunday opening of the World's Fair, and Sunday freedom generally.

The City Council of Chicago has passed a memorial asking Congress to repeal all legislation in reference to Sunday, and the resolution to refer the matter to the Managers of the World's Fair.

A Labor Cadets society has been solicited from a town, Texas, for the protection and help of their fellow-Israelites, who are in a very bad condition. To be forwarded to the "proper officers" for examination. Authorized Catholics throughout the Union.

REV. W. W. McFARREN, of Biddeford, Maine, member of the special committee appointed to examine certain Maine denomination in reference to a formula for a plan to ensure better Sunday legislation, "a resolve to and to continue to cherish and set at Rest the State, copies of a petition to be forwarded to the Senate at Washington." That Sunday excursions by railroads and steamboats should be taxed.

## Sunday Smashed to Pieces.

A "Rest Day League" organized lately in Danville, Ill., by Elder E. B. Graham and D. W. Wilcox, of the Illinois Supreme Court. Of this organization the *Illinois State Register* says:

"It is a league to gather young people's organizations, and use them for temperance and for defeating this aim; and it is planning for complete closing of shops on and for Sabbath by parliament law like that of everybody indeed; and is much aided in its purpose by letters and lectures from prominent religious people in this county."

A TELEGRAM has been received that no cases were tried before any court for the last quarter. Permits for the refunding of monies secured for persecuted men against the Treaty or Indictments found against the same. The attorney in the circuit firmly holds that the statute of the District of Columbia is unconstitutional; however, that the matter of constitutionality, has been referred the jury at the last court.

According to this holding, church property in the District of Columbia stands upon the same basis as all other private or corporate property.

The officers of the Christian Endeavor societies of the country are taking steps. They virtually give notice that they desire to represent the several Baptist, because he was also of two natures as a real point with the other churches, against the closing of the Fair on Sunday. The officers of the society are taking. They virtually suggest that all young people may study the Fair, their religious teachings, throughout the country, and add their influence to the common demand and state that "the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord." Be separate from persons too.

We are told that every second day-keeper is to be the Christian Endeavor as a heathen institution.

costs, which amounted to $7.16. The gentleman refuses to pay the fine, and he is now threatened with imprisonment. We shall await with some interest the developments in the case.

The committee on privileges and elections of the Legislature of South Carolina is considering bringing the individual religious opinions into the legislative proceedings of the State, as witness the following taken from a press report from Columbia, S. C., December 5:---

Representative Hines inadvertently admitted that the committee on privileges and elections had formulated a report on Sunday. Representative Hines introduced a concurrent resolution for a stigma on the House and State, and that such legislation should be made to answer all the requirements of the situation. The resolution gives notice that they were astonished at the house of issues.

This last clause is very true; but at the bottom however the responsibility for the legislature on Enforced of religious observance will be found to be very heavy!

*The Mail and Express* says:---

By this is meant, that, because of the course of the Board of Managers of the Exposition in asking Congress to repeal its Sunday closing provision, the protection of divine Providence is being withdrawn from Chicago, and the city given up to lawlessness and violence. That is a sample of what will be said more and more by those religious whose voices the *Mail and Express* voice. Evil men and schemers will multiply in numbers, and violence and lawlessness increase, pestilence and physical disorder will come upon the earth. We have the words of the apostles and of Barnabas to this. The *Mail and Express* and all its fellows are very well with their explanation.

For there are a number of assemblies coming, some meeting on the ground, time setting, break out next summer while millions of people from all lands shall be gathered here on their way to and fro, and the wheels of travel making strenuous efforts that the catastrophe in the turmoil, it is easy to see where the *Mail and Express* would fix the cause of it all. Although this particular catastrophe may not happen, things similar will, and that fantastic explanation will be given for them and considered sufficient. Then comes the cry---"Was it the insult?"---"come board with him!"

A DISPATCH from Elizabethton, N. J., says that on Sunday, December 4, "Wilson H. Steffler undertook to have an auction sale of buildings at North Elizabeth, and in order to draw a crowd he hired a cornetist who set to playing tunes in front of the grounds. Chief of police Toney, by order of Mayor Rankin, stopped the cornetist. The gathering of about three hundred, and arrested the agent and he is to be arrested. Steffler, together with another who was a Patterson hotel, was pulled in, and also the band of fifteen musicians.

The prisoners were marched to police headquarters. Lawyer Fester R. Voorhees was sent for to defend them, and Justice Halfield held a short session of court, at which religious opinions of some were arraigned. They pleaded guilty to violating the Sunday ordinance, and were fined $5.68 each, or about sixty cents for each musician. If it was disorderly to sell houses on Sunday: why was it not disorderly to arrest them? Did not the transact the business of the court? If Sunday was desecrated by the sale of houses, but not by the holding of the court, was it a civil court or an ecclesiastical council? If an ecclesiastical council, how did it come within its province to fine and imprison for selling houses?

Who was not the boptime tangle, and where it began.
