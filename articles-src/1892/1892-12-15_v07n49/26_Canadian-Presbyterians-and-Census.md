It is said that in Canada 230,000 more persons reported themselves to the census takers as Presbyterians than can be found on the roll of Presbyterian Church books. If the Canadian Presbyterians would only adopt American Sabbath Union methods of counting, this thing would be reversed, and the church would soon be claiming a membership of at least 230,000 more than the census takers, or even the tax collectors or death could find.
