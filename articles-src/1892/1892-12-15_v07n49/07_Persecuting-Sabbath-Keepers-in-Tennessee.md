The fining and imprisoning of Seventh-day Adventists in Henry Co., Tenn., evinces an amount of injustice and bigotry which would seem impossible, if the facts were not on record. The men who are being persecuted are acknowledged to be estimable, and law-abiding citizens, against whom no charge can be brought, except that they pursue their usual vocation as farmers on Sunday. In the case of W. S. Lowry, tried at Paris, Tenn., May 27, 1892, the important testimony which procured the verdict, "guilty," was given by a Sabbath-keeper who was compelled to testify against his brother Sabbath-keeper. Good must come of such injustice and unchristian transactions by calling public attention to the intolerant laws which yet exist amid the ignorance and bigotry of Tennessee. These transactions are shameful and cruel. They show how the existing Sunday laws can be made to answer partisan ends and the behest of the bigots who institute proceedings in such cases. While the whole land teems with Sunday work, Sunday pleasure-seeking and Sunday revelry, Christian men are fined and imprisoned, really because they keep the Sabbath and exercise their God-given right of doing ordinary work, like Christian men, on Sunday. Is it true that thus late in the world's history religious toleration and freedom can be gained only through prison bars. Has the genuine gospel of Christ ever been preached in Tennessee?
