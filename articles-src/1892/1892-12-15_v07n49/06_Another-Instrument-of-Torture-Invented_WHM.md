A WRITER in a late number of the Christian Statesman expresses himself thus:—

It is a humiliating fact that tobacco, confectionery, meat and bread shops, the ice cream and peanut stands of Philadelphia are generally open on the Lord's day and doing a flourishing business. Can this be helped? Can the nuisance be abated? Yes; but not by speeches, conventions and resolutions alone. Of these the enemy are not fearful. I earnestly suggest the combining of Sabbath associations and Law and Order societies.

It has long been known that this combination was intended. The Law and Order societies have in fact been more largely used for this purpose than any other. It is logical, and historical as well, that it should be so. The Inquisition followed the same course precisely. This writer in the Christian Statesman is suggesting no new or untried thing. Such a combination has succeeded before,—succeeded in persecuting to the death. It will succeed again, succeed in persecuting—no one can yet tell to what limit. This combination of law and religion which in past centuries invented and used the rack, the thumbscrew, and the fagot, is itself no new thing. But an original instrument for the expression and exercise of its authority has been invented and put into active operation at Winchester, Md. A merchant of that place has recently read his Bible without those scales upon his eyes which make the fourth commandment read, "The first day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God." Having seen that the commandment is, and always has been, "The seventh day is the Sabbath," like a sane, reasonable, and consistent man he proceeded to keep that day. But the latter-day inquisition, with a subtlety of device worthy of the added intellectuality of the age, and a skillful use of the modern improvements, has invented a new refinement of persecution. This eminently consistent and sound-minded merchant, when he understood that the word of God was unmistakably "the seventh day is the Sabbath," immediately closed his store on the Sabbath. Not to have done so would have argued him illogical, inconsistent, and wanting in those attributes of uprightness, reliability, and sanity, which prompt a man to square his practice with his convictions and principles. Had he done otherwise, he might properly have been considered an unsafe man with whom to do business.

But the inquisition of the last decade of the nineteenth century reverses all this, and adjudges this man fanatical, insane, and unsafe as a business man because of this evidence of his righteousness and probity, and so informs the commercial agencies which publish to the world the voting of a man's business credit and honor. As a result of this publication his creditors in the regular line of business threaten him with financial ruin at a forced sale. At the same time they propose themselves that they will institute no proceedings if he will but yield principle to policy, and open his store on the Sabbath. They have no doubt of his business capacity. He is sufficiently sane to handle their goods on credit to the amount of thousands of dollars if he will but deny the law of his God. More than that, if he desires to refuse the continued credit offered him by those from whom he purchases goods and pay them immediately, and in full, there are those intimately acquainted with him, and conversant with all his affairs, who stand ready to loan him, at any moment, all the money he desires, if only he will deny the law of his God, and open his place of business on the Sabbath.

Methods of persecution are open to this generation which Torquemada never dreamed of in his philosophy of torture. They will be used. It would be well for business men among Sabbath-keepers, Israelites, Seventh-day Baptists, Seventh-day Adventists, to take note of this new invention now being put to such practical and effective use at Winchester, Md.
