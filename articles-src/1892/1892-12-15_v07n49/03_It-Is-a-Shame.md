# IT IS A SHAME,

a crying shame, that such insane fanaticism, and such UNCHRISTIAN intolerance, should flourish at this late day! How doubly shameful it is that our sense of liberty and love of liberty are so thoroughly overcome by constitutionally hypocritical religiousness, that there should be such liberty-destroying inhumanity. To me the affair in Tennessee, beside being a spectacle of just and upright men suffering as criminals, presents a deeper meaning. An old, silver-haired father, who had harmed no one, who had but complied or, rather, who had striven to follow the Golden Rule as a line of conduct for life, being driven in a chain-gang with blacksmith, and this animus loyalty to what he considered to be right. Think of it is the Golden handed infamy and, remember that this crime against him, this crime against human rights, was perpetrated in this name of law, and instigated by persons professing to be religious Christians.

The persecution of Jesus by the Pharisees was tender-heartedness compared to the persecution of the Seventh-day Adventists by those whom maliciousness itself was to-day. And yet these same shrill shouted at "eighty-odd thousands" Christians! Let us see how their actions square by the Golden rule, which one of the greatest master of that basic principle of moral government.

Let us suppose that in Louisiana, for example, by the Christian, intelligently and on certain days made holy by their whole religion and teaching of Sabbath. "Other than acts of real necessity." Let us suppose that Protestants lived to keep these days, first, because they denied the right of the church to enslave men or make holy days, and secondly, because the fierce struggle for bread made it imperative that they work. Now let us further suppose that a runup of the most unpopular citizens openly disregarded this unjust statute, and if the violators were dragged to prison, doomed to lie in jail, and finally put to work in New Orleans streets in company with the lowest class of criminals. Would not there be a mighty outrage? But the principle that has been trampled in the land at such an un-American and unconstitutional manner, so clearly trampled on the right of conscience and disregarded the spirit of free government!

"Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them." Jesus taught this as a cardinal truth, the sum of laws and precepts.
