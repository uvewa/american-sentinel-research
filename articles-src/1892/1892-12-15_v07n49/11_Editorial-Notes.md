# Editorial Notes.

We have no apology to offer for making the masterly article from the Arena for December, prominent throughout in this issue of THE SENTINEL. The *Arena* is a prince among magazines, and this article although not as a popular subject is second to none in power or dignity, and can not fail to please every alert, each to reader of THE SENTINEL. Take it, read it, pass it. Read it and ask your friends and neighbors to read it. Anticipating a demand for this article we have had a limited number of extra copies printed and will furnish them at one dollar per hundred. Those desiring extra copies must order at once.

The article in this paper which should be widely in the way the which attention on our first page. This whole question of congressional tampering with a religious affair. Its pertinence is too little understood. The articles referred to presents a new phase of it, and not exceedingly likely to be read. Do not fail, therefore, to read the articles of this paper.

The National Reform Association is again on its mission, and so has appointed a committee to confer with Rev. W. F. Crafts and Dr. T. P. Stevenson of the *Christian Statesman*, and to combine if possible, to combine the *Christian Statesman* and the *Christian State*, making one paper to be the official and recognized organ of the Association.

It was at a meeting of the Executive Committee of the Association, held in Philadelphia on the 7th, that it was decided to combine the papers. This will doubtless be done, and the uniting of those two papers, could be accomplished in a year, it would be a great well spent. The committee has good reason to apprehend some difficulty in dealing with Mr. Crafts, for he has shown a disposition to take to himself everything within his reach, and subjoined in committees, he is not even a member of the National Reform Association, and the National Reform Association, and it would be a little incongruous for him to have entire control of the organ of the Association. As a matter of fact, it was plainly said at the meeting by a member of its Executive Committee that the *Christian Statesman* under its present management does not correctly represent the Association. Indeed it represents only Mr. Crafts and his Reform Bureau. It is not at all likely that the crafty man will be caught with any National Reform bait. Mr. Crafts was

shrewd enough to capture an old and well-established paper instead of starting a new one, and he is not likely to relinquish his vantage-ground. The union attempted to offer the consolidation of the two papers evidently has a difficult task to perform.

The National Reform Association held its regular annual meeting in Philadelphia on December 8-9, and at the same time there was held under its auspices a "National Conference on the Christian Principles of Civil Government." The meeting was nicely situated, and there was nothing new offered. The National Reform Association is away behind the movement of which it is a part. The American Sabbath Union, so-called, in the national Reform Association, and is doing vastly more so-called reform work than the National Reform Association has done or ever can do until it gets out of its rut. It is impossible to give any news concerning the changes of the movement that is threshing over the same old straw that it has been pounding for twenty-eight years, but we shall in future contributions notice some points presented at the Philadelphia meeting.

This whole article from the *Arena*, for December, printed elsewhere in this paper, is a special article and timely one. The attention of the people must be called to the nation being persecuted upon righteous men in this country in the name of good morals and good government, and in no way could this be more forcefully done than by setting forth the facts editorially, as Mr. B. O. Flower has done in his deservedly popular and widely-read magazine.

HITRPRESS the press of the land has been strongly silent upon the subject. Monroe would speedily plead that the facts so vigorously set forth in the *Arena* and has been brought before to their attention in such a way so as to challenge their attention, and arouse the indignation of this can any no longer. Every reading man in the United States must now decide for or against liberty of conscience. Every newspaper or of any influence must decide whether it will lift its voice against the iniquity which in Tennessee is outraging liberty, or whatever side of this question it will assent to religious persecution on American soil. Mr. Flower's article is a bugle call to the press of the country; how will the editors of the United States respond?

THERE is hope that the secular press will for the most part be found on the right side in this contest, but, alas! the religious press is, with very few exceptions, strongly committed to the support of the open and intolerance. It is true that comparatively few of the religious papers have openly justified the Tennessee perse-

cution, but the attitude of the denominations for which they speak is such that their position is not a matter of doubt. The great religious bodies of the land have formed a confederacy for the purpose of creating out all opposition to their ambitious schemes for the acquisition of power, and they have found their most determined foes to be the very people who are being persecuted under the color and form of civil law in Tennessee. The so-called Protestant churches and their organs will not, therefore, cry out against the wickedness now aid and forcefully assailed by the *Arena*.

CARDINAL Gibbons has written a letter to E. I. Thompson, of Chicago, declaring himself in favor of keeping of the Fair open on Sunday. The Cardinal

"The Sunday closing of the exhibits would be to unfortunately deprive that thousands of our countrymen, who would be tempted to visit the fair, of its advantage. In that case I would favor day in dissipation. In that case I would favor open, with the proviso that all machinery should stop." The observance of Sunday is very desirable, and that will not be inopportunely proper should come. Let it if it do not any the ordinary Sabbath devotions of the day; on the contrary, those who will visit the Fair on those days will be inclined to turn their minds and hearts to Him who inspired men to produce such works of art.

WHEN Cardinal Gibbons has spoken. The P. E. P. Cards has two or three bishops also declaring in favor of a national Sunday law, the law field of attention of the American Sabbath Union promptly added the 100,000 Roman Catholics of the United States to the number of petitioners for a national Sunday law. Will the American Sabbath Union likewise add them on the strength of the Cardinal's letter in favor of Mr. Thompson and the Cardinals for in favor of an open Sunday Fair? And if not, why not?

It is said that in Canada 7,310,000 more people are reported themselves to have been taken as Presbyterians than can be found on the rolls of Presbyterian churches. But if the Canadian Presbyterians would only adopt American Sabbath Union methods of counting, this thing would be remedied, and the church would soon be claiming a membership of at least 100,000 more than the census takers, or even the tax collectors or death fond find.
