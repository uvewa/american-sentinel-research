# The War Is On

The war is on. The question as to whether the allied forces of Romanism, paid by the money of all the Government, pulled at the terrific cost it was, shall by the forces of American freedom, which has held lead only to a repetition of the Dark Ages, when Rome controlled both Church and republic, and is destined to be one of the leading issues of the immediate future. The American people are awakened to the fact that the decision of Judge Brewer and the action of Congress in passing the Sunday Civil feature of the law provide for Sunday closing of the World's Fair, are entirely out of harmony with the foundation principles of this Government. Protests are being selected at every point and from every quarter against the move.

Thomas Brewer, having once rendered, these religio-political guardians of the liberties of the people, the question was "settled," and on this illusion was grounded a Sunday provision to close the World's Fair appropriation was perfectly constitutional, and becomes of the particularly complicity of the religious element back of this movement; both senators and representatives voted for the appropriation against their expressed convictions to the contrary, simply as a measure of "wise statesmanship," and because "religion enters into all national politics."

The *Mail and Express*, the great religious daily of New York, the organ of Col. Shepard, is very much stirred over the protests that are raised, to this conversion to "disgrace the Nation and outrage the religious sentiments of millions of our best citizens, by publicly desecrating the Sabbath and defying and defeating the law of the land, and calls all lovers of the 'American Sabbath' to 'stand to the end by every possible means, this attempt to, deny the sentiment of a Christian nation and the law of the divine Bible." It further gives expression in a late editorial of Col. Shepard:

> It is full time that those advocates of irreligion, who would deny the authority of the Bible and ignore its precepts over the Nation, and deny that there is not for all that the Supreme Court has declared that this is a Christian nation, the fundamental law of the land, all stand up and be counted.

> "Should be taught" and "taught when young;" these are the words and they well intimate his method of this teaching through the Sunday-law crusade.

Those who oppose the opening of the Columbian World's Fair on Sunday will find strength and in Cheapness they have being making mistake.

The Rev. Dr. McAllister of the great and real interest of the Church, to claim him for the Sunday Sabbath, and are only too few years have any protestant. Protestant take the lead in the defense of the religion since the religious movement is made to the Citizens; and inasmuch as the religion and interest, and since the majority, they must abide the consequences unquestioned.

And now that the vote of this vast National Committee, by which he refers to the Constitution, and his real purposes made; "they must expect that he will seek to carry out," and "the legislation to gain, and legislation to fail in with the majority."

> Reader, when you are familiar to THE SENTINEL, readers as a readers to the question, that the Church of years ago expressed himself on this subject.

And the author of these views, in the midst of this war, wrote also as follows: that is a real war: he was not serving; but we look with the anti-slavery question, after they presented their views on the subject, let alone being disturbed about their position.

And the author of the *Mail and Express*, in a conversation with the writer in the days of the decision of Judge Brainard in the King case, did, with a great deal of straight-forwardness, express the opinion that when people persistently violated the law, and laws were made against them, they must suffer the consequences.

President Snoddy also expressed at that time, as the close of his editorial above quoted, and we pass it along as the real sentiment of the National Reform party: "these suggestions in fact that the Board of Review, as to their views and principles, the voice of carrying the proposition even by the people should take."

FRIDAY evening, September 23, there was held in Calvary Baptist Church, this city, a mass-meeting "to give expression to the approval with which Christian people . . . . . have received the action of Congress in regard to the Sunday closing of the World's Fair." It was presided over by Col. Elliot F. Shepard, the president of the American Sabbath Union.

That meeting was called a "mass-meeting;" but it was such only in the sense that the public was invited and that it was not a deliberative body. The masses were not present. No vote was taken. It was merely a packed and drilled and inspired personitated, and inspid speeches were made to a small and listless audience. Not the slightest sign of either approval or dissent greeted Colonel Shepard's review of the part the American Sabbath Union had acted in "compelling Congress, as the *Examiner* (Baptist) puts it, "to make the appropriation of $2,500,000 conditional on the observance of the Christian Sabbath."

But other speakers fared a little better; old Colonel Shepard, if set at the proper places he himself applauded, and his example was of course followed by others, but not with that abandon of enthusiasm common to mass-meetings. Indeed there was said that was worthy of applause even from the standpoint of the Sunday-law advocates. (What "arguments" advanced, the *Examiner* comments.) That's value to the present instance was largely due to the personality of the men who uttered them.

This from a friend of the meeting and of the movement in the interests of which the meeting was held, and not is expected as a compliment.
