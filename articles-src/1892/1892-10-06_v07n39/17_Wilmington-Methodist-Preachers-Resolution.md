**THE** Methodist preachers of Wilmington, Del., recently passed the following resolutions:

"Resolved, That we, as ministers of the gospel, and as citizens, will use our influence in every legitimate way to secure . . . the proper enforcement of laws made by representatives of the people for the protection of the Sabbath, and that we call on all who reverence the law of God and who desire the highest welfare of the community in which we live to join us in this work.

"Resolved, That we respectfully and firmly call upon the civil authorities to enforce the existing laws concerning the observance of the Sabbath."
