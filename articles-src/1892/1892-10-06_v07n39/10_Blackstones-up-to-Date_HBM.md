# Blackstones up to Date

In his chapter on Corporations, Blackstone says in reference to ecclesiastical corporations:

These courts act only per unique nation, and possess no coercive jurisdiction, yet they can censure or excommunicate a consideration, which, carried to the full will affect a man's reputation and his capacity at law extent.

Hence, of course, the learned author of a discussing a condition where there is a union of Church and State, a condition which under the influence of such men as Lachborne—had it continued without giving a change. The language of Blackstone ought to be modified, and made applicable to our own time and country. "For [ecclesiastical courts] act only per unique, and yet only per solder capable of criminal and their mechanism can only make the civil law of the land; for that if legislation, carried to its full extent, would alone account for the fact that the ecclesiastical courts interfering in any spiritual matters whatsoever."

H. B. MAURES.
