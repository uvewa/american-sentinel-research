The war is on. The question as to whether this land of freedom, purchased at the terrible cost it was, shall by its legislative acts commit it to a policy that must lead only to a repetition of the Dark Ages, is coming to the front with wonderful rapidity, and is destined to be one of the leading issues of the immediate future. The American people are awakening to the fact that the decision of Judge Brewer and the action of Congress in passing the Sundry Civil Service bill with the proviso for Sunday closing of the World's Fair, are entirely out of harmony with the foundation principles of this Government. Protests are being entered at every point and from every quarter against these things.

When the Brewer decision was rendered, these religio-political guardians of Sunday sacredness declared that the question was "settled," and on this decision urged that a Sunday-closing proviso to the World's Fair appropriation was perfectly constitutional, and because of the persistency of the religious element back of this movement, both senators and representatives voted for the appropriation against their expressed convictions to the contrary, simply as a matter of "wise statesmanship," and because their "action would be sustained by their constituency."

The *Mail and Express*, the great champion of enforced Sunday observance, is very much stirred over the protests that are raised to this movement to "disgrace the Nation and outrage the religious sentiment of millions of our best citizens, by publicly desecrating the Sabbath and defying and defeating the law of the land," and calls on all lovers of the "American Sabbath" to "resist to the end by every possible means, this attempt to defy the sentiment of a Christian nation and the law of the divine Ruler." It further gives expression in a late editorial as follows:—

It is full time that these advocates of irreligion, who would erect upon the ruins of the American Sabbath the carnival feast day of continental Europe, should be taught, once for all, that the Sabbath is an American institution resting upon the fundamental law of the land, as well as a religious institution resting upon the authority and command of its divine Founder.

"Should be taught" and "taught once for all"!! How? A "Rev." gentleman intimates his method of thus teaching what the Sunday Sabbath is, as follows:—

Those who oppose the opening of the Columbian Exposition on Sunday are no better than anarchists, and in Chicago they hang anarchists.

The Rev. Dr. McAllister had this to say five years ago:—

Those who oppose this work now will discover, when the religious amendment is made to the Constitution, that if they do not see fit to fall in with the majority, they must abide the consequences or seek some more congenial clime.

And now that the amendment to the Constitution, to which he refers, is to all practical intents and purposes made, we may expect that he will seek to carry out his threat against those who "do not see fit to fall in with the majority."

Rev. M. A. Gault, whose name is familiar to THE SENTINEL readers as a zealous advocate of religious legislation, a few years ago expressed himself on this subject as follows:—

Don't think we are advocating war; but if we are not faithful in the use of these other means, as it was with the anti-slavery question, after they had agitated and petitioned, and used the ballot, they drew the sword; so shall we as a last resort be compelled to use the sword and the bullet.

And the editor of the *Mail and Express* in a conversation with the writer in the city of Des Moines, Iowa, last winter, upheld the decision of Judge Hammond in the King case, with the significant remark that when people persistently violated the law of the land as Mr. King had, they must suffer the consequences.

But the editor of the *Mail and Express* at the close of his editorial above quoted, assumes a puritanical aspect, draws down his face to its utmost, and after "decloring" the fact that the Board of Lady Managers of New York, came within one vote of carrying the proposition to open the gates of the Exposition on Sunday, says:—

We deeply regret this obstinate resistance of fully and freely expressed and embodied public opinion.

Yes, really, it is too bad that there is such an "obstinate resistance" to this movement! The writer recalls a similar regret that was expressed some eighteen hundred years ago when there was an attempt on the part of the religious hierarchy to stifle religious investigation and suppress freedom of speech in the early history of Christianity. And when they were not able to carry their point even by threats of imprisonment, the record says that the priests and Sadducees were "grieved that they taught the people and preached through Jesus the resurrection from the dead." They felt very bad, and without doubt deeply regretted the "obstinate resistance" of the apostles; but how long they continued to be simply "grieved" is told a little further on, when it is stated that at about their next preaching service they "laid hands on them and put them in hold." Finding that this did not have the desired effect, they next "beat them," and finally for the purpose of teaching the apostles "once for all" that their "obstinate resistance" would not be tolerated, the record says that as Stephen was preaching, simply the gospel of Jesus Christ, "they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears, and ran upon him with one accord, and cast him out of the city and stoned him" till he was dead. The story is short, but how significant!

With the spirit manifested and the threatenings of those at the head of this movement to enforce the observance of the Sunday as a day of rest, what may we expect, if once they hold the balance of power?—Simply a repetition of the proceedings against the apostles, and nothing short of it. Is there not in this movement that which should stir to the utmost every lover of religious liberty? Surely there is. W. E. CORNELL.
