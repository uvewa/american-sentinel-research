CHICAGO is making an effort to secure the repeal of the act conditioning the national appropriation for the World's Fair on the Sunday closing of the Exhibition. This the Mail and Express calls "Chicago's breach of faith." It is all right for the American Sabbath Union to petition, and intimidate by threats of political boycott, for the purpose of securing Sunday closing, but it is bad faith for anybody to oppose them and to simply exercise the right of petition in behalf of an open Fair! Was there ever a more arrogant assumption?
