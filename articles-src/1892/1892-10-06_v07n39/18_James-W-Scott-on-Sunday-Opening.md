**THE** Chicago correspondent of the New York World relates an interview with reference to the World's Fair with James W. Scott, of Chicago, in which Mr. Scott says, in answer to a question as to whether the World's Fair will really be kept closed on Sunday:

"Well, we're going to try hard to have it opened seven days in the week. You know Congress said it shouldn't; but when that proposition was up a good many congressmen were looking for a renomination. They weren't at all anxious to offend the Church people, and they voted against their convictions merely because they didn't want to lose their chance of getting back. About one hundred of them failed of renomination and a good many of them who didn't won't be elected. The Chicago Herald has been circulating a petition for Sunday opening and already has about one hundred thousand names. This winter we propose to send it to Congress and we are sure that it will be voted for by many who voted to close before.

There is value in such agitation as this just in proportion as it can be used to emphasize principle; but when the principles which should govern the matter are lost sight of the discussion and the petitions are only empty words, and utterly valueless.
