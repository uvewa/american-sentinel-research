In the Christian Statesman of August 13, Rev. J. M. Foster thus sets forth the National Reform idea of the proper relation of Church and State:—

1. According to the Scriptures Church and State are mutually separate and independent divine institutions.

The Church's sphere is the conscience and the heart. She deals with matters of belief. The moral law is both a civil and an ecclesiastical code. In the former sense the State is its keeper; in the latter, the Church. It is the State's duty to suppress open idolatry, as Asa did in Judah; it is the Church's privilege to enforce the worship of the true God within her pale. It belongs to the State to punish blasphemy, to the Church to sanctify God's holy name. It belongs to the State to prohibit all public Sabbath desecration; it is obligatory upon the Church to consecrate the day to God. The State must crush polygamy and banish speedy and easy divorce and prohibit the "social evil." The Church teaches husbands to love their wives—wives to obey their husbands. The State punishes the external act of covetousness; the Church strikes it down in the heart with the sword of the Spirit. The Church and State are mutually separate and independent provinces of Christ's dominion, each subject in its sphere to the mediatorial throne.

2. According to the Scriptures, the State in its sphere exists for the sake of, and in the interests of the Church.

Not to mention the fact that Christ is "head over all things to his Church," it is expressly asserted, "kings shall be thy nursing fathers, and their queens thy nursing mothers;" "the nation and kingdom that will not serve thee shall perish; yea, those nations shall be utterly wasted." "the mountain of the Lord's house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it." The general truth here taught is not far to seek. "Mountains" and "hills" in scripture signify the greater and smaller kingdoms of the earth. "The mountain of the Lord's house" means the Church; and to "be established in the top" of the one and "exalted above" the other indicate that the nations shall be the support and defense of the Church. Kings becoming "nursing fathers" and queens "nursing mothers" refer to the sustaining care which nations shall exercise over the Church, and "serve" signifies the ministry of the nations in providing for her material wants. The essential truth of these prophecies is, the true State will have a wise reference to the Church's interest in all her legislative, executive, and judicial proceedings. The expenses of the Church in carrying on her public aggressive work it meets is whole or in part out of the public treasury. Thus the Church is protected and exalted by the State.

3. According to the Scriptures, the Church and the State will exist in friendly recognition and cooperation.

Because the State is distinct from the Church it does not follow that it is divorced from her. The Christian family is a divine institution. It is independent of the Church, and yet it exists in friendly recognition and co-operation with her. The Church will recognize the good offices of the Christian State, and the true State will formally acknowledge its obligation to serve the Church. They may swear the same covenant bond, in which are embodied the duties which each in its sphere owes to the King of kings. The nation and church of Israel seem to have sworn the same bond at Sinai. The church of the British Isles and the three kingdoms—Scotland, England, and Ireland—sworn the same covenant in 1643, "the solemn league and covenant." Our Nation is under as much obligation to acknowledge the Lord Jesus Christ in her Constitution as the Church is in her creed.

This declaration is not new; it has been made before. But in the past it has failed to attract the attention that it certainly must now attract, for the reason that so many people have all along thought any union of Church and State impossible in this country. Recent developments have dissipated the illusion and the people are awakening to the fact that, whereas, they have fondly supposed that in this Nation "the Church and the State were mutually separate and independent institutions," it has come to be really true, as stated in Mr. Foster's second proposition, that "the State in its sphere exists for the sake of, and in the interests of the Church."

Instead of this now being a Government of the people for the people, it is a Government by the churches for the churches. Leading members of Congress have declared that they dare not resist the demands of religionists who are clamoring for power; and Rev. H. H. George, of the American Sabbath Union, declares, "I have learned that we hold the United States Senate in our hands." He might have said, and now probably would say, that the churches hold the United States Congress in their hands, for the House has shown itself as subservient to their demands as had the Senate when Mr. George said what he did.

The condition of things in this country so far as the relation of Church and State is concerned is substantially the same as described by Reader of the union of Church and State in the fourth century. He says:—

With the commencement of this period the Church entered into an entirely different relation to the State. It did not merely become a whole, recognized as legal, and tolerated by the States—which it had been already from the reign of Gallien down to the Diocletian persecution—but the State itself declared its principles to be those to which everything must be subordinated. Christianity became, by degrees, the dominant State religion, though not entirely in the same sense as paganism had been before. Church and State constituted, henceforth, two wholes, one interpenetrating the other, and standing in a relation of mutual action and reaction.

The "action" was generally that which Mr. Foster says should be in this country, it was the State serving the Church. The "reaction" was upon the Church, and was manifested in a loss of spiritual power and increased worldliness and greater apostacy. Such "reaction" necessarily follows the "action" of spiritual adultery, which any union of the Church with human governments is. C. P. R.
