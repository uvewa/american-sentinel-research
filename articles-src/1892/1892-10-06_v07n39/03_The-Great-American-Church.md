At the Ministerial Union in Syracuse, N. Y., the Rev. Chas. Ferguson said—

That he believed in one organic church, of which the President of the United States should be head, which church should take hold of every phase of American life.

In view of the Supreme Court decision that "this is a Christian Nation"—a most un-American act—the above statement is of interest, as it most clearly indicates the continued growth of sentiment in the religious world, that the Church must dominate the civil power. The churches have secured a national recognition at the hands of the highest authority in the Nation, and that which is called the Christian religion, is made the religion of the Nation.

In harmony with this, Congress has said that Sunday shall henceforth be the Sabbath of the Nation—the great American Sabbath of an American church—and now what more logical conclusion than that this "church should take hold of every phase of American life?" Then in so doing, this most un-American church, will do a most un-American thing in dominating "every phase of American life" through the agency of secret police or Sunday rest leagues, spying out absentees from religious worship, under a law which this most un-American church shall secure, compelling all to attend worship on Sunday. And when this is all brought about by this un-American organic church, and shall by authority of this unconstitutional law, intrude itself into the secrets of the family, the individual, the citizen, dominating their rights—for this is just what it all means—then which will be most to be dreaded, the Papacy with the Pope as its visible head, or this un-American church with "the President of the United States" as the acknowledged "head"? Acknowledged by whom?—By this un-American church, of course.

But what about dissenters?—Nothing more logical than that they will be dealt with according to laws and penalties (for a law is of no value except there be a penalty) secured by this, un-American church and enforced by, not a Spanish Inquisition, but an un-American Inquisition, established upon American soil, in this "land of the free." The people should beware lest they be deceived by such terms as "Americanism" and an "American church," but study to know where lies the true principle of American Government.

Let me say here, that to the true Christian, the true church, another and entirely different work has been given, than that of dominating over the rights of others. The true Christian has always stood in vindication of these rights.—Publius, in Marshall County, Minn., Banner.
