The action of the Democratic Congress in voting to close the World's Fair on Sunday has had the effect of causing the secularists of the country to organize themselves into a voting party. To close a national Exposition against the work-ingmen of the country on the only day they can attend is certainly vicious legislation. The effect is well illustrated by a cartoon in *Puck* representing a clergyman and a saloon keeper clasping hands in front of the gates to the Exposition, which are closed and padlocked, while the pious people go one way toward the church and the world's people go the other way toward the saloon. *Puck* gives the matter its correct name, "An unholy alliance," in which the Church and the rum shop ally themselves to divide the custom of visitors to Chicago. The result will be that while the Church may catch five hundred of those who would otherwise attend the Fair, the saloon will absorb five thousand. In the interests of sobriety the Church should be willing to lose a tithe of its attendance in order that the saloons might be emptied.

What makes the hypocritical action of Congress so much the worse is the fact that probably not one in a dozen of the legislators who voted for the closing of the Fair have sufficient respect for Sunday to observe it themselves, and they are as likely to go with one crowd as with the other. Monday morning will find half of them sitting up in bed and inquiring, "Where was I at?"

The hypocrisy of legislators and the bigotry of pietists have been a greater detriment to public morals than all the Sunday labor and recreation charged upon offenders since the time when the Jews sought to slay Christ for breaking the Sabbath.—*Smohomish, Wash., Eye.*

NOTE.—THE SENTINEL can not agree that Christ broke the Sabbath. He was so accused by the Jews, but refuted the charge. He declared that he kept his Father's commandments. He violated Jewish tradition; not the divine law of the Sabbath.
