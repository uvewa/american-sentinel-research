# Legislative Hypocrisy

The action of the Democratic Congress in voting to close the World's Fair on Sunday has had the effect of causing the multitudes of the country to organize themselves into a voting party. To close the World's Fair gates is to make the enjoyment of the country on the only day when laboring people can attend a mere luxury. The effect is well illustrated by a fact, as a Paul at Rome is represented as carrying a citizen's, and the papers announce that in front of the gates to the Exposition, "a saloon has been opened, and the pious people go one way toward the gate and the impious crowd go the other way toward the saloon, "Pack gives the master at the correct rate. "An unholy alliance," is what the Church and the rum shop ally themselves to by divide the caution of visitors to Chicago. The result will be that while the Church may catch five hundred of those who would otherwise attend the Fair, the saloon will absorb five thousand. In the interests of sobriety the Church should be willing to let the saloon be supplanted by a place where public morals might be tempted.

The hypocrisy of the members of Congress so much the worse is this fact that a large majority of the individual legislators who voted for the closing of the Fair have sufficient respect for Sunday to observe it themselves, and they are as likely to go with one crowd as the other. Monday morning will find half of them sitting in to deal and ispiriting.

"Where was I at?"

The hypocrisy of legislators and the bigotry of papists have been a greater detriment to public morals than all the Sunday labor and recreation charged upon offenders since the time when the Jews went to stay Christ for breaking the Sabbath.—*Chatsworth, Shults, Etc.*

But this is nothing to what it is to be since the change. This paper to be accused the leader the Sabbath. He was accused of the very same thing of which these people now keep his Father's commandments. He violated Sabbath teaching and the divides of the Sabbath.
