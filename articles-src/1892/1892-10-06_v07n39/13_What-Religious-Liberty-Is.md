At the Second Baptist Church last evening, Rev. Dr. Anderson, the pastor, preluded his sermon by what it is hoped will be the first of a series of timely talks on timely topics. Last night's talk was about the public schools. As it was brief and to the point it is published in full:

"The event of greatest social importance to the people of Rochester this last week was the opening of the public schools. It is cheering to the heart both of the patriot and the Christian to see so large a number of children receiving the education and discipline which will fit them for the duties of life, for both patriotism and Christianity thrive more vigorously in an intelligent community. I am glad to say that all the enemies of the public school are dead except those who derive their hostility from religious intolerance. The religious intolerants are of two classes: First are the Romanists. It is impossible to please them in the public school question. If we teach religion in the schools, the schools are sectarian, and if we do not teach religion in them, they are godless. The only thing that would please the Romanists exactly would be to have Romanism taught, but they are willing to compromise on a division of the school moneys, which you and I share in paying, diverting part of them to the support of Romanist schools. If that is done in Rochester, I shall immediately put in my claim for Baptist schools, and no doubt Presbyterians, Methodists, Unitarians, Jews, atheists and Confucians would act similarly. That would be a pretty spectacle indeed, under a Government which professes the entire separation of Church and State.

"The second class of the enemies of the public school sincerely suppose themselves to be the friends and are found principally in Protestant churches. They are the men who demand the teaching of religion in the public schools. But what religion, my friend? Some are quite frank and say, 'Why the true religion.' But what is the true religion? 'My religion.' It does not take a man of large historical information to see that this is the spirit of mediaeval persecution come to life again. Others are more cautious and say, 'We would teach those fundamental religious tenets common to all men.' But what are the religious tenets common to all men? 'Why, the existence of God, the immortality of the soul, and the moral accountability of all men to God.' But, my friend, there are many men in Rochester who do not believe in a God, deny the immortality of the soul, and hold themselves accountable neither to God nor anybody else. What will you do with their children? This fact always exasperates the advocates of religious instruction in the public schools. Such people are exceptional, peculiar, and their children ought to be taught those great truths, even if their fathers do not believe them. And what is the ground of your advocating the forcing of your religious ideas on such people? Is it not just because you happen to be in a majority, and is it not the old principle of conformity to the religious opinions of the majority? Suppose the atheists came to have a majority in Rochester, and you were exceptional and peculiar, but paid taxes just the same, what would you say if they began to teach your child atheism in the public school? Rochester would howl with your protests. It makes a great sight of difference, whose ox is gored.

"But say some, 'What of those multitudes of children growing up without any religious education?' Two things, first, the religious instruction in public schools does little good any way. Religion is a voluntary principle implanted in the heart by the grace of God, and you can not force men into religion. It has been tried for centuries and always failed. And then I would not give much for the religious instruction of the multitude of irreligious teachers in our city, who would have no heart in it. But this is neither here nor there. It is not the province of the State to teach religion. That is the business of the Church and the home, and the true doctrine of religious liberty simply emphasizes the supreme duty of the Church and home to the children, by cutting them off from using the State to aid them in their own business.

"I speak of this subject for I notice in the public prints the charge, how true it is I know not, that two of our school commissioners have expressed the purpose of not appointing any more Catholic principals. Such men have not digested the first principles of religious liberty. Neither has the man who so sharply criticises them in public prints and takes occasion to highly laud religious liberty, for he says that a large portion of the religious community (Romanists) has been deprived of the fair share of representation in the school principalships. This man, if elected a commissioner, would doubtless remove enough Protestants to give the Romanists a 'fair representation.' But the religious views of teachers have no bearing at all on the question. After ascertaining the good moral character of a candidate for a principalship and her ability to govern and to teach the branches required, the board has no more right to ask her whether she is a Protestant or a Catholic than it has to inquire what sewing machine she uses. The public schools are not institutions for teaching religion, but reading, writing, spelling, arithmetic and geography. I intend to take such a position that if any teacher, Romanist, Jew or atheist attempts to instill her religious views into my child's mind, I can consistently go to the board of education and demand the reprimand of the teacher, and, if the attempt is continued, her dismissal. I do not thank the State for attempting to teach my child religion. Let it keep its hands off. I will attend to my child's religious education myself.

"When will men learn the principles of religious liberty? Every man is responsible to God alone for his religious opinions."—*Rochester Democrat and Chronicle, Sept. 19, 1892.*
