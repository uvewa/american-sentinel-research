# What Constitutes a Union of Church and State

BORN the Republican party, is the platform adopted at Minneapolis, and Benjamin Harrison, as the candidate of that party, have declared in favor of complete union of Church and State in this country. But inasmuch as a Republican blank, since the adoption of this party platform, enacted religious legislation, and inasmuch as Mr. Harrison promptly gave his assent to the measure, it becomes an interesting question what these men understand by a union of Church and State.

In discussing this question some two years since, Rev. W. J. Coleman, a prominent National Reformer, said:—

"That means the State, or, strictly speaking, our Nation, is ruled by a church. This means, 'A building where worshipers meet' or 'those who habitually attend the same place of worship.' It A union of Church and State would be a body of believers acknowledging the same ecclesiastical authority or doctrines,—those of one denomination or sect; thus subjecting all others who acknowledge no central authority, and are not connected with the church so established, to persecution."

The union of the State with the Church, taken in the first, second, or fourth sense, would be impossible in this country; and it is not desirable in any sense.

Mr. Coleman then argues that the adoption by a government of the "aggregate Christianity of the country" would not be a union of Church and State, and he concludes that the term can be applied properly only to a union in the third sense, namely, by uniting the State with "a body of believers acknowledging the same ecclesiastical authority or denominational union." And that this is the meaning universally attached to the term there can be no doubt; but that it is correct does not follow. In fact it is easy to show that the aggregated Christianity is a union of Church and State. "The church" as applied to "the world," the Church in its broadest sense, is not, in the common understanding, a human ecclesiastical or denominational authority, but this "collective body" does recognize common authority. All denominations, more or less fully, recognize God as the great moral governor, and his law as that by which all must be judged; in short, the revealed will of God is the authority recognized by the Church in its broadest sense; and it is infra-state authority that the National Reformers wish to have incorporated in the law of the United States, thus making the law of the Church and the law of the State one and the same. And that the law must be interpreted by the courts and enforced by the Government then becomes a union; secular, ecclesiastical authority which all must recognize under penalties. If this would not be a union of Church and State in all essential particulars, we would like to have the Republican party, or Benjamin Harrison, or Mr. Coleman, or somebody else, whether Republican or Democrat, tell us what would constitute such a union.

It was in exactly this sense that Church and State were united in the fourth century. It was the whole body of Christians that was to be favored, every opposing religion to be suppressed. Constantine did only that which the National Reformers want done—he simply recognized that which the Supreme Court and Congress have already done—he simply made the nation Christian by an official recognition of the Christian religion, and by furthering the adherents of that faith above all others. Then as a natural consequence the bishops of the Church, that is, of the whole body of believers, came together to decide what was the Christian religion; and thus was formed the Roman hierarchy. And the American papacy will be formed in a precisely similar way.
