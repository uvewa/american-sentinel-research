THE Christian Patriot, Morristown, Tenn., in its issue of Sept. 15, preaches the authorities and people of the State of Tennessee a plain sermon from the first chapter of Isaiah. Among other things the Patriot says:—

The judgment and conscience of the people condemns also the running of trains and the publication of newspapers on the Sabbath. Not one man in a hundred ever apologizes for Sunday freight trains. But trains are run and papers published every Sunday in the year in defiance of the will of the people. Has Tennessee a republican government? or are we ruled by corporations? And yet Tennessee farmers, who religiously observe Saturday are put in prison for ploughing in their own fields on Sunday. Hypocrites! straining at a gnat, to swallow a camel!

The church members of Tennessee are no better than its politicians. They profess to receive the Bible as the word of God, the only infallible rule of duty. But they pay no attention to it, openly transple upon it. The Christians of Tennessee, in spite of all their professions, care nothing for God's word.

Does not Isaiah describe us very correctly? "Ah, sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evil doers, children that are corrupters." Is not his council worth following: "Cease to do evil, learn to do well, seek judgment, relieve [or righten] the oppressed, judge for the fatherless, plead for the widow."

Certainly the rebuke given by the *Patriot* is well merited. But the people of Tennessee are no worse than others. Everywhere in our land hypocrisy and cant are at a premium. They are the legitimate fruit of National Reform and will increase more and more as that delusion spreads and grows.
