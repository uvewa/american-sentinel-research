A RECENT dispatch from Berlin says:—

Despite the declared discontent on every side against the new law restricting Sunday trading, the Government has decided to maintain it, but will authorize communal authorities to relax its provisions where they really interfere with the personal comfort of the inhabitants. The Emperor, speaking to a member of the Berlin corporation said that the working people would soon learn the distinctive value of Sunday repose, and, once tasting it, they would never desire to relinquish it.

But the discontent plainly springs from the fact that the working people have already had a "taste" of enforced repose. It reminds one of the old English proverb that "one man may lead a horse to the water, but twenty men can not make it drink." How different from this spirit of legislative religion is the spirit of the gospel, as it entreats, "O taste and see that the Lord is good," and says to the world, "Whosoever will let him [not compel him to] take the water of life freely."

W. A. SPICER.
