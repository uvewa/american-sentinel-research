# A Difference Noted

A RECENT dispatch from Berlin says:—

The Emperor declared the discontent on every side manifested by the working classes is beyond question. The government has decided to maintain it, but will no longer look upon this condition with insensible content and will endeavor to bring about some social comfort of the inhabitants. The Emperor, after a few minutes' pause, in faltering accents, said that the working people would soon learn the importance of the measures proposed, and added with great emphasis: "God grant they may not be too late."

But the discontent plainly springs from the fact that the working people have already had a "taste of enforced rest," enough to make the most sanguine fear that "one man may lead a horse to the water, but twenty can not make him drink." How different from this spirit of enforced rest is that of the Master:—"Come ye, as it entreats, "(I) taste and see that the Lord is good," and says to the weary of heart, "Whosoever will let him (not compel him) come." The former is man's way of salvation.

W. A. SPICER.
