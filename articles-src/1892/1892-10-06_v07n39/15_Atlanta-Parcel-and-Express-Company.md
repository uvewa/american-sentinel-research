**THE** Atlanta Parcel and Express Company has been granted permission by the city council to run its wagons on Sundays. There were several speeches in opposition to the innovation but the petition was granted on the plea that it was a necessity as the company numbered among its patrons druggists, florists and ice cream dealers.
