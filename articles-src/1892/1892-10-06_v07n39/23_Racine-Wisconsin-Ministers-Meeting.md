A CORRESPONDENT writes us from Racine, Wis., that on the 21st of August the ministers of that city held a meeting professedly in the interests of temperance, in the course of which Rev. Dr. Roberts, of the Welch Presbyterian Church, said in substance, that the churches were to give the people religion, but that they need the civil government to help them in their efforts. What they could not do with religion to reform the people the civil officers could and should do with clubs and imprisonment. The Doctor justified his position by an appeal to the stoning of the man in the wilderness who gathered sticks on the Sabbath day. His speech was simply another evidence of the persecuting spirit of the Sunday law advocates. They would persecute to the death if they had the power, and blindly imagine the while that they were doing God service.
