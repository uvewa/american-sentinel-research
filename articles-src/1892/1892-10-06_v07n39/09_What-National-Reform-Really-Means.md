# What National Reform Really Means

As a Christian Characteristic of Attempt. X. Rev. J. M. Foster then sets forth the National Reform, or the Christian method; viz., an absolute union of, or incorporation of Church and State.

The Church is a body of men and women equally separate and independent divine in heart. She deals with matters of belief—not carnal things but spiritual things.

In the former sense the State is the keeper: in the latter sense the Church. It is the State's province to minister the body of the Church, as the Church's privilege to enforce the worship of the Church. But this is not upon the State, but upon God's holy name. It belongs to the State to preserve and protect the duties which men do not pay upon the Church to consecrate the day to God, for the civil magistrate to command religion to keep this day. The civil ruler should protect it. The Church teaches husbands to love their wives—but there is a law against wife-beating. . . . The State strikes it down in the heart with the sword of the Spirit; the State removes it with the sword of steel; and independent provinces of Christ's domain.

> *1. According to the Scriptures, the State is divine in origin for the sword of the law and for the sword.*

Not to mention the fact that Christ is "head over all things to the Church." Again it is asserted, "kings shall be thy nursing fathers, and queens the nursing mothers." "The Lord hath established his throne in the heavens, and his kingdom rules over all." It is written: "All nations shall be strictly warned."

Now in the light of these scriptures, we can see the true sense; "All nations shall flow unto it." "Mountains" and "hills" in scripture signify the great and small organizations of the world. All nations and peoples, churches and denominations, and to "be established in the top" of the one and all the rest. All power in heaven and in earth, the Church shall exercise over the Church. Kings becoming "nursing fathers" and queens "nursing mothers" of the Church shall become the same of every nation—any nation which nations shall exercise over the Church. The national revenue shall be used for the support of religion, Christian missionary work. The funds of these prophecies, in the *true State will have been established,* and in these State will have become the establishment of religion.

*The expenses of the Church in carrying on for purely religious work will be met from the Treasury of the public treasury.* Thus the Church is preordained to be State, and the State with nations in the State will exist in friendly recognition and on each other.

Thus far the National Reform theory does not follow that it is directed from her. The Church when so united with the State is not a dependent of the Church, and yet it exists in and for the State; the State exists in and for the Church. This is what is called the Christian State; and the true State will formally assume or embrace the Christian religion. They are each other's complement, and by their each are exalted the duties which each in its sphere has to discharge. It is not simply establishing the Christian religion, nor is it simply making the State Christian.

> "Wrote the same covenant in 1643," the acknowledgment of God, of his law and of Christ as the ruler of nations. *Her Constitution as the Church is to her*

*Christ in her Constitution as the Church is in her*

by the Christian Nation is both just and settled; is it not our ecumenicity in the same consideration? The demand of the Christian Nation is that the Nation shall by constitutional amendment declare itself Christian. But would it not be any more Christian than it is now? If the decision of the Supreme is that the Nation is Christian and not make it is awakening to the fact that, whereas, they have forty expressed that the Lord says, "the Church and the State were mutually separate and independent institutions, of that other state with no established Church."

Mr. Foster's recent proposition, that is, Mr. Foster, the real purpose being laid of, and in the Church Established of the Church.

Instead of his time breaking of the service of the people for the people, it is a reverenced in the clearing by the denomination continued something of Congress have declared that they have not trust the demands of religionists who are clamoring to protect of Rev. M. E. Gault, of the American Sabbath Union, declares, "I have learned that to hold the United States Senate in our hands." He might have said, and now it would be equally true that it teaches both the United States Congress in their hands, for the Congress has given the very same regard to the demands as laid the Senate when Mr. Blair had charge of it.

The condition of things in this country is expressed is substantially the same as that in the fourth century; the joining of the Church and State in the fourth century.

With the consummation of the union of the Roman Church and State, the persecuting power of the fourth century was recognized as legal, and tolerated by the State, and the claims of the bishops were allowed down to the Diocletian persecution. And it was the natural result when this intolerance, instead of being suppressed and allowed, by became, by degree, the dominant State religion, that it should turn the Roman intolerance upon the Christians into law, into incorporating the Roman intolerance into the civil service of the Government.

The "action" was generally that which Mr. Foster says should be in this country. "Reaction" was upon the Church, and "reaction" was upon the Church, and this will be followed now as surely as then, and with greater apostolicity. Such "reaction" was universal, sadly, any union of the Church and State.
