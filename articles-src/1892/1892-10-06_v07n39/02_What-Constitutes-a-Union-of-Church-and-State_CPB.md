Both the Republican party, in its platform adopted at Minneapolis, and Benjamin Harrison, in his letter of acceptance, have declared in favor of complete separation of Church and State in this country. But inasmuch as a Republican Senate has, since the adoption of the party platform, enacted religious legislation, and inasmuch as Mr. Harrison promptly gave his assent to the measure, it becomes an interesting question what these men understand by a union of Church and State.

In discussing this question some two years since, Rev. W. J. Coleman, a prominent National Reformer, said:—

The State means the Nation, or whole body of people. . . . The word "church" may mean: (1) A building where worshipers meet; (2) those who gather in such building, or a congregation; (3) a body of believers acknowledging the same ecclesiastical authority, or denomination; (4) the collective body of believers in the world. These acknowledge no central authority, and are not combined in any human organization; (5) the aggregate of religious principles and ideas in a community.

The union of the State with the Church, taken in the first, second, or fourth sense, would be impossible. . . . When, however, we turn to the third and fifth meanings, we reach the heart of the whole difficulty.

Mr. Coleman then argues that the adoption by a government of the "aggregate of religious principles and ideas" would not be a union of Church and State, and concludes that the term can be applied properly only to a union in the third sense, namely, by uniting the State with "a body of believers acknowledging the same ecclesiastical authority or denomination." And that this is the meaning usually attached to the term there can be no doubt, but that it is correct does not follow. In fact it is easy to show that the State can be united to the Church in either the fourth or fifth sense.

The "collective body of believers in the world," the Church in its broadest sense, does not, it is true, recognize any human ecclesiastical or denominational authority, but this "collective body" does recognize common authority. All denominations, more or less fully recognize God as the great moral governor, and his law as that by which all men will be judged; in short, the revealed will of God is the authority recognized by the Church in its broadest sense; and it is this same authority that the National Reformers demand shall be recognized as the supreme law of the United States, thus making the law of the Church and the law of the land one and the same. And then that law must be interpreted by the courts and enforced by the Government which then becomes a central ecclesiastical authority which all must recognize under penalties. If this would not be a union of Church and State in all essential particulars, we would like to have the Republican party, or Benjamin Harrison, or Mr. Coleman, or somebody else, whether Republican or Democrat, tell us what would constitute such a union.

It was in exactly this sense that Church and State were united in the fourth century. It was the whole body of Christians that was to be favored. And everything else grew out of that. Constantine did only that which the National Reformers demand that this Nation shall do, and that which the Supreme Court and Congress has already done, namely, he made the nation Christian by an official recognition of the Christian religion, and by favoring the adherents of that faith above all others. Then as a natural consequence, the bishops of the Church, that is, of the whole body of believers, came together to decide what was the Christian religion; and thus was formed the Roman Papacy; the American papacy will be formed in a similar way.
