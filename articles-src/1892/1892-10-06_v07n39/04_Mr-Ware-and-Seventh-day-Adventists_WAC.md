In his last issue of the *Michigan Sabbath Watchman*, the July and August number, Mr. Francis W. Ware, the editor, devotes no less than twelve columns of his valuable (?) space to attacks upon the Christian denomination known as Seventh-day Adventists, notwithstanding the fact that in his April number he "thanked God" their "days were numbered," and stated that they were on their "death-bed," and were "coming speedily to an end." He now, however, admits that "as a business concern with a religious name and nomenclature" the denomination "is driving considerable business"—altogether too much, no doubt, to suit Mr. Ware.

A very prominent feature of the "business" being performed by this people is that of preaching the keeping of "the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus." Rev. 14:12. They preach that the faith of Jesus is "the power of God unto salvation," and that this power in the heart of the believer in Jesus Christ will enable him to "keep the commandments of God."

As one of these commandments says "the seventh day is the Sabbath" and commands that this day be kept holy, the Adventists keep it and preach it as it reads, and shut not to declare that Sunday is not the Sabbath of the Lord, however much it may be preached and prayed and sung and legislated upon as such.

Inasmuch as Mr. Ware and his paper and the organization under which he is working (the American Sabbath Union) are all laboring to "protect and promote the observance of" Sunday as the Sabbath of the Lord, and are in favor of doing this by means of civil law, which Seventh-day Adventists claim upon the authority of the teachings of Christ is not a gospel method of work, Mr. Ware of course regards them as his natural enemies. And as it is natural for a man to seek to subdue and put down his enemies, and as Mr. Ware regards this people as a "business concern," he will no doubt seek to put a stop to their "business," by shutting up their publishing houses, which he has already seriously declared against; by boycotting their other institutions, which he has already warned the people against patronizing; and by persecuting the Adventists themselves, and thus do his part in fulfilling that prophecy which foretold a condition of things in this Government of boasted civil and religious liberty, in which it would be declared "that no man might buy or sell save be that had the mark,"—the mark of the Papacy, which is the false or Sunday Sabbath,—and finally, "that as many as would not worship the image of the beast"—the likeness of the Papacy in this country—"should be killed." Rev. 13:11-18.

Mr. Ware is following no uncertain course. It is the path the papists trod before him. That this is so may be seen in the fact that no straw will be laid in his way by the papists, in prosecuting the work he is now engaged in, but they will bid him God-speed, and when the proper time comes will rally to his assistance to defend the institution of their own substituting,—the false and rival Sabbath. He may seek to cast stigma and contempt upon those who honor the divine precepts of Jehovah as much as he pleases, by classing them with the low and vile, some of whom, however, know far more about justice and the rights of humanity than do many religious bigots; but one thing is certain, and that is, that in his fight for the Sunday Sabbath Mr. Ware will have the papists for his backers. They know full well there is no authority in the Bible for the Sunday Sabbath, and are only too well pleased to have professed Protestants take the lead in the defense of the unscriptural institution.

Mr. Ware, who is a Methodist minister, ought also to know that there is no scriptural authority for the Sunday Sabbath, for the "Methodist Theological Compendium," page 103 (edition 1865), says:—

It is true, there is no positive command for infant baptism, nor is there any for keeping holy the first day of the week.

But compendiums and disciplines and even the Bible itself count for nothing when men are wedded to hoary-headed tradition, and are set for the defense, not of the gospel, but of the commandments and doctrines of man.

Reader, where are you going to stand in this conflict? W. A. COLCORD.
