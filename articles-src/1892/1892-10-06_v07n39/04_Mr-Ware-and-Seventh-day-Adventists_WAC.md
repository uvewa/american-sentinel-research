# Mr. Ware and Seventh-day Adventists

In his last issue of the Michigan Sabbath Watchman, the July and August number, Mr. Francis W. Ware, the military, devotes no less than twelve columns of his valuable (!) space to attacks upon the Christian denomination known as Seventh-day Adventists, notwithstanding the fact that in his April number he "thanked God" their "days were numbered," and stated that they were on their "death-bed," were "creating apostle to us all." He, now, however, admits that "as a numerous concern with a religious cause and commanding resources" —altogether too much, no doubt, to suit him.

A very prominent feature of the "business" side of Mr. Ware's publications is that of preaching the keeping of "the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus." Rev. 14: 12. They preach that the faith of Jesus is "the power of the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus salvation," and that this power in this conflict with the world of ungodliness, will enable him to "keep the commandments."

As one of these commandments is to keep the seventh-day Sabbath, and this commandment that this day be kept is the very commandment the Adventist kept and this is the very reason they keep the seventh day as not the Sabbath of the Lord, how can it be fairly said that the commandment was ring and legislated upon as new.

Inasmuch as Mr. Ware has set himself and the organization made under his hands—the American Sabbath Union itself—are all laboring to "protect and restore the observance of Sunday as the Sabbath of the Lord, and are in favor of closing by his power of civil law, including the World's Fair," seventh-day Adventists claim upon the authority of the teaching of Christ is not a gospel method of work. Mr. Ware of course regards his own natural enemies but even he, with his peculiar nature and ambitions and put down his enemies, and as he says, "there are some who try to sow discord and create concern," he will no doubt seek to put a stop to the "concern." It is only natural that publishing houses, which he has always seriously maligned, against which he has always warned the people against; and by pronouncing the Adventist literature blasphemous; and this the literature in fulfilling that prophecy truly predicts a condition of things in this Government which it would be dishonored "that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark," "the mark of the Papacy, which is the first-day Sabbath"—that indeed this, "that as many as would not worship the image of the beast"—the likeness of the Papacy in this country—"should be killed." Rev. 13: 11-18.

Mr. Ware is following no uncertain course. It is the path the papists followed in this. That this is so may be seen in the fact that no straw will be left in its way by the papists, in promoting the work he is now engaged in, but they will bid him God-speed; and when the proper moment when ready to rally its administration to defend the institution of their own establishing—the first-day and free Sabbath. He may seek to cast stigma and contempt upon those who honor the divine principle of Jehovah as much as he does upon claiming them with the law of "the son of man in the earth" to forgive them the justice and the rights of humanity than this people; but the day which it will come is certain, and that is, that in his fight for a national Sabbath law he will give up to the so-called Sabbath, Mr. Ware will fall. He will find the papists for his backers. They know full well there is no authority in the Bible for the Sunday Sabbath, and are only too well pleased to have any protestant Protestant take the lead in the defense of the scripture-less institution.

Mr. Ware, who is a Methodist minister, may be surprised to know that there is no scriptural authority for the Sunday Sabbath. The "Methodist Theological Compend" (Amos Binney, page 103 edition 1863), says:—

> It is true, there is no positive command for its institution in the New Testament. There is no command in the New Testament nor any rule given as to what the first day of the week.

Reader, when you are going to stand in this conflict?
