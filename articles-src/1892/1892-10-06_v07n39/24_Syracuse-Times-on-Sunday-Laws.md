COMMENTING on an arraignment of Sunday laws as un-American and oppressive, the Syracuse Times says:—

Nevertheless these un-American and oppressive laws exist. They will increase and multiply. It is high time that all who understand their oppressiveness and unrighteousness condemn them as emphatically as this. They ought to be repealed. Why are they not, why will they not be repealed?

They will not be repealed because instead of growing better and coming more into harmony with the principles of the gospel of Christ, "evil men and seducers" will "wax worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived." Freedom of conscience has reached high-water mark in the history of this world, and already the ebb has begun. History is repeating itself, and the sure word of prophecy is being fulfilled.
