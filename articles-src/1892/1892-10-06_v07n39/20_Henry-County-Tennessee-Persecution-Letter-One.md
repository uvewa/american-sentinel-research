THE following letter to one of the editors of this paper will explain itself:—

Paris, Henry Co., Tenn., Sept. 28, 1892.

MR. C. P. BOLLMAN.—Dear Brother: There are eighteen of us from Springville summoned here to-day that indictments may be found against our brethren for working on Sunday. That is the main question. They even ask about the women. May the Lord help us to stand firm. Pray for us.

J. F. Finch.

THE readers of THE SENTINEL will remember that it was in Henry County that four men were imprisoned not long since, and three of them worked in the chain-gang, for Sunday work, or rather for Sabbath rest, since only Sabbath keepers were prosecuted. May God sustain these poor people as they suffer persecution for conscience' sake.

—

THESE people are charged with maintaining a nuisance by their Sunday work, yet in this instance, as also in the other cases referred to, the evidence against them is wrung from their brethren in the church. In the present case, mere boys have been summoned before the Grand Jury and will in all probability be required to testify against their parents, possibly their own mothers. And this in a so-called Christian land! How long, O Lord, how long!
