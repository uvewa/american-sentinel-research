**THE** World's Fair managers of the New York State exhibit are soliciting signatures to a petition asking that the Exposition be kept open Sundays. An attempt was made to obtain the names of some of the ministers of Albany. The ministers have consequently been moved to sermonize on the subject, and have criticized severely the action of the women managers who voted for an open Fair.
