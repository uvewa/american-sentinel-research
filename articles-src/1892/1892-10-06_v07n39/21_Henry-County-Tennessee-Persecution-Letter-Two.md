ANOTHER letter from Henry County contains some additional information:—

Springville, Tenn., Sept. 29.

MR. C. P. BOLLMAN.—Dear Brother: The Circuit Court is now in session, and six members of the Springville church were before the Grand Jury yesterday, and six of our neighbors not members of the church, for the purpose of finding bills against the Seventh-day Adventists of this place. They are very sharp this time. They had three of Brother Ward's boys in order to get him; and one of Brother Moon's boys in order to get him again; and my father and father-in-law in order to get me again. We think that at least six of us are indicted, but do not know for sure.

The State's attorney asked some of our brethren such questions as these:—

"Were you at the first meeting that John Dortch attended when he returned home?"

"Did he exhort his brethren to stick to their faith and violate the law?"

Yours, W. S. LOWRY.

IN order that those not familiar with the facts may understand this letter, it may not be amiss to explain that "Brother Ward" is the man who was indicted before but was not convicted. "Brother Moon," is deacon of the Springville church, and was convicted and served out his sentence, part of it in the chain-gang. "John Dortch" is one of the elders of the church; he was convicted last June of Sunday work and was imprisoned, but not as long as the others, having property which was sold to pay part of the costs in his case. The writer of the letter, W. S. Lowry, is also an elder of the church, and was convicted in June and worked out his fine and costs in the chain-gang.

Did the Spanish Inquisition ever do worse than invade families and churches and wring from unwilling witnesses things said and done in the privacy of the family, and in the sacred precincts of the church?
