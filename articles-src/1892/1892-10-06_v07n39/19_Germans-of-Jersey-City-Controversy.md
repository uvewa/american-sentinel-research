**THE** New York Sun thus describes a difficulty which has arisen between the Germans of Jersey City and the clergy, on the Sunday question:

The German element of Jersey City, more especially of the Greenville section, is filled with indignation in consequence of an attack made upon the Greenville Turn Verein on Sunday by the Rev. Chalmer D. Chapman, rector of Grace Episcopal Church. The Turn Verein has been holding a fair, which was opened a week ago yesterday, and was advertised to close on Sunday night. The advertisement also announced that all the articles left over would be sold or raffled off. A sociable and a dance were also provided for to close up the fair. Mr. Chapman exhibited a great deal of feeling in speaking of the matter. He said:

"I have been a resident of Greenville for nearly fifteen years, but never before in all that time have I heard of such an outrageous desecration of the Sabbath. I am ashamed of our townspeople, because they allow such a desecration without attempting to interfere. As a minister of the gospel I can not keep silent. I would be criminally negligent if I kept my mouth closed."

"The Sabbath is our safeguard. It is our breakwater. These people are mostly foreigners, and they are trying to establish foreign customs in our land. Americans are known the world over as a Sabbath-observing people. It is on account of their loyalty to the Master that Americans have been so prosperous. We have no wars. Plagues never visit our shores. God has blessed us, and we should not allow foreign Sabbath-breaking customs to obtain a foothold here.

"I am surprised that the ministers of Greenville have not publicly protested from their pulpits. I am surprised that our church members have not made a united protest. The Turners have no excuse whatever for opening the fair on the Sabbath day. They are undermining the fundamental principle of Christianity. Can we, as Christians, conscientiously stand by and allow such things to take place? No! By all means, no!"

What can Mr. Chapman and the Christians to whom he appeals conscientiously do in such a matter? No doubt Mr. Chapman thinks they can appeal to law and compulsion, and so enforce upon the Germans of Jersey City the identical customs of Sunday observance which they themselves follow. But can they do that and remain exponents of the Christianity which Christ taught? They can not. They know they can not. Mr. Chapman knows they can not. Then why does he not stop and think, before making such statements?
