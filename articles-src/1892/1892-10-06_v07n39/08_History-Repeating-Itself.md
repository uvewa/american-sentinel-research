# History Repeating Itself

The proposition to have a "Parliament of Religions" at the World's Fair in Chicago, at which the representatives of every religion in the world shall meet together and compare their creeds and their systems, has met with great favor, and with very high expectations. The prize given for holding 15 furnish food for everyone thought to the detriment of church of Jesus.

The Rev. J. S. Chandler, missionary of the American Board, writing from India, says: The report of such a parliament, has received the approval of prominent independent men. This is sure an occasion that will furnish an occasion to show to the world its need Christianity, how not too, bold and hack high spiritual and moral trend. Referring to the duty of Christians in the matter, he says: "If any other faith," which has been made by comparison of religious faith, would certainly add, "But surely if there is a modification of belief, the Christian would certainly not be intolerant of that faith."

The Rev. John Henry Barrows, D. D., of Chicago, chairman of the General Committee on Religious Congress, says:—

> Wisdom dictates that tolerance to the Parliament should be extended to the wearhead representations of all the great historic religions. There can be no doubt that those who are to take part in the proceedings will represent the best elements of their different creeds. Some of the leading scholars of Christianity who are entitled to be heard before the addresses before the Parliament. Japan is taking a deep interest in the Parliament. . . . . . and from his experienced counsel as to the best representatives. . . . . . The list of subjects for discussion and the names of speakers at many of the sessions, where there were some certain, the atonement and the future life are to be provided for the meetings, and the subjects to be discussed will include all questions which have occupied the minds of thoughtful people in vital principles.

Professor Janes Boyes says that such a conference will be useful "not only in spirit of Christian sympathy and humanity, but in enabling men of different ecclesiastical organizations to understand how their efforts may in suited for common objects. Nothing can be of more value than to lead men to realize the uniqueness of many of their differences in church government and forms of worship, and the largeness of their unity in vital principles."

The Rev. Phillips Brooks, lately D. D., Philadelphia, says: "The plan for the World's Parliament of Religions has really taken such practical shape, and reached such assurance of realization, that I find myself turning gratefully to the consideration of the actual sessions, the representatives of all the great religions, gathered for the first time in the name of the one Power above, and in recognition of a common good below. But I believe that no mind yet comprehends the possible good results."

President Snoddy says in response to the Parliament; If we can have a breaking of the idea "of the universal fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man;" of bringing religions leaders together on both sides of the Atlantic effort similar words of appreciation.

We read over these statements and note the enthusiasm with which many endorse them. It is that of unity. Not only in the Church, but a desire for unity among the professors of all forms of Christianity. This is not to be reduced to a minimum, and to show how much, after all, Christianity and religion have in common. And now for the history.

In the second century of the Christian era a new philosophy mock system, giving the members of which assumed the name of "Eclectic" or the "Eclectic Philosophers."

This philosophy was adopted by each of the Christian fathers, and applied to Christianity, and yet to retain the name, then professing Christians who taught those who in this century preached in the schools were called Eclectics: "These men then have approved of it. These were the things pressed upon us as the Christian religion; did the Eclectic philosophical school set to recommend themselves unto the things and the commandments and traditions of Christian teaching to collect together from all sides of the system."—Mosheim, Ecclesiastical History, book 1, century 3, part 2, chap. 3, section 5.

Can we not read this without thinking of the above quotations, and of the many in favor of the World's Parliament of Religions?—"one way," certainly, the thing like did not end here. One step of compromise prepared the way for another. And so it was.

> The eclectic mode of philosophy was changed in the second century in a way that increased the Platonists with great rapidity. Ammonius Saccas, a native of Alexandria. . . . . . which was called in the New Platonists. This man was educated in the Christian religion; but allured by the charms of philosophy . . . . he conceived a grand prospect of generality of genius, as well as the great part of the whole of Christianity, the genius of Christianity together, and to teach a philosophy by which all philosophies, and all religions, whether barbarous or Grecian, might be united to the best of Christendom not excepted, might unite together and have in common one system of faith and one rule of practice.—But it must be carefully noted that Ammonius did not follow what had before flourished in Egypt. For this reason he laid the foundation of it in the mind of the opinion that all sects of philosophy and religion entertain that they selected out of all what agreed with the truth.—Mosheim, century 2, part 2, section 8.

But Ammonites held that all who professed Christianity must allow the same differences in their conscience; and these common elements as Christian should be accepted by the rest of its professors as in the *Methodist Book Concern*, vol. 1, chap. 3, sections 1, 2; *Hurst, Hist.* 1 conf. 2, p. 45.

In the rapture with which Ammonites and the Eclectics plunged into the harmonizing of Christianity with all the different philosophical schools, and as adopted by the Platonic philosophy and applied both as Ammonites and the Eclectic Christian fathers saw—only Christian, bondness, and prevailing on all the wise and good of every sect to lay aside their contentions and quarrels, and uniting together, as one large family, the children of one common mother, to bring about a general reformation.

How we find the idea of "the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man, which is to finally hoped will be furthered by the Christian Nation is both just and settled; is it not our ecumenicity in the same consideration? The demand of the Christian Nation so that the Nation shall be constitutional amendment declares itself Christians. But would it not be any more Christian than it is now? If the decision of the Supreme is that the Nation is Christian and not make it be it would, a constitutional amending is a Christian? It is possible that the Christian Nation is beginning to use all such problems, whether by the process of court or by constitutional amendment, is only hypocrisy?
