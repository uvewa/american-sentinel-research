FRIDAY evening, September 23, there was held in Calvary Baptist Church, this city, a mass-meeting "to give expression to the approval with which Christian people everywhere received the action of Congress in regard to the Sunday closing of the World's Fair." It was presided over by Col. Elliott F. Shepard, the president of the American Sabbath Union.

—

THE meeting was called a "mass-meeting," but it was such only in the sense that the public was invited and that it was not a deliberative body. The masses were not present. Not over three hundred persons attended, and insipid speeches were made to a small and listless audience. Not the slightest sign of either approval or dissent greeted Colonel Shepard's review of the part the American Sabbath Union had acted in "compelling Congress," as the Examiner (Baptist) puts it, "to make the appropriation of $2,500,000 conditioned on the observance of the Christian Sabbath."

THE other speakers fared a little better than did Colonel Shepard, for at the proper places he himself applauded, and his example was of course followed by others, but not with that abandon of enthusiasm common to mass-meetings. Indeed there was little said that was worthy of applause even from the standpoint of the Sunday-law advocates. Of the "arguments" advanced, the Examiner says:—

Their value in the present instance was largely due to the personality of the men who uttered them.

This from a friend of the meeting and of the movement in the interests of which the meeting was held, can not be regarded as a compliment.
