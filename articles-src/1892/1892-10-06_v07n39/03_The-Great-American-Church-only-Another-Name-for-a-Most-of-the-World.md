# The Great American Church only Another Name for a Most of the World

At the Ministerial Union in Syracuse, N. Y., Rev. Thos. Crigan Pears took the stand that in the interest of reason, of progress, the discussion which is now upon the land, which church should take hold of certain particular tasks, etc.

In view of the Supreme Court decision that this is a Christian nation,—a decision that in its whole scope allows all non-American, and in its very nature all non-Christian interests to go, because it allows a shadow of interest, or moral interest—he indicates the continued growth of sentiment which must dominate the civil polity. Christianity must dominate the civil power. Church should dominate the civil power; recognition at the hands of the highest civil authority in the Nation by which alone the question that religion is to be the religion of the Nation.

How natural and easy it is, since the Supreme Court has said that Sunday shall henceforth be the standard by which it is marked,—the American Sabbath of an American church,—and what shall more practically concluded that this "church should take hold of every place where it is." And if so, in so doing, this most un-American church, undenominational in name but practically dominating "every place of America" through the "living agents" of persuasion or Sunday rest leagues, ripping out all objections about religious prejudices, under "practical lines of church consolidation," all churches shall secure, compelling all to observe every "American Sabbath." Really this is all brought about by this undenominational organization, and the authority of this unconstitutional law, which comes only through the actions of the family, the individual, the citizen, and, resting their rights—this is the just what it all means—then which he must be to demand. The Papacy has the power, as it is always has, of real things. The true church, stated or unstated, is with the "President of the United States as its acknowledged head." It is a church.

But what about dissenters?—Nothing but what has been done with them, according to law and penalty and a law of a lot of men—unconstitutionally, papally secured by this, un-American church and enforced by it as a Spanish Inquisition, but an un-American Inquisition, established upon Americans, on the "land of the free." The people themselves should not let it stay by such terms as "Americans" and as "American church," but study to know wherein lies the true principle of American Government.

Let us say here, that to the true Christian, the true Catholic, and other entirely different work has been given, that of domination over the rights of others. The true Christian has always stood in vindication of these rights.—*Padding, Marshall County, Minn., Banner.*
