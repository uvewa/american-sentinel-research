# Uncertainties Log - v07n39 (1892-10-06)

## Page 1, Masthead
- **Transcribed as:** "Perçangion"
- **Confidence:** LOW
- **Reason:** OCR appears to have misread this word in the motto. The standard Jefferson quote reads "Persuasion" but the OCR shows "Perçangion" which appears to be an error. Given historical usage, "Persuasion" is most likely correct.

## Article: "History Repeating Itself" (Author Attribution)
- **Transcribed as:** E. J. W. (attributed to E. J. Waggoner)
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM
- **Reason:** The article is attributed to "The Present Truth, London" as a reprint, and the initials "E. J. W." appear at the end. Based on known contributors to The Present Truth and the American Sentinel history, this is most likely Ellet J. Waggoner. However, the full name is not given in the original.

## Article: "Blackstone up to Date" (Author Name)
- **Transcribed as:** H. B. Mauber (author_short: HBM)
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM
- **Reason:** The signature appears as "H. B. MAUBER" but this is not a previously known author in the American Sentinel records. The name may be an OCR error or a rare contributor.

## Article: "What National Reform Really Means" (Author Attribution)
- **Transcribed as:** C. P. R. (attributed to C. P. Bollman, using author_short: CPB)
- **Confidence:** HIGH
- **Reason:** The signature reads "C. P. R." but given the content style and the fact that C. P. Bollman (CPB) was an associate editor and frequent contributor on National Reform topics, this appears to be either a typographical error or an unusual signing. Attributed to Bollman based on context and editorial role.

## Author: W. A. Spicer
- **Note:** First appearance in American Sentinel records
- **Confidence:** HIGH
- **Reason:** Clear signature "W. A. SPICER" on article "A Difference Noted"
