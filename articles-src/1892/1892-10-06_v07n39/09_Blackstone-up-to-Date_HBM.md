In his chapter on Corporations, Blackstone says in reference to ecclesiastical courts:—

Those courts act only pro salute animæ, and their sentences can only be enforced by spiritual censures: a consideration, which, carried to its full extent, would alone demonstrate the impropriety of these courts interfering in any temporal rights whatsoever.

Here, of course, the learned author is discussing a condition where there is a union of Church and State, a condition which under the influence of such men as Labouchre, is slowly but surely undergoing a change. The language of Blackstone might be modified and made applicable to our own time and country. "For those courts (civil and all legislative bodies) act only pro salute corporo et civitate and their sentences can only be enforced by civil censures; a consideration which, carried to its full extent, would alone demonstrate the impropriety of these courts interfering in any spiritual matters whatsoever." H. B. MAUBER.
