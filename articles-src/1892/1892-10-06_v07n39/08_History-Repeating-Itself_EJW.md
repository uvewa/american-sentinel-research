The proposition to have a "Parliament of Religious" at the World's Fair in Chicago, in which representatives of every religion in the world shall meet together and present the claims of their various systems, has met with great favor, and with very little opposition. The reasons given for holding it furnish food for serious thought to the student of church history.

The Rev. J. S. Chandler, missionary of the American Board, writing from India, says: "The project of such a parliament has received the approval of prominent missionaries and Hindus. The latter say that it will furnish an occasion to show to the world that non-Christian religions, too, hold and teach high spiritual and moral truths." Referring to the statement that "Christianity is intolerant of any other faith," which has been made by one who opposes the scheme, the missionary adds, "But surely if there is a modicum of truth in any other faith, Christianity need not be intolerant of that faith."

The Rev. John Henry Barrows, D. D., of Chicago, chairman of the General Committee on Religious Congresses, says:—

Wisdom dictates that invitations to the Parliament should be extended to the worthiest representatives which can be found of the great historic faiths, and the committee have prudently decided that those who are to take part in the proceedings should be selected by them after carefully conferring with those best informed as to the various religions. Some of the leading scholars of Christendom have already accepted invitations to make addresses before the Parliament. Japan is taking enthusiastic interest in the coming convention. Bishop Thoburn, of Calcutta, is kindly affording his experienced counsel as to the best representation from India. The prospects are bright for a series of religious congresses of exceptional interest where, as now seems certain, the attendance will be limited only by the capacity of the great halls that are to be provided for the meetings, and the influence of which will undoubtedly tend to deepen the spirit of true brotherhood among religious men of diverse faiths.

Professor James Bryce says that such a conference will be useful "not only in announcing the progress made in the spirit of Christian sympathy and humanity, but in enabling men of different ecclesiastical organizations to understand how their efforts may be united for common objects. Nothing can be of more service than to lead men to realize the unimportance of many of their differences in church government and forms of dogma and to feel more deeply their unity in vital principles."

The Rev. L. T. Chamberlain, D. D., of Philadelphia, says: "The plan for the World's Parliament of religions has already taken such practical shape, and gained such assurance of realization, that I find myself turning gratefully to the consideration of its actual success; the representatives of all the great religions gathered for the first time in the name of the one Power above, and in recognition of a common bond below. But I believe that no mind yet comprehends the possible good results."

President Seely expresses a hope that the Parliament will give men a clearer idea "of the universal fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man;" and many other religious leaders on both sides of the Atlantic offer similar words of approval.

Now read over these statements and note the principal thought running through them. It is that of unity. Not unity among professed Christians, merely, but unity among the professors of all forms of religion. The idea is to reduce the differences to a minimum, and to show how much, after all, Christianity and paganism have in common. And now for the parallel.

In the second century of the Christian era a new philosophical sect sprung up, the members of which assumed the name of "Eclectics." The historian Mosheim says:—

This philosophy was adopted by such of the learned at Alexandria as wished to be accounted Christians, and yet to retain the name, the garb, and the rank, of philosophers. In particular, all those who in this century presided in the schools of the Christians at Alexandria (Athanagoras, Pantheon, and Clemens Alexandrinus), are said to have approved of it. These men were persuaded that true philosophy, the great and most salutary gift of God, lay in scattered fragments among all the sects of philosophers; and therefore that it was the duty of every wise man, and especially of a Christian teacher, to collect those fragments from all quarters, and to use them for the defense of religion and the confutation of impiety.—*Ecclesiastical History, book 1, century 2, part 2, chap. 1, section 6.*

One can not read this without being reminded of the arguments put forth in favor of the World's Parliament of Religions. But, very naturally, the thing did not end here. One step of compromise prepares the way for another, and so,

This (eclectic) mode of philosophizing was changed near the close of the century, when Ammonius Saccas with great applause opened a school at Alexandria, and laid the foundation of that sect which is called the New Platenic. This man was born and educated a Christian, and perhaps made pretensions to Christianity all his life. Being possessed of great fecundity of genius, as well as eloquence, he undertook to bring all systems of philosophy and religion into harmony; or, in other words, to teach a philosophy by which all philosophers and the men of all religions, the Christian not excepted, might unite together and have fellowship. And here especially lies the difference between this new sect and the eclectic philosophy which had before flourished in Egypt. For the Eclectics held that there was a mixture of good and bad, true and false, in all the systems; and therefore they selected out of all what appeared to them consonant with reason, and rejected the rest. But Ammonius held that all sects professed one and the same system of truth, with only some difference in the mode of stating it, and some minute difference in their conceptions; so that by means of suitable explanations they might with little difficulty be brought together.—*Mosheim's Ecd. Hist., book 1, cent. 2, part 2, chap. 1, section 5.*

The favorite object with Ammonius, as appears from the disputations and writings of his disciples, was that of not only bringing about a reconciliation of all the different philosophical sects, Greeks as well as barbarians, but also of producing a harmony of all religions, even of Christianity and heathenism, and prevailing on all the wise and good men of every nation to lay aside all their contentions and quarrels, and unite together as one large family, the children of one common mother. *Mosheim's Ecclesiastical Commentaries, century 2, section 28.*

Here we find the idea of "the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man," which it is fondly hoped will be furthered by the World's Parliament of Religions. Really, the plan of Ammonius is involved in the proposed Parliament. History is indeed repeating itself.

What, now, was the result of all this effort to manufacture unity independently of the work of the Holy Spirit? One sentence from Mosheim, out of many that might be quoted will suffice for the answer. "It came to pass that the greater part of the Platonists, upon comparing the Christian religion with the system of Ammonius, were led to imagine that nothing could be more easy than a transition from the one to the other, and, to the great detriment of the Christian cause, were induced to embrace Christianity without feeling it necessary to abandon scarcely any of their former principles."—Id. section 32, note 2.

Will this result follow in the nineteenth century as well as in the second?—Undoubtedly, for the same causes must produce the same effects.—E. J. W., in The Present Truth, London.
