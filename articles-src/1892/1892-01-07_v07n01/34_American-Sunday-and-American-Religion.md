AT a mass-meeting recently held in Washington, D. C., to devise means for promoting the moral welfare of the army and navy, one speaker, who was a military man, is reported as saying that he considered "the preponderance of foreigners in the service a drawback to Christian work." If that be so the Christianity which is preached to the American soldier and sailor by the paid chaplains of the United States can not be the Christianity of the Bible. Can it be that this is a whisper of the development of the watchword "America for Americans" into "The American Sunday and American religion for Americans."? Is the Russian national intolerance becoming epidemic as well as the Russian influenza?
