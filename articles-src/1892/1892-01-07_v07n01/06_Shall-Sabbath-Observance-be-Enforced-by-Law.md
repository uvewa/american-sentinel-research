# Shall Sabbath Observance be Enforced by Law.

*A synopsis of the negative argument, delivered at the Annual Session of the Convention held at Philadelphia, of the American Sabbath Union, Nov. 12, 1891.*

SABBATH observance is the effort of a saved, wayward heart. Christianity says: "The love of Christ constraineth us." "We come to the Front of love." Advocates of the compulsory observance of Sunday make out no argument except from civil considerations.

As a hypocrite or symbolical act, let them how of suffer." History this has now come that no basis of it needed was taken out of, Christianity, than can be found in its fear of imprisonment itself. The power of Christianity is, and love, the strength Christianity ever had of, ever, and that is never made compulsory and that is never made compulsory of time.

To enforce Sabbath observance from the heart rebels is to offer to God the sincere offering that ever fell from the lips of Christians was the counterpart of this observance by compulsion. Two great evil must result:

*First*, "The world, will not believe there is such a thing as the power of the Holy Spirit, alone, it has, the power of the Holy Spirit that produced it."

*Second*, Both world and Church will be plunged more deeply into sin; because, for help against an evil, the Church has come to this very essence of that evil.

"You will not and not purify the world, or a worldly Church sanctified by the aid of the world. Therefore, "let, what I mind to be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus" and go with the power to the whole world, and in every hands "Preach ye the gospel to every creature," that is, go not to a state, to make man's good hands for Sabbath which says, "Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith the Lord

of hosts." Spend on the work of the Master with half the power expended on the Sabbath law, the struggle, and the world would stand aghast at the revival of the Church.

A religion which cannot enforce its own observances is opposed to the settled teaching of Christ, and the fundamental principles of Christianity, Christianity represents the use of force in the observance of its institutions.

The principles of a religion are part of that religion, and to enforce a religion observance is to enforce a part of that religion. But such enforcement involves a prior decision of the courts as to what religion is true and what false; and if our enforce what it deems the true religion, it must, with violation of law, suppress what it deems false religion. It would declare it its claim itself infallible, and an-infallible would be the masterless of an inquisition. To enforce the observance of the Sabbath means there is a place a religious dogma in the statute books by establishing a state held by an opposing religion. To force the observance of a religious institution on the nation, would commence, make, is religion persecution, and so as to explain was reads it.

The profound and learned American jurist, Judge Cooley, says: "The law discriminated against the religion of the seventh-day observer by forcing him to keep a second Sabbath in each week, thus unjustly punishing him for his belief. The argument which in my study this has already observed the seventh day of the week is unanswerable." Thus the learned judge declares that such and such a punishment most onerous certain crimes for a religious belief. And such punishment is for persecutions. All history tells that paper, Jews, and profound Christians have perished other religions because they thought them false. Voting in the our prejudice, we seem to think that men have changed; that we may enact such laws, and fan the smouldering embers, yet professes no flames.

But we must admit what evidence proves true. Allow me to read but two of many letters received in from a Kansas judge U. M. Ross, a member of the State Bar Association, of Arkansas, and one of the leading lawyers of the State—

"Dear received. The paper passed in this State in 1891, required all persons to keep Sunday as a day of rest, although they might religiously observe another day of the week, has been lately enforced, the penalty for its violation falling only on, persons believing that Saturday is the Sabbath. I wrote a letter of protest to the press in Appeal. It was manifestly unjust to those as well as to the lower. You are welcome to any opinion as to the propriety of such legislation as that contained in the repeated act. "Setting out my observations of any kind of legislation that has for its object the naming of any class of men as the exercise of their religious convictions. It is the fundamental basis of our Government that every man has a right to the free exercise of his religion in the debate of his own conscience. It was
