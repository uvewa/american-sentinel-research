AT a notable gathering recently held in this city for the purpose of furthering the interests of the World's Fair, no reference was made to the question of Sunday closing; but in an interview with a reporter for the Mail and Express, in response to the question, "How about opening the Exposition on Sundays?" Thomas W. Palmer, President of the commission, replied, "That depends on the will of the American people. We have received large petitions from various parts of the country asking that the gates be closed on Sunday. We have not received a single petition asking that the gates be opened on the Sabbath."

It is noticeable that there is in this no suggestion of the question being decided upon principle, and not even upon "the will of the American people" only as expressed.
