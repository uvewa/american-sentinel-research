THE Syracuse Times has this:—

"The American Sabbath Union ('Pearl of Days' Leaflet No. 3) says:—

"The civil power must recognize some day if we are to have any day of rest.

"How many of the following parallel statements will the American Sabbath Union also indorse?

"The civil power must recognize some God if we are to have any God to worship. The civil power must recognize some religion if we are to have any religion. The civil power must recognize some form of baptism if we are to have any baptism. The Union continues:—

"To permit any one to keep any day he may choose, or no day at all, would soon end in no Sabbath.

"By parity of reasoning, then, to permit any one to recognize some God or no God, some religion or no religion, some form of baptism or no baptism, would soon end in atheism, infidelity and heresy. Are the American Sabbath Unionists ready to swallow the pill? If so, let them explain why the belief and practice of baptism has survived so well without the interposition of civil law. Such is the logic of the advocates of Sunday laws."
