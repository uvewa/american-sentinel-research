REV. DR. SAWIN, an orthodox minister of Troy, New York, says: "A man who is in the right and is sure of his ground can always afford to be tolerant of the opinions of others. It is only the man who has a secret misgiving that his faith can not stand the investigations of reason who is bigoted and narrow, and who demands that other men shall think as he does or stop thinking altogether."
