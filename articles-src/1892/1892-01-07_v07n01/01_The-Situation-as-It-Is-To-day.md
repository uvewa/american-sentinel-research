# The Situation as It Is To-day.

ANOTHER year has passed, and THE AMERICAN SENTINEL enters upon the seventh year of its publication. The evil which, in 1886, led to THE SENTINEL'S being called into existence, has grown steadily and rapidly onward during the whole year. Although the year 1891 has not been one of so much legislative activity as have some of the years before it, yet the forces of the movement to join religion and the State, has come the more time lost, in fact, so as to real material progress, it is but fair to say that the movement has gained almost as much in the past year as in any year before.

In addition to its general strength the movement has made several important accessions. At the beginning of the year the allied organizations stood: The National Reform Association; the Woman's Christian Temperance Union; the American Sabbath Union; and the Catholic Church. There have been gained during the year, the Chautauqua Literary and Scientific Circle, and the Young People's Society of Christian Endeavor. The latter numbers more than eight millions of members; though a large number of them may be, just now, too young to count in a political way, it will in a very few years be able and ready to bear a full part in the grand scheme to make the religious element superior to the civil power in this Government, for the Chautauqua Literary and Scientific Circle, its platform, through its publications, the press, the pulpit, and the free circulated tracts and the widest open door for the propagation of the National Reform doctrine that has been found since the Woman's Christian Temperance Union joined the movement in 1886. And the Young Men's Christian Association, which has all along kept itself well aloof from the movement, is now becoming more and more a part of it.

In past years influential members of the legislative department of the national Government have proved themselves anxious to perform a prominent part in the movement, and it counted as an essential to a branch of politics, and in the past year a large number of members have shown themselves willing to do the same. The Fifty-first Congress, the closing sessions of course, of the city, attending a score of Senators of the Sunday standing of members of the Fifty-first Congress. There was a very large number, the members who made answer, but a large majority of those who did, and reply, expressed themselves in favor of the compulsory recognition of the sacredness of Sunday by declaring their readiness to vote for the closing of the gates of the World's Fair on Sunday. The Fifty-second Congress is largely a new body and its views are yet to be manifested. Until the past year the legislative was the only department of the Government that had been coolly called to, or had had an opportunity to, express itself upon the subject.

And so far the question has been discussed, by this department, the very last that can be said of it is that the question has been dealt with in a manner that should fill with joy the very hearts of the most bold National Reformers and would-be persecutors in all the land. If the Supreme Court of the United States should adopt the views and confirm the opinions of the decision delivered, that would pity the individual who should ever venture to think or act for himself religiously in this country. As the victim of this particular piece of persecution so termed, dealt with, is hardly likely that the Supreme Court will be called upon to pass upon its merits in review of the case reported. And in view of the result, so far, as the case did go, the people may count themselves fortunate that there is this prospective delay.

Of the three departments of the national Government the executive only remains formally untouched by this specific movement of governmental sacerdotal assertion to religion in recent and positive legislatorial enforcing religious observance. But in view of the trend made by the present chief Executive it would not take even three more years to fully open to the National Reformers as soon as they can succeed in carrying any of their measures that far. For President Harrison, not only like his predecessor in office, went beyond the Constitution and lauded a religious proclamation appointing a day of religious thanksgiving—which went beyond them, as far as our knowledge goes, and actually assumed the prerogative of deciding what the character of their observance of the day should be—one of which he declared to be "worship with thanksgiving."

As to our recollection goes, previous proclamations of this character only appointed the day and left the people free to decide for themselves what were the appropriate observances of the day. But President Harrison, not only appoints the day but, actually presumes to decide for the people what observances are "appropriate" and distinctly names "worship" as one of those things which are "appropriate." This is all illegal and wrong; it is true; for if it be the prerogative of the President of the United States to appoint a day for religious purposes, it is also proper enough that he should define the religious exercises that are appropriate to the occasion. He who decides that a day should be observed is, at least, a good course, best qualified to decide how it should be observed. And it is but natural, and proper too, that those who would respect the appointment of a day of religious exercise should look to the same source for directions as to how it should be observed. But how much further will President Harrison or any other President ever have to go, in principle, to become entire controller of the religious exercises and worship of the people and proclaim himself Pontifex Maximus at once in full fashion?

No, no, such was not the view of the makers of the national Government. Jefferson, the chief writer in the same, declared that "executive proclamatory facts and fastings" are "deviations from the strict principles of the immunity of religion from civil jurisdiction." And Madison, Jefferson's predecessor in the presidential chair, and his admirable colleague in the battle for religious freedom in Virginia, and in that for the Nation, declared that "No power to prescribe any religious exercise, or to assume authority in religious discipline, has been delegated to the general Government." This ought to be enough; but to make it stronger, yet, read these words of the United States Constitution: "The powers not delegated to the United States by this Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people." Yet for more than a quarter of a century this plain provision has been habitually disregarded in this respect; and not only has the presidency distinctly supplanted the Constitution, but it got more and more bold and advanced as time goes on. And the people, religious as well as otherwise, love to have it so. If that they would remember these worthy words of President Lincoln:

> It is not believed to be in the interest of religion to free the civil magistrate to direct its exercises, its discipline, or its doctrines; nor of the religious societies, that the general Government should be invested with the power of effecting any uniformity of time or matter among them. Fasting and prayer are religious exercises; the enjoining them the act of discipline. Every religious society has a right to determine for itself the time for these exercises, and the objects proper for them, according to its own particular tenets; and this right can never be safer than in their own hands, where the Constitution has deposited it.

But instead of respecting the Constitution, which, which is its provisions and its power, has left to the individual this whole matter of religion to be exercised or not as to him seems proper, the chief executive of the Nation, in disregard of that oath to maintain the Constitution, have taken from the people this inalienable right. And the people, instead of jealously guarding this right and being grateful that the Constitution recognizes and guarantees as free exercises, dully submit to it all, and rather cause the hand that is stealthily filching from them this liberty, after right and inalienable privileges, which have been bought with such torrents of blood and such untold suffering.

In addition to all these things there has been in the past year a more rapid growth than ever before in the country, of the pernicious doctrine that the safety of the State and of Society as a whole is dependent upon the public and official recognition of religion, and that to-day it is to commit a treason against the State and to strike at the very foundations of organized society. And, as THE SENTINEL has always

said out, this point is made to turn entirely upon the Sunday institution. It is religion as regarded by Sunday that is essential to the preservation of society and the State. This is the religion represented by Sunday that must be publicly recognized and established or the State and Society as a whole will perish. It is therefore the State and save society. It is therefore

And this is said to the State itself, and above all it disregard it, it is to commit treason against society and the State. Thus the disregard of Sunday or of some day is more and more to be recognized and declared to be the infamous offense against society and the State.

Upon this point, for during 1891, the Pope has come to the support of this doctrine. He says in the encyclical:—

"It is he who are the chief guardian of religion" and therefore enjoins "the rulers of the observance of the results of work or trade on Sundays and certain festivals" declares "and should be made free from interference by religion;" and that the Church "each in its due course" as the respective observance should be had, in due measure and degree, to the help of the law and the State entirely.

And even nor as we enter upon this New Year everything goes to bring the question throughout the whole Nation. The accession the official recognition of Sunday and all that is involved in it, by competent authorities also. One of the very subjects, bills introduced in the Fifty-second Congress by the present session, was one by Senator Peffer of Nebraska, to close the World's Fair at Chicago on Sunday.

For all these things THE AMERICAN SENTINEL enters upon its seventh year with its original and sole avocation more desperate that the Government of the United States, as founded by its fathers will be subverted, and will be made subject to a religious power, and that what will be known in description of religion and the State, with all its attendant evils, after effect, historical than of the Papacy.

The accomplishment of this as a certain and definite realization. The thing is only a question of time; and the time has draws on; all things call and say to THE SENTINEL "what of the night?"
