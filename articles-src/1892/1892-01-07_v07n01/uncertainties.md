# Uncertainties Log - Volume 7, Number 1 (1892-01-07)

No significant uncertainties encountered during transcription of this issue. The OCR quality was generally good, with clear text throughout all pages.

## Minor Notes

- Page 1, Line 27: OCR reads "ALONEO T. JONES" but this is clearly "ALONZO T. JONES" based on all other references in the issue and known historical records. Corrected to ALONZO.

- Throughout: Image references (e.g., "img-0.jpeg", "img-1.jpeg", "img-2.jpeg") were skipped as these are advertisements and publication information graphics not relevant to article content.

- Page 7: Multiple advertisements for health foods, books, and other products were skipped per instructions to omit ads and subscription info.

- Page 8: Subscription terms and publication information were skipped as boilerplate material.
