SENATOR PEFFER of Kansas, the Farmers' Alliance Senator, has signalized his entrance into congressional life by offering, among others, a bill to increase the number of chaplains in the army. These bills to give more chaplains to the army, under better pay, are almost unnoticed incidents of each congressional session; but they are a part of the great sum total of effort to saddle religious responsibility upon the Government, which, in the aggregate, has become a noticeable factor in political affairs. To such an extent has this become the fact that the phraseology even of the newspaper correspondents bears unconscious testimony to the hold this question of formal religion is taking on public affairs and public thought.
