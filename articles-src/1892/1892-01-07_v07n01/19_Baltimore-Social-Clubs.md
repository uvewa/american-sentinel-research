THE same course is being taken in Baltimore to evade the enforcement of Sunday laws against liquor selling, which has been used elsewhere,—the organization of "social clubs." These are liable to become worse sink holes of corruption than the saloons themselves. The law will never do away with intemperance or lessen its evil, materially, while the attempt is made from the standpoint of a moral or religious reform. If undertaken properly, as a purely civil matter, the manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquors could be stopped within any given time which the law might see fit to set.
