A LATE number of the Occident says:—

It will be an everlasting reproach to this Nation if the Columbian Exposition be thrown open on Sunday. We beg our Christian readers to reflect in advance on what may be their duty in such a case. The evil is seriously threatened; how may we meet it? . . . Can Christian men consistently attend an exposition that, under the circumstances, is flung open on the Lord's day, and made an engine of irreligion?

Upon which the Signs of the Times remarks as follows: "On the same principle Christian men ought not to patronize any railway company which runs Sunday trains. There is a wonderful effervescence of religious zeal every time this entirely unscriptural Sunday question bobs up. We should think that our religious contemporaries would at last come to question as to what is the real basis of all their feelings in this direction. Would it make the people any better if the Columbian Exposition were closed? Does the fact that it might be opened compel any one to disregard the Sunday? The truly loyal would be more loyal at such a time. Is the conscience of the Christian to be governed by act of Congress? Who would reproach the Nation?"
