# Sunday Papers and Campaign.

*The following statement from Mr. ——:*

THE Atlanta Constitution is entirely right. The following statement from Mr. ——:

In a recent speech before the Sabbath Association, in Philadelphia, Rev. Sam. Small, although among others the Sabbath, referred to the growing evil of the first, declared as this step:

Following the usual line of argument, his doubtless was led to make the above statement, because his genius is quite naturally in favor of the Sunday Paper. And the Sunday paper gives the advance of Sunday laws a great deal of trouble.

This paragraph from the press to the strict observance of Sunday, together with the example of so many editors who publish their papers on Sunday, is strongly demonstrated by Mr. Smith. But how about his own example upon that point? The same paper makes the following mention of a camp-meeting held in connection with that to the date of its issue:—

We are informed on the authority of our correspondents at the Ridgewood Avenue theater par- ty, on Sunday:

Rev. Sam Small and Rev. S. E. Hart were the speakers.

They had a good house, and never played to be better.

It was Sunday, but that went for nothing. Ten-cent admission appears satisfying to the saints.

A well filled house faced the speakers, and showed fine prosperity and results.

It was a pretty good, that which was held in the back of the stage. Painted in all the glowing colors of the best artists, and showing the crowning of an artist's hand, it suggested strongly a stage dream. Then the footlights found upon the

scene and theater grew involuntarily looked for their spots and first and allowed himself of a short of scene.

His was followed by Rev. Sam Small, who spoke from the text:

He was received, a body calm regard on the audience: who silently, tense, was witness of a forced garden the every day duties to those in their several and the right holiday of war expected, but it was certainly a departure from a kind of the stage to have as the candidates on the citizens ticket and force upon them public attention.
