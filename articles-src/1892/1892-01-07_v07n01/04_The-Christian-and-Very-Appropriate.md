# The Christian and Very Appropriate.

In the *Christian Statesman* of May 1, is given, a copy of a petition that was to be among others presented by the national party in convention assembled, which reads as follows:—

As American citizens we respectfully ask you to place in your platform, a short flat statement that there are great truths, namely: that our civil government has been established by the authority of God; and that the moral law is the rule of all our civil law that is not its equal and obligations.

We do not ask that a new sentiment, or as a that is additional ones.

As the natural application of these principles to public issues in our national life, we ask you to demonstrate:—

1. The American Sabbath.
2. A uniform Christian marriage law.
3. The right of the Bible in the public schools.

We ask you to make your nominations and conduct your campaigns in harmony with these principles.

It is stated in the comment accompanying the petition that "after some persisting that had been in the above platform after 'appropriate creed,' this additional statement," not as seeking a union of Church and State, "but we who adore?"

When I had finished reading the above, my eye fell on the following words at the foot of the column: "The Devil never

asks anybody to go farther than the next corner to begin with." He then asks a next was quite significant, and very appropriate, in connection with such a petition.

The petition asks that the State remove the one great corner-stone upon which depends the whole structure that separates between the Church and the State, by declaring religious truths to be civil truths; and fearing lest some cool, practical objector, seeing them thus subservient to undermine this Godgiven barrier that divide them, should think that they were trying to unite the two, they cry out at most indignantly "we abhor a union of Church and State."

The zealous demand for Sunday laws, that the laboring man may have opportunity to attend Church, is the same old trick which Satan played when, during the early centuries, he was working for a union of Church and State. He never asked them then "to go farther than the next corner to begin with." "Just to make Sunday laws" to stop the theaters, and public shows and games on that day, so that the laboring men should attend to their religious duties. It is not the same to-day with the so-called National Reform movement!
