# The Way of the Church in the State.

The editor of the Twentieth Century has found a thing too wonderful for him, that is, the way to a description of the relation of the Church to the State.

"One can not help wondering at the way some clergymen look at things. For example: In this Thanksgiving sermon or published in full, in the *Mail and Express* by Mr. of Rev., the Rev. Elms Tucker, pastor of Perry Market Methodist Episcopal Church, of that city, says:—

Another marked feature of the Government was the relation of the church of the Church to the State and the consequent prosperity of the former under

the bounty recognition of the latter. The recognition of religion, the legal and many beneficent provisions in the source of several State Governments, the exemption of the Church property to elevate its secular and religious institutions of the church to provide for its exercise. The bounty of the State, the handmaid of the State, the transactors how God gives functions. Also patronized and fed by the bounties of the State, the church spread to the level of point of useful secular institutions. Thank God for a free church in a free State. While the spirit of the Christian to the permission seems to be opposed to the union of Church and State as especially determined in the interest of the former, force is to prove that a state of entirely policy in its stead. We observe that while men turn back to the past lessons of the State there we will find coalition, former..."

"As to results, that is a proposition."

It is pitiable that Mr. Tinker does not know that the Church in this country "presumes to dictate in secular and governmental matters" as much as it can, or that "she assumes the support of a martialist, is patronized and fed by the bounties of the State" to the extent of millions of dollars in the form of exemption from taxation! it is not possible. The very strength of which he has in his parlor the recipient of State bounty to the extent perhaps of one or two thousand dollars a year and he must know it. How, then, does he not interpret the foregoing correctly? Is Mr. Tinker a fraud? Or does he take himself to be so much a part of the very strength of the Church that can not be known until it ceases to be legally favored by the State?
