The Atlanta Constitution is authority for the following statement from Mr. Small:—

In a recent speech before the Sabbath Association, in Philadelphia, Rev. Sam Small, alluding to the agencies against the Sabbath, reckoned the press among the first. He thanked God he was out of that.

Following the usual line of argument, he doubtless was led to make the above statement, because the press is quite generally in favor of the Sunday paper. And the Sunday paper gives the advocates of Sunday laws a great deal of trouble. This opposition from the press to the strict observance of Sunday, together with the example of so many editors who publish their papers on Sunday, is strongly denounced by Mr. Small. But how about his own example upon that point? The same paper makes the following mention of a campaign meeting held the Sunday previous to the date of its issue:—

The anti-barroom movement gave a special Sunday matinee at the Edgewood Avenue theatre yesterday afternoon.

Rev. Sam Small and Rev. R. E. Hart were the star performers.

They had a good house, and never played to better advantage.

It was Sunday, but that went for nothing. Two more ardent campaign speeches were never made.

A well filled house faced the speakers, and cheered them frequently and loudly.

It was a pretty scene, that which rested on the back of the stage. Painted in all the glowing colors of forest, field and sun and sky, with all the cunning of an artist's hand, it suggested strongly a stage drama. Then the footlights flared upon the scene and theatre goers involuntarily looked for the orchestra.

Hart spoke first and delivered himself of a short speech.

He was followed by Rev. Sam Small, who spoke on the usual line.

It was Sunday, a holy calm reigned on the thoroughfares without men, women, and children had forsaken the every-day duties to observe the day, and some reference to God and Christ and the holy Sabbath day was expected, but it was a campaign speech. Humorous references were made to the candidates on the citizens' ticket and funny mention made of the leaders of the citizens' movement.

Now it is a fact that can not be denied that newspapers devote a large share of their space to the discussion of politics, and during campaign times they do but little else than discuss the political issues of the day. And when they carry this discussion over into a Sunday issue, is it in any sense different from Mr. Small's political speech on Sunday? Men who do not stand on sound principles are sure to make their inconsistencies manifest.
