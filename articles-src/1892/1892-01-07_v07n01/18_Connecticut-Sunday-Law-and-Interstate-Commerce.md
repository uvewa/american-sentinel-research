THE compulsion by which Remenyi, the violinist, was converted to Connecticut Christianity for one Sunday has brought out no little comment from the press. The Herald expresses a sound legal view of the matter when it says: "It may be doubted whether any State has a right to interfere with the running of through trains across its borders. The train service from Massachusetts to New York, through Connecticut, is interstate commerce, and the courts have repeatedly held that such commerce is beyond the control of a State. Only Congress has the constitutional right to regulate it."
