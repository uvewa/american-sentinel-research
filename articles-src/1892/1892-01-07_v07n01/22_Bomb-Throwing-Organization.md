It is worthy of note that among the different insane and devilish things unearthed by the effort to identify the bomb-thrower, whose deadly intentions toward Russell Sage recollect upon himself, was the asserted existence of a bomb-throwing organization "of a religious character" which, it was declared, "would be in ten years the largest and most influential in the country." That such an element of horror as this may yet become an active factor in the fanatical religious contest now brewing is not impossible.
