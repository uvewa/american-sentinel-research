# Editorial Notes.

VETERANS of twenty-five years or more in the Union or Confederate service, whether National or State, are entitled, by virtue of their military service, to live anywhere they please within the confines of the Roman Empire, and this privilege applies to Jewish veterans as well as to others. In order to evade this, and lay the heavy hand of expulsion upon a class of Jews, also, the Russian Government has, unmasked, of the public exercises of those old soldiers, deprived them of the right of worship, by closing their synagogues, and, as it is a grave penal offense to even read Jewish prayers in any place other than a regularly registered synagogue, so denied of the right of worship is complete. Such things as these are evidence of what religious will go to in striking the promoters of darkness to make a "Christian" State or a "Christian" Nation.

In the published report of his campaign, for Russia, during the year ending October 1st, Iowa, M. A. Gault says: "It must be careful to avoid the Union of Church and State, but equally careful to prevent the States from antagonizing the Church. To open the Fair on Sabbath would necessarily shut out a large number of Sabbath-keeping Christians, and also be violating their civil liberty by putting them at an enforced disadvantage and loss. The Government would thus pay a premium on infidelity and irreligion, for one that Sabbath breakers could not illegally enter the Fair or patronize it. It would interfere with those religious men, some of these violations—

and violate the First Amendment of the National Constitution." Analyze this. Outside of the first phrase there is not a sound statement in the paragraph. If the Church is the exponent of pure religion and the State of civil equity there can not be antagonism between them. If the Fair were open every day in the week, no one would be shut out on any day. If closed one day all will be shut out on that day, most of them not willingly. Absolute non-interference from the Government is the safest will also bring perfect equality, anything one just Christian believers among all the people in all circumstances, lawyers, but even among themselves. The Government would pay no premium, for as it has no proper authority it would have also no improper responsibilities. To avoid interference does not interfere, and to obey does and violate. This is more a very superficial way to make the worse appear the better reason, yet it is a fair sample of the methods used by the ruling genius legislationists.
