THE AMERICAN SABBATH UNION is developing great activity in Michigan; a new paper called the Michigan Sabbath Watchman, has been started in Grand Rapids, and a virulent, as well as active campaign, is in progress. The Religious Liberty Association is issuing large editions of tracts particularly adapted to combating the errors advanced by these mistaken enthusiasts. It is to be hoped that all who can use this literature to advantage will write to the Michigan office of the Association, given at the head of this column, for such as they can distribute to advantage.
