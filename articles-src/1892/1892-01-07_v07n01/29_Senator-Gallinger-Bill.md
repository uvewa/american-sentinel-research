SENATOR GALLINGER, of New Hampshire, the successor of Henry W. Blair, has introduced a bill into the Senate, which, it is said, has been commented on with favor quite generally, to the effect that every person in the employ of the Government who is not native-born, or a completely naturalized citizen of this country, shall be immediately dismissed the service. This is class legislation. It is not the first of its kind, neither will it be the last. But it would be well to look long before leaping in each case. An accumulation of class restrictions means, eventually, paternalism and tyranny, civil and religious.
