MISSIONARIES writing from Japan report the question of the Sunday closing of the World's Fair as a subject of discussion there, and urge that the course which is taken will have great influence in that country. Certainly, it will have great influence everywhere, and those who are pressing the agitation have no understanding how world-wide it will be, nor how eternal in its lasting results. They know not what they do.
