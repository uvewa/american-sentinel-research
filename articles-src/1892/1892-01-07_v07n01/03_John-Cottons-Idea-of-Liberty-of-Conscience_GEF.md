# John Cotton's Idea of Liberty of Conscience.

THE SENTINEL has again and again set forth the truth that there can be no real liberty of conscience unless men are allowed, the same civil right to, think, to think, and speak, and act right religiously, is purely religious matters as distinguished from purely civil. This is the point that so many honest, well-meaning people fail to see. Why, say they, should I permit a man to do wrong, when I might restrain him by law? Will not God hold me guilty if wrong will I too, be not be guilty? These people forget, that God gave in the beginning that same people would be wrong, and that misery, pain, and death would, be the result of that wrong; and that He, while knowing this, still made one free as a free-willing to do right.

God himself refused to use any compulsion. After, after men had sinned, and sinned horridly, he sent not his Son, to force them to the right way. When men therefore attempting to use force in matters of conscience, even to restrain men from the wrong, they at once exalt themselves above God. The fact is no man, ever in any station, ought to use force in religious matters, without thinking, and perhaps honestly, that he fit it to restrain men from the wrong. Why did God leave men free to do wrong in the beginning? Simply on account of this very truth so often stated by Text Secretary, that there can be no liberty and freedom in the choice of the *Right* unless there freedom also includes the choice of the wrong.

The statement, that men may have a perfect liberty of conscience to think and act right religiously, but they shall not have liberty to think and act wrong in contradictory, and self-destructive. It at once implies that some one besides the individual is in decide, with reference to every thought and act, whether it is right or wrong, and then give permission accordingly. But it was for this very purpose and only for this purpose, that conscience was given to the individual and if conscience is denied independent judgment of action in this sphere, and it has no other sphere of action, then the conscience is wholly and completely abolished. There is no room left for any individual conscience, the dictate and privileges being wholly usurped by the decisions of some doctored sect, is alliance with the civil power.

This is proves the fact that there can be absolutely no liberty of conscience, unless there is as much liberty to do wrong as to do right. The discussion between Roger Williams and John Cotton turned wholly upon this point.

Failing to see this point John Cotton, perhaps honestly enough, justified the cruel banishment of Mr. Williams, and involved himself in a mass of contradictions. Roger Williams said:—

Mr. Cotton expects far greater light than that, and that he is only in the way of things, he must (according to his way of persecution) turn from, etc.

To which John Cotton replies as follows:—

> Mr. Williams hold me no farce-breaker of conscience. But if he is to apply these words experimentative? If I expect more light, must I one casting to sure as suspicion that what I see already is real, I see promises Christ himself; if he brings to that he has once a mind to confound them that thinketh all the houses expected ready about him of this very thing, that he may expect yet to look what, I expecting more in itself needs present that said brings it. It is but a few days ago a Professor Bryce says, "a Roman Catholic," and not Mr. Williams, and entitled "The Shady Secret," thereby a recollection of it, verifying from the previous for the same of his Calvinistic, to the answer the question, which to relates on the seventh page of that book, is defended by references of a kind forces from preventing any for cause of conscience, then he says it is done so one may of causes, that it is not lawful to persecute any for conscience sake rightly informed; that for an erroneous and blind conscience (even in fundamental and weighty causes) even in a correction, according as the apostles directions may require.

Mr. Cotton expects to see more truth, but being convinced of the dangerous error of his way. If not partial, it may appear that he is not yet pureed for cause of conscience, but for sinning against his own conscience. In things of importance, whether point of doctrine, or worship, if hard, and held them in, as a gate of Christian moderation and love through with and and constancy, is not that I have learned from the word of truth, that when one see and not are and still does
