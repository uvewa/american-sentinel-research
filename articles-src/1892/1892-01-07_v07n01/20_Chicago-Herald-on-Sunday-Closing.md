Or the Sunday closing of the World's Fair the Chicago Herald expresses itself thus forcibly: "If a hint be given from headquarters that the Fair will be closed totally on Sundays there will go off a protest to make all its beams ring. There will also be an eager rush for stock in that waiting syndicate to buy up the Sunday trade of the liquor saloons, if they be declared the chief educational places to be had in Chicago during the World's Fair Sundays."
