THE fashion of Sunday funerals, according to the Washington Post, is rapidly becoming a thing of the past in Washington, for the reason that, as the undertaker said to the reporter, "The class of persons we serve no longer bury their dead on the Sabbath;" and also because of the fact that "our best cemeteries, the Catholic being accepted, will not permit a burial on Sunday."

To be born, to be married, to die, to be buried, on Sunday will soon be quite "bad form" among the religious "four hundred".
