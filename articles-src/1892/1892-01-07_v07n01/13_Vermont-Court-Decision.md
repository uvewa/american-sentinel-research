A VERMONT court has decided that the holder of an accident insurance policy who is injured while hunting on Sunday can not recover on his policy, because of having received the injury while violating the Sunday laws of the State.

It can immediately be seen how far such a decision as this might be made to carry, in denying legal remedies to those who dissent from religious forms which the civil law may recognize.
