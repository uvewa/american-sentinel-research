"The Rev. David McAllister, D. D., left for Philadelphia last night to complete arrangements to again assume control of the Christian Statesman, in company with the Rev. T. P. Stevenson. These two Reformed Presbyterian ministers have had charge of the Statesman ever since it was founded by Dr. McAllister, twenty five years ago. About a month ago the Rev. Wilbur F. Crafts secured control of the sheet, and became managing editor.

"The paper has always been the organ of the National Reform Association. There was some doubt expressed among the leaders of that organization about the propriety of making the change in management. A week after it was announced, notices of discontinuances of subscriptions began pouring in. The subscribers were mostly members of the Reform Association. The matter soon took such a shape that it became necessary to do something to prevent an actual division in the ranks. The old management of the paper was appealed to, and to-day matters will be arranged in Philadelphia, and an attempt made to smooth over the trouble.

"Mr. Crafts, who is about to retire from his brief career as head of the Association organ is well known in western Pennsylvania, where he has done considerable speaking at intervals for the Sabbatarians."
