THERE is an organization called the "United Christian Commission in the Interest of the Army and Navy." This organization, which seems in its inception to have been an exceedingly praiseworthy one, met in executive session at Washington, some days ago, to discuss measures to be urged upon Congress in reference to the religious branch of the military and naval service. As an adjunct to this Senator Peffer has introduced a bill to increase the number of chaplains.
