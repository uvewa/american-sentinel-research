DR. EDWARD THOMPSON, the Pacific Coast Secretary of the American Sabbath Union, holds up California as an awful example of a State without a Sunday law. He is reported as saying at the annual convention of the Union just held at Des Moines, Iowa, that "during the nine years since California repealed her Sunday law her population had increased 30 per cent. and her crime 80 per cent. In other words that the repeal of the Sunday law manufactured criminals."

When Dr. Thompson returns to California he may be asked to substantiate such statements as these. If they are not true they should not be made. If crime has increased in this proportion it will not assist in remedying it to refer the fact to a fallacious cause.
