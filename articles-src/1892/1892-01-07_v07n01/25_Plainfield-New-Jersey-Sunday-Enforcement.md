THE authorities of Plainfield, New Jersey, are giving strict attention to the enforcement of laws against the Sunday selling of liquor. Hotel proprietors have been fined one hundred dollars each, for permitting the Sunday sale of liquor on their premises, and the regular saloons and barrooms have been required to remove their screens and window shades, on Sunday, that they may be open to public inspection. As a temperance movement the closing of the saloons one day in seven is inexpressibly futile. But that is not the intent of Sunday closing, it is not an effort for the civil suppression of the liquor traffic, but is an attempt to enforce a moral reform and compel the liquor sellers to respect Sunday; and the general effort is begun with them because of the opportunity against them which their questionable occupation gives.
