# What Do They Want?

THE first number of a paper entitled, *Political Dissenter*, published at the office of the Christian Statesman, is before us. The first page reveals the objects to which it aims. It holds that "a coalition" of followers of Christ must stand aloof may enter which association ... places itself, in antagonism to the law of Christ." The writer refers to our Constitution as being antagonistic to the law of Christ; for he immediately adds: "Not until the loyal followers of the King of kings shall faithfully carry out this principle will they control the social and political life of the Nation."

This plainly reveals the fact that the party of which the Dissenter is the organ, are aiming to get the control of the political life of the Nation.

On the same page is a report of a sermon preached by Dr. N. M. Pattison, editor of the *Presbyterian Journal*, of Philadelphia, and indorsed by the editor of the *Dissenter*, in which he said:—

The preacher also was to show that this Nation of nominal God-fearing people is to be a Protestant Christian nation; and that either sectarian association which carried in our national life, would result in our coming to nothing more than a political religious sectarian the preacher called upon all loyal American citizens to band together to realize their highest aspirations in the sphere of this general government, which are meaning what is desired.

From this representation it is clear that there are two rival bodies, each professing the Christian religions, who are striving to get the control of our civil Government. We ask, What difference will it make to dissenting which of the two succeeds? The aim of each of the same, to control the civil power for their own advantage, is the same; the aim to make this a Protestant Christian nation; and that either association which carried out in our national life, would exalt one creed above all others, the preacher called upon all loyal American citizens to band together to realize a Protestant Christian, a Roman Catholic, or to any or no denomination of that body, those who do by the Roman Catholic Church. Those who give such reason as alone for their opposition to Roman Catholic domination, if victorious, would use the civil power for their own advantage in national application, or confine themselves

to the very essence of that will.
