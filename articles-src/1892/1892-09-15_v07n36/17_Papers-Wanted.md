## Papers Wanted.

The next number of THE AMERICAN SENTINEL, No. 37, date of September 21, will be one of special interest, and we wish to place copies of the paper in the hands of thousands of readers, and for those who have not kept themselves thoroughly posted on the workings of the National Reform forces in our national Government.

Every reader of THE SENTINEL ought to order several extra copies of this number for distribution among his or her neighbors.

This issue ought to reach one hundred thousand copies, and it will be thrilled if the reading public will only help in circulating it. Extra copies of No. 37 will be furnished at one dollar per hundred or eight dollars per thousand. Send in your orders at once that we may know how many to have printed.
