# Are Sunday Laws a Civil Necessity.

“To substitute a weekly holiday for the observance of Sunday, in this community, would be the most cruel wrong that could be imposed upon the man who earns his daily bread by daily labor. The Sabbath laws of every State in the Union recognize it, directly, or indirectly underscore it, is the only protection these people have been given them.”

“To substitute a holiday for the Sabbath” would be an impossibility with any people who would accept no such substitution. But if the individual observes a holiday instead of a Sabbath nothing can prevent his observance of a Sabbath, religious or any other.

There is a constant tendency towards the diminishing of hours of labor, without a growing custom of making Sunday a holiday. This was said in an effort to show that Sunday laws are necessary; but instead of proving the necessity of Sunday laws, it really proves quite the contrary. If it required rather than, to make Sunday a holiday, but to restrict all forms of labor open upon Saturday afternoon; the law strictly makes Saturday afternoon, a public holiday, and banks, courts, store, most necessarily stopped business, because business done at that time would not be legal. But to make Sunday *does not* would not satisfy Sunday-law advocates. This is exactly the case with Sunday in California. It is a legal holiday, no public business is done and would not be legal if it were done, and yet, Sunday advocates say that California has no Sunday law, clearly proving that it is not a mere holiday law be enacted in that State. The truth is clear that the advocates do not want a legal recognition of Sunday as a *sacred* day. And that, they wish, would be religious legislation? C. P. B.
