## Revivalist Mills in San Francisco.

Two revivalist Mills recently visited San Francisco, and drew crowds that no hall or other public building in the city could accommodate them. The *Examiner* of that city, in the issue of August said:—

Mills will be practically surprised at the disposition of the store-keepers to close their stores that they and their clerks might attend to the evening meeting.

Here is a man free from what are usually called the enticements of a new city, had large enough for his audiences, and ran out of the stores and from their store avocations to hear him. He does not have to complain of the counter attractions of the ball games, the grist and the Sunday newspaper. He has learned the secret of interesting people in what he has to offer the world, so as to take time from his own devised avocations to hear his preaching.

Is not this an unkind thrust at those ministers who want everybody else closed up on Sunday in order that their churches may be filled?
