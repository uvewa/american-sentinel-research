Every reader of THE SENTINEL ought to order several extra copies of this number for distribution among his friends. This issue ought to reach one hundred thousand copies, and it will if the friends of the paper do their duty in circulating it.

Extra copies of No. 37 will be furnished at one dollar per hundred or eight dollars per thousand. Send in your orders at once that we may know how many to have printed.
