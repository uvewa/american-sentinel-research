THREE boys have been arrested in Pittsburg for putting up a tent and selling refreshments on Sunday. They are to be prosecuted to the "full extent of the law."

THE Pearl of Days reports that the American Sabbath Union has printed and sent out one hundred thousand copies of Elliott F. Shepard's "Brief" in favor of keeping the World's Fair closed on Sunday, which was presented at the hearings before the Congressional Committees on the World's Fair last April.

THE Northern Christian Advocate says that in New Orleans the Sunday law is violated, but that "The American Confederation of Labor has entered into an alliance with the Sunday Rest League to secure its enforcement, and it is believed that the opposition must give way."

Thus one by one, through apparent self-interest, or some other deception, different organizations are led into this great delusion.

THE Philadelphia Record has this editorial on the subject of Congress and the Sunday closing of the World's Fair:—

Apart from the immediate question of closing the World's Fair on Sunday there can be no mistaking the ulterior object of this Sabbatarian crusade. Should it prove successful, the reaction against personal liberty and social progress will not cease until every street-car shall have been stopped, and every library, academy of arts, and museum, closed on Sunday. The Sabbatarians have not hesitated to avow that their purpose is to re-establish the puritanical policy of the seventeenth century. In the debate on the Quay amendment Senator Frey, of Maine, passed a eulogy on the puritanical Sabbath, and fervently expressed a hope of its speedy restoration in this country. Other senators, in their Sabbatarian zeal, gave utterance to like views. This is the real meaning of bigotry's persistent attack upon the Colombian Exposition.

It seems that in North Carolina indulgence in gymnastic exercises is a desecration of Sunday. The pugilist James Corbett, while on his way through North Carolina to fight with John L. Sullivan at New Orleans, was so forgetful of the religious duty of complete Sunday rest required by the municipal regulations of the town of Charlotte, N. C., as to take, while stopping off there on Sunday, some modification of his customary daily physical exercise.

A posse of police was detailed to arrest him, and he was obliged to leave his special car on the track under the surveillance of the Charlotte police, and take another train to escape the consequences of his failure to observe the requirements of Carolina religion. Those who intend to stop over Sunday in the village of Charlotte hereafter would do well to telegraph in advance for instructions, unless they are in search of regular employment in the chain-gang or are composed of the stuff of which martyrs are made.

COMMISSIONER DOUGLAS, of Washington, D. C., received recently an application from a retail grocer requesting permission to keep his store open on Sundays, as his stock was perishable, and to close his store on that day would cause him great loss.

A subordinate officer to whom the matter was referred, stated in his indorsement on the papers that there is no law to keep the store closed on Sunday, and recommended that he be allowed to keep open, as requested. Commissioner Douglass, however, wrote the following on the subject:—

"The letter asking permission to keep a grocery-store open on Sunday for the sale of 'perishable' articles, such as meats, etc., was duly received, and referred to the Police Department. It has been returned, with a favorable recommendation by Lieut. Kelley. The lieutenant says that there is no law to prevent the doing so. I am not so sure there is no law to prevent this. In the first place, the Decalogue seems to forbid it. In the second place, by early and late common law decisions in England, Christianity has been held to be a part of the common law of that country.

"And, in the third, the supreme courts of this country have always held from the first that when the first settlers from the mother country came to America they brought the 'common law' with them as a vital part of their birthright of principles of government and social order. It will not be disputed that the Decalogue is a prominent plank in the Christian platform. I have often thought that an indictment might be framed under this idea.

"If not, it certainly has force enough, in my mind, to induce a refusal of such a request, and leave the party to stand on his rights in the matter as the courts may determine. For these reasons, with others not now mentioned, but generally understood or adopted, I must vote to refuse the request. Besides, all the articles called perishable can be preserved by the use of an ice-box."—Pearl of Days.

THE Pearl of Days is not satisfied with the multiplicity of organizations now existing for the furtherance of enforced Sunday observance, but advocates the establishing of still another. It says:—

The need of a national society, thoroughly organized and generously supported, to meet the assaults upon the Sabbath originating in high places, is the deep conviction of very many. The sacred day will never be fully saved to us so long as we think its foes are only to be found in the saloon, in alliance with the grosser forces of Sabbath desecration. The consciences of the intelligent masses must be appealed to. There must be such a moral atmosphere created as will favor discussion of the great Sabbath principles taught in the Bible. In other words, there must be greater attention given to finding out what God's will is concerning the fourth commandment.

If this new organization would really give itself to finding out what God's will is concerning the fourth commandment the result of the investigation would astonish the author of this paragraph.

THE Pittsburg preachers and their "Law and Order" detectives continue to make life uncomfortable for the people of Pittsburg on Sunday. The Pittsburg Dispatch notes the following incident:—

The Law and Order Society's movement against the pernicious selling of milk, etc., after 12 o'clock Saturday night is occasioning a great deal of criticism. Alderman Hobe says there are six or seven informations being prepared by the society for the violation of the law, but thinks the charges against the dealers are for selling ice-cream and cigars. He stated that any one brought up before him charged with selling milk, ice, or bread, on Sunday, would be discharged. He considers the application of the law to the selling of a glass of milk as stretching things too far.

A gentleman who had just gotten off a train went around the city Sunday morning about 1 o'clock in search of something to quench a thirst which he had been cultivating for many miles. He first tried the saloons, but found none open. Next he plead with the drug-store clerk even for a glass of vicky, but to no avail. He became desperate at last, and went into a Smithfield restaurant and meekly asked for a glass of milk. He nearly fell from his seat when the waiter informed him it was against the law to sell milk on Sunday without being served with a full meal. He sat meditating for a while, then, with a great deal of reluctance, said, "Can you give me a glass of water without violating the law?" After forcing the liquid down his throat he went out muttering to himself, in not very complimentary language, about the kind of a place he had fallen into.

Such facts as these show conclusively that the more those who seek the enforcement of Sunday laws gain the more they will demand.

THE purposes to which Sunday laws may be, and are, put, is well shown in this item from Our Country, published at Boston:—

A summons has been served on William H. Mace, of Stoneham, the well-known proprietor of the refreshment saloon at the northerly end of Spot Pond, calling him into court to-morrow morning to answer to the charge of keeping an open shop on the Lord's day. An interesting story is told in connection with this case.

Before Mr. Mace opened his saloon there was a contest between him and one Michael McCarthy in the matter of obtaining a lease of the land on which his building stands, it being a very desirable location. Mr. Mace secured the lease, and since then it is alleged that McCarthy has been endeavoring in one way and another to make matters unpleasant for Mace.

Last Sunday Mace left his horse in front of McCarthy's house and weighted him, while he went into his own saloon, which is near by. It is said that McCarthy came out and commenced moving the horse away, whereupon Mace ordered him to let the horse alone, and some hot words followed. It is alleged that soon after this incident McCarthy reported to Chief of Police Houghton that Mace was keeping his place open on Sunday, and this led to the complaint and summons against Mace.

Religious laws have always made an acceptable weapon for the malicious and the hypocritical against their neighbors. This will be found to be no less true now than in preceding generations.

THE Cottage Pulpit, of Nashville, Tenn., publishes this outspoken expression of noble and worthy feeling in reference to the fines and imprisonment suffered by Christian citizens of Tennessee under the State Sunday laws:—

In regard to the persecution of Seventh-day Adventists in Henry County, and elsewhere in this State, we have this further suggestion to offer: That if the intelligent Christians belonging to the communities where these men have been arrested would stop forward and refund fines that an ignorant or prejudiced justice of the peace or judge has imposed upon them, under mistaken zeal for the maintenance of the State's laws, they would honor Christ and his cause by it, and relieve themselves and the church in Tennessee of the appearance of complicity and approval of such disgraceful proceedings. Or, perhaps better still, to show the world that America's boasted heritage of religious liberty is not all a sham and a fraud and a mockery here at the core of the Nation,—here in the old "Volunteer State," as her citizens so proudly call her, because of her readiness to defend the national honor when the frontier was invaded, why not, you Christian men of honesty and intellect, exert your influence upon the governor of the State and have him remit the fines, as we presume he has the power to do, and thus cleanse the hands of our good commonwealth of the uncleanness, and her fair name of the stigma, of being thought a reviver of the old inquisitorial fires of persecution under color of law.

THIS account of an interview between a Presbyterian clergyman of Stillwater, Minn., and Archbishop Ireland on the public school question is from the New York Herald:—

The Archbishop charged the public schools with being godless, and professed a desire to introduce religious elements into them. I suggested that when I went to school we recited the Lord's prayer and read from the Scriptures, and asked how they were driven out. He confessed that it was largely owing to Catholic protests.

I again suggested that committees of all religious denominations meet and formulate a ritual to be used as a text book, containing religious instructions that would not be objectionable to any sect and that no persons of good morals could object to.

He objected on the ground that I would not confess to the Catholic idea, admitting that what Catholics wanted was the teaching of the Catholic religion in the schools. He cited an instance in which the State legislated in a matter of religion, requiring the observance of the Sabbath, and remarked that the State didn't do that for the sake of religion, but to require the observance of Sunday as a day of rest.

He then said: "Why not legislate immediately in that way in the matter of the public schools?" Claiming that by such a plan the State would immediately arrange religion, I objected to the Sabbath as not being a parallel, the Sabbath being common to both Catholics and Protestants, but that the Catholic religion which he was advancing in his plans was not common to both Catholics and Protestants.

The Archbishop frankly admitted that the Protestant's conscience had good reason to be offended when Sisters of Charity were introduced into the Central Public School buildings and placed over Protestant children. I asked if I might infer from that that the garb of the Sisters of Charity had a teaching force. This he practically admitted.

The Archbishop is an astute and plausible talker; but, as I said to him, his plan involves the impossible condition of putting religious instruction by the State in schools, which is contrary to the laws and conditions of the State.

I suggested that this plan was one that could stand only on its merits, and in the eye of the law this religious element robbed it of all merit. He seemed confident that some compromise would be arrived at by which the difficulties would be met. I gained from him the information that his efforts are by no means considered at an end.

It will be noticed that in antagonizing the Roman Catholic prelate it was necessary for this Presbyterian to acknowledge the impropriety and impossibility of the State teaching religion in the public schools, although this position directly crossed the suggestion which he had previously made as to the formulating of "a ritual to be used as a text book, containing religious instructions that would not be objectionable to any sect."
