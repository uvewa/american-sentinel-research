## Religion and the Public Schools.

This account of an interview between a Presbyterian congregation of Bellows Falls, Mass., and Archbishop Ireland, on the public school question is from the *New York Tribune*:—

The Archbishop was expected, and proved to be a most being gracious, and professed a desire to introduce the public schools to religious instruction. He said, "When I went to school we recited the Lord's prayer each day at the opening of the school, and the same rule was followed in this vicinity." This he said was largely owing to Catholic protests.

"He was in favor of the exclusion of all religious instruction from the public schools. The Bible could be used as a text book, containing religious instruction, and that no person of good morals could object to it. The only question was as to whether it should be used as a text book, containing religious instruction solely; what was wanted was the teaching of the Catholic religion." He also stated he was not in favor of laws requiring the observance of the Sabbath, and requiring people, however righteous, to attend to matters of religion, but to require the observance of Sun day, the 1st day of the Week.

"But in what way," said one, "Will you keep it, and in that way in the matter of the public schools?" "I want to see our public schools returned to the Sabbath," said the Archbishop. "All these matters, such as not being a parallel, the Sabbath being constantly before the public, tending to maintain the Catholic religion which he was attracting in his own diocese, should be considered from a religious standpoint."

The Archbishop frankly admitted that the Protestant religion is making rapid progress, and that very large numbers of the Catholic boys and girls attend the Central Public School buildings and placed over Protestants. "I dissented," said the pastor, "I told him that that the glory of the country consisted in education and in training the children of the community, but, as I said to him, his plan involves the imposing of religious instruction on people that is not wanted and not necessary for the maintenance of law, justice, and conditions of the State."

I inquired of him if there was one that could possibly be used as a text book, because he wished this religious element rubbed it of all merit. He said he could not, and I said, "So long as we have arrived at by which the difficulties would be met. I guessed from his conversation that he wished one as a text book, containing religious instructions that would be accepted by all denominations."

The Archbishop frankly admitted that the Protestant religion is making rapid progress. It will be noticed that in antagonizing the Sabbath and the Bible this Presbyterian and his Archbishop brother agree. Both are interested in getting the Bible into the public schools, although this position directly contravenes the principle of the entire separation of Church and State; and both oppose the use of the Bible as a text book, containing religious instructions that would be accepted by all denominations.
