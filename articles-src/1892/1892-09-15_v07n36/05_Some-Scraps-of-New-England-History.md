# Some Scraps of New England History.

## THE SUFFERING OF THE QUAKERS.

NOTWITHSTANDING the laws and punishments so carefully provided and enforced in the severest way, the Quakers continued to come. And where the Puritan laws were, that was the very place where the Quakers were most anxious to go; they were opposed to every kind of civil oppression, religious oppression, or intolerance and State. Not only to this, but in almost everything else that government made them objects of special hatred to the theocrats of Massachusetts. They recognized no such distinction between the Christian clergy and laity, and could neither be forced to respect them. They refused to doff their hats of office in church or in court. They were not to be silenced by the assertion of an “inward light,” by which every individual is to be guided in “a course of life.” And “the doctrine of the ‘inward light’ of adoptive inspiration, was the most annoying of all to the Puritans.” Another thing no less offensive than the “inward light” was the refusal to keep Sunday in the Puritan fashion. And it was because of the impropriety of Christians turning the Lord’s day into a Sabbath. Here a people who have been denounced as infidels, blasphemers, agents of the devil, and who compel on earth guilty of every heresy and every crime in the Puritan calendar.

Attention to the confederacy of the theocratic colonies. The confederacy literally refused Rhode Island, on account of a diversity of religion of every sort, from admission into the league. But hatred of the Quakers led Massachusetts in 1656 to ask Rhode Island to enact a law against them. But Rhode Island, “Save New England from the Quakers!” was the cry of Massachusetts. And that colony, signifying themselves their answer to the petition of the Massachusetts colonial authorities, by determining them to preserve the whole body of the colony from such a thing as admitting and excluding all Quakers, a solemn resolution of the colonial legislature was passed.

“Roger Williams was still prejudiced.” Rhode Island, and true to his principles “whereby to punish any for their worship he declared to be wrong, and only declaring by word their minds and judgments on any of the things of God; and the power of God is to do salvation to our endeavor; and to the ends only to be found by that which is not only opposed by arguments in discourse, and so left to the censure of God’s word. Any breach of the civil law shall be punished, but the freedom of different consciences shall be respected.”

They replied with the whole confederacy. Massachusetts threatened to cut off all trade of Rhode Island. In the annals of Rhode Island, by Roger Williams, adherents to its principles to Christendom, were called the “refuse and Rubbish of New England.” The appeal presented the case as it is, but that is far from the most striking record; the most grandest and most touching appeal in all the annals of this world’s history, however fortune may befall, let us not be considered interchangeably.

In course, October 13, another law was passed against Quakers, in which is the following:

> If any person or persons within this jurisdiction shall henceforth entertain or conceal any Quaker or Quakers, or other blasphemous heretics, every such person shall forfeit to the country forty shillings for every hour’s entertainment and concealment of any such Quaker or other blasphemous heretic, as aforesaid; and shall be committed to prison till the penalty is fully satisfied and paid; and it is further ordered that if any Quaker or Quakers shall presume, after they have once suffered what the law requires, to come into this jurisdiction, every such male Quaker shall for the first offence have one of his ears cut off and be kept at work in the house of correction till he can be sent away at his own charges; and for the second offence shall have his other ear cut off; and every woman Quaker that has fulfilled the former sentence, in like sort shall be severely whipped, and kept at work in the house of correction till she be sent away at her own charges; and for the second offence to be treated as the first; after which, whether male or female, being convicted again to be sent from us shall be seized and forced out of the limits of the colony. If they shall a third time be found among us, they shall be committed to the house of correction again; be set to work until convicted and then be sent away at their own charges. And in the meantime to be severely whipped once in three days.

The Quakers, however, still came, not only from England, but on occasion, having been imprisoned, whipped, and banished; but coming back again. The magistrates also pursued their persecutions, raised to others in the colony persecuting as zealously as ever, until that May 10, 1659, the following statute was enacted:

> Whereas, there did arise a sect accounted heretics, called Quakers, who took upon them to be immediately sent of God, and were inspired by the Holy Ghost, to speak and write blasphemous, opinions, and did make their abode in sundry parts of these United Colonies of New England; it is therefore hereby enacted and declared by this Court and the authority thereof, that every person of the kind of people called Quakers, that every such person or persons, professing themselves to be Quakers, who shall be from time to time, in strengthening themselves, or infesting any of the United Colonies of New England, and who shall be found by the constable and officers, it is ordered, that, if a every person, at meeting, shall pay to the common fund a fine of one pound; and every person speaking in such meeting, shall pay five pounds or suffer for the said offence by whipping, not exceeding forty stripes. And further, it is ordered, according to the former law, shall he for all first and second offences be severely whipped, and committed to prison, and kept at hard labor till sent away at his own charges; or any man ever visit their hateful errors, our interest in their accursed sect and the exercise to be at their own charges, and if any of them shall thereafter come to abide in or near the same town or place where they were formerly resident of the community, being convicted before the court, banished on pain of death.

In 1659 “Rev.” John Norton, appointed by the rest of the clergy, directed a petition praying that all the deadly evil be inflicted by law against all who should refuse to attend church after being banished. It was urged before the General Assembly, and endorsed by the Massachusetts Colonies met in Boston in September. The result was that three Quakers were sentenced to death, and their execution which in response advised the general court to address a petition of their own. Accordingly, October 18, the general court issued this order, thereby becoming positive law:
