THE revivalist Mills recently visited San Francisco, and drew such crowds that no hall or other public building in the city could accommodate them. The Examiner of that city, in its issue of August 20, said:—

Business will be practically suspended in this city to-day, for the men of trade have agreed to close their stores that they and their clerks may listen to the message that Mills, the revivalist, brings. . . Here is a man free from what are called "sensational methods" who can find no hall large enough for his audiences, and can call the men of the world from their avocations to hear him. He does not have to complain of the counter attractions of the hall game, the picnic and the Sunday newspaper. He has learned the secret of interesting the world in his message, and the world is willing to take time from its own devices to listen to him.

Is not this an unkind thrust at those ministers who want everything else closed on Sunday in order that their churches may be filled?
