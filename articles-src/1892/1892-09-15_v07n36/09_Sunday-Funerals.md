## Sunday Funerals.

One would not naturally suppose that Sunday enthusiasts would carry their ideas so far as to seriously deny the right of a man to die on a day which would necessitate his burial on the Sunday; but such would seem to be the case, from the following clipping from the *Halifax (Canada) Churchman:*—

At a meeting of the Ministerial Association of Halifax the following resolution was passed:

"Resolved: There is a tendency in abort the Halifax that for several years past has been growing custom of burying on Sunday. "We, the ministers, have long felt the time has come when it is desirable to urge our people to discontinue, as far as possible, all Sunday funerals and burials, and we are agreed, so far as in us lies, to aid in discouraging the custom."

—*Grand Lodge, Mo.*, J. L. CUTT.

From the foregoing it would appear that it is a sin to attend funerals on Sunday, notwithstanding men die, and the natural order of events points to Sunday as the day of interment.

Would it be less fallacious to repeat that any purpose their opinions, the other day, when the "Ministerial Association of Boswell" could attend the funeral without remorse of conscience?

It is not because it is so much of a sin to bury a man on Sunday that brings Sunday to the front as the "American Sabbath."

What is wanted is to set up the "golden image" on the "plains of Dura," and to attempt all classes to "fall down and worship."

—*Grand Lodge, Mo.*, J. L. CUTT.
