## The Youth's Companion.

The *Youth's Companion* thinks it ought to keep to the school work of politics, the only possible rule is to make the school a place of instruction in the fundamentals of knowledge, in morality, in religion so far as all are agreed. Schools as constituted, and no others, should be the teaching of religion.

Many regard liberty of conscience as one thing and liberty to practise according to the dictates of conscience as quite another thing. But there it can be no liberty of conscience without liberty of action. The Constitutions of most of the States of the Union contain the guarantee of liberty of conscience. The Constitution of Tennessee, for instance, provides that "no human authority can, in any case whatever, control or interfere with the rights of conscience." This would seem to be quite provision, and yet the courts of Tennessee have so construed it as to practically nullify it by making it guarantee only the right to believe and practise the tenets of one's sect, without the right to disregard laws made in aid of other sects. But this is a point upon which the constitutions Christian can not practice, that which he does not believe.
