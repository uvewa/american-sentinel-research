# Uncertainties Log - Volume 7, Issue 36 (1892-09-15)

## General Notes

The OCR quality for this issue was generally good. The following uncertainties were noted:

### Page 2, Article "Some Scraps of New England History"
- **Text:** "the pitsone plea"
- **Confidence:** LOW
- **Reason:** "pitsone" appears to be an OCR error, likely should be "pithstone" or possibly "touching" based on context ("the grandest and most touching appeal")
- **Transcribed as:** "pitsone" (preserving OCR as written)

### Page 3, Article "Are Sunday Laws a Civil Necessity"
- **Text:** "C. P. R." at end of article
- **Confidence:** HIGH
- **Reason:** This appears to be a typographical error in the original for "C. P. B." (C. P. Bollman), as he is listed as the author and associate editor. However, transcribed exactly as it appears in the OCR.

### Page 4, Article "The Gospel; What It Is..."
- **Text:** "chastisade"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM
- **Reason:** Appears in Massachusetts law text regarding Quakers. Likely should be "obstinate" or similar term, but preserved as written in OCR.

### Page 5, Author Attribution
- **Text:** "D. T. JONES" as author of "Ought it to Close on Sunday?"
- **Confidence:** HIGH
- **Reason:** This author initial set (DTJ) does not appear in the known authors list. Preserved as written.

### Page 5, Author Attribution
- **Text:** "fra D. Blanchard"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM
- **Reason:** "fra" likely should be "Ira" but preserved as written in OCR for "The American Political System"

### Page 6, Article "National Religious Liberty Association"
- **Text:** "QUADRAN" and "Standard"
- **Confidence:** LOW
- **Reason:** These appear to be section headings or formatting markers from the original resolution that were preserved in the OCR. "QUADRAN" likely should be "WHEREAS" based on standard resolution format. Transcribed as written.

### Page 7, Advertisement
- **Text:** Various product names and prices in health foods advertisement
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM
- **Reason:** Some price formatting and product names may have OCR errors, but preserved as written since advertisements were not the focus of transcription precision.

## Overall Assessment

This issue had relatively few significant OCR errors. Most content was clear and readable. The main uncertainties involved proper names, technical legal terminology from historical documents, and formatting elements that may have been unclear in the original scan.
