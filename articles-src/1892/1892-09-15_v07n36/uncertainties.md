# Uncertainties - American Sentinel, September 15, 1892 (v07n36)

## General Notes

Pages 6-7 of this issue have particularly small, dense print that made OCR very challenging. Several articles on these pages (11_Sunday-Law-Notes, 12_The-Persecution-of-Seventh-day-Adventists, 13_Religion-and-the-Public-Schools) have significant reading uncertainties throughout.

## Article 07: Ought It to Close on Sunday? (DTJ)

### Page 5, Left/Center Column
- **Obstruction:** Dense column text, some words at column margins unclear
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Issue:** Several passages in the long quotation from Rev. Mr. Francis are difficult to parse due to the original being a newspaper quotation within a newspaper. Some sentence construction seems garbled in the original.
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM - The article is long and some transitions between quoted material and editorial commentary are unclear.

## Article 08: The American Political System

### Page 5, Right Column / Page 8, Right Column
- **Issue:** Article spans from page 5 right column to page 8 right column. The flow between pages is uncertain.
- **Second pass completed:** Yes

## Article 09: Sunday Funerals

### Page 5-6, Left Column
- **Issue:** The resolution text and the attribution "Grand Lodge, Mo., J. L. CUTT" at the end appear twice - once before and once after the editorial commentary. This may be a printing artifact or intentional.
- **Confidence:** LOW - The attribution and ending are unclear.

## Article 10: Self-Evident Truths

### Page 6, Top Left Column
- **Issue:** This appears to be a continuation from a previous column (possibly from page 5). The opening "those" begins mid-sentence.
