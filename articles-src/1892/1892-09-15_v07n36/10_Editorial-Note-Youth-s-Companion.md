THE Youth's Companion thinks in order to keep the school out of politics, "the only possible rule is to make the school a place of instruction in the fundamentals of knowledge, in morality, and in religion so far as all are agreed. Schools so constituted and no others, should be supported by the public taxes."

A fine conception, truly, of what a public school should be. But where can the religion be found upon which "all are agreed?" Has anybody ever discovered such a religion? and if anybody were to discover it would it be worth teaching to anybody in any place?
