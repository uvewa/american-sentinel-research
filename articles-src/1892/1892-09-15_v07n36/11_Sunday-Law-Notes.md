## Sunday-Law Notes.

*The Post of Dupo* reports that the American Sentinel Union has printed and sent out one hundred thousand copies of Tracts at Dubuque—"Right? What is a force keeping the World's Fair closed on Sunday, which was sent to the members of the Committee on the Grounds at the World's Fair last April."

———

*The Philadelphia Record* has this editorial on the subject of Congress and the Sunday closing of the World's Fair:

Apart from the immediate question of closing the World's Fair gates on Sunday in deference to a certain religious sentiment, which has never been proved successful, the reaction against personal liberty goes much further. The sale of newspapers on Sunday shall have been stopped, and every library, academy of music, art gallery, public park and recreation ground closed, a long step will have been taken toward an era which sustains the puritanical policy of the newspapers continues. These newspapers have, however, reflected the sentiment, the spirit of the people on a vital question of personal liberty, and expressly expressed a hope of its speedy and final settlement. At a meeting of the Elgin watch factory workers, trial, gave expression to like views. This is the creed and faith of the *Record*; and in behalf of the people we are content to advocate it.

It seems that in North Carolina indulgence in gymnastic exercises is a desecration of Sunday. The past summer at Charlotte, while in the war ship *Vesuvius* was engaged to fight with John L. Sullivan at New Orleans, was obliged to keep his special car on the track under a contract. From present indications nothing more is in it than day rest required by the municipal regulations of the town of Charlotte, N. C., as to what, was designated his daily physical exercise to attend him, and was obliged to leave his special car on the track under an indictment. From present indications nothing more is ancient train to escape the consequences of his failure to observe the Sunday law. And all this is the result of a Sunday law intended to stop over Sunday in the village of Charlotte, N. C.; for it is well known that prize fighters train for international contests they are in search of regular physical exercise, and not the spasmodic work of one day. Such stuff of which martyrs are made.

———

Instead of entering a vigorous and manly protest against the persecution of Seventh-day Adventists, a Baptist paper in this city, enters upon a labeled defense of Sunday laws, and incidentally its makers.

———

If there are any whose conscience obliges them to rest from labor on more acres on some day: they may be relieved from the bondage of a double Sabbath by ceasing to petition or plaster members of this body on Sunday—only as not to disturb others in the enjoyment of their rest day of the week.

———

But what would constitute a disturbance of others? Some people are very much "disturbed" by the mere knowledge that their neighbors are not in keeping the seventh day while they work, and work on the first day while they rest. And in at least one State this annoyance has been held by the courts to amount to a public nuisance, and Christian men have been imprisoned as common criminals under this legal fiction. Such a perversion as our Baptist contemporary proposes may mean something or nothing according to the whim of the courts.

The Printing practices and their "Law and Order Societies" are endeavoring to close the saloons and keep people of Pittsburg on Sunday. The Pittsburg Dispatch recently said:—

The Law and Order Society's movement against Sunday selling of liquors appears to be meeting with an unexpected obstacle. In his charge to the grand jury, Alderman Heise says there are six or seven informations against saloon keepers, but when they come to trial, the charges against the dealers are for selling on Sunday and not to drunkards. There is a distinction here that Judge Stowe considers important, since no work, on Sunday, would be disturbed. He recently made an application for an injunction near the Pittsburg hotel.

———

Another instance of how the United States Sunday laws may be enforced, and also the injustice to the corner in the largest cities, as the conscience of the community continues to grow on this question:—

Then, after only four or one-half lines relative to Dakota and Wyoming, follows another account of how in San Francisco both laymen and ministers say that even in California the people need rest, on Sunday to be observed, and Christian service attend all things. A California correspondent recently an application from a retail grocer of Allegheny for permission to keep open Sunday. As his stock was perishable, not to close his store on Sunday—result loss.

A judicial officer in whom the "matter was referred to in disgrace refused the permission of his superiors in law to keep the store closed on Sunday, and reconsidered that law in the interest of conscience. Commissioner Dunnigan, however, wrote the following:—

"The strict ruling of permitting to keep a grocery store on Monday for barbers to keep open was the suggestion that was made by some citizens. It was referred to the Police Department. It has been returned, with a statement that there is no law to compel a man to close his store on Sunday. There being no law, the Police Department says that there is no law to prevent the doing so. Inasmuch as it is unquestionable that, both in the first place, the Decalogue seems to forbid it. In the second, it covers such acts and not observances. And in England, Christianity has been held to be a part of the common law of the land."

Before Mr. Marx opened his business was in good standing, it being a very desirable position, and his wife, who had been his clerk. Mrs. McCarthy has been endeavoring in one way and another to cause annoyance.
