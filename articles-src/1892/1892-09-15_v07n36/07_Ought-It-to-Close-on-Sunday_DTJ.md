## Ought It to Close on Sunday?

Those who have been watching the trend of religious thought during the last decade, and have noted the advances which the Church has been making toward civil power, will perhaps be interested to know the views of the religionists upon the issue now before the public, namely, the closing of the World's Fair on Sunday, as reported by the leading journals and ministers of the Pacific Coast. A Rev. Mr. Francis gives the following as special dispatches from Washington:—

Matters of national import in Congress were somewhat over-shadowed yesterday by the discussion commenced by the World's Fair Sunday closing bill. The contest was exciting and bitter. The bill was amended, and on the amendment Senator Quay, the eminent Pennsylvania senator, demanded the yeas and nays. The terms upon which the World's Fair appropriation is incorporated in a measure are that the Fair gates shall be closed on Sundays, that no charge for admission shall be made on Saturdays, and that the rigorous operation of the new proviso

> "Shall be binding upon the committee and the managers of the World's Fair."

The opposition rallied but the Sabbatarians carried the day.

Typographical errors led to the leading San Francisco daily papers misquoting Rev. Mr. Francis. In the *Examiner* his statements were corrected as follows:

In my statement on the Sunday opening or closing of the World's Fair begun, I wrote as follows: "If ever there was a religious bill presented in Congress, this Sunday-closing bill is one, and never shall it lose!" The arguments the main one for the Sunday closing of the World's Fair is its effect upon the day of the workingmen; *per contra*, it is urged that it will be no violation of the day, and that the amount of extra labor required to run the different departments would amount to desecration. It is time to ask by what right Congress legislates in favor of any Sunday, but especially Saturday and Sunday combined. There is a stereotyped and meaningless phrase, Sunday Sabbath, that confuses and dominates all classes. So far as the World's Fair is concerned, it is operated by stock and not by the Government. If the Government wishes to close its exhibit, let those who favor and those who do not favor the open Fair each have their way and then abide by the result.

Sunday, as a day of physical rest, cannot be secured at the price of the most utilitarian. Sunday could not be better spent by the masses of the people than as a recreation of the physical man, mixing pleasure and instruction, and enabling them to enlarge and broaden their views for the future.

The foregoing was written in July, 1890, and that it may be considered sound, dispassionate, broad, versatile, adverse, good, and ill natured, I have followed its line. My views, both good and adverse, are worthy of consideration, but as yet you have seen or heard of no rebuttal arguments concerning the great question involved. All in all, it is well to remember that Sunday in the United States is a holiday for the people who keep it, from a religious standpoint. Riding rigidly to the line of demarcation, a legal holiday—not a holy day, and just and title of it is the Christian Sunday. Sabbath of Sunday! Sunday is a holiday and only religious observers make it a Sabbath or day of religious opinions and practices them. They have, however, no special privilege of requiring others who do not choose to keep Sunday as a Sabbath to keep it. A larger class of citizens do not mark their Sundays with Sabbath observances. Sabbath keepers, of the former class, have perfect right to do so, provided that action does not conflict with others' rights; however, no moral right to compel the former to keep a legal Sabbath, which it is not. Where, then, comes in the constitutional or legal right of the lesser, larger, class of citizens who observe Sunday in both senses of the word, to compel the non-observer to keep a holiday. They believe that the day is one of rest for moral and legal purposes, but they have no right to make observances of prescribed religious rites a reason for its being so. It appears to be nothing short of persecution to violate another's religious liberty. It is a holiday; beyond that no power may and should not. Its interferences about Sunday are to protect the observance of citizens in worship.

The only question, especially in cities, either in, whether Sunday is that, or is the day of the agitation in advance, shall it be one of comparatively innocent pleasure and of healthful amusement as an intermediate of toil.

If, as our contemporary intimates the real object is to close, in this country, and all other avenues of pleasure the employment of labor about which would be closed, the day would be, for the most part, one of vicious idleness for all but the comparatively small minority who regard it as a Sabbath. For the people who are confined to the office, the shop, or the factory six days a week, and are obliged to remain in the city on Sunday, and are not inclined to go to church, they will resort to some sort of amusement places and if these are closed, as they would be, to a great extent, under the proposed legislation, their only recreation in their own homes; for idleness, the mother of mischief, in large population, invariably breeds vice. Continuing:—

Consider what would be the lot of vast classes in the large cities, to whom Sunday is the only available day of rest. That one part of the population already has Sunday for its Sabbath. Another part is prevented from keeping it as a Sabbath. To make Sunday the most luxurious day of the seven, to close the World's Fair on Sunday, as well as the library, the museum, and the park, to restrict the travel companies, of hotel and restaurant keepers, and of a thousand and one dealers in food and labor becomes general if present legal resistances are not sustained.

As a matter of fact there are comparatively few people in the city of San Francisco who may not, have regular days of rest if they so desire. Railroad and street-car men have their rests; with very few exceptions, given some other day in the week in which to rest. Is there any principle of equity or justice involved in trying to hold a laboring man broken in health from having insufficient time to rest? Improper living, dissipation, insanitation, extravagances, etc., distracts our attention and yet on the whole while "holidayism" is not all which might be wished, the lesser, the better form of Sunday observance in this country, in this century, the system of human life has increased instead of decreased as one would be led to expect that it would have been by the theories of those who assume that closed weekly rest in this connection, the opening of the Fair on Sunday:—

Rev. John E. Cottle, rector of St. Bridget's:—

The keeping of the Exposition open on Sunday could do no possible harm. A man who works six days in a week uses quite sufficient to entitle him to one day's recreation; and I believe that they need to use. The Sabbath is a day set apart for rest and recreation after the work of the week, and for whatever a man considers conducive to his betterment. A man who works five or six days in the sweat of his face; and God, who gives us six days of labor, also gave us one of rest. I see nothing wrong in going to the World's Fair on Sunday; in fact I consider it special use, especially since he has ordained that the World's Fair should be open on Sunday.

Rev. John Kimball, of The Pacific, the organ of Congregationalism west of the Rocky Mountains, said:—

The universal opinion, both of those who are in favor of and those who are opposed to closing, and Americans, is that the best health and interest of the individual and the community demands one day's rest from the ordinary pursuits of labor in each week, and a time be given to repose and exercise.

Rev. J. A. Cruzan, Pastor of the Congregational Church:—

My principal objection to the opening of the World's Fair on Sunday is the resulting effect on labor. The greatest thing of interest in the World is the American Sabbath; with its worship of the living God. My only desire is to preserve Sunday, as to its contrast with the continental Sunday.

Rev. W. W. Case, of the Central Methodist Church:—

Of course the clergy is a unit on this proposition. We think the World's Fair should be closed on Sunday. We are a Christian Nation, and should keep one day holy.

Rev. J. Q. A. Henry, one of the leaders in the Baptist denomination:—

The decision to close the World's Fair on Sunday was right. I hope it will be done.

Rev. D. Hanson Irwin, Pastor of the Howard Street Presbyterian Church:—

I am opposed to the opening of the Fair on Sunday. I am glad that a decision to that effect has been reached. The keeping of the Lord's Day is in the interest of religion.

Rev. D. D. Williams, Pastor of the Plymouth Congregational Church:—

My idea is that our legislators did wisely and well on the subject of closing the World's Fair on Sunday. I endorse their action fully and without reservation.

The editor of the *Pacific Churchman* holds sound views on the question of religious liberty, and is quick to give his reasons therefor. He is in favor of opening the World's Fair on Sunday, and only suggested the compromise of closing in the forenoon and opening in the afternoon, out of "deference to a sentiment" which he also states "would be unwise to try to ignore." All will recognize the principle involved by listening carefully to those who constitutionally observe Saturday. "They have a perfect right to do so."

We have here, however, no moral right to compel the former to keep a legal Sabbath. How well some express their opinions to act as if they did,—as did the congregation of a large church which when it hears, "Open the World's Fair on Sunday"—reads "Let us break the Sabbath!" Some of these people do not believe in Sunday opening to enter the Fair on that day. Such people could refuse to visit the World's Fair on Sunday, is, in itself, an answer to the question of the right to refuse to attend the Fair on the day which a majority of our citizens practically observe as their weekly holiday.

It is gratifying to know that some men who stand in the midst of the religious press, and stand in the pulpit, have not been carried away by the present wave of intolerance.
