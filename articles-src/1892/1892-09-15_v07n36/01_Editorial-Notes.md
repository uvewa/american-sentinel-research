It has always been the boast of the American citizen that this was the land of the free, and a refuge for the oppressed of all nations. The persecuted and downtrodden of the world have been encouraged to seek a haven here. The United States has made itself the apostle to the whole earth of equality before the law to all men. The people of the world have heard. They believed.

—o—

THE gospel of unalienable rights found many believers. The doctrine that the true purpose of government is to secure these rights to men found numerous upholders. The idea that it was from the consent of the governed that governments derived their just powers was like a vision of Paradise regained. It is not to be wondered at, that increasing millions sought to realize for themselves the blessings of this later Eden in the New World.

—o—

FOR a hundred years the United States preached these principles, and, in the cases of the immigrants who grasped the outstretched hand of brotherhood extended to them, it practiced the principles which it preached. Colonial ecclesiasticism was but a memory. Neither tolerance nor intolerance ruled, but equity and equality were the watchwords of the State. All were welcome, and equally welcome. The invitation was without reserve to all,—Come! They heard, they answered, they came.

—o—

THE invitation has gone out; the multitudes have come from Europe, the East, the far East. They continue to come. Are they still welcome? If they are not still welcome, why is it that they are not? The Chinese exclusion act, and the extraordinary precautions of the Government for its enforcement, prove conclusively to the Oriental that he is no longer welcome.

The late statutory discriminations against alien labor, and the method of the application of the foreign contract labor law, are more than a hint to the European masses that they are no longer wanted here. What is the occasion of such a complete change in policy as this? This Nation has lately made a judicial profession of Christianity. Is the reason for this coincident change in foreign policy to be found in that?

—o—

THE conversion of the Nation to Christianity was accomplished through a decree of the Supreme Court. The decision, in which the Nation made its public profession of religion, also acknowledged the binding force and propriety of an alien labor law of which the purpose was to discriminate against foreign workingmen, and in favor of resident laborers. But the plea was made, that, because this was a Christian Nation, it must necessarily be contrary to its policy to exclude Christian ministerial or missionary laborers. In the very profession itself of our national religion there is found this serious anomaly. It has heretofore been the policy of this country, humane, generous, just, to discriminate against none, but gladly share with all the blessings of a free Government, and the wider opportunities for the pursuit of happiness which this country has afforded. If the religious professions, which this country has made, have been made in perfect candor and good faith, why is there this incongruity?

—o—

IN the Gospel of St. Matthew it is related, that, as Christ sat upon the Mount of Olives, his disciples came privately to him and asked what would be the signs of his second coming, and of the end of the world. When he had given them the evidences of its near approach, and assured them that the day and hour was known, and would be known, to none, not even the angels, only the Father alone,—then he counseled them to be always in readiness for that great event, and spoke to them in beautiful parables, closing his discourse with a terse description of the final examination of the righteous and the unrighteous. He said to them, that, when he should come again in all his glory with the holy angels about him, all nations would be gathered before him, and he should divide the righteous from the unrighteous, and set the one on his right hand and the other on his left. The righteous he would call "blessed of my Father," and say to them that they should come to their inheritance,—to the kingdom that had been prepared for them since before the foundations of the world were laid. But the unrighteous he would call, "cursed," and order them from him into the fire prepared for the devil and his angels. To the one,—the second death; to the other,—life eternal! With a directness to be understood by the simplest, he gave his reasons for making this distinction.

—o—

To those to whom he gave the heritage of eternal life, he said that it was theirs because they had given him food when hungry, water to drink when athirst; had clothed him when naked and cold; visited him when sick and in prison; and, when a stranger they had received him gladly. But as for the others, when he had been hungry, they had not fed him; when he had thirsted, they had not given him drink; they had not clothed him when cold and naked; when he was in prison and sick they had not visited and comforted him; when he came a stranger among them, they had shut the door upon him.

When they both alike disclaimed having done, or having failed to do, all this to him personally, he said to them that as they had done this to the least of his brethren they had done it to him; and as they had not done these kindly charities to his brethren, so they had failed to do them to him.

Those whom he addressed so tenderly, as the blessed of his Father, and to whom he gave the highest possible gift, had entertained an angel unawares. The others had entertained no angels except those who came to them well accredited, having the insignia of their rank, and carrying properly certified letters of credit showing their financial standing, and so introduced that there might be no mistake as to their social position. The one were the righteous and Christlike; the other were the unrighteous and unchristian.

If this is a Christian Nation,—if it can be a Christian Nation,—which must it be, Christlike, or un-Christlike? If a nation can be Christian, when did this Nation show the most Christlikeness? When it opened its doors to the stranger and received him gladly, offering him, with a full hand, all the good things of the earth? Or when it closed its doors to some and strove to make it more difficult to others to enter? Is it consistent to profess both Christianity and un-Christlikeness in the same testimony? Does not such inconsistency savor of hypocrisy? Is there that difference between the Christianity of Christ and "American Christianity"? Is there a new religion, and is the United States its prophet? Has it forsaken the religion of unselfishness, and does it now profess the religion of selfishness, and has it christened this "American Christianity" and established Sunday observance as its sign manual, obligatory upon the American citizen?

All this bewildering maze of intricate inconsistencies which arise about these questions are significant—of what? That this is not a Christian Nation. That there can be no such thing as a Christian Nation. That the whole idea as now taught is but the figment of a deluded imagination. There can be no such thing as corporate religion. Religion, pure and undefiled, can never be anything but an individual experience. In that representative government whose individual citizens have, in the greatest majority, a personal experience of the religion of Jesus Christ, there, civil equity will most abound, and will more and more abound. But in these United States under the hypocritical pretensions of a judicial profession of religion it does, and will, less and less abound.
