## Self-Evident Truths.

those "self-evident truths" when we unhesitatingly assert the other man's right to believe and worship as he choose, or not to worship at all if he chooses. Freedom to do a thing necessarily implies equal freedom not to do it. It is the full admission and restoration of our own rights that makes us willing to recognize others and try to force them to conform to our standard.

The word of Christ (Matt. 7:12) to "do unto all things whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you, do ye even so to them; for this is the law and the prophets," is an appeal to Christ's followers, of what constitutes proper Christian charity. "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself." As Christ's legal opinion this rule is binding upon all Christians, unequivocally requiring them to accord to others in all things the same right and privileges they would wish and expect for themselves.

It exposes the character of those who claim that name Christian, but have so little regard for that fundamental law of Christian conduct, that they seek to enforce upon other holder formulas of worship, under penalty of fine, imprisonment, or other critical persecution. The law of Christ is clear: "All things whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you, even so do unto them." And that the rights of "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness," for every man, as embodied in the Declaration of Independence and guaranteed by our Constitution is in harmony with it, is a self-evident truth; and that these rights should be maintained by Christians and defended by all citizens,—"by this shall ye know them."—*Ira D. Blanchfield, in Dunkirk, Indiana.*
