## The Persecution of Seventh-day Adventists.

The *College Pulpit*, of Nashville, Tenn., publishes this singularly expressive cry of grief and warning from one of the Christian citizens of Tennessee under the State Sunday law:—

In regard to the persecution of Seventh-day Adventists in Henry County, and elsewhere in this State, we have but one hearty suggestion to offer. That of the intolerant Christian brethren to the persecuted ones: the words of Jesus, "If they persecute you in one city, flee into another!" We do not endorse these views, and refused fines that as tyranny and prejudiced justice is what it has been long since been quite clear, feeling as we do, that the men are sincere and consistent; we would know Christ and his cause by it, and others the movement of the Almighty, and the cause of persecution. To persecute either still, to abet the world in it, is, in our judgment, to put our all against Christ: not at a stage; and a fraud and a snobbery here at the heart of it all, and reeking with a vindictive purpose, not to defend the national honor when the frontier is trampled on by the foe of the Church, but to attack and have him resist the foe, as we permit the unrighteous court of law in this case that hinders our good conservatives of the omniscience, we say, in full consciousness of the responsibility which attaches to this, that imperatorial fines of persecution and the rule of law.
