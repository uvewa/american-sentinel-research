# The American Sentinel.

IT has always been the boast of the American citizen that this the land of the free, and a refuge for the oppressed of all nations. The persecuted and downtrodden of the world have been encouraged to come to our shores. The United States has made itself the apostle of the whole earth of equality before the law to all men. The people of the world have heard. They believed.

The gospel of unalienable rights found many disciples. The doctrine that the true purpose of government is to secure those rights found numerous upholders. The idea that it was from the consent of the governed that governments derived their just powers was like a vision of Paradise regained. It is not to be wondered at that nations everywhere looked to this land for illumination, and came rushing for themselves the blessings of the later Eden in the New World.

For a hundred years the United States preached these principles, and, to the mass of the immigration who grasped the outstretched hand of brotherhood as extended to them, it practised the principles it had announced. Neither tolerance nor intolerance ruled, both equity and equality were the watchwords of the State. All were welcome, and equally welcome. The invitation was without reserve to all,—Come! They heard, they answered, they came.

That invitation has gone out; the millions have come from Europe, from the far East. They continue to come. Are they still welcome? If they are not still welcome, why is it that they are not? The Chinese exclusion act, the almost extraordinary prosecution of the Government in the enforcement, prove conclusively to the Oriental that he is no longer welcome.

The late statutory discriminations against alien labor, and the method of the application of the foreign contract labor law, are more than a hint to the European masses that they are no longer wanted here. What is the command and a complete change in policy so that? This Nation has fairly made a judicial profession of Christianity. Is the reason for this occasional change in foreign policy to be found in that?

The conversion of the Nation to Christianity was accomplished through a decision of the Supreme Court. The decision in which the Nation made its “public profession of religion, also acknowledged the leading force and propriety of an alien labor law of which the purpose was to discriminate against foreign workingmen, and in favor of resident laborers. But the plea was made, that, because this is a Christian Nation, it must necessarily be a policy of the Government to protect ministerial or missionary laborers. In the very profession itself of our national religion there is found this sectional policy.

It has therefore been the policy of this country, humanly, generous, just,—to discriminate against none, but gladly offer to all the blessings of a free Government, and the wider opportunities for the pursuits of happiness which enterprise has afforded. If the religious profession, which this country has made, have been made in perfect candor and good faith, why is there this incongruity?

In the Gospel of St. Matthew it is related, that, as Christ sat upon the Mount of Olives, his disciples came privately to him and asked what would be the sign of the end of the world. Among other things he told them of the judgment of the world. When he had given them the evidences of its near approach, and assured them that the day and hour was known, and would be known, to none, not even the angels, only the Father alone,—then he counseled them to be always in readiness for that great event, and spoke to them in beautiful parables, closing his discourse with a terse description of the final examination of the righteous and the unrighteous. He said to them, that, when he should come again in all his glory with the holy angels about him, all nations would be gathered before him, and he should divide the righteous from the unrighteous, and set the one on his right hand and the other on his left. The righteous he would call “blessed of my Father,” and say to them that they should “come” to their “inheritance,”—to the kingdom that had been prepared for them since before the foundation of the world were laid. But the unrighteous he would call “cursed,” and order them from him into the fire prepared for the devil and his angels. And the reason for the two sentences,—for the one, “life eternal” with a directness to be understood by the simplest, he gave his reasons for making this distinction.

Of eternal life, he said that it was theirs because they had given him food when hungry; had given him drink when thirsty; because they had clothed him and had taken him when naked and sick; visited him when sick and in prison; and, being a stranger they had taken him in gladly. But as for the others, whom he had been hungry, they had not fed him; he had been thirsty and they had not given him drink; they had not clothed him when cold and naked; when he had been in prison and sick they had not visited and comforted him; when he came a stranger among them, they had shut the door in his face.

When they both, alike disinherited and heirs of doom, or having failed to do, all this he told them, he personally, he said to them that in refusing to extend it, or in extending brothers they had done it to him; and as they had not done these kindly charities to his brethren, so they had failed to do them to him.

Those whom he addressed so tenderly, as “blessed of his Father,” and to whom he gave the highest possible gift, had entered his kingdom only because of what they had entertained no angels except those who came to them with accredited, having letters of their ruler, and carrying properly certified letters of credit evidencing their bona fides. It was because they, always and ever, had done these deeds of kindness and tenderness that they had received from the Judge the decree of righteousness and Christliness; the other were the ungracious and uncharitable.

If this is a Christian Nation,—if it can in a Christian Nation,—which must be, Catholic, or so-Christian? If a nation can be Christian, when did this Nation show the most Christlikeness? When it was opening its doors to the stranger and received him gladly, offering him, with a full hand, all the blessings of a free State; or when it closed its doors to some and strove to make it more difficult to others of entrance? It is inconsistent to be both Christian and un-Christlike. The religion of Christ that must needs bear such an inconsistency savor of hypocrisy? Is it strictly a combination of “American Christianity” of Christ and “American Christianity” of the Church that is making the United States its prophet? Has it broken down Christianity as it is, and does it now profess the religion of selfishness, intolerance and injustice as “American Christianity” and established Supreme Court rulings thereby as an ecclesiastical hierarchy upon the American citizen?

All the bewildering mass of intolerant inconsistencies which arise about these matters are significators of—what? That there can be no such thing as a Christian nation. There is, and can be, no such thing, but is not the figment of a deluded fancy that there can be such a thing as corporate religion. Religion, pure and undefiled, can never be anything but an individual experience. In that representative government whose institutions and laws, in the greatest majority, a Government which professes the religion of Jesus Christ, there, civil equity will soon vanish; and will more and more decline. But in these United States under the hypocritical professions of a “Christian” Nation, it is just as much so, and more, and less and less of it, too.
