# The Gospel: What It Is, and Its Work

## As Opposed to the Mystery of Iniquity.

*(Concluded.)*

The National Reform Association and this whole ecclesiastical combination have been working for their purposes about twenty-five years. Will they stand still and do nothing? It has been and here today an ecclesiastical organization anxious to assert the Government on a kind of sovereignty for itself; just as there was then to this day.

Then can any one doubt, or fail to see, that under the circumstances making the conditions of the times, in view of the position the Church occupied at that time, the decision of the Supreme Court, deciding in favor of Christianity as the religion of the land, acknowledged the Papacy, and out of that came all that the Church then and now demanded? With the like circumstances and the like conditions of church ambition, out of this Supreme Court decision making Christianity the religion of this Nation,—just as certainly is this is the image of the beast, and so it will come everything that the prophecy tells about.

We are quite sure that all intelligent minds, are confident and at least for this reason, that what appears to be on this national Constitution, there was a movement for Christianity as the national religion,—not the Catholic nor the Protestant, but “the Christian religion, the best of all religions.” If we read them, that is all. Let me read to you what James Madison said:

> Constituted *favored* Christianity at the first, just as a religion “the whole body of Christians.” And then he established a Catholic Church.” The adoption of all Christians,” just as surely as he did then in truth, as certainly as the Supreme Court of the United States has established Christianity as the religion of this nation, in

another way, just so certainly has it established all other religions, just as certainly, and in any manner whatsoever, hence certainly, in establishing any, whatever, it must certainly's one particular sect in exclusion of all other sects. The Supreme Court, this as certainly as anything, whatever, has acknowledged all the privileges of Protestantism; but if that is it, assuredly will have to decide which sect of Protestantism it is. I do not know who will decide it, whether the Supreme Court, or Congress, or by national election campaign, I can not say; but it will be decided in some way. It is bound to come.

Madison and those of his time knew just as certainly as they knew anything, that Christianity was established as the State religion of Virginia, there must be a particular sect established, and everything must be accomplished. Not only that, but he said so.

Instead of holding forth an unction to the persecutors, his memorial said:—

> Now; mark they held this position; they had experienced it. We are in no way dreaming— we have had some of it too in our day. They tell us in the mere propagation of the Christian or the established religion; it “is a signal of persecution.” Just as certainly as this legal establishment, just as the decision of the Supreme Court, made Christianity the established religion of the State in favor of Christianity as the religion of the nation in that State, just so certainly this Supreme Court decision making Christianity the religion of this Nation is a signal of persecution through the Nation. But I read again from Madison’s remonstrance:

> It is not to be believed. It is not first time to believe it.—

> Distant as it may be in its present form from the Inquisition.

In that proposition to establish “the Christian religion” in Virginia, they saw the Inquisition. What do we see in the actual establishment of the same religion by the Supreme Court of the United States?

> The one is the first step, the other is the last. Is either to be tolerated?

That is what they saw, the founders of this Republic, when an attempt was made to establish Christianity as the religion of the State religion. What does this people see in that Supreme Court decision, of the United States, which establishes Christianity as the religion of our national religion? Just as certainly as that back there was a signal of persecution, and persecution throughout the State, just so certainly here is a signal of persecution, and persecution throughout all the Nation. Just as certainly as that back there the establishment of this religion in that State, just so certainly this has in it the same thing.

All just exactly in the same way, only carried further. The whole course of the establishment back there had in it the Papacy at last—and it did come. It was the very image of the Papacy is or will be. Counterfeiting Christianity, and this brought the establishment of the Papacy in a National Christianity, and this brought the establishment of the Catholic Church religion, in every respect, the fullness of all intolerant persecution of all kinds. Soon the next step was made, compelling all dissenters outside the pale of this Catholic Church—these Calvinist Catholics—heretics to join the Catholic Church, and they were compelled to join the Catholic Creed.

There arose still another difficulty and dispute as to what was the true Catholic doctrine, and this brought the Council of Trent, to decide what was to be declared the true Catholic doctrine. This was soon completed, and the Council of Trent established, Arianism as the true Catholic doctrine. This was followed by another empire, who, by a council, reestablishing Trinitarianism of the true Catholic doctrine. Thus one ruler and council decided one way, and another ruler decided another way, as to what was the true faith of this State-established Christian religion, controversy after controversy of all the power of this world to establish the fountain of faith by earthly governments and human power instead of the word of God through it, the Lord Jesus Christ, the power of God. Thus on every line of inquiry had and adjudicated for the people at every step on the way up to the decision.

Now, then, old controversies will be renewed. The struggle to hold that field— the right to fight so as to what is the real true Christianity, Catholics or Protestants, Trinitarianism or Unitarianism, old controversies or new, Calvinism or Arminianism. These old controversies have not been abandoned, they have been hushed for a long time. They have covered up, but they will break forth, and the explosion will have in it honorable theories that have no truth in them. The world will then see what they will be, worlds and worlds will be astonished; the world will simply simulating disputes to which way the one who opposes all civil power, to force those who oppose them, and thus on they will go by all civil power, just as is our day and let men do as they think or believe. “Old controversies now apparently at rest, will be revived. And also new controversies, also irreversible revelations of false science, doctrines, principles, doubts, shall at once take their place.”

Now all will see this: and now, and some will continue, and there it is. “DISTANT AS IT MAY BE TAKE PLACE FAIRLY EARLY.” It is not first time to believe it. It is not first time to believe it.—

I want to ask that all shall study this. I hope you will.
