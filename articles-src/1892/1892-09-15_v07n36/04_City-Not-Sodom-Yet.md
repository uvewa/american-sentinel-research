# City Not Sodom Yet.

“Holloway” has stated the facts just as shown him by visits to California and correspondence in the *California Christian Truth*, he says, compels him to say that “there seems to be no great Sunday in this city.” Sunday work and Sunday business instead of being on the increase in that State are on the decrease even in the largest cities. The drift is in the direction of a more general rest upon that day. We do not say that it is due to a growing religious conviction; but we incline to the opinion that it is right in the line with the general tendency of the times, which is toward shorter hours and more time off for recreation, a tendency the world over.

The facts show that civil law is not necessary to secure the observance of one weekly rest day. And that this conclusion is correct even the *Examiner* has virtually admitted something over two years ago. A writer from one of the leading cities in this country in this paper said:

> a few large firms in the same lines of business had tried closing their doors on Sunday mornings and it had never been until a scandal made themselves prominent. In conjunction with public sentiment they had found it necessary to close up their offices on Sundays as before, and so the old holiday became assured as a matter of custom.

This was said in an effort to show that Sunday laws are necessary; but instead of proving the necessity of Sunday laws, it really proves quite the contrary. If it required rather than, to make Sunday a holiday, but to restrict all forms of labor.
