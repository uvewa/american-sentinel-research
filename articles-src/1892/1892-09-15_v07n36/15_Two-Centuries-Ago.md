## Two Centuries Ago.

Two centuries ago the law of Plymouth, Massachusetts, required all parents to have their children baptized. There was certainly in itself no real wrong in putting a few drops of water on the head of an infant, and it could do the child no harm. But the Baptists refused obedience to the law because they could not conscientiously do that which the law required. They did not so understand baptism, and in their view to sprinkle infants and call it baptism, or to do it as a religious ceremony, or to acknowledge faith in by doing it, when they had no such faith, would have been wicked. They therefore suffered fines, imprisonment, banishment, and even death rather than yield their consciences into the keeping of the State.
