## The American Political System.

It was declared to be the opinion of this Congress that human laws cannot make that right which is clearly wrong, nor is it the least among the religious combinations to effect, or purpose to be found on an examination of this subject. There exists at the present time in this country one of the most dangerous combinations the world ever saw, and still a million of people are banded together for a political object. We are evidently entering a period of political and religious agitation, and a careful study of the principles which underlie the American political system is one of the first duties of the present generation; every citizen should seek to understand the rights of himself and of his fellows; this is intensely un-American and most dangerous to our institutions.

In the development of this American idea of government many important declarations of principle have been made, each an assertion of the principle involved. Of these the following may be cited: In 1776, the New York provincial congress, June 26, 1776 declared,—

Resolved: That neither the parliament of Great Britain, nor any other earthly power or authority, had ought or can of right interfere or interpose in any wise whatever in the religious worship or discipline of the churches.

This was too general to give protection against all classes of religious legislation, since any interference in his religious concerns would certainly be resisted.

The Virginia declaration of rights, adopted June 12, 1776, is still more to the point. In the Constitution of nearly all the States of the American Union this principle is embodied, and most of the provisions are broad. Section 16 reads as follows:—

That religion or the duty we owe to our Creator, and the manner of discharging it can be directed only by reason and conviction, not by force or violence, and therefore all men are equally entitled to the free exercise of religion, according to the dictates of conscience; and that it is the mutual duty of all to practise Christian forbearance, love, and charity towards each other.

Madison said:—

The right of every man to a freedom in the exercise of religion according to the dictates of conscience, is something which every man has a right to enjoy and which nothing but a mere majority is entitled to, nor to remand, or control.

We can more fully realize the force of the State. And who will say that they did not do right? Who does not honor them for their fidelity to principle, and to God? Not one; all honor those faithful men as champions of soul-liberty. Yet, according to judicial decisions even the seemingly ample guarantee of liberty of conscience in the Constitution of Tennessee does not leave the dissenter from the prevailing religion free to disregard laws made in the interest of that religion in all respects. And so in that State, as in some other States, the observers of the seventh day, though permitted by the observer of that day, are required to keep Sunday also; an imitation which makes them look upon the Baptists and their aping of the statute law. There has been in advance of a Massachusetts two centuries ago!

But those who keep the seventh day are not laying requiring others to keep it. They are not disturbed because they are at work while they are resting. They simply ask to be let alone, in the exercise of what is their right to work on a day on which the law requires them to rest at all times that they feel no need for rest or tired or when their sense of duty to God moves them to do so. They see no special legislation in their behalf, and they insist that there should be none in the behalf of others.

But why should observers of the seventh day, or of any day other than Sunday, be permitted to work on Sunday only provided they disturb no one any more than observers of Sunday shall be permitted to work on Saturday only provided they disturb no one? Why should any more protection be thrown around the Sunday keeper than around the man who keeps another day? And if an order for rest to rest at all must rest at the same time, why is it right and just to require the seventh day observer to rest on Sunday so that he shall not disturb the Sunday keeper, why should not the Sunday keeper be required to rest on Saturday so that he may not disturb those who observe the seventh day?
