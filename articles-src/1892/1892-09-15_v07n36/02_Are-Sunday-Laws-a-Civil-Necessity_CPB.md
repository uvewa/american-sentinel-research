"To substitute a weekly holiday for the Sabbath," says the Examiner, of this city, "would be the most cruel wrong that could be done to the man who earns his daily bread by daily labor. The Sabbath is a necessity to him, and whoever attacks it directly, or indirectly undermines it, is the laboring man's enemy, however he disguises himself."

"To substitute a holiday for the Sabbath" would be an impossibility with any man who really keeps a Sabbath; for he would accept no such substitution. But if the individual desires a holiday instead of a Sabbath nothing can prevent him from having it. This our contemporary admits when it says:—

There is a constant tendency towards the increase of unnecessary labor. This is due to the growing custom of making Sunday a holiday—a day for junketing and visiting and merry-making.

So far as this concerns the merry-makers alone, the State has no cause to interfere; it is a moral question for each person to settle with his own conscience and with God. But when the Sunday holiday begins to nullify the Sunday rest day, the State may and should interfere. Its interference should be solely to protect all classes of citizens in their right to a day of rest.

The only question, especially in cities, is, whether Sunday, for that is the day that all the agitation is about, shall be a day of devotion and of refreshing rest, or of comparatively innocent pleasure and physical recreation, or one of vicious idleness. If, as our contemporary intimates ought to be the case, excursions to the country, and all other avenues of pleasure requiring the employment of labor should be closed, the day would be, for the most part, one of vicious idleness with all but the comparatively small minority who regard and keep it as a Sabbath. For if people who are confined to the office, the shop, or the factory, six days are compelled to remain in the city on Sunday, and are not inclined to go to church, they will resort to the saloons or to worse places; and if these are closed, as they never all are, people will resort to dissipation in their own homes; for idleness, unless sanctified by the influences of religion, inevitably breeds vice. Continuing, the Examiner says:—

Consider what would be the lot of vast classes of working people with fifty-two holidays a year and never a day of rest. That one part of the people may play another must work. To cater to the demands of the merry-makers, thousands must find Sunday the most laborious day of the seven, instead of the most restful. This is true already of employees of horse-car and railway and steamboat companies, of hotel and restaurant keepers, of policemen. How long will it be before Sunday labor becomes general if present legal restraints are ignored or repealed?

As a matter of fact there are comparatively few people who do not, or at least who may not, have regular days of rest if they so desire, Railroad and other employees who work on Sunday, are, with few exceptions, given some other day in the week for rest. And it is a rare thing to find a laboring man broken in health from having insufficient time for rest. Improper living, dissipation, unsanitary surroundings, etc., destroy thousands; and yet on the whole while "holidayism" has been supplanting in a measure, at least, the better form of Sunday observance in this country, the average of human life has increased instead of decreased as one would be led to expect that it would have been by the theories of those who assume that stated weekly rest is a physical necessity.

THE PEOPLE WILL TAKE REST.

The fact is that while real regard for sacred things is on the decrease, and while this naturally leads to holidays in instead of Sabbath keeping, the tendency of the times is toward fewer hours of labor and larger opportunities for rest and recreation than formerly, and Sunday laws are not needed to enable the mass of the people to secure the physical benefits to be derived from this state of affairs. And to force upon people the benefits of religion is both improper and impracticable. The people will take all the physical rest that they need and desire, but it is impossible to force upon them the spiritual rest which alone constitutes Sabbath observance.

California has no Sunday law, and for this reason is an excellent illustration of the ability and willingness of the people to regulate for themselves the matter of Sunday rest. The facts as stated by the friends of Sunday themselves show that Sunday observance has actually improved in that State since the repeal of the Sunday law.

In 1885 Rev. W. F. Crafts published his book, "The Sabbath for Man," in which he relates that in order to obtain a world-wide view of Sabbath observance he corresponded with more than two hundred persons residing in nearly every nation of the world. One of the questions which he asked was:—

Where have you seen the best Sabbath observance?

To this, a San Francisco pastor responded:—

Among the Christian people of California.

Mr. Crafts' question and the San Francisco pastor's answer to it are found on page 95 of his book before referred to. On the preceding page occur these words:—

Both laymen and ministers say that even in California the Sabbath is, on the whole, better observed and Christian services better attended than five years ago.

"Five years ago," from the standpoint of 1885, was three years before the repeal of the California Sunday law. Therefore, taking into consideration all that Mr. Crafts said upon this subject, we conclude that according to testimony published in his own book, California had in 1885, when the State had been without a Sunday law for two years, better and more general Sunday observance than it had under a Sunday law.

And that Mr. Crafts meant to convey the idea that there had been a general improvement in California, in the matter of Sunday keeping, is further evident from the fact that the quotations which we have made from his book, are prefaced with the following, set in italics:—

Another element of hope in the United States is that the West has improved in Sabbath observance (except in the largest cities), as the communities have changed from frontier Territories into settled States.

Then, after only four and one-half lines relative to Dakota and Wyoming, follows the statement quoted, that "both laymen and ministers say that even in California the Sabbath is, on the whole, better observed, and Christian services better attended, than five years ago." This Mr. Crafts gives in his book as an encouraging fact. A residence of seven years in California, six years of which were spent in one of the largest cities of the State, justifies the writer in saying that the facts are about as "both laymen and ministers" have stated them. And with this agrees also "Holloway," a correspondent of the New York Observer, who, in a letter in that paper, dated October 2, 1890, said of Sunday in San Francisco:—

True, there are some drawbacks here as there are in all the cities of our land. Attractive as the city is, and in its main features very desirable as a place of residence, yet the good people who have come from the East regret the absence of some things with which they have always been familiar. There are no Sabbath laws in California and no recognition of it on the statute books of the State. Labor of all kinds can be carried on without hindrance, stores may remain open for the transaction of business as on any other day of the week, places of amusement may be open without interference from the authorities, while noisy demonstrations can go on as usual. But while there is the absence of all Sunday laws we must not draw the conclusion that there is no respect paid to the Lord's day. Truth compels us to state the fact that San Francisco is a Sabbath keeping city. The drift is plainly in that direction. The moral sentiment of the people is largely in its favor, and with very rare exceptions we will find as much order and quiet in the streets as in some of our most favored Eastern cities. Those who knew California twenty years ago, now witness a far different order of things. The mass of the people respect and keep the Lord's day. No merchant of any respectability keeps his store open on the Sabbath. The wharves are deserted. The Italian fruit dealers in many localities close up their places of business, and even in the Chinese quarter of the city there is some recognition of the fact that this one day calls for a regard to decency and order, if not for religious reverence.

CIVIL LAW NOT NECESSARY.

"Holloway" has stated the facts just as we know them to exist in California. Truth, he says, compels him to say that "San Francisco is a Sabbath-keeping city." Sunday work and Sunday business instead of being on the increase in that State are on the decrease even in the cities. The drift is in the direction of more general rest upon that day. We do not say that this is due to a growing regard for the day; indeed we incline to the opinion that it is right in line with the general tendency of the times, which is toward shorter hours and more holidays; but that does not alter the case.

The facts show that civil law is not necessary to secure to the working people a weekly rest day. And that this conclusion is correct even the Examiner inadvertently admitted something over two years ago, when of the Saturday half holiday in this city it said:—

For several years, by a concerted action, some few large firms in the same lines of business adopted a system of early closing during the summer, but the practice was by no means general, and it had no sure basis until a statute made Saturday afternoon a legal holiday. When all banks and public offices closed at noon on Saturday, it was found not only practicable to close private offices and shops, but of little use to keep them open, and so the half holiday became assured as a summer institution, and is more and more generally observed with every year.

This was said in an effort to show that Sunday laws are necessary; but instead of proving the necessity of Sunday laws, it proves conclusively that no such laws are required further than to make Sunday a legal holiday. There is no law forbidding work upon Saturday afternoon; the law simply makes Saturday afternoon a legal holiday, and banks, courts, etc., must of necessity suspend business, because business done at that time would not be legal. But to make Sunday dies non would not satisfy Sunday-law advocates. This is exactly the case with Sunday in California. It is a legal holiday, no public business is done and would not be legal if it were done, and yet, Sunday advocates say that California has no Sunday law, and they are demanding that a Sunday law be enacted in that State. The truth is, that that which they want is a statutory recognition of Sunday as a sacred day. And that, they say, would not be religious legislation! C. P. R.
