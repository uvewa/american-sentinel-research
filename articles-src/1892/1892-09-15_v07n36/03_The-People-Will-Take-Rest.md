# The People Will Take Rest.

The fact is that while real regard for the religious observance of the day, with which this naturally leads to holitarians instead of Sabbath-keepers, the tendency of the times is toward fewer hours of labor and more time for rest, recreation and recuperation than formerly, and Sunday laws are not necessary in order to enable the people to secure the physical benefits to be derived from this state of affairs. And so time is upon people the rest that is in fact both irregular and impracticable as necessary for their welfare; they can read that they need and desire, but it is rather, by force upon them, that an ecclesiastical rest which alone constitutes Sabbath observance.

California has no Sunday law, and for years it has afforded an excellent illustration of the ability and willingness of the people to secure for themselves all the rest that they need. So far as the Sunday rest is concerned, the people are doing just as well without a law as they could possibly do with one.

Sunday rest. The facts as stated by the friends of Sunday themselves show that Sunday observance has actually improved in that regard. From the State of Ohio we have the following:

In 1887, Rev. W. F. Crafts published his book, “The Sabbath for Man,” in which he claims that it is misleading to refer to a world-wide view of Sabbath observance as correspondent with more than two hundred years of progression in country after country towards a general Sabbath observance on this day of the world. One of the questions was:

Where have you seen the best Sabbath observance?

To this, a San Francisco pastor returned:

> Among the Christian people of California.

Mr. Crafts’ question and the San Francisco pastor’s reply were not on pages 6 of his book before referred to.

In 1882, a minister from the East visited San Francisco and was surprised to find how well Sunday was observed.

Many laymen and ministers say that even at that date it was better observed in San Francisco than in many eastern cities.

1883, was three years before the repeal of the Sunday law. But it has been improving since then. Taking this fact into consideration all that Mr. Crafts said in 1887, we are forced to conclude that according to testimony published by himself, Sunday observance had been continuously improving in California, the State which leads all others in having no Sunday law, since the State had been without a law for at least eight years, five years after most general Sunday observance than in many eastern cities.

And that Mr. Crafts meant to convey the impression that Sunday had been improved in California, in the matter of observance, is also evident from the fact that the quotations are from what he was *then* writing. In fact, the quotation from page 606, are the very last lines of the book.

Another instance of how in the United States the tendency is to Sunday rest, even better rest in the largest cities, as the cosmatisms of the country naturally tend to become.

Then, after only four one-and-half lines relative to Dakota and Wyoming, follows this positive testimony from Christian workers and ministers say that even in California there are nowhere so well Sundays observed, and Christian service better attended.

Mr. Crafts gives in his book an encouraging account of the condition of Sunday rest in San Francisco, which is confessedly one of the largest cities of the State, justifying the pastor’s answer. He states about as “both laymen and ministers also “McBurney,” a correspondent of Mr. Crafts, “Mr. Crafts states also in that paper, dated October 18, 1886.”

There are some drawbacks here as there are everywhere, but it should be remembered that San Francisco draws its population from a floating class of residents, yet the poor people who have come from all parts of the world. The permanent residents of California are those only who have always been Sabbath-keepers.

As a matter of fact any business that can not be so much so as it can be, that can be carried on without hindrance, store or factory, public or private. In other words, since the repeal of the old Sunday law, California may be open without interference from the author to its being declared the law of the State. We are not drawn to the conclusion that there is no observance of Sunday in California. We do state the fact that San Francisco is a Sabbath observing community, being a typical California city, and with very rare exceptions rest will be taken from choice.
