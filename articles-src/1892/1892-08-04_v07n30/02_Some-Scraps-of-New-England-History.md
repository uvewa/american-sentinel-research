# Some Scraps of New England History.

THE act of 1631 making membership in the church, a test of citizenship had its advocates and its enemies in almost equal other elements. There was considerable number of people not members of the churches, and because of uniform inability could not be admitted. Some of them, they did not want to be admitted, for as membership in the church was compulsory, and those who were not wanted to be, and desired it their right to have a voice in the government, and churches of their own. But the theocrats were not willing that any power should slip through their fingers in any such way as that. They found not only a way to keep them from the distress, but with that to make their lot yet harder; for the stern and following law was enacted:

> It is now found by sad experience, that much trouble and disturbance has happened to the church and civil state by the persons in the church not certified, and that are otherwise unfit thereto, not being rightly behaved gathered.

> It is also in vaine manner ordered that no companies of new or shall henceforth erect or make use of any house for the public worship of God without the allowance of the towns of the greater of the churches in the jurisdiction and approbation of the magistrates.

> And further, it is ordered, that noe person being a member of any church which shall hereafter be gathered without the approbation of the magistrates. A the greater pai of the said churches shall be admitted to the freedom.

Mrs. Hutchinson was condemned, but happily escaped with her life. A few days after her condemnation, the government sent her a warrant banishing her from the territory of Massachusetts. At the first opportunity Mrs. Hutchinson and her friends went to Narragansett Bay, and finally settled on the beautiful island of Rhode Island, where they settled, in 1637 or 1638.

In 1633 a few Independents, under the leadership of Thomas Hooker, a minister, emigrated to the Connecticut Valley; and another company of the colonists, removed from Massachusetts Colony to the valley of the Connecticut, and established there the towns of Springfield, Windsor, and Wethersfield; and January 14, 1639, Springfield preferring to remain in the jurisdiction of Massachusetts, the three remaining towns established a form of government under three "fundamental orders," the preamble of which is as follows:—

> Forasmuch as it hath pleased the Almighty God by the wise disposition of his divine prudence so to order and dispose of things that we the inhabitants and residents of Windsor, Hartford, and Wethersfield are now cohabiting and dwelling in and upon the river of Connecticut and the lands thereunto adjoining; and well knowing where a people are gathered together the word of God requires that to maintain the peace and union of such a people there should be an orderly and decent government established according to God, to order and dispose of the affairs of the people at all seasons as occasion shall require; do therefore associate and conjoin ourselves to be as one public State or Commonwealth; and do for ourselves and our successors and such as shall be adjoined to us at any time hereafter, enter into combination and confederation together, to maintain and preserve the liberty and purity of the gospel of our Lord Jesus which we now profess, as also the discipline of the churches, which according to the truth of the said gospel is now practiced among us; as also in our civil affairs to be guided and governed according to such laws, rules, orders, and decrees as shall be made, ordered, and decreed.
