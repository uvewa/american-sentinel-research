# The National Religion.

there is fully established the doctrine of Church demand of the churches to be obeyed, and of making it for whatever they please and choose. This is but the establishment of a religious despotism. This is precisely what THE AMERICAN SENTINEL has always been saying; was in this question of Sunday legislation. And nothing but the most tyrannical and unjustified despotism can be or can ever come out of it.

UNITED STATES senators have declared it to be "not wise statesmanship" to disregard the demands of the churches; the legislation deciding a religious controversy as to whether Sunday is the Sabbath, or not. Now why shall this Sunday legislation apply only to the World's Fair? and the Spiritualists now work up some agitation. And some issue in the same force by which they demand legislation which will compel the question as to whether or not people are alive when they are dead if there are as many Spiritualists as there are church members; and, of course, it can not be or "wise statesmanship" to disregard their demands. Besides this, there is the complete support of all "the evangelical churches" in the country. And as Senator Quay has grasped the demands of the churches above on this Sunday closing of the World's Fair, which more quickly the same body grant the demands of the same churches upon any topic which happier times bring with them. For such would only be "wise statesmanship," according to the definitions of the term. What issues these questions have in them it is statesmanship only! The truth is, the first act, not statesmanship at all. It is sheer demagogism; and that of the worst sort. These gentlemen should be told that statesmanship does not consist in yielding to unjust demands of the unrighteous demand of religious people in all their arbitrary demands of classes; it consists in sound and healthy public opinion.
