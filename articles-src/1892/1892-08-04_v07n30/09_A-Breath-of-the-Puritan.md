# A "Breath of the Puritan."

"The Sabbath in Puritan New England," is the title of a book by Mr. Alice Earle which has just been published. In the book Mrs. Earle has given extended descriptions of the kind of Sabbath-keeping forced on the people in those days; and the divines are now desirous of returning. One of the most noticeable features of the Puritan Sunday was the "tithing-man." Mrs. Earle describes the tithing-man down the church armed with a long pole, one end of which was provided with a heavy knob, the other with a fox-tail or hare's-foot. He poked the sleepy in the back with the sharp end, tickled the ears and beneath of male sleepers, the soft female ear. The ordinary length of the sermon was about three hours, though some of four or five hours were not unknown. It can readily be seen that this duty of the tithing-man was no sinecure; and for the boys who resented being startled from his nap with a sharp-pointed pole in the back was soundly whipped and stigmatized as "a common sleeper at the public exercise." The tithing-man also had to keep in order the boys. Outside the meeting-house he had charge of a large number of families, and in some cases the tithing-man was responsible for the children learning their catechism. He inspected the anchor. He entered private houses to assure himself that no one stayed at home on the "Sabbath day." He saw that no one else played truant. He served that no one fared sumptuously on Sunday, and it was part of his business also to see that no one fared on "baked meats" that day. In addition to the many duties already enumerated, the tithing man and maidens did not travel in any unseemly manner or at unreasonable hours on the road coming Saturday night. He was empowered to stop all Sunday work. He had to keep "a special eye out" on all backsliders, and make their lives as uncomfortable as possible, that they might promise if threatened by a special malingering; he "warned people out of ye town," their not earning having been noted; him, he had to turn the hour glass on the minister's desk, to mark the weary periods of the long discourses. He was a prominent factor in performing the sundry acts of Puritan Sabbath-keeping.

Many illustrations are given showing the absurd extent to which the Sunday laws were carried and enforced. In 1670 two lovers were punished for "sitting together on the Lord's day under an apple tree in Goodman Chapman's orchard." A Dunstable soldier was fined forty shillings for putting a plaster on a boy as on old that he said was his own on "ye Sabbath." Captain Kemble, a prominent citizen of Boston, in 1656 condemned to two hours in the public stocks for "lewd and unseemly behavior," which consisted in kissing his wife on the door-steps, on his return from a three years' voyage. An English sea captain was "soundly whipped for a like offence. A man who had fallen into the water and was drenched himself limping to church to dry his only suit of clothes, was found guilty and "publicly whipped," for resting Stooling on Sunday was forbidden. To stay away from church; most cumulative perfectly made. A severe Dungeon-like was inflicted on a man who dared say of a common laborer that "he was as good a man as Deacon So and So." To criticise a sermon or the conduct of a minister was punished by fines, confessions and a heavy fine, and so forth.

These practices were not merely incidental; they were a most intemperate sort. Even their ordination services were scenes of unearthly. As seen from the journal of one pastor, "We I. N. long feast. It kept us all merry. A jolly ordination. No of rum were all night at discotion." Not a few were there "ordination hangovers" felt for a considerable ball." And it works found the most astounding features were the amount of "punch" that was put away. At one ordination: "six and one half barrels of cider, twenty-five gallons of wine, one who was present."

Another account says: "Theichurch had eighteen persons each; upon each takes a good-sized silver bowl of toddy was placed, each of which, it is estimated, held about a gill. During the evening theichurch presented their pastors with two and a half barrels of cider, a treasury pastor, besides cheese cakes and a variety of other provisions. It was two o'clock in the morning before the ichurch twenty tenders to wait upon the tables. They had twenty people at first, and then the company broke up. This was in 1785, and the Barbecue spirit. The cost of this minister's ordination, as given by Mrs. Earle in the book was $200.

And yet there are those who are sighing for a "breath of the Puritan," when they enforced Sunday observance!
