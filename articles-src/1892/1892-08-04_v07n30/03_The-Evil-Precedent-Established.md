# The Evil Precedent Established.

[In the House of Representatives, on July 8, at the instance of Mr. Morse of Massachusetts, a member of the Committee on the Columbian Exposition, a letter from Mr. Morse reporting upon the subject of the closing of the World's Fair on Sunday was read. His remarks upon the question will be found below. We give them entire.]

Mr. Chairman, there are other things that I want to speak about while I am on my feet in relation to this subject, more general. I am opposed to the Congress of the United States touching this subject. It is not of the local affairs of the people of Illinois. Illinois already had, and has had for half a century had, on her statute books possibly the most stringent Sunday law of any State in the Union, except Pennsylvania, and the Pennsylvania law and the Illinois law are, I believe, copies of one another.

The Illinois Sunday law of 1841 provides:

> Whoever disturbs the peace and good order of society, by labor or amusement on the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday, shall be fined not exceeding twenty-five dollars. Whoever shall be convicted of horse racing on the first day of the week commonly called Sunday, whoever the peace of any prince committed during the hours of public worship, shall be fined not exceeding twenty-five dollars.

If the penalty is not sufficiently severe to insure perfect order, the Legislature of Illinois and the municipal authorities of Chicago can increase the severity. I believe in Christianity; I believe in the holy Sabbath day, but I do not believe in the Congress of the United States violating its own functions by legislating on that subject.

Mr. Chairman, there are other substantial reasons why Congress should not enact a law forbidding the opening of the Fair on Sunday. If we take control of the Exposition, how can we at the same time avoid the responsibility of its success or failure, or can we refuse appropriations for its maintenance, and I also think it much better to let good Sabbath-keeping people late upon this subject than for Congressional legislation from a religious point of view. Actor, I do not propose to criticize the motives of the gentleman from Pennsylvania, or of the gentleman from Illinois. But I desire to say that I am opposed to any legislation intended to regulate the character or morals or religion of the people of Illinois or of any other State. Such legislation by Congress is strictly prohibited by the Constitution.

Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.

Mr. Livingston.—"The gentleman does not consider the Sunday question as a religious question."

Mr. Wicker, of Alabama.—"Yes, sir; I consider the Sunday question as one involving considerations of religion as well as morals, and I am opposed to legislation on that religion. I regard the keeping of this question as a religious proposition, and I believe that all persons should "remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy," but I insist that it does not matter what is adopted in efforts and whether made to inject religious legislation in Congress, the result is bound to be detrimental to Christianity."

When the Congress of the United States attempts to interfere with the religious rights or customs of the people of any State by undertaking to regulate their observance of Sunday, or to other religious matters, then Congress is trespassing on its trading on unconstitutional ground, and trespassing on grounds that the history of the world shows has been the foundation of great harm to the Church.

It does not make any difference whether it is approached directly or indirectly. Whether we approach the question by positive legislation or by proviso and conditions attached to an appropriation, the result is the same results, and it is establishing a precedent that will ultimately be used against the causes of Christianity, and my judgment is that in this day no more patriotic manifestation of piety by the most devout and most devoted Christians. Their views are that all that says regarding religion should be enacted by local law-making bodies.

A law enacted by the Congress of a country or extended as state, even though with the best intentions, very possibly might at some future period be used to given views of all the people to be affected.

Now in order to show more in order that I can on this subject might be pleasing to the people of Maine and yet not at all to the majority of the people of the State of California, and a law pleasing to both Maine and California might be unsatisfactory to the people of another state in a different section; and therefore I felt that the best plan was to allow the States to make all laws that the local commercial and moral subject.

The man who framed the articles of our fundamental law, which I have read, remembered that the most atrocious violations that have been against the institution of our Saviour Jesus Christ was under regularly organized Sunday laws. They remembered that in 1660 Buryan was sentenced to twelve years in jail for "preaching the gospel and deviating from the national religion" and for disobeying a trary to law," and for "upholding most pernicious meeting and conventicles." They remembered that in the great State of Kentucky, a Kentuckian, and of the men John Waller, Louis Craig, and James Gillis, who were sent to jail, were sent to an attorney, in presenting the case to the court said:—

> May it please your courtships, these men are great disturbers of the peace; they cannot meet a man on the road but they must ram a text of scripture down his throats.

These were the principles that were in mind a few years prior to the adoption of the Constitution of the United States. "Preaching the gospel of the word of God" and "preaching the word of God in violation religion enacted by law-making powers direct and forging on the people had caused wrongs and persecutions that suggested to our forefathers the propriety of incorporating in the very First Amendment, and first paragraph of that amendment, the proviso prohibiting legislation of this character by Congress. I have great confidence in the people of this country, and in the several legislatures; and I do not deem it necessary for Congress to undertake to legislate upon this point.

I do not like the method adopted Congress proposes to take of telling the people that had received money and give it to a rich corporation. This is a tax forced upon the people who pay taxes. The punishment to people is wrong, and effected upon the people who pay taxes.
