In an editorial on the subject of Congress and the World's Fair, the Philadelphia Record says:—

Apart from the immediate question of closing the World's Fair on Sunday, there can be no mistaking the ulterior object of this Sabbatarian crusade. Should it prove successful, the reaction against personal liberty and social progress will not cease until every street car shall have been stopped and every library, academy of arts and museum closed on Sunday. The Sabbatarians have not hesitated to avow that their purpose is to re-establish the puritanical polity of the seventeenth century. In the debate on the Quay amendment Senator Frye, of Maine, passed a eulogy on the puritanical Sabbath and fervently expressed a hope of its speedy restoration in this country. Other senators, in their Sabbatarian zeal, gave utterance to like views. This is the real meaning of bigotry's persistent attack upon the Columbian Exposition.

But very little is known of the real object of this crusade for the enforcement of Sunday sacredness. The Bible reveals its real meaning. Few, though, have given enough thought to the matter, in connection with prophecy, to comprehend their relation. This writer for the Record understands that there is an ulterior purpose and realizes the logical outcome of the movement. He is right. The day will come when all he sees in it will come to pass, and more.
