# At This and At That.

In an editorial on the subject of the World's Fair, the Pittsburg *Dispatch* says:

> But very little is known of the real object of this crusade for the enforcement of "Sunday closing." No body of the church thinks the issue in this article worthy of its real meaning. For, those, though, have means enough to struggle through, their weakness will multiply, in compassing to, their relation. This writer for the Dispatch is one who has always desired to stop, pause and realise the logical outcome of what is being done. The time however will come when all men in it will come clear enough.
