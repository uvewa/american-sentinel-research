# The National Religion and the World's Fair.

THE AMERICAN SENTINEL is in the seventh year of its publication. From the first number that was ever issued, it has been telling the people that in the national Government, through Territorial legislation, the Constitution, there would be established a national religion; and that there would be national Sunday legislation at the demand of the churches.

ALL of this is now done by the United States Supreme Court decision of February 29, 1892, and by Congress, in the act closing the World's Fair on Sunday. In these two governmental actions everything is wrapped up, and only waiting for its development, all that THE SENTINEL has been telling about, and warning against, for seven years.

We knew it was coming. We knew it was inevitable. And all the way we continuously and as earnestly protested, and warned the people, against it. We knew not exactly how this thing would be done; we only knew that it would be done; but we know enough about the evil thing, to be able to recognize it when it should appear, by whatever way it might come.

We have protested against the doing of this great evil; and now we protest against the thing since it is done. We protest against the evil principle itself, and we do protest and shall continue to protest against any and all the consequences of the principle.

We had the right to protest against the establishment of a national religion; and we have the right to protest against this national religion now that it is established. We had the right to disagree with the ecclesiastical combinations which were bending every effort to secure the establishment of a national religion; and now that they have secured exactly what they have been demanding, we still have the same right to disagree with them. We had the right to dissent from the propositions, the doctrines, and the dogmas of this ecclesiastical combination, before the United States Government took their side of the controversy and championed their cause; and we have the same right still. In other words, we have the rights and every right to dissent from any and every religious organization on earth; and when the Government joins a religious organization, then we have the same right still, and the right extends now to that of refusal of obedience to the Government itself, in so far as it is joined to the religious organization.

THE one great object of this great movement to secure governmental recognition of religion was to secure legislation by which Sunday observance could be enforced throughout the Nation, backed up by national power and influence. We protested against their movement, and disputed their right, to use the governmental power for any religious purpose. Now that they have secured it, we still dispute their right to use it. We had the right to dissent from their claim of right to use the Government for any religious purpose; and we still have the right to dissent from their use of the governmental power for this purpose. We had the right to refuse to keep Sunday when it was required by the churches without the aid of the Government; and we have the same right to refuse to keep it when it is required by the churches with the aid of the Government. In other words, governmental aid of churches in enforcing their dogmas and ordinances can not take away any man's right of dissent from those dogmas and ordinances. The Government does right in dissenting from both churches and Government in the things wherein they are allied.

IT was lack of power to coerce the people that they ought to keep Sunday as the Sabbath, that caused the churches to demand the governmental power to aid in compelling the people to do this. Lacking the power to persuade the people, the churches resorted to power to compel the people, to secure the enforcement of the Church. The religious controversy, as to whether Sunday is a sacred day or not, has been going on in the United States longer than has the movement to secure the recognition or declaration of the national Government that it is. Those who demand that Sunday shall be kept, have admitted over and over again that there is no divine command for it. And the effort of these churches to secure the alliance and aid of the Government was an effort to get the national Government to take their side of this controversy. In this effort to get this they have constantly held up the Government's concession to this. In the effort to gain this they have constantly, in all countries, as has been abundantly shown by their own words all these years. If any one is inclined to think they will by any less so, now that they have the governmental backing of every nation that could see what we held, in the gallery of the House, when the first vote was taken by which Congress committed itself to their side of this religious controversy, and could have seen and heard their exultation.

IN this act of closing the World's Fair on Sunday, Congress has distinctly taken sides in a religious controversy. It recognizes this; and the Supreme Court in its decision, have committed the Government of the United States to the decision of a religious controversy. Neither the act of Congress nor the decision of the Supreme Court, will convince the Jew or the Christian, who observes the seventh day of the week as the Sabbath, that Sunday is the Sabbath. No more will the National Reformers be able to convince those with the aid of the power which those acts give, to inflict pains and penalties upon those who disagree with the National Reformers before as without them. We refused before that Sunday should be observed; we refuse now that it should be observed. We refused before to keep Sunday; we refuse now to keep Sunday. We rejected before, the National Reformers' right to use the governmental power to compel men to accept Sunday. Having used the power, we reject now their right to use it.

ALL these years we have denied the right of the Government to enforce the observance of any day or of any other religious rite or institution. We denied this while it was only proposed to legislate in behalf of these things. We protested against Sunday legislation because it is religious legislation, and it has been proposed to legislate in behalf of these things solely for religious reasons; and we deny it still. This has been and is, and will continue to be the position and the protest of THE AMERICAN SENTINEL now and always, the most prominent feature and reason of our protest against Sunday legislation. And as long as the *Sentinel* had maintained this standing only, so long would this law have still been, the prominent feature of our protest. Now, however, the question has changed; and the prominent feature of our charge changes accordingly. Congress has now legislated upon the subject. Congress has now decided and has committed the Government to the decision that Sunday is the Sabbath and shall be observed, not only because it is religious legislation, but because of the additional fact that in this act Congress has committed itself and the Government to one side of a religious controversy.

SUNDAY is not the Sabbath. Sunday is not the Lord's day. Sunday is not in any sense the Christian Sabbath. And the chiefest advocates of this Sunday legislation, the leading members of this religious combination for the observance of Sunday, do not say it. They know that the only authority for it is the authority of the Catholic Church. If they do not know this, and everybody else who will look can see, that the sole authority of the "church" which is authority for Sunday is the authority of the Catholic Church and that alone. And they may likewise know that all Protestants who keep Sunday, simply do homage to the authority of the Catholic Church, and that alone, for there is no command for keeping Sunday in the Bible, whether by church rulers or governments. And therefore in enacting legislation requiring the observance of Sunday, is requiring acquiescence and obedience to an authority of the Catholic Church, for there is no other authority for Sunday observance. It was therefore perfectly fitting that in the discussion in the United States Senate of the Sunday bill in the Senate the chief place in the speech should be given to the views of Catholic Archbishop Ireland; for the authority of the Catholic Church is no authority at all upon Protestants. But the fact is a Papal falsehood. And we refuse to recognize it or yield any respect to it as either true or right.

THE seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord, and Sunday is not the Sabbath. The seventh day is the Lord's day, and Sunday is not. The seventh day is the sacred day and the only sacred day, and Sunday is not at all a sacred day; "for thus saith the Lord:—

> Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work; but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maid-servant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates; for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day, and hallowed it.

> And God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made. Gen. 2:3.

This is the position and the protest of THE AMERICAN SENTINEL now and always.
