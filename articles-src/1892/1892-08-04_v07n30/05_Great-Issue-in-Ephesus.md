# Great Issue in Ephesus.

WHEN Paul preached the gospel in Ephesus, the people, fearful that their craft was in danger of being set at naught, urged on by those who thought their craft was in danger, raised a popular clamor to drive out the apostle, and to encourage themselves, and to try to make it appear as they shouted for hours, "Great is Diana of the Ephesians." Something akin to that sound in the following from Rev. J. Q. Adams of San Francisco, through the *San Francisco Examiner*, of July 17, and from a member of the Baptist Church:—

> My principal objection to the opening of the Fair is a consideration of the fact that in this commercial age and the eagerness in trade which is its chief characteristic, the opening of the Sunday of the World's Fair is the American Sabbath.

That is to say a shout among the great throngs of Sunday will be the contradictory crowds of Christianity churches, and the actual established exhibition of drunkenness, debauchery and all other forms of Sunday wickedness, will say that day allowed. If Sunday is a fact, is itself no proof of itself. It is a religious controversy, and those are the adversaries would never ask it. It is primarily a reassertion of the most daring religious side which leads its adherents to demand for its support the aid of the all civil law.—*Signs of the Times.*
