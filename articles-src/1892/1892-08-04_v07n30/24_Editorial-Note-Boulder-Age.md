AN editorial item in the Age, of Boulder, Mont., expresses, in words which can not be misunderstood, a clear understanding of the import of the action of Congress in reference to Sunday at the World's Fair. The Age says:—

The Senate of the United States has passed a World's Fair appropriation bill, but attached to it a proviso that the Fair must be closed on Sundays. This is a practical recognition of a State Church, and shows how invidiously but how surely the enemies of the liberties of man are gaining control of a Government whose founders declared that there should be no union of Church and State, their experience as well as their study of history having taught them that where Church and State were combined, the Church became the practical ruler, and a most cruel and despotic one at that. The aphorism that "Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty" should be kept constantly in mind by the American people if they would preserve their liberties.

This action of Congress, together with late judicial decisions, make it already too late for anything more than protest. The legal authority of religious dogma in civil affairs is now fully recognized. All who do not uphold this evil thing should protest, as does the Age.
