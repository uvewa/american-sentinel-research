## Overall Assessment

This issue's scan quality is moderate. The main editorial on pages 1-2 is generally readable, but many of the shorter articles and notes on the inner pages (3-7) have areas of significant difficulty. The typeface is small throughout, and some column edges show degradation. A higher-resolution scan would help resolve many of these uncertainties, particularly in the block quotes and lengthy editorial passages.
