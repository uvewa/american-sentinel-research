NOW THAT CONGRESS HAS COMMITTED ITSELF AND THE GOVERNMENT TO THE FALLACY AND THE FALSEHOOD OF SUNDAY SACREDNESS, THE NEXT THING IN ORDER WILL BE FOR IT TO COMMIT ITSELF TO THAT OTHER WIDESPREAD FALLACY AND FALSEHOOD—the immortality of the soul. NOR NEED WE EXPECT IT TO STOP THERE. AND, INDEED, WHY SHOULD WE? HAVING ENTERED THE FIELD OF RELIGIOUS CONTROVERSY, AND TAKEN SIDES IN ONE POINT OF DOGMA, WHY NOT GO THE WHOLE COURSE? NOR IS IT SUFFICIENT TO ASK, WHY SHALL IT NOT DO IT? THE REAL QUESTION IS NOW, HOW CAN IT POSSIBLY KEEP FROM DOING IT?
