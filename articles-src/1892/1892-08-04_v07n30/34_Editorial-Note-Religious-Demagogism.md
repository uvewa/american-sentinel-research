THE INFLUENCE OF THIS RELIGIOUS DEMAGOGISM IN THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES HAS BEEN SHOWN during this session in the passage of the proviso for the Sunday closing of the World's Fair; in the confirmation of an ordinance for the punishment of profanity in the District of Columbia; and by a favorable decision upon the Sunday ice bill for the District by the House and District Committee of the Senate. The Supreme Court has decreed this to be a Christian Nation. Will the citizens of the United States be invested with natural immortality by decree of the Court or by act of Congress.
