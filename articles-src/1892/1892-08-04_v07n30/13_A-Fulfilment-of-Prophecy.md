# A Fulfilment of Prophecy.

THROUGH the office of the National Religious Liberty Association, in passing the proviso for the Sunday closing of the World's Fair in the State, the *Times*, of Oakland, Cal., particularly notes:—

That the amendment of Senator Quay was accepted by the Senate is a matter which is a matter of indescribable significance: its scope being immense, and its consequences are prophecy triumphant. It was fitting that such an important the passage of this measure. The mandater of whose reputation has received the whole nation; that is, with almost every crisis, and which together with almost every crisis which circles around the passage of something truly momentous. And in this legislation, Senators Morgan and Harris called for an immediate vote on a national Sunday law, and in taking on this particular phase, if not opposed, I find against them. No wonder that when the vote was taken on the Quay Sunday closing amendment, Senators Morgan and Harris called for and religions experimental methods that Sunday laws are a remnant of that spirit which for centuries held sway over body and soul; these things must come, and were come. The *Signs* does not even suggest that such laws are to be desired; it publishes the fact and calls upon others not to minimize of that spirit now controlling our legislative bodies—a spirit growing upon the world.

This is an accurate view of the matter. As we forcibly said here, the vital question is, Shall the Fair be open or shall it be closed? Whether Congress shall go beyond the restriction of the United States so beyond the restriction of the Constitution and outside the legitimate limits of civil legislation to establish a union of religion and the State? It is a fact to be deeply regretted that Congress has in earnest protest. The advocates of the legislation all along have manifestly lacked either the intelligence or the candor to state squarely the issue involved. Indeed the acknowledgment of even the existence of such a question would be fatal to their views. They dare not permit its consideration.
