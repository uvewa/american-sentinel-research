# The Church in Politics.

The following, clipped from the Pittsburg *Dispatch*, of July 16, is an extract from a sermon delivered that evening at a church from one of the popular pulpits of the city, and how clear indeed that the action of the senators and members of the United States Senate to religious legislation. And who can foretell but may take advantage of this fact in order to secure legislation in behalf of the church in other matters equally entitled to it.

> Let a law be made to a law be made in behalf of the church in a matter of first importance, as in the Labor Cases.

The contracting paragraph is, however, its most decisive the most instructive:

> The Senate and House conference on the Sunday civil trespass on a tract on the ground of the warm Sabbath petitions of the American people and churchmen and acted "on the earthly civil bill." Their efforts were backed up by the strongest pressure of religious sentiment, and by the petition for some end, some which wore in the nature of appropriate amendments to the original measure.

Such facts as this, and there are many more of the same kind, should serve as a just criticism of the form in which this whole movement is now being conducted. What is the fruit of such as this? "By men shall ye know them."
