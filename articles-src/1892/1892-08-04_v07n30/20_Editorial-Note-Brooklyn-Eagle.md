THE Brooklyn Eagle very properly thinks that, "It does not fall within the function of Congress to make Sabbatarian ordinances for the government of any State, or for any part of the community comprising the State. If the Managers of the Exposition can consistently call on Congress for the desired aid, they are entitled to have it, without submitting to conditions which involve the religious or conscientious scruples of anybody."
