# Look on This, and Then on This.

The Pittsburg *Times*, of July 18, contains two finely contrasted items, the one illustrative of a "religious nation," the one laid to express gratification over the action of Congress in the Sunday closing of the World's Fair; and the other a paragraph showing how quickly Congress had fallen below the evident respect for Sunday observance that had become a characteristic of a good portion of that day upon the very sabbath from their labors.

The account of the satisfaction over congressional action, was accomplished thus:—

At the meeting of the Reform Bureau over the Sabbath closing action of Congress in the Sunday closing of the World's Fair there was a general feeling of rejoicing and being beastly. After a few remarks by Peter Beck, the first time a resolution of thanksgiving was offered.

Mr. Crafts first drew a vivid word painting of the church militant and the church triumphant and closing bell, and spoke of the great victories that had been won. He said the Sunday closing bill as one of the great decisive victories in the history of the cause.
