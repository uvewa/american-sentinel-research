When Paul preached the gospel in Ephesus, the people, fearful that their goddess could not take care of herself, urged on by those who thought their craft in danger raised a popular clamor to drive out the apostle, and to encourage themselves; and to try to make it appear so, they shouted for hours, "Great is Diana of the Ephesians!" There is a very similar sound in the following from Rev. J. A. Crugan, Congregationalist, in the San Francisco Examiner, of July 17, and from thousands of others also:—

My principal objection to the opening of the World's Fair on Sunday is that the grandest thing that we have to show to the nations of the Old World is the American Sunday.

It is safe to say that among the great things of Sunday will be the contradictory creeds of Chicago's churches, and the grand exhibition of drunkenness, debauchery, and licentiousness with which Chicago will that day abound. If Sunday is of God, it needs no legal support, and its adherents would never ask it. It is the conscious weakness of its moral and religious side which leads its adherents to demand for its support the aid of statute law.
