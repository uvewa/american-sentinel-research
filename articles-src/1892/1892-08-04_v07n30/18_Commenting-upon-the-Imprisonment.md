# Commenting upon the Imprisonment of Adventists in Tennessee.

COMMENTING upon the imprisonment of Adventists in Tennessee, a correspondent of the *Elmira Apostolic*, a Missouri paper, says: "How long will it be before the State of Tennessee, will be ready to burn men at the stake." She imprisoned them now from forty-five to ninety days simply because they happen to differ as a set of intolerant religious bigots in regard to which day of the week should be observed as the Sabbath. Has not an Israel already bowed above the God of heaven and demands that men run athwart their consciences by the laws of the State in preference to the laws made of the God of theirs. Rome made the same demand under similar pressure—religious intolerance: but some men went to the stake as there were went to prison rather than violate their consciences in regard to the law of God. And so went the three Hebrew children into the fiery furnace, and Daniel into the lion's den. When men put up as ministers of the gospel of Christ and ask for the civil power to enforce any religious institution, we may know that they have not the spirit of Christ, the gentle Shepherd, but are actuated by the same evil spirit that led the Jews to persecute the prophets, crucify the Saviour, and put to death his apostles."

Now that Congress has committed itself and the Government to the fallacy and the falsehood of Sunday sanctioning, the next thing in order will be to find a way to manifest itself to that other widespread fallacy of the "civil Sabbath."

Not now need we expect it to stop there. And, indeed, why should we? Having the field of religious legislation opened up, and taken sides in one point of dogma, the influence of that same field is bound to not go the whole extent? Nor is it sufficient to ask, Why shall it not do it? The real question is, now that it has the principle, how can it possibly keep from doing it?

In the two leading speeches in the United States Senate (those by Hawley and Hiscock), in favor of Sunday closing of the World's Fair, the chief of all the arguments used was that the churches demanded it and it should be granted, because it was "not wise statesmanship" to disregard the demands of so large a number of religious people. This is precisely the doctrine enunciated by United State District Judge Hammond. It may, therefore, now be considered as the established doctrine of the Government of the United States: Consequently, all that remains, is for the churches to demand a thing, and they will surely get it; for they are officially notified that it is "not wise statesmanship" to disregard their demands. This is not Sunday legislation,
