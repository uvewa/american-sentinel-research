UNITED STATES SENATORS have declared it to be "not wise statesmanship" to disregard the demands of the churches for legislation deciding a religious controversy as to whether Sunday is the Sabbath, or not. NOW WHY SHALL NOT THIS PRINCIPLE APPLY IN OTHER CASES? WHY SHALL NOT THE SPIRITUALISTS NOW WORK UP SOME ISSUE BY WHICH THEY CAN DEMAND LEGISLATION WHICH WILL DECIDE THE QUESTION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT PEOPLE ARE ALIVE WHEN THEY ARE DEAD? THERE ARE AS MANY SPIRITUALISTS AS THERE ARE CHURCH MEMBERS; AND, OF COURSE, IT WOULD NOT BE "WISE statesmanship" to disregard their demands. Besides this, THEY WOULD HAVE THE UNANIMOUS AND HEARTY SUPPORT OF ALL "THE EVANGELICAL CHURCHES" IN THE COUNTRY. AND AS CONGRESS HAS GRANTED THE DEMANDS OF THE CHURCHES ALONE ON THIS SUNDAY-SABBATH QUESTION, HOW MUCH MORE WOULD THE SAME BODY GRANT THE DEMANDS OF THE SAME ONES OVER AGAIN WITH LARGELY INCREASED NUMBERS WITH THEM. FOR SUCH WOULD ONLY BE "WISE statesmanship," according to the latest definition of the term. WHAT QUERY IDEAS THESE GENTLEMEN HAVE OF WHAT statesmanship is! THE TRUTH IS THAT IT IS NOT statesmanship at all. IT IS SHEER DEMAGOGISM; AND THAT OF THE WORST SORT. THESE GENTLEMEN SHOULD BE TOLD THAT statesmanship does not pander to the selfish and arbitrary demands of classes; it creates sound and healthy public opinion.
