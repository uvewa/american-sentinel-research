# The Sunday-Closing Question.

THE San Francisco *Examiner* gives a tolerant and a bold to alert interview with clergyman of the city on the subject of the Sunday closing of the fair. One declared that "of course the clergy is at one in this proposition," and as they would have been but for the sensitive utterances of Rev. C. I. M. Wicks of the Post, of Cloverdale, who said:—

The question, after all, is one of Sunday observance. Most Christians will admit that the United States has a civil as well as a religious character. A large class of our citizens hold Sunday widely from a religious standpoint. Holding rigidly to the letter of the fourth commandment, they apply every jot and tittle of it to the Christian Sunday. Their observance of Sunday is strictly and solely ecclesiastical. They have a perfect right to hold their opinions and to practice them. They have, however, no moral right to compel others who do not share those opinions to act as if they did. Another and a larger class of citizens do not mark their Sundays by any religious observations: they regard and observe Sunday simply as a civil holiday. They, like the former class, have perfect rights. They choose to make their own use of the day. They have, however, no moral right to compel others to spend Sunday as they choose to spend their Sunday as a civil holiday. But there is a third, and by far the largest class of citizens, who observe Sunday in both characters, religious and civil; as a holy day and as a holiday. They have no more right than the others to dictate to others how that day is one of recreation of soul and body. They re-create the soul by grateful observance of prescribed religious duties. They re-create the body in whatever decent, healthful, agreeable way they may choose. They, like the others have, a perfect right to do so. They, like the others, have no moral right to enforce their practices upon those who differ with them. This is a free country, and the essence of freedom is the right of private opinion and practice. To open the World's Fair on Sunday is equivalent to a notice put on the door in Sunday opening to enter its gates and particularly to every citizen, any more than the closing on Sunday is, to no slight sense, to compel an observance of the day which a majority of our citizens do not believe in. As no one is under compulsion to go to the Fair on Sunday, so also, no one should be under compulsion not to go. The question of attendance or non-attendance is purely a question of individual conscience. As to the question of opening or closing, it does not believe in denying to two large classes of people the privilege of attending the Fair on Sunday, because a minority, however large and however respectable, wants the gates closed on that day. Beyond this there remains the important consideration of those in ordinary day when they can attend the Fair without a loss in wages; which they ever call to effect, or not offered at all. I am now, as I have been from the first, in favor of opening the Fair on Sunday.

The authorities of San Jose, Cal., are enforcing their new Sunday closing laws.
