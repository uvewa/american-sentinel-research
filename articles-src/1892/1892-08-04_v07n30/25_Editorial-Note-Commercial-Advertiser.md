THE New York Commercial Advertiser said of the action of the Senate in passing the Sunday-closing proviso:—

There was something decidedly cheap and small in the action taken by the Senate yesterday. Receivers of presents have the benefit of an old and wise saw for their guidance. One must not look a gift horse in the mouth. But if it be bad form to scrutinize and weigh a gift under the very eye of the giver, it is not less so to fix limitations upon the uses to which a gift may be put. Even a tramp would question the delicacy of a hint not to expend for drink a piece of silver given to pay for a night's lodging, but the people of the great city of Chicago have been treated in just this shabby fashion by the Senate of the United States. Millions are voted to them. But this munificence is handicapped with the condition that the people of Chicago are not to be trusted to make a seemly use of it. We are willing to help you with your Fair, the Senate says in substance, but we have no intention of giving you a chance to be wicked. You Chicago people and the stranger within your gates should go to church Sunday, and go nowhere else. If you are unwilling to do so, at any rate, you shall not spend the time that good people should spend in listening to sermons in wandering through exhibition halls surveying the triumphs of man in art, science, manufactures. You are not very good, we fear, but the Senate of the United States will not loan your Fair a cent unless you shut it up Sunday.

We do not think it is going too far to say that this attitude of the Senate is in contravention of the spirit, at least, of the Constitution. It can not be denied that it constitutes an intermediary on the part of the State with matters religious. Under the regis of that instrument the Jew, for instance, has every right of conscience possessed by the Christian. Had the Chicago management decided of its own volition to close the doors of the Exposition Sunday and shut out the people, their course would have been regrettable because of its narrowness, its intolerance, and especially because of its discourtesy to the foreign visitors, who during their sojourn amongst us will be, in some sort, the guests of the Nation.

But it is a far more serious matter when the Senate of the United States says to Jews, Seventh-day Baptists, Adventists, and all that innumerable host of people of other denominations or no denomination who have their own views on the Sabbatarian question, that they shall, whether they will or no, how their wills to those of an arrogant minority of their fellow citizens and be compelled to observe Sunday as a Puritan Sabbath. Such a decree, even if made by a majority, would be tyranny. But as the ukase of a minority, it is simply intolerable.

But let the Senate be comforted. Their inopportune piety will extort a hymn of praise from a large and influential body of the Chicago people. Not all of them will grumble. Our Upper House has won the unanimous applause and heartfelt gratitude of every liquor dealer in the city. It is

no secret that every rum seller in Chicago has been holding his breath while this question remained undecided and pulling all available wires to bring about so desirable a consummation. They at any rate are happy, for they now know that all day long throughout every Sunday during the holding of the Fair, their palaces will be crowded by citizens and strangers alike, pouring into their coffers an unbroken stream of silver, of gold, and of greenbacks—money that was designed to swell the receipts of the Fair, but which senatorial piety diverted into a very different channel.

But what a queer chorus of praise will salute the ears of our Solons—a chorus in which the grateful voices of Sabbatarians will mingle with the swelling poems of triumphant dispensers of Bourbon and of rye—with a grim crucifix, obligato, of Mephistopheles, to give color to the score!

These are truthful words, and especially applicable now that the House has followed in the footsteps of the Senate, and Congress has made for the Nation this hypocritical profession of religion.
