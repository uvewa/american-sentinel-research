CIRCUIT JUDGE SWIGGART, of Tennessee, in ordering the Seventh-day Adventists to prison, also ordered that they, "educate their consciences by the laws of Tennessee." And this in the face of the Constitution of Tennessee which plainly declares that "no human authority can in any case whatever interfere with or control the rights of conscience"! And thus again, he who sits to judge men "according to the law," commands these same men "contrary to the law." See the original instance in Acts 23:1-3.
