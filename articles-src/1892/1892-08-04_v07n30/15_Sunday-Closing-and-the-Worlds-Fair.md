# Sunday Closing and the World's Fair.

Sunday closing becomes a sort of bribe to laborers and country people to attend services on other days. It is strange that temperance reformers are not on this fact.

The sooner the friends of Sunday take it out of "politics" the better will be the results for religion and for Sabbatism.

This confidential idea of "civil rest," and the religious Sabbath, "is just now popular and fashionable, a seeming relief from the charge of attempting the union of Church and State, or of Christianity and the State; under which the friends of Sunday legislation wrote. But the combination is confusedly and demoralizing. It misses its full theoretical ground; be mistaken for a pure civil measure; only works from religious skins, all else is mere civil and secular trickery, and very much as the court has settled this question and the verdict will be carried to all who on a true bill to try the experiment.—*The Sabbath Outlook.*

SATURDAY is not the Sabbath. Sunday is the Lord's day. Sunday is not in any sense. And the chiefest advocates of this Sunday legislation, as to its chiefest advocates. Now of the Sunday closing of the World's Fair are the supreme authority in Chicago with it. The fair is said to be one of "two horns."

In his shop on the "Sabbath," Captain Kemble, a prominent citizen of Boston, in 1656 condemned to two hours in the public stocks for "lewd and unseemly behavior," which consisted in kissing his wife on the door-steps, on his return from a three years' voyage. An English sea captain was "soundly whipped for a like offence. A man who had fallen into the water and was drenched and drenched himself limping to church to dry his only suit of clothes, was found guilty and "publicly whipped," for Stooling on Sunday was forbidden. To stay away from church; most cumulative perfectly made. A severe Dungeon-like was inflicted on a man who dared say of a common laborer that "he was as good as Deacon So and So." To criticise a sermon or the conduct of a minister was punished by fines, confessions and a heavy fine, and so forth.

But very little is known of the real object of this crusade for the enforcement of Sunday. Nobody of the church thinks the issue in this article is worthy of its real meaning. For, those, though, have means enough to struggle through, their weakness will multiply, in compassing to, their relation. This writer for the Dispatch is one who has always desired to stop, pause and realise the logical outcome of what is being done. The time however will come when all men in it will come clear enough.

THE New York *Commercial Advertiser* said of the Senate of the United States:

> In the action by the desultory closing act of the Senate, the Senate has furnished an example of how little the leaders of the Senate who sat with their was for their guidance. Than most of the laws of this body are the result of a most careful examination of the duties imposed upon them in the very eye of the giver. It is not has not to its limits. And no one ever found it necessary to legislate in order to give force to it. In the course of the great city of Chicago has been treated in just that manner. But with additional sums offered and taken, the nation has been compromised. And it is handicapped with the condition that the people may not enjoy a sight of the exhibition on the 52 Sundays of the year. Let us repeat what the Senate says in substance, but we have already quoted it:—"We give you the money. Take Chicago people and the stranger within your gates and make Sundays the dullest, dreariest days in the year. Put away all educational interests and give up your Sunday instruction. We shall not spend the time that good people give to church-going or worship, and refuse any kind of instruction, amusement or recreation for soul, in spirit, ministers, furthermore. Let the President of the United States, and the Senators, and let your Piety Fly at Half Mast." We must confess that the closing enactment by the Senate of the United States is the one significant. This attitude of the Senate is in contravention of the spirit and purpose of the American Government, and in conflict with the traditions of the part of the State with matters religious in such form to the utmost degree unpractical the Christian. Had the Christian element been rightly organized they might have kept the Exposition Sunday and shut out the bad elements and so they have thus spoiled their chance of its discovery to be the religious day, they want it. Such is their selfishness that their own stupidity.

But it is a far more serious matter when the Congress of the United States enters upon that broad, Adventism, and said in the course of the address, "The Sunday law is a religious law."
