# Disgraced Sunday Laws.

RECENT despatches from the common jail of Paris, Texas, report the arrest and imprisonment of several citizens, the accompanying editorial comment from a religious contemporary shows the extent to which Sunday laws can be used as an instrument of persecution: "Under the legal method by which to find means of forcing men to be religious, the courts of every State will ultimately be used." The Rochester *Advertiser* speaks, although of the truth, yet seeking to reach the same point from the other side: "All law is restraint. The right of every freeman to go to the Fair or worship the Almighty as he sees proper, is guaranteed to him by the Constitution."

Those intolerant religionists who say that those misguided enthusiasts who are "opposed to all law" and have lost sight entirely of the original purpose and spirit of the Sunday closing law, both in connection with the World's Fair and with the general Sunday-closing agitation, should read letters written from Tennessee by victims of the Sunday law. The facts of that case will go farther to convince with peculiar weight, to ought to come with peculiar weight to those who are thinking of these matters, than any comment upon the subject.

EDITORS AMERICAN SENTINEL: When I see what is now being done, I think of the prophecy of the third angel's message: it has now been in full process of fulfilment, and it has been fulfilled before our eyes, and if we were asleep before, surely it is time that we were awake. As to what W. A. says, as to what we as a people should do, as to what our attitude should be, I say, on the basis of E. M. King's article that so far as Sunday work is concerned, it is work and labor, and I do not deem the worship of any one (and they are many who worship on the seventh day) should be interfered with. We have always observed the Sabbath which we believe to be the seventh day, Saturday, and we have always paid our dues and supported those among us; and to care for the support of our families as far as it is in our power and ability, and that we may do work on Sunday, or rather, as the Bible says, we rest upon Sunday on the day of the week after the seventh day, as the first day of the week or the rest of the week.

The three others contrasts W. N. Lowry, J. H. Allison, and W. R. Burrow respectively.
