COMMENTING upon the imprisonment of Adventists in Tennessee, a correspondent of the Elmira Spectator, a Missouri paper, says: "How long will it be before the State of Tennessee, will be ready to burn men at the stake? She imprisons them now from forty-five to ninety days simply because they happen to differ with a set of intolerant religious bigots in regard to which day of the week should be observed as the Sabbath. She has exalted herself above the God of heaven and demands that men educate their consciences by the laws of the State in preference to the law of the God that created them. Rome made the same demand under similar pressure—religious intolerance; but some men went to the stake as these men went to prison rather than violate their consciences in regard to the law of God. And so went the three Hebrew children into the fiery furnace, and Daniel into the lion's den. When men posing as ministers of the gospel of Christ ask for the civil power to enforce any religious institution, we may know that they have not the spirit of Christ, the gentle Shepherd, but are actuated by the same evil spirit that led the Jews to persecute the prophets, crucify the Saviour, and put to death his disciples."
