# Circuit Judge Snodgrass.

CIRCUIT JUDGE SNODGRASS, of Tennessee, in ordering the Seventh-day Adventist men to prison, also ordered that, "neither make their consciences by the laws of State of Tennessee," and further that the Constitution of Tennessee which plainly states that "no human authority can in any case whatever interfere with or control the rights of conscience." And thus again, the act by which the judges merely "contrary to the law," commands those men of God. For a scriptural instance in Acts 25:1-3.

And the civil laws of the Government of Tennessee and the civil laws of Tennessee of the moral exactions of God, that men shall alienate their consciences by them! For the judge of the righteousness of the citizens of Tennessee by the measure of their subjection to Tennessee statutes, and the admeasure of his standards for the conscientiousness for the consciences of the citizens of that State, who made the laws of Tennessee? The State, or the citizens of the State, or Jehovah? If the State made the law, and the citizens made the State, then the citizens have set up their own sinful selves as the rule of conscience, and are a law unto themselves,— their own rule. If the State, which is a composite body of their creation, run make rules by which their consciences must be educated, then the State is their God, and they are themselves above it, for they have made it.

The difference between the ideas of India and of Tennessee is that the one worship the works of their hands and the other the creations of their wills.

It is as true of the one as it is of the other that they neither know nor understand the true God and the all-reaching justice of his eternal law. Their eyes are shut that they can not see the difference between sin and righteousness, legislated injustice and divine equity. Their hearts are hardened against their fellow-men whom they know not how and worship the god which they have made, the images which they have set up. The images which the King of Babylon made, on the plain of Dura, was no more an idol than is this self-made fiction of peoples' consciences which the State of Tennessee puts in its statute books, and to which it requires that men shall bow. The bowing to the image of brass was idolatry, the bowing to the fiction of law would be no less idolatry, but would be immeasurably worse than the other.
