THE Rochester Advertiser speaks, although not the whole truth, yet nothing but the truth, when it declares that, "The laws of the State of Illinois are the supreme authority in Chicago with regard to Sunday observance, inside as well as outside the Fair grounds, and the Managers of the Fair, under those laws, are the persons who alone have, as they should have, power of discretionary action." The whole truth is that neither the United States, nor the State of Illinois, nor the World's Fair Managers, nor any other human authority, can rightfully have any control over the religious observance of Sunday, or any other day.
