THE political bearing of this Sunday question in Congress, is very clearly shown in the correspondence of the Chicago Tribune, when it said: "It is further urged on the leaders of the House that in the present political conditions, with the German vote drifting away from the Republicans in Illinois and the Northwest, it will be the best party policy for the Democrats to defeat Sunday closing. The reply is the profane one that Congress isn't run for the benefit of Illinois Democrats, and that members from other sections are not going to sacrifice their chances of re-election for the sake of somebody in the West."

That is it, the religio-political boycott has got in its work.
