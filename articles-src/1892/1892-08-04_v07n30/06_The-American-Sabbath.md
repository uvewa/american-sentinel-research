# The American Sabbath.

UNDER this head the *Patriot*, published at Lamoni, Iowa, gave forcible editorial expression to some plain facts as to the present stand upon patriotism and religion in the United States. The *Patriot* says:—

The ending spirit in the move to secure the passage of the Sunday closing bill, by Congress, "may not have become fully conscious of the fact," but we are passing through a crisis in the history of our relation to religious and civil liberty. The combine first in the name which the National Reform Association and others, by which they propose to legally compel all men to observe Sunday as the Christian Sabbath. This denominational dispute, there must either be a formal recognition of religion by the Government, or there will be an abandonment of the struggle. Some people are apparently disappointed when their voice upon this question is not heard; but this is not a universal observance of that day by the Christians of this country, even had it been the practice. The origin of the first day observance has been another one.

That a national convention is forced upon us through the influence and under cover of the dark in using the phrase: "American Sabbath," the following things are to be considered:

1. An American Sabbath can not be set up as a thing; there can be no such thing as an American Sabbath. There can be no English Sabbath, no French Sabbath, no German Sabbath. Neither can there be an American Sunday, as there can be an American President, an American Congress, and an American Constitution; the course of the Government toward its citizens, there can be no such thing as an American Sabbath, because all these of the people of the United States have no more power to make a Sabbath than have all the people of any other nation; because the people of the United States have no more power to make a Sabbath than to create a world and then rest from the labor and declare the elsewhere when it is appointed. To attempt such a thing is the sheerest folly of which any one could be guilty. We have but to look at the historical record, and to look with favor upon it is to look with favor upon despotism.

2. The observance of a Sabbath is not the result of a beastly command, close the law was created by the Almighty himself; but if duly considered, implies the following things: God blessed the Sabbath day. The weekly rest is a sign of God; second, the formal promulgation by the nation of a Sabbath carries with it the responsibility of its enforcement; third, the responsibility of the nation as such. We deny that either of these responsibilities can be maintained upon the religious ground that is proper.

3. The institution of the Sabbath is a divinely appointed rest for the benefit of bears. On the contrary, the most intolerant persecution that has ever existed of people that people has ever adopted, formally and legally, and it requires the observance of a day claimed by them to be sacred; has been enacted by religious authority whatever, even going so far as to prohibit the application, has been characterized by tyranny over the conscience. Mohammedans and Buddhists, Israelites and Christians alike, follow their own ordinances, and being especially forbidden to do so, to force such observance, by law, or otherwise, by earthly power—is to antagonize the rights of the truth as the Sabbath of the Lord, and furthermore as they have so well demonstrated is intolerance.

These are statements of truths which are patent. Congressmen do not even profess to read them and they may not yet be convinced, but we trust they still are not beyond the reach, if of native birth, would, unassisted, teach themselves to respect the sacred and inviolable character of sacred things. Then, will they permit their names to go down as an obstacle to legal and all human and religious subjects? Political religion always brings ruin. The question is, how long before intolerance will rule the country?
