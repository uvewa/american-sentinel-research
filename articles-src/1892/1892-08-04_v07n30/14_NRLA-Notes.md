# National Religious Liberty Association.

THE Park Board has signified its intention to enforce the opening of Museum of Natural History in Manhattan Square, this city, on Sundays.

THE Lake Michigan Chautauqua Assembly puts into a Sunday edition of the Chautauqua, and a very meeting with the displacing of the religious press convention.

THE New York *Herald* says:—"If Congress wishes to tell the Fair Directors that it expects them to carry out the obnoxious provision, and make the Fair a dismal bore on Sundays, let it do so with all boldness."

THE Brooklyn *Citizen* says the Sunday closing provision in the World's Fair appropriation is an insult to the intelligence of the people, and we have added, as well, that congressmen have also added Sunday to themselves.

THE International Sunday Association has recently held a general gathering at Muskegon, on Sunday. They have there a contest between themselves as the liberal Lutherans and idea of Sunday was on, and the Puritans strict observances.

THE New York *Herald* points out the fact that the Sunday closing provision will virtually prevent the attention the Fair to go to church of the people and religious worshipers, because the very people who would go to church if the Fair were open. What are the people going to do with themselves?

THE Brooklyn *Eagle* very properly thinks that:—"It does not fall within the functions of Congress to include behind these institutions of the governments of any State, or for any part of the community to ask it to do so. Neither any individual nor any position can consistently call on Congress for the purpose of having Congress force their views of religious matters upon others. It is unwise voluntary submitting to conditions which involve the religion of any particular sect."

THE Rochester *Advertiser* speaks, although of the truth, yet seeking but its truth, when it says—"The supreme arbiters of this question are the supreme authority in Chicago with regard to Sunday or holidays, and hold in their hands the Fair grounds, and the Managers of the Fair, under the legal supervision of the courts of Illinois, as they alone have, power of discretionary action." The whole truth, is that neither the United States, nor the State of Illinois, nor the World's Fair Managers, nor any other earthly authority, can rightfully compel any man or set of men to keep the religious observance of that day, or any other day.

THE political bearing of this Sunday question is well set forth in the following from the political columns of the Chicago *Tribune*, when it said:—"It is not in the power of any political party, in the present political condition, with the German and the Northwest, it will be the best party policy for the Democrats to disturb these questions." The reply is the people see that Congress has not run for election or the elections for the amended legislation, from other sections are going to sacrifice their religious convictions or to restore the amended legislation.

That is, the religio-political boycott has got in its deadly work.

THE speeches of senators and congressmen in favor of legislation for Sunday closing of the Fair, do much harm and should not be used against them. They now drop its theory of a civil Sabbath as a civil institution on the side of the argument. Senator Hawley gave them all their cue when he said of
