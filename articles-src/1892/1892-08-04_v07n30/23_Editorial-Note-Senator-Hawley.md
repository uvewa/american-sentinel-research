THE speeches of senators and congressmen in favor of legislation for Sunday closing of the Fair, all go to show that the American Sabbath Union may now drop its theory of a civil Sabbath as a veil for which they have no longer any use. Senator Hawley gave them all their cue when he said of Sunday observance and the laws of the different States for its enforcement, "Everybody knows the foundation. It is founded in religious belief."

Has Senator Hawley, and those who supported the Sunday-closing proviso in the Senate and House, ever heard of the First Amendment to the Constitution?
