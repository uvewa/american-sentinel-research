Two hundred and twenty delegates to the international convention of the Machinists' Association, of North America, adopted at their meeting, in Chicago, May 11, a resolution asking that the Fair be kept open on Sunday. These machinists were from labor organizations in Canada, the United States, and Mexico. Their action is a denial of the interest manifested in their welfare by the Sunday closing people.
