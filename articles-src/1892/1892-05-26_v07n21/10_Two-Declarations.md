# Two Declarations.

Now what will Congress do? In the Methodist Episcopal Conference at Omaha May 14, the recommendation to close the Columbian Exposition instead that the gates be closed on Sunday; at a meeting of the Executive Board of the Knights of Labor at Pittsburgh, yesterday, it was resolved that the Fair shall not be closed on Sunday, as Mr. Powderly says, "in the interest of the laboring man and of the working class."

Two great representative bodies, the Quadrennial Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church and the Executive Board of the Knights of Labor, are not at daggers drawn.
