# The New Method of Petitioning.

This is what the *Christian Statesman* says about what it calls the "new method of petitioning:"—

> The old method of petitioning, by manufacturers' signatures, obtained before as the old one at the convention, is not only slower, but loses many names in the rotation that we are needed, by delivering to any meetings, not by sending to secure names at meetings, lodge rooms, and church assemblies. The result is that before the petition ever reaches Congress the names of the organization, just what sort of people they are is all known.

As intimated by the *Statesman*, the "new method of petitioning is by resolution." "Vote it," says the *Statesman*. "That is, the one who presides at any meeting presents the petition, and as many or as few desire to do so in favor of it. The negative side of the question is either not put at all, or else put in such a way that nobody feels free to vote against the resolution for fear of being misunderstood."

Can it be possible that the *Statesman* admits that the petition as indorsed by the "unanimous" vote of a church, or other society, of so many members, giving the whole membership, that probably not one-half, or even one-third, of that membership voted at all?
