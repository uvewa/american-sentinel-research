## The Test Act

In view of the history of the struggle for religious liberty that has taken place in England and other European countries, it seems almost incredible that there are those who still wish to go back to medieval methods for the advancement of religion and morality; who still think that by formally connecting the name of God with the law of the land, or by making religion in any way a test for civil service, they would be advancing the interests of Christianity. Such a course has again and again been demonstrated a failure. It was tried by the Emperor Constantine, who made the Christian religion the religion of the Roman Empire. The result was that Christianity was not advanced but hypocrites were multiplied, for all unprincipled men who desired favor immediately professed to be Christians; making the last state worse than the first.

But the weakness of this theory was, perhaps, best demonstrated by the English Test Act, passed 1673, in the reign of Charles II. This act decreed that no man should hold any office under government, unless he was a Christian and partook of the Lord's supper. No doubt many at the time considered this an advance step toward making England an ideal Christian nation. What could be more desirable than to have all employees of the nation humble Christian men? Their idea of the result was doubtless very similar to Miss Willard's conception of the Christianized politicians marching up to the polls to worship God. But, alack! how far below these visionary dreams did the actual result prove. Never was a more deplorable state of affairs brought about by act of Parliament. Every honest dissenter was shut out, and every scheming rogue was taken in, and the sublime religion of the Man of Calvary was used as a mere political football. For one hundred and fifty-five long years the English people were afflicted with this iniquitous act, until in 1828 it was repealed.

Lord John Russell, in introducing the motion for repeal, said:—

This state of the law used to provoke the greatest scandal. It used to be the custom in a church in London, for persons to be waiting in a neighboring tavern, and not to enter the church until the service was concluded, when they entered for the purpose of what was termed "qualifying for office." When this was the case, a person belonging to the church used to cry out, "All gentlemen who come to be qualified will be pleased to step up." They did step up to the communion table, and took the sacrament, for the purpose of qualifying themselves to receive office. Such were the consequences of these laws, such the consequences of prostitution of religion to politics, thus making it hateful to man and offensive to God.

Long before, this abominable condition of things had evoked the indignant protest from the poet Cowper:—

Hast thou by statute wrenched from its design
The Saviour's feast, his own bless'd bread and wine,
And made the symbols of atoning grace
An office key, a pick look to a place;
That infidels may make their title good
By an oath dipped in sacramental blood!

Such were the results of making religion a test for office.
