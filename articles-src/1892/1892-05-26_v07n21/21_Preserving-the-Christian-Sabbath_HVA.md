### Preserving the Christian Sabbath.

At the annual convention of the American Sabbath Union held at Des Moines, Iowa, some time ago, this resolution was adopted:—

Realizing that the Sabbath was ordained for man, and that the proper observance of the day would secure to labor the one day of rest in seven, so much needed and so much prized by intelligent labor throughout the entire land, therefore, be it

Resolved, That the President of this American Sabbath Union be authorized and requested to appoint a committee of one or three whose duty it shall be to visit, as far as practicable, all local State and national conventions of labor organizations, and lay before them the aims and work of this Union, extending to them the right hand of fellow, ship, and secure, as far as possible, their co-operation with us in the work of preserving the Christian Sabbath and all its benign influences to our Nation and the world.

The preamble to the resolution conveys the idea that the sole object of the American Sabbath Union is a philanthropic one —to "secure to labor one day of rest in seven." Just as though labor was deprived now of such a privilege, was being robbed of "much prized" rest. But how "much prized" by intelligent labor is this one day of rest in seven? As much as the extra money received for voluntary surrender of it? If so, then why do they surrender it? The fact is, Sunday rest is not so "much prized" by labor in general as are the dollars received instead thereof. And how "much needed"? That depends on whether we consider man's spiritual, physical, or financial needs. His spiritual needs of proper Sabbath observance are great, but what has such a consideration to do with a civil Sabbath rest? Nothing at all. And so far as man's physical needs are concerned, a certain amount of rest every day would do just as well as a rest upon any specific twenty-four hours. Financially considered, the laborer's needs of one day's rest in seven are not much felt by him, however much the American Sabbath Union may think they are needed. At least we seldom hear labor calling for less to do, but rather for more.

If it were really a fact that labor was being robbed of rest and compelled to forego it, we already have ample provision in our national Constitution to remedy such a state of affairs. We refer to the amendment which prohibits slavery and compulsory labor of any kind. In reality, the laboring man is not compelled to work seven days in the week, nor any days at all for that matter, and this is well known by the American Sabbath Union. The plea for the laboring man's rest is merely a cloak to hide ulterior purposes, namely, the exaltation of the Sunday as a Christian institution. This is evident from the body of the resolution, which says the purpose of it all is "preserving the Christian Sabbath." By this they mean Sunday. If there is anything Christian about it, it certainly does not need any preservation that men can give it. I mean God does not need the American Sabbath Union, nor any other union, or any government on earth, to uphold his word. But rather his word upholds men. And there is the point of it. The American Sabbath Union knows that the Sunday has no word of God to uphold it, so they seek to prop the tottering affair on resolutions and appeals to the arm of flesh.

If their design is not the exaltation of Sunday as a religious institution, then why not seek to emancipate the laboring man from unnecessary Tuesday work? But, oh no, Tuesday rest would not fill the empty church pews and contribution boxes. And the American Sabbath Union is not nearly so much interested in the poor laboring man's "much needed" rest as they are in having good attendance at their meetings. And this last can be attained only by "preserving the Christian Sabbath"—Sunday.

Again, where is the relation between the effort "to secure to labor one day of rest in seven" of the preamble, and the preservation of the "Christian Sabbath" of the resolution proper? Well, the whole thing is merely to obtain a "much needed" (?) recognition of Sunday sacredness. This so-called plea for labor is to gain that end. It is a religio-political concern—nothing more, nothing less, consequently it is un-American, and unchristian. For God preserves the Christian religion and institutions in spite of opposition. They are backed by the power of God's word. But Sunday sacredness is not; hence, all these appeals and resolutions to preserve this relic of popery and paganism.
