# The New York Sunday Law.

To the *Washington Star*, a newspaper in Washington City, D. C., a reporter, signing himself "Citizen," writes:—

> Your paper seems to be the medium for reaching the community on matters of public interest. You have already advanced the women's cause considerably. Now, I ask you to advocate the rights of the barbers of Washington. Many of the barber shops are open each morning till nearly noon.

The subject was brought to my notice by a clerk, who goes to a barber shop regularly on Sunday morning; I was told they closed on Sunday mornings after closing the store. Is there not a law against working on Sunday?

To "Citizen's" "question," "Is there not a law requiring clean to be closed?" the answer might be given that the general Sunday law of the Colony, and State, of Maryland, enacted in 1723, and afterward embodied in the laws of the District of Columbia, and which is probably the worst that was ever good law, is in good law now. Congress has never repealed it. It is just now as valid and just as worthy of enforcement as it ever was. If the law affords its permits of tobacco instead of the extreme of the country to not at all validate the law in the least. There are no provisions of the law to be enforced. That. This is the law:—

> Be it enacted, etc., That no person whatsoever shall work or do any bodily labor on the Lord's day, commonly called Sunday, and that no person or persons having children, servants, or slaves, or willingly or wittingly suffer any of them to do any manner of work or labor on the day aforesaid (works of necessity and charity always excepted), nor suffer or permit any children, servants, or slaves, to profane the Lord's day by gaming, fishing, or fowling, or any other unlawful recreation or pastime; and that every person transgressing this act; and being thereof convict by the testimony of one or more witnesses, or confession of the party before any justice of the peace, shall forfeit the sum, or one hundred pounds of tobacco, for each and every such offense.

There are many things about this resolution and the manner of sending of it, with accompanying circumstances, that are worthy of remark.
