BAPTISTS are about the only large denomination that has not had a share of the Government pap, administered through the medium of Indian schools. The Baptists have not only conscientiously refused to ask for or receive any appropriations from public funds for their evangelical enterprises, but energetically oppose all such appropriations in behalf of other religious denominations.
