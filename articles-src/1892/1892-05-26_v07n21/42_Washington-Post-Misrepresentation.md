The statement made by the Washington Post, of May 18, that "on the subject of having the World's Columbian Exposition closed on Sunday, and the sale of intoxicating drinks on the grounds prohibited," "the church associations and the temperance societies on the one side, and the Seventh-day Baptists and liberals on the other, have been striving with each other as to which will pour a larger volume of petitions into the baskets of the Quadro-Centennial Committee for and against these propositions," is, so far as the sale of intoxicants is concerned, as false as it could well be. The petitions of the Seventh-day people, whether Baptists or Adventists, simply ask Congress not to interfere in any way in the matter of Sunday closing. They do not even ask that the Fair shall be kept open on that day, but only that Congress shall not assume the guardianship of a religious institution and establish a dangerous precedent and enter upon a course of religious legislation.
