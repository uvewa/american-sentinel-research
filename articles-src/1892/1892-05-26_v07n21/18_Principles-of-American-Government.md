### Principles of American Government.

The principles of this Government are civil and religious liberty. Man was created to be free—a slave to no man or set of men; free to seek for his own happiness, in his own way, and to choose for himself in matters of conscience. A love for this freedom is planted in every breast. The struggle of the race in its efforts to free itself from the galling chains of tyranny and despotism, is a theme of intense interest. For long ages the "divine right of kings" to rule, was an undisputed question, except by the more daring or ambitious. This tyranny was made more cruel by the union of Church and State—the greatest scourge that ever befell a nation or people. This Church-State rule has caused more bloodshed than all else beside. But desires for freedom can never be quenched in blood.

The Great Charter of England marks an era in this struggle for liberty. Its designs were never fully realized. The greatest reason why it was so, no doubt, was in this Church and State rule. Let the Church be united with the State, in however slight a degree, and true liberty can not exist. When the New World was discovered, the time had come for a new experiment in governmental affairs, viz., a new Government founded upon entirely different and opposite principles—that of a diemion of Church and State—a Government in which the people should govern themselves; a Government where, not the will of one man or any set of men, but the will of the people should be law. A Government where the civil and religious rights of any one man, were to be as sacred as the rights of any other man. In fact a Government where the rights of the minority—be that minority ever so small, should be sacredly guarded. There was no room in the Old World for such a plant. An ocean must lie between, lest its growth be impeded, and its fruit be made imperfect, by the influences that must necessarily cluster around it in the Old World. New territory must be opened, new soil broken. That territory was found in this most favored of all lands. That experiment was tried in this country. This country has emblazoned upon its banners, liberty to all. These foundation stones (civil and religious liberty), have made this Nation the example and wonder of all the world. Our prosperity is unexampled. Our free institutions are without a parallel in the history of nations. But we must not forget that "eternal vigilance is the price of liberty."
