# Interesting Figures.

We published some months since the table showing the various amounts appropriated by the Government for the support of denominational Indian schools from 1887 to 1891 inclusive. The renewed interest in this subject by the action just taken by the Methodist Conference in favor of the proposed Sixteenth Amendment calls for the republication of these figures.
