# History About to Repeat Itself.

THE Methodist General Conference, at its session in Omaha, has considered the World's Columbian Exposition. This subject was brought up in a way which is said: "Better that the Columbian Exposition never be opened than that the gates be opened on Sunday." The committee appeared largely in favor of an appropriation of Government funds for the uses of the Commission, provided the Exposition were to be closed on Sunday; but if the committee asked the Conference to drive the whole weight of its influence to defeat the Fair, only a few clamored for this proposition. The usual appropriation for the Exposition was also considered in the same. Several enthusiastic speeches were made, including others, but on the whole a dissenting voice heard. The committee recommended the sending of telegrams upon this question to the President, and to Congress. The telegrams were sent, and the record of the dispatch to Congress appears thus, in the *Exposition:*—

> The Chair lays before the Senate a telegram in the nature of a petition from the Methodist General Conference was read and referred to the Committee on Quadro-Centennial.

*The Discourse for Fire Prevention.*

> We are instructed to communicate through you to the Senate the desire of the General Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church that the World's Fair be closed on Sunday.*

> *The General Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church, representing over two million three hundred thousand church members, fifty-six thousand preachers, and counting in the Sunday school; the superintendent report is made. The resolution was fully adopted, and Mrs. A. is counted again together for several months. Still this does not end the matter. Mrs. A. is also a member of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, and is counted again in that. Then the State convention adopts a resolution of the denomination of which she is a member agent, again is Mrs. A. counted. Then comes the General Conference, or Assembly, or Synod of the same expression, and again that much counted individual, helps to swell the number of the petition. It is in this way that the new method of petitioning, Michigan one and two million more petitioners than the entire membership of the Society? Is not the whole system a pious fraud?

There are many things about this resolution and the manner of sending of it, with accompanying circumstances, that are worthy of remark. In the first place, the Bible State are almost always "petitions,"—no paper,—even when a few back uses and the sending of their contributions and voice the "petition."

TRUE, as MR. BERTELS has explained before, a petition for the same thing is presented before different organizations having largely the same membership, so that no matter how counted it is counted again. For instance, Mrs. A. is a member of a church. That pastors' a meeting presents a petition, and it is, of course, adopted by unanimous voice of those present. Mrs. A. is not present, but is counted as one of the several hundred members represented in the petition. But Mrs. A. is a teacher in the Sunday school; the superintendent reports it made.

This. It is that of one independent power treating with another. It is the method of diplomats communing between two independent powers. An unjust has been replaced, and laws are power beside the other, officially, and in due form, a comprehensive statement of its ultimatum. It is couched in diplomatic style, and form, and arrangement of thought. With outstretches of courtesy it first grants in much grandeur and lovely speech a preamble a prelude to the statement of the express reasons upon which that approval is conclusive. This treating power represents in its twelve and a half millions of constituent members, the individual President and the Senate of the United States. As it is an expression of this character its approval is necessary to govern political action, and that is to be counted as accepted, all such as must send the third of a new experiment through the diplomatic nerve of the Government. It has been left to the General Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church, in session in Omaha, Neb., to coolly patronize the President and Senate of the United States, and express its approval upon condition, and its desires.

This incident, originating as it has, for a purpose which is a characteristic of a religious body which has stigmatized its connection with civil government, has not yet shown itself under the cover of religion in this country, is most remarkable. It is prophetic. And that of which it is prophetic, is the haunted by readings of history. It is a prophetic of a repetition of history.
