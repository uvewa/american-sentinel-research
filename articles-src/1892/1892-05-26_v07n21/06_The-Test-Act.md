# The Test Act.

In view of the history of the struggle for religious liberty that has taken place in England and other European countries, it seems almost incredible that there are those who still wish to go back to mold a social method for the cultivation of morality and purity; who still think that by formally connecting the name of God with the law of the land, or by making religion in a way a test for civil office, they would be advancing the interests of Christianity. Such a course has again and again failed of any such purpose. It was tried by the Emperor Constantine, when Christianity was made the religion of the Roman Empire. The result was that Christianity was so corrupted, but hypotheses were multiplied, for all unprincipled men who desired favor in dominating professed to be Christians, making bad men worse than the first.

But the weakness of this theory was, in the history of England, demonstrated. The Test Act, passed 1673, in the reign of Charles the Second, provided that no person who held any office under government, and hence was a Christian and patriot citizen, be considered this an advance step toward making an alliance between Church and State. What could be more desirable than to have the Government in the hands of Christian men? Their idea of the result were certainly very similar to Miss Willard's conception of the Christianization of politics—all the people would worship God. But alas! how far below what men hope and desire is the result still proves. Never was a more deplorable state of affairs brought about by any act of Parliament. Every designing schemer shut out, and every scheming rogue can bring a religious test, or pretend to honor, and Man of Calvary was used as a more profound weapon for the injury of the good. Fifty-one long years the English people have suffered with this imposition, and until in 1828 it was repealed.

The mover of the motion for repeal, the motion for repeal, said:—

> The miser of the act was to provoke the greatest scandal. It used to be the custom in a church in which what was called the sacramental test was applied, that as soon as the communion service was concluded, when they retired for the purposes of devotion, the churchwardens seized at its cry out. All gentlemen who have

It shows that while the *Statesman*'s moral crusade, somewhat resembles religious bite, it is not wholly impertinent. True, the *Statesman* does not yet everywhere, already else it would never refer to the *Mail and Express* as a "religious and reform" paper, for it is neither, but it is anything from a text of Scripture to a liquor "ad."

The *Statesman*'s classification of the *Mail and Express* as a "religious and reform" paper, but its own distinction, situated, though doubtless intentional, upon the real religious and reform press.

The *Statesman* is quite welcome to our column in this classification; we will not serve a single purpose to its place for service, and purge it of the patent medicine and and the "tobacco and liquor" advertisement and demand its readers, but that is too much to expect. The *Statesman* must of course live, and if the money to live on comes from advertisements, so must the meat come from advertisements. We can't very well expect from a paper writing in a National Reform fog bank.
