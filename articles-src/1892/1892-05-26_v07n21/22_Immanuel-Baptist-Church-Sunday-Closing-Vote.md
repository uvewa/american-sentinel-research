SUNDAY evening, May 15, Rev. O. P. Gifford, Pastor of the Immanuel Baptist Church, Chicago, presented to his congregation—which upon the occasion numbered about three hundred—a series of resolutions in favor of the Sunday closing of the World's Fair. Mr. Gifford was about to put the question when Dr. J. N. Crouse rose and said that he was strongly opposed to the resolutions. "This is a curious issue," remarked the Doctor, "it is the extreme Sunday observer and the saloon keeper banding together for the closing of the Fair." "I think," continued the Doctor, "that the opening of the Fair will be of great benefit to the workmen from an educational standpoint. I am therefore in favor of the adoption of an amendment to close the machinery Sunday, but that all the art galleries and educational exhibits be opened and the poor and the workmen be admitted free of charge. If we close the Fair Sunday we will have these masses that come here to visit us crowd into the saloons and gambling houses."

Dr. Crouse's remarks showed those present that there were two ways of looking at the question and "throw'd a coldness ober de meetin'." The question was put, but only about one-sixth of the congregation voted for the resolutions, and about a fourth as many voted in the negative. We glean these facts from the Chicago Tribune, of May 16.
