THE Christian Statesman of the 14th inst. has the following:—

THE AMERICAN SENTINEL (Seventh-day Adventist) has at last made a good point against the Christian Statesman, namely, that while it condemns Sunday newspapers it "actually advertises Sunday trains." On reading this, we turned to our advertising columns and were surprised to find in a railroad schedule of trains, in an obscure foot note, "Sunday," meaning Sunday trains. Thanks to "our friends, the enemy." Immediately on the discovery of this inconsistency the directors voted it out.

Will THE SENTINEL and the Investigator, and other papers that copied the criticism, be fair enough to say that the "ad" was put out as soon as our attention was called to its character? We hope THE SENTINEL will continue its good work. We see like notices in the Mail and Express and religious and reform papers. We covet for others the benefits we have received ourselves. There is room for reform in the advertising columns of even the religious papers. We notice, for instance, that the Seventh-day Baptist Recorder advertises a railroad running Sunday trains. Let us polish up the jewel of consistency for each other and learn all we can from our foes. They are oftener truer than our flatterers.

This is encouraging, and, so, gratifying. It shows that while the Statesman's moral cranium somewhat resembles rhinoceros hide, it is not wholly impenetrable. True, the Statesman does not yet see everything clearly else it would never refer to the Mail and Express as a "religious and reform" paper, for it is neither, but is anything from a text of Scripture to a liquor "ad." The Statesman's classification of the "leading evening paper" is a slander, though doubtless unintentional, upon the real religious and reform press.

The Statesman is quite welcome to the slight service which we have rendered it. We would be glad to do it a further service, and purge it of the patent medicine "ads" which at once deface its columns and defraud its readers, but that is too much to expect. The Statesman must of course live, and if the money to live on don't come from subscribers, of course it must come from advertisers. We can't expect very much from a paper living in a National Reform fog bank.
