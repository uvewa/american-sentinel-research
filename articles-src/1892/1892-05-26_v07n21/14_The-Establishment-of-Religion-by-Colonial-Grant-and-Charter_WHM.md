## The Establishment of Religion by Colonial Grant and Charter.

In pursuance of the plan of establishing the Christian religion in Plymouth Colony, which Justice Brewer says animated these colonists, and in addition to the laws already quoted against those who "prophanely swears or curse;" those who "neglect the frequenting the publick worship of God;" the stern decree against the heathen red man who shall fish, or plant, or carry burdens on the Lord's day, or "discharge any gun att anything;" the corporal punishment, at the discretion of the magistrate, of such as deny the Scriptures to be the rule of life; the decree against those who do not furnish due maintenance to their ministers, that it should be in the power of the magistrate "to use such means as may put them upon their duty:" these seem already to furnish a sufficiently substantial foundation upon which to build an establishment of religion. But at every convening of court, however little the gospel may have been advanced, the work of establishing religion goes on. In 1657, June 3, it was decreed:—

WHEREAS. This General Court taking into their serious consideration the great defect that either is, or like to bee in ye several Townships in this jurisdiction for want of an able, Godly Teaching Ministry, and the great prejudice to the scales of many like to ensue; and being desirous according to our duties that such defects should not bee for want of due incorragement to such as either are, or shall bee, employed in see good a works of the Lord for his honour and the good of scales. And in consideration that in asmuch as the several Townships granted by the Government; was that such a companie might bee received as should maintain the publick worships and service of God there, doe, therefore, judge that the whole body Church and towns are mutually engaged to support the same; and therefore order and agree, That whatsoever Township there is, or shall be, an able, Godly teaching Minister, which is approved by this Government, that then four men be chosen by the Inhabitants, or in case of their neglect, chosen by any three or more of the Majestrates, to make an equal, and just proportion upon the estates of the Inhabitants according to their abilities to make up such a convenient maintenance for his comfortable attendance on his work as shall bee agreed upon by the Church in each township, where any is, with the concurrence of the rest of the inhabitants if it may be had, or by the Majestrates aforesaid in case of their apparent neglect and that distress, according as in other just cases provided, bee made upon such as refuse to pay such their proportions which is in justice due. But in case there bee any other way whereby any townships doe or shall agree that may effect the end aforesaid this law not to bee binding to them.

Thus early in the history of this Colony it would seem that not only has there been an establishment of religion, but an established church has been formed as well. Mr. Justice Brewer did not tell us of this. Can it be that the reading of the learned Justice has not proceeded farther than the Mayflower compact in this line of very interesting legal lore? Or did he name the compact as standing for, and representing, all the legislation that grew out of it, and thus personifying the Christianity which should be the birthright, the inheritance, and the guarded possession of the "Christian Nation" to come? To attribute the first would be an unparduable breach of the ethical code,—constructive contempt of court. But, so far as the laws which have been quoted explain, amplify, and enforce the intent of the compact, it would be a still grosser discourtesy to attribute the second supposition to a Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, sitting upon the Supreme Bench in the year 1892, and in possession of all his mental faculties undimmed.

However, the evidence is not yet in, and it is still too early to draw conclusions. This same session of the Plymouth Court enacts again, as follows:—

It is ordered by the Court, That in case any shall bring in any Quaker, rantor, or other notorious bertriques, either by land or water, into any part of this Government, shall forthwith, upon order from any one Majestrate, return them to the place from whence they came, or clear the Government of them on the penalty of paying a fine of twenty shillings for every week that they shall stay in the Government after warnings.

This is a very strange law. It forebodes grave possibilities. There seems to be in it the foreshadowing of a set purpose in the establishment of religion, and the establishing of a church in legal form and authority. It will be necessary to read this old statute book still farther.
