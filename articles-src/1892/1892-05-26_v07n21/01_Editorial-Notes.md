# Editorial Notes.

Two more Adventists have been indicted for Sunday work, this time at Graysville, Tenn. It is probable that the trials of those indicted at Springfield, will have taken place before another number of THE SENTINEL reaches the readers.

\* \* \*

The Law and Order League, of Pittsburgh, Pa., which has been waging war on news-dealers, and carrying on and causing arrests for selling papers on Sunday, has now made information against the proprietors of the *Dispatch*, *Leader*, and *Press*, for working on Sunday.

\* \* \*

SUNDAY, May 13, while Col. Elliot F. Shepard was attending a meeting in Omaha, in the interest of better "Sabbath observance," "rowdy car men" were at work on his new building in New York. It is best just to say, however, that the contractor states that the work was done without Mr. Shepard's knowledge.

\* \* \*

The Methodist General Conference has indorsed the proposed Sixteenth Amendment to the national Constitution, which provides that no State shall—

> use its property or credit, or any money raised by taxation, or authorize either to be used for the purpose of founding, maintaining, or aiding, by appropriation, payment for services, compensation, or otherwise, any church, religious denomination or religious society, or any institution, society or undertaking which is wholly, or in part, under sectarian or ecclesiastical control.

\* \* \*

Of the plain amendment and the attitude of the Methodists toward it, the *Mail and Express* says:—

> The action of the Methodist General Conference, in session at Omaha, in promotion of the effort now being put forth for the protection of our distinctively free American institutions, and the perpetual prohibition by a constitutional amendment of all and all manner appropriation of public funds, is indicative of the general interest in the subject and of the determination of the people to maintain the absolute separation of Church and State, as the essential condition of the perpetuity of both our civil and religious liberties.

This same page shows how manifested that interest and sincerity by passing unanimously a resolution to the effect that no session working under Methodist direction and sanction would in the future allow its moneys to come from the national treasury, nor any money for their educational work among the Indians.

The table published elsewhere, this issue, perhaps most possibly afford a closer to the general and local show afforded by Protestantism to prohibit. The Catholics received $437,599 as against only $94,826 divided between eleven denominations.

Baptists are about the only large denomination that has not got a share of the Government pie, also, of the medium of Indian schools. The Baptists have not only conscientiously refused to ask for or receive any appropriation from public funds for their evangelical enterprises, but energetically oppose all such appropriations in behalf of other religions.

It seems a little singular that just now so many people who have all along insisted there was in this country no danger of a union of Church and State, should suddenly discover not only that such a union existed, but find cause for alarm already arisen. The *Mail and Express* says of the proposed Sixteenth Amendment:—

> It is within the scope of its purpose to protect and conserve whatever gives, in its general, American and monarchist character, the divorcing of Church and State, and the preventing of ecclesiastical domination of any of our public institutions.

Now the *Mail and Express*, by saying "Church and State," imply that they are now connected; and that is the fact; and to a greater extent than the *Mail and Express* realizes. That paper, and the friends of the proposed amendment generally, can not see that sectarian schools supported either in whole or in part by public funds, form a connecting link between the State and the Church; why can not they see that the schools lead to "union"? In the common acceptation of the term, to form such a link? And that any other religious institution supported either by State treasuries or by State influence and power, just as truly unites Church and State as the direct appropriation of State money for the support of sectarian education? Why can not all Protestants see that to be consistent they must not only refuse State aid in the shape of money, creed, or property, but also in the form of laws for the maintenance of distinctively religious institutions?
