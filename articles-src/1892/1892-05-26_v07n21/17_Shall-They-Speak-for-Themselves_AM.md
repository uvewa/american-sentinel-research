### Shall They Speak for Themselves?

Does it not seem strange that after all that we hear nowadays about closing the World's Fair on Sunday, for the benefit of the laboring man, that he does not make himself heard in favor of this movement? And yet it is true that this very large class, in whose interest great effort is ostensibly being made, is making no effort whatever in its own behalf.

Those gentlemen who spoke in favor of Sunday closing, before the Committee on the Columbian Exposition, of the House of Representatives in Congress, recently, expressed a great deal of sympathy for the laboring men, and especially those engaged in railroad business, and those directly connected with the Fair. Rev. Mr. George set up the claim that if the Exposition should be opened on Sunday, it would be necessary for seventy-five or one hundred thousand men to labor on that day, in order to accommodate a much smaller number who might desire to attend; and made a very strong appeal for those enslaved people, claiming that they would be compelled to labor against their will in the matter.

We hear this, or similar statements on all occasions when this question is under discussion by those people who favor congressional action for Sunday closing.

But what are the facts in regard to the position held by the laboring classes on this question. If Mr. George's position is correct we should expect to find the laboring people earnestly demanding a recognition of their rights.

It is an open secret that the American Sabbath Union, through its officers, has embraced every opportunity that presented itself, to endeavor to secure the co-operation of the labor organizations of the country, in its demands, and petitions for Sunday closing.

Labor conventions have been besieged by men, armed with petitions and resolutions; a strong influence has been brought to bear upon them, the power of eloquence has been exhausted, but with little or no result.

The United Order of Trainmen of America is one that it would be natural to suppose would be as deeply interested in this question as any in the land, yet at its last annual convention that organization failed to indorse the petition to Congress for a law to close the Exposition, although strongly urged to do so. What is true of this order, is true of nearly all the great labor organizations of this country.

We are therefore left to conclude that, either this class of American citizens are not capable of realizing their true condition, and hence it becomes necessary to assume paternal control in all matters affecting their well-being, or, that, being men of at least ordinary intelligence, conscious of the liberties secured to them under our free institutions, and of their personal accountability in matters of religion, they will not sacrifice their manly dignity by consenting to special legislation in their behalf. Of the two propositions the latter is greatly to be preferred.

We are not afraid to trust these men with our lives, and the lives of our families, as well as the care of millions of dollars' worth of property. We leave them to make their own contracts with their employers, as to hours of labor, wages etc., and is it a fact that they are not capable of judging as to what is for their own physical good, as well as their spiritual growth by the aid of the moral teaching that is due to all men, at the hands of those men whom our heavenly Father has divinely commissioned to the work of imparting moral instruction? Such an opinion can not for a moment be entertained.
