THE PRESIDENTIAN pastors of western Pennsylvania have pledged themselves to raise funds for the use of the Law and Order League, and have agreed that their congregations shall act as committees for that purpose. When it is understood that these Law and Order Leagues are extra legal organizations, employing a systematized detective and secret agency, existing for the enforcement of religious law mainly, it will be immediately seen that one of the most effective factors in inquisitorial persecution is again actually in operation. Who can fail to see the parallel and appreciate the danger?
