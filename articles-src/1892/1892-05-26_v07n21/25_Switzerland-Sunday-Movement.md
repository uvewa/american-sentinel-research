A CORRESPONDENT of the Review and Herald, writing from Geneva, Switzerland, says: "Switzerland is a great center for the Sunday movement on the European Continent. The International Sunday Association has its seat in Geneva. In most of the cantons there are laws compelling the observance of the day, and the Sunday unions are at every opportunity asking for more rigid laws. After the recent railroad disasters they sent very earnest appeals to the railroad companies asking them to suppress the Sunday tickets (we have Sunday tickets for half the usual fare), as the cars are always packed full on this day."
