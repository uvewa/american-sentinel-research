### A Wrong Supported by Fraud.

The American Sabbath Union boasts of having secured legislative action in the interests of Sunday closing from six State legislatures, among them the Legislature of Kentucky. The writer does not know the nature of the arguments used to secure this action in all these legislatures, but if the means used was similar to that used before the Kentucky House Committee, they should repent instead of boast.

Rev. J. M'Closky Blaney, D.D., of the Presbyterian Church of Frankfort, Ky., appeared before the lower House and made a lengthy argument, which was afterward printed and placed on the desk of each member of the Legislature. On page eleven of this document, the statement is made that "there is nowhere any evidence that the laboring people want the Fair open on Sunday, and much to the contrary."

It is hoped that the gentleman was ignorant of the facts when he made this statement, in which case it would mitigate the sin to one of ignorance. It seems strange, however, that he should know of the single labor organization that had asked for a closed Fair, and be ignorant of the other and larger organizations that have petitioned for the opening. The American Federation of Labor, in annual convention in 1890, voted for an open Fair. This organization numbers five hundred thousand organized workingmen. At their recent convention in Birmingham, Ala., the American Sabbath Union made a strong effort to secure a reversal of this vote, but failed; and instead the convention voted that "in the opinion of the delegates of labor unions here assembled, the rest day should be jealously guarded against the encroachment of those who live upon the labor of others." This Mr. Blaney tortures into a demand for a closed Fair, in the face of the fact that the same organization had asked for an open Fair, and that this which he quotes in favor of Sunday closing was passed by the convention as a substitute for a request for a closed Fair. Again the Knights of Labor in annual convention at Toledo, Ohio, in 1891, were urged to pass the following resolution by a delegation from the World's and National Woman's Christian Temperance Union organizations, in session at the same time in Boston:—

Resolved, That we believe the World's Exposition should be closed to work on Sunday and open to worship; open to the higher pleasures of the intellect and the holy work of human brotherhood, by means of meetings, reformatory and philanthropic, and conferences on vital humanitarian questions, and religious concerts; that we beseech the authorities to give us these.

Instead of passing this resolution the General Assembly adopted the following:

Resolved, That the General Assembly is in favor of the World's Fair being kept open on Sunday for the education of the masses, providing that no employe be compelled to work more than forty-eight hours each week.

And T. V. Powderly, Grand Master Workman of the Knights of Labor, in the Official Journal, of December 3, 1891, says:—

The World's Columbian Exposition should be kept open on Sunday. Those who attend it can have one day in the week for rest, pleasure, recreation, or devotion, just as they please.

This organization numbers three hundred thousand laboring men.

Besides these National organizations, the following local organizations of Chicago, have asked for an open Fair; Local Union American Flint and Glass Workers, United Carpenters' Council, Glaziers' and Glass Cutters' Union, Tin and Sheet Iron Workers, Cigar Makers' Union, Journeymen Tailors' Union, Amalgamated Society of Carpenters and Joiners, Painters' District Council, Central Labor Union, Car Makers' Union, Mechanics' Union.

Inasmuch as all these labor organizations had passed resolutions asking Sunday opening, which had been published to the world through the daily papers, it seems passing strange that the statement could be ignorantly made by a public man, "that there is nowhere any evidence that the laboring people want the Fair open on Sunday, and much to the contrary." As compulsory Sunday observance is wrong, it must needs be maintained by such incorrect and fallacious arguments.
