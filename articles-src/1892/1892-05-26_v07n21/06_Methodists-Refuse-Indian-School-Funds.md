THE same paper remarks that—

the Methodists also manifested their earnestness and sincerity by passing, unanimously, a resolution to the effect that all societies working under Methodist direction and sanction would in the future refuse to receive from the national Government any moneys for their educational work among the Indians.

The table published elsewhere in this paper may possibly afford a clew to the great zeal now shown by Protestants to prohibit these appropriations. For the year 1891, the Catholics received $347,689 as against only $206,268 divided between eleven Protestant institutions.
