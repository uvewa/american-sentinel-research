THE Methodist General Conference, at Omaha, appointed a special committee on the World's Columbian Exposition. This committee brought in a report in which it said: "Better that the Columbian Exposition never be opened than that the gates be opened on Sunday." The committee expressed itself as favoring the appropriation of Government funds for the uses of the Exposition, provided only the gates were to be closed on Sunday, but if the gates were to be opened on Sunday, the committee asked the Conference to throw the whole weight of its influence to defeat further congressional appropriations to the Exposition. These suggestions met with the unanimous favor of the Conference. Several enthusiastic speeches were made supporting them, and there was not a dissenting voice heard. The committee recommended the sending of telegrams upon this question to the President, and to Congress. The telegrams were sent, and the record of the dispatch to Congress appears thus, in the Congressional Record:—

The Chair lays before the Senate a telegram in the form of a petition, which will be read.

The telegram was read and referred to the Committee on the Quadro-Centennial (Select), as follows:

Omaha, Neb., May 10, 1893.

The Honorable the Vice-President,
United States Senate:

We are instructed to communicate through you to the Senate of the United States, the adoption this day of the following resolution:—

"The General Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church, here assembled, representing two and one-half million members and ten million adherents, heartily approves of the Columbian Exposition and the World's Fair appropriation bill now pending before Congress, providing expressly that the appropriation by Congress shall be conditioned on change, the Exposition on Sunday."

Sent by order of the Conference.
THOMAS D. PRAGUE,
Chairman Committee on Columbian Exposition.
JAMES T. EDWARDS,
Secretary of Committee.

There are many things about this resolution and the manner of sending it, with accompanying circumstances, that are worthy of remark. In the first place, the method: It is that of one governing power treating with another. It is the method of diplomatic communication between independent powers. An issue has been reached, and here one power vouchsafes the other, officially, and in due form, an unequivocal statement of its ultimatum. It is couched in diplomatic style, and form, and arrangement of thought. With snare show of courtesy it first grants its most gracious and hearty approval as a prelude to the statement of the express proviso upon which that approval is conditioned. This treating power calmly points to its twelve and a half millions of subjects, and proceeds to dictate to the President and the Senate of the United States, with an appearance of certainty that its approval is necessary to governmental action, and that its condition must be accepted, such as must send the thrill of a new experience through the diplomatic nerve of the Government. It has been left to the General Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church, in session at Omaha, Neb., to coolly patronize the President and Senate of the United States, express its approval upon condition, and dictate its terms.

This incident, originating as it has, for the purpose which it champions, and in a religious body which has signalized its present session with the most remarkable exhibitions of political intrigue and ambition for place and preference which has yet shown itself under the cover of religion in this country, is more than remarkable. It is prophetic. And that of which it is prophetic can be learned by reading history. It is prophetic of a repetition of history.
