# Shall They Speak or Be Still?

Does it not seem just a little after all that we hear nowadays about the laboring man, that he does not stand in much need of a guardian of his own. It is not only a fact that he never asked for a protector of this kind, but the manner in which he is continually being made, is making a very good guardian of himself.

Those gentlemen who spoke in favor of Sunday closing, before the Congress; the two Representatives in Congress, received, these petitions with the petition of the laboring men, and especially those who have made petitions to be more closely connected with the Fair. Rev. does not seem to see that missions and managers are concerned.

yet it conveys an erroneous idea. It is remarkable how impossible it is for this question to attain to an accurate statement in the public prints. In the first place, those who are petitioning that Congress should take no action to close the World's Fair on Sundays are not striving to sustain anything in point of tendency. That, certainly, is not necessary in a matter of principle, and they are simply striving to show those who are petitioning for Sunday closing, is a vital principle involved in this question. This is the chief work in connection with which it is addressed.

Again, these different parties are not arrayed strictly "for and against these propositions," as the statement says. One party is petitioning for positive action closing the Fair. The other party is not asking for positive action, excepting it to be open, they would protest against that as seriously as against the present procedure. The opposition is only petitioning that the Government remain neutral, where, of right and propriety it ought to be neutral, and not asking anything else.

And again, as to the sale of liquor, this the petitioners of the opposition do not touch. While the majority of them compromised, no doubt that the sale of intoxicating liquors on the grounds, as all local management and the law of the place, yet the exceptionable view of abuse into exercise had, of those now petitioning Congress not to take any action as to Sunday closing; it must be that the manufacture and sale of liquor should be, done away entirely, always and everywhere.
