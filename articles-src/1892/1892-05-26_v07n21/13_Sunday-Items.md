# Sunday Items.

SUNDAY evening, May 15, Rev. O. P. Gifford, speaking at a mass meeting in the First Baptist Church in Chicago, thus reviewed about three hundred—a series of resolutions in favor of the Sunday closing of the World's Fair. Mr. Gifford was about to put the question when Rev. Dr. J. N. Crone rose and said that he was strongly opposed to the resolution. "This is a curious issue," remarked the Doctor, "it is like leaven keeping bunched together for the closing of the Fair." "It will be a shame," said the Doctor, "that benefits of the Fair be closed on Sunday."

THOUSANDS of people now visit the World's Fair grounds in Chicago every Sunday. The *Tribune* of that city says that on the 8th inst., "the visitors at Jackson Park numbered over eight thousand," and "it also was stated that few ever had their usual attendance."

The Methodist Conference, at Omaha, is reported as having indorsed the idea of the formation of a National Sabbath Union. Whether it is to take the place of the American Sabbath Union, or is to be a higher degree of that organization, is merely for the purpose of obtaining another organized body to vote often, early, and late, is not stated.

Two hundred and twenty delegates to the international convention of the Christian Sabbath association, of North America, adopted at their meeting, in Chicago, May 11, a resolution asking that the Fair be kept open on Sunday. These resolution was from labor organizations in Canada, the United States, and Mexico. Their action is a denial of the interest manifested in their welfare by the Sunday closing people.

But in this they have overstated the case for Sunday closing. A dispatch in the Detroit *Tribune* of May 11, states that this same convention "put the Sunday plea changes at into a tinsel; and any legislative demands by national means directly aimed at demanding to be unlawful" and that their conscientious scruples.

Greater unconstitutionality, greater power of religious disposition, every Sunday the convention means. It is to overcome the short—the rendering to Ceasar the things which are Ceasar's, in other words, the total separation of Church and State—matters

Sabbath Union, nor any other union, or body, or combination of unions; it is the word. But rather his word toplash men, it is not body solely interested in this question in addressing the Duty to one has ever yet gone so far. And the American Sabbath Union knows that the Sunday closing of the World's Fair will not be produced by truly good performances.

To move the aggressive, bulldozing spirit of active political elements, the petition's really is contrary to expectation. But the exhibition has been made. The highest legislative body in the land has been the recipient of its discommand; the legislature would do well to consider before it is the desire to further a Christian set out purely religious claim that leads to that condition of things and common courtesy.

—"Johnts" is getting to be a crank. He has started a remonstrance against opening any more new streets in his vicinity.

Biggs—How is he interested?

Paris—He got a lot this last bind that they intend to keep them open on Sunday. —*New York Herald.*
