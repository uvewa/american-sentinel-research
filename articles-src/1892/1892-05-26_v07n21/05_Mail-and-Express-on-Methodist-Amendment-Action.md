OF the proposed amendment and the attitude of the Methodists toward it, the Mail and Express says:

The aggressive action of the Methodist General Conference, in session at Omaha, in promotion of the effort now being put forth for the protection of our distinctively free American institutions, and the perpetual prohibition by a constitutional amendment of all sectarian appropriations of public funds, is indicative of the general interest in the subject and of the determination of the people to maintain the absolute separation of Church and State, as the essential condition of the perpetuation of both our civil and religious liberties.
