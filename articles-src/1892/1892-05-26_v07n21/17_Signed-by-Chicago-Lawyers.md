# Signed by Chicago Lawyers.

The following petition from Chicago lawyers has been sent to Congress by the National Religious Liberty Association, relative to the closing of the World's Columbian Exposition:—

*To the Honorable the Senate of the United States in Congress Assembled:*

We, the undersigned citizens of the United States, hereby respectfully, but decidedly, protest against the Congress of the United States Government to a union of religion and the State in the passage of any bill or resolution to close the World's Columbian Exposition on Sundays, or in any other way committing the Government to a union of religion and the State.

Walker, Leopold F. Danberman, Theo. C. Davis, F. L. Cozelling, Herman Link, C. A. Barrer, Michael S. A. Mage, E. A. Phage, M. D.

The National Religious Liberty Association is a Christian organization opposed to Church and State union, but is being aided by various liberal minded people outside the society. Petitions will be circulated among various professions separately.—*Chicago Tribune.*
