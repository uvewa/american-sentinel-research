AGENT McClure, of the Pittsburg Law and Order League, was indicted some weeks ago for perjury. His trial ended on the 12th inst. with this verdict:—

We, the jury, find the defendant, Robert McClure, not guilty of perjury in either count of the indictment, but affix the costs of the case upon him.

This verdict is in effect the same as the Scottish verdict, "Not proven," sometimes rendered in Scotland when the defendant is believed to be guilty but the evidence is technically insufficient for a conviction.

Commenting upon the McClure verdict, the Pittsburg Dispatch of May 13, said:—

The verdict of Not guilty, but must pay the costs, brought in by the jury at the end of the McClure trial establishes a punishment of its own. While the agent of the Law and Order Society escapes the sterner penalties which would have followed a verdict of "Guilty as indicted," the finding of the jury, nevertheless, remains one to which neither he nor his employers can at any time look back with satisfaction. The truth is that the contemptible methods and spirit shown in the petty suits against the newsdealers do not rise above the level of barratry, and command neither the approval nor sympathy of the public.

The following day the same paper said:

The fact is recalled by the sentence in the McClure perjury case, that in past years a similar verdict saddled the costs on the present agent of the Law and Order Society, as a result of his own litigation, and that he refused to pay the penalty put upon him by the verdict. Judge White, however, refused the application for relief from the payment of costs, calling attention to the fact that a man who drew a regular income from prosecutions must take the chances of getting saddled with such cost occasionally. As the same individual was ultimately sent to jail for persisting in his refusal, it may be presumed that he will act with more discretion in the matter of costs this time.

What is to be done with the costs, however, is a matter of little moment beside the prominence of the fact that the alleged maintenance of morality is in the hands of a man who makes a profession of criminal prosecution, and draws an income from the informations which he makes, whether they are well-founded or not. We do not think that professional prosecution for revenue reflects any credit on the maintenance of law and order. While the latter-day Scotch verdict of finding a man not guilty but putting the costs on him may be abstractly criticized, it brings out some facts which the alleged Law and Order organizations will do well to ponder.

It is apparent that public opinion is not so overwhelmingly in favor of the work of the so-called Law and Order League as its friends would have us suppose.
