It seems a little singular that just now so many people who have all along insisted that there was in this country no danger of a union of Church and State, should suddenly discover not only that there is danger, but that to some extent such a union already exists. The Mail and Express says of the proposed Sixteenth Amendment:

It is within the scope of its purpose to protect the common school system, in its purely American and unsectarian character, the divorcing of Church and State, and the preventing of ecclesiastical domination of any of our public institutions.

The words, "the divorcing of Church and State," imply that they are now connected; and that is the fact; and to a greater extent than the Mail and Express realizes. That paper, and the friends of the proposed amendment generally, can see that sectarian schools supported either in whole or in part by public funds, form a connecting link between the State and the Church; why can not they see that the schools need not be "sectarian" in the common acceptation of the term, to form such a link? and that any other religious institution supported either by State money or by State influence and power, just as truly unites Church and State as does the appropriation of State money for the support of sectarian education? Why can not all Protestants see that to be consistent they must not only refuse State aid in the shape of money, credit or property, but also in the form of laws for the maintenance of distinctively religious institutions?
