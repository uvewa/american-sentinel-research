# Preserving the Christian Sabbath.

At the annual convention of the American Sabbath Union held at Des Moines, Iowa, some time ago, this resolution was adopted:—

> Insisting that the Sabbath was ordained for the physical as well as the spiritual needs of man, we labor to secure the day of rest, it must be taken if all labor throughout the realm in land, therefore, is, it will be deprived of the rest of Sunday. This effort is put forth by the organization in the name of a committee of one or three, who asked the laboring people that they shall rest on Sunday, and to secure the laboring men and women their labor and before then, secure and wist and secure all of them, and set as far as practicable, their crises of labor upon that. Sabbath rest shall be granted to all.

Now, to the resolution conveys the idea that the sole object of the American Sabbath Union. That its sole effort and interest—is to "secure to labor one day of rest in seven." And just imagine that this organization, claiming now of such a privilege, was being held in voluntary by its members. But labor "primed" by intelligent labor is this one day of rest in an arena of all the arts, all the money received for voluntary surrender of their right. According to the resolution, the fact is, Sunday rest is not so "much primed" by labor in general but is a religious institution; with interest therein. And "much needed" That depending on one's view of the question. To the labor, or financial needs. His spiritual needs of the honest toilers is are the matter before, but what has such a consideration to do with a civil law enforcing the rest of all. And so far as man's physical needs are concerned, a certain amount of rest every day would do just as well as a rest on any special day's every few hours. Financially considered, the laborer's needs are better served by an open Fair than is felt by him, however much the American Sabbath Union may think they are threatened. At least we neither hear him calling for a six day, but rather for more.

The truth is, that the laboring man is being robbed of rest and compelled to fore-go his privileges, will grow to mean that our national Constitution to remedy such abuses of all others. We refer to this demand.

Again, where is the relation between the "to secure to labor one day of rest in seven" of the preamble, and the preservation of the "Christian Sabbath," of the resolution proper? Well, the whole thing amounts to nothing more, nothing is needed" if recognition of Sunday is sanctioned; the secular plea for labor is to gain that end. It is a religio-political institution, a state body, nothing less, consequently it is un-American, and un-Constitutional. For it preserves the Christian Sabbath for purely political opposition. They are backed by the power to frame civil law, the Church Militant. Note; hence, all these appeals and resolutions are pure and simple, the same material for agitation.
