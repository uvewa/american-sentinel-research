THIS Nation, which, according to the decisions of the judges of the United States Supreme Court, and United States Circuit Court for Tennessee, is a "Christian Nation," has wrapped the robes and broad phylacteries of its exclusive religion about it and refused longer to associate with the Chinamen. Long ago this country ceased to be the "asylum for the oppressed of all nations," now an entire people is excluded. It would be natural to expect that this supposedly heathen nation would apply the doctrine of an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth, right here. But instead of that the Chinese seem to have made use of that "soft answer which turneth away wrath;" to have turned the other cheek; and applied the injunction as to forgiveness even to seventy times seven. Perhaps our "Christian" legislators, law-makers, and National Reformers, who make this Christian Nation, would do well to give some attention to the ethics of heathen China.
