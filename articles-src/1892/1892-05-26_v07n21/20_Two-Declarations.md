### Two Declarations.

Now what will Congress do? In the Methodist Episcopal Conference at Omaha May 11, the Committee report on the Columbian Exposition insisted that the gates be closed on Sunday. At a meeting of the Executive Board of the Knights of Labor at Pittsburg, yesterday, it was insisted that the gates be opened on Sunday, "as Sunday," as Mr. Powderly says, "is the only day of leisure to a large majority of the working class."

Two great representative bodies, the Quadrennial Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church and the Executive Board of the Knights of Labor, are not at daggers point over the question, but they certainly are decidedly antagonistic. Each body represents millions; the opinion of each is undoubtedly sincere. There will be no compromise between them.

Perhaps the question could be best solved by permitting those who want to stay away from the Fair on Sunday to stay away, and those who want to visit it to visit it; for after all, the Fair is to be run with the money of the people, and no one class should be permitted to control it.
