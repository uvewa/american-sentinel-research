# The Statesman "Acknowledges the Corn."

The *Christian Statesman* of the 14th inst. has the following:

> The cause of Christianity in America has at last made a good point against Agnosticism. We have secured an important concession. On reading this, we turned to our editorial page to learn what it was. Was it some new schedule of trains, in an obscure fast note, or some important legal decision? We were not a little surprised to find that the discovery of this uncommonly the directors voted the closing of the World's Exposition on Sunday.

> On turning to our editorial page, and to other papers that copied the criticism, he fact to which this remarkable language referred, as our attention was called to character? We might have supposed from the terms of the announcement, that some great advance in religion and reform papers. We regret for others to present the situation in due prospective, and give the fact its true proportions for it fails to the religious papers. We notice, for instance, that the Agnostics do not seem at all disturbed by a resolution made by a few directors about closing the Fair on Sunday.

This is encouraging, and, oh, so gratifying.
