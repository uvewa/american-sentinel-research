IN the Washington Evening Star, of May 11, a contributor, signing himself "Citizen" has the following:—

Your paper seems to be the medium for reaching the greatest number of people in the District, and you have already advocated the icemera cause. Will you not go still further and include grocery men and their clerks? I am informed that groceries are kept open Sunday mornings till nearly noon.

The subject was brought to my notice by a clerk, who said, in reply to a question, that he could not attend church Sunday morning, as it was too late after closing the store. Is there not a law requiring them to be closed? If not, why not?

To "Citizen's" question, "Is there not a law requiring them to be closed?" the answer might be given that the general law in reference to Sunday labor, in Maryland, enacted in 1723, and afterward embodied in the laws of the District of Columbia, has never been repealed. If it was ever good law, it is good law now. If it was ever worthy of enforcement, it is now just as valid and just as worthy of enforcement as then. That the penalty is affixed in pounds of tobacco instead of the currency of the country does not invalidate the law in the least. There are decisions which cover just such cases as that. This is the law:—

And be it enacted, That no person whatsoever shall work or do any bodily labor on the Lord's day, commonly called Sunday, and that no person having children, servants or slaves, shall command, or willingly or willingly suffer any of them to do any work or labor on the Lord's day, (works of necessity and charity always excepted); nor shall suffer or permit any children, servants, or slaves, to profane the Lord's day by gassing, fishing, fowling, hunting, or unlawful pastimes or recreations; and that every person transgressing this act, and being thereof convict by the oath of one sufficient witness, or confession of the party before a single magistrate, shall forfeit two hundred pounds of tobacco, to be levied and applied as aforesaid.

This law has never formally been repealed. Why has it not been enforced? Because the sound sense of the bench, and bar, and people, has recognized the fact that the law is an anachronism,—that it is an unwarrantable survival of ante-Revolution and ante-Constitution days. It has been dimly recognized heretofore that no legislative body had any right to pass such a law as this, and that, therefore, it never was valid, and consequently never has been, and is not now enforceable. It is just as good a law now as it ever has been since Congress assumed the municipal control of the District of Columbia, and it is just as good a law as any law on that subject which Congress could pass now, for that is unconstitutional, and any similar laws passed now would also be unconstitutional. But the question of "Citizen" would perhaps cover grocery stores only. There is no law for the especial purpose of closing grocery stores on Sunday. Why not? For the same reason that there is, and can be, no enforceable general law on the same subject constitutionally passed and enforced under the authority of Congress. For the same reason the ice bill can not become a law. The general law, which would be the only proper form in which to state the legislation, is outside the sphere of congressional action completely. These individual bills are nothing but dividing that general act into as many separate laws as there are industries, interests, and modes and forms of labor, and diversion, practiced and engaged in throughout the District.

Is it a fact that "Citizen" and other advocates of this impossible legislation are really earnestly desirous of securing legislation which shall ameliorate the condition of those who now work seven days in the week? Why do they not then propose proper legislation to that end? Why do they not propose a bill which shall make six days a week's work and impose a penalty upon any employer that shall permit his employee to labor for him seven days consecutively? leaving the religious observance of a particular day entirely a matter of choice. Why not?
