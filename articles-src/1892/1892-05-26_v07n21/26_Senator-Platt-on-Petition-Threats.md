THE Congressional Record, of May 11, under the title of "Petitions and Memorials," has the following:—

**MR. PLATT.** I present three memorials from churches in the State of Connecticut, remonstrating against any appropriation for the World's Fair unless a guaranty is given that the Fair shall be closed on Sunday and no liquor sold on the premises, with a threat of opposition hereafter to all members of Congress not heeding the demands of the memorialists. I wish to say that I think I am in sympathy with the purpose of the memorialists; I have long ago announced my opinion that the World's Fair ought to be closed on Sunday, but I am not in sympathy with the threat which is contained in the memorials. I do not like to do anything under duress because I am threatened.

Thus, nothing daunted by previous rebuke, the "political blackmail" upon senators and Congressmen continues. The Sun speaks of this incident editorially, at some length, and characterizes it as an abuse of the right of petition, saying, "The idea of incorporating threats in a petition is a novelty, and presents an incongruity almost as great as there would be in putting a menace into a prayer. The late Dr. Lieber in his treatise on Civil Liberty and Self-government, said: 'The right of petition is indeed a necessary consequence of the right of free speech and deliberation, a simple, primitive, and natural right. As a privilege it is not even denied the creature in addressing the Deity.' But in addressing the Deity no one has ever yet gone so far as to mingle threats with his supplications.

The Sunday closing of the World's Fair will not be promoted by such performances."

To see the aggressive, bulldozing spirit of saloon politics emanate from the pastor's study is certainly contrary to expectation. But the exhibition has been made. The highest legislative body in the land has been the recipient of its discourtesies. Our legislators would do well to consider whether it is the desire to further a Christian or an unchristian purpose that leads to this disregard of Christian and common courtesy.
