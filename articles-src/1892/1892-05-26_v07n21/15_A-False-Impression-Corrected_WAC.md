## A False Impression Corrected.

A Gentleman officially connected with the lately organized Battle Creek society under the American Sabbath Union, for the enforcement of Sunday laws, recently stated that the Seventh-day Adventists were circulating petitions to Congress for the opening of the World's Fair on Sunday. In view of the fact that others may be laboring under a like misapprehension, the following statement of facts is given.

Seventh-day Adventists are not now and have not been circulating a petition to Congress or any other legislative assembly, for the opening of the World's Fair on Sunday, neither are they putting forth efforts in any other direction with a view to securing the opening of the Fair on that day. They are not particularly concerned as to whether it shall be opened or closed on Sunday. They are willing that this matter should be left with the commissioners and managers of the great show, for them to decide as in their judgment, in view of all the circumstances connected therewith, they may think best. But they are opposed to Congress or any State legislating upon this question, and saying by law that it must be either the one way or the other. They are opposed to religious legislation, and to the movement on foot to make the closing of the World's Fair on Sunday a rider by which to get Congress committed to that sort of legislation. Against this they are petitioning. It is Sunday legislation, and not Sunday closing, they oppose. That such is the case the petition which they are circulating is herewith presented as evidence:—

We, the undersigned, citizens of the United States, hereby respectfully, but decidedly, protest against the Congress of the United States committing the United States Government to a union of religion and the State in the passage of any bill or resolution to close the World's Columbian Exposition on Sunday, or in any other way committing the Government to a course of religious legislation.

It will be observed that this does not petition that the Fair shall be opened or closed upon Sunday, but that Congress shall not legislate upon this question.

Another document entitled, "Sunday and the World's Fair," of which they have circulated over 500,000 copies, contains the following, which is evidence to the same fact:

It is not the purpose of this leaflet to discuss whether the Fair shall or shall not be closed on Sunday, but to inquire what motive prompts to the making of such a demand.

They believe that Sunday keeping, like the observance of any other religious rite or custom, should stand upon its own merits and not be bolstered up by law, should be voluntary and not compulsory. If there is not enough piety in the church to maintain church institutions, they do not think matters are going to be bettered by compelling men by law to keep up the forms of religion while their hearts are far from it.

Because genuine religion may be a blessing to the individual, the family, and thus indirectly to the State, the State has not for this reason a right to attempt to force men to be religious. Many things which are good if voluntarily performed are a positive curse if forced. Marriage, the apostle Paul says, is honorable in all; but the State would not be in very honorable business if it attempted to force marriage upon mankind. Every person has a civil right to remain in celibacy if he so elect, and so has every individual the same right to choose whether he will keep a Sabbath day or not. "He that regardeth the day regardeth it unto the Lord." "Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind." Such are the statements of Holy Writ.

That there is occasion for petitions of the kind above quoted is evident not only from the fact that Congress has been besieged with petitions asking for legislative enactment to close the Fair on Sunday, but from the further fact that those who are urging this measure are so anxious that Congress shall commit itself to Sunday legislation that they are resorting to boycotting methods, and have backed up their movement with the following intimidating threat which is contained in their petitions:—

Resolved, That we do hereby pledge ourselves and each other that we will from this time, henceforth, refuse to vote for, or support for any office or position of trust, any member of Congress, either senator or representative, who shall vote for any further aid of any kind to the World's Fair except it be on the conditions named in these resolutions.

But in this they have overshot the mark. A Washington dispatch to the Detroit Tribune of May 11, states that this clause "millifies the petition and changes it into a threat; and any legislation procured under duress would be easily demonstrated to be unlawful and therefore unconstitutional."

Every lover of civil liberty, every opposer of religious despotism, every believer in the Christian theory of government—the rendering to Caesar the things which are Caesar's and to God the things that are God's, in other words, the total separation of Church and State—should sign the petition praying Congress not to enter the realm of religious legislation, and thus violate the First Amendment to the Constitution, which says, "Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof."
