# A Wrong Supported by Fraud.

THE American Sabbath Union, after having secured legislative action in the various State and Territorial and other legislatures, among them the Legislature of the United States, among the various; the nature of the arguments used to secure this action in all these legislatures, the motives used was similar to that before the Kentucky House. On one occasion, they should report instead of boot. Rev. A. H. Mullory Blaney, D.D., of the Presbyterian Church of Frankfort, Ky., appeared before the lower House and made a lengthy argument, which was after-printed and placed on the desks of members of the Legislature. On a closer siftings of this demands, the statement is presented; there is in every representation that the laboring people want the Fair closed on Sunday.

It is hoped that the gentlemen were ignorant of the facts when he made this statement, for it would be a serious thing to state the sin in one of ignorance. But this is the way. Those persons who should know of the inside labor organization that had voted for and against a Fair, are large part of the other and larger organizations that the professed for the National Convention. The American Federation of Labor, in annual convention in 1890, voted on this question. This organization numbers one hundred thousand organized workingmen.

A vote was taken on the question of closing the Fair on Sunday. It was for, Aila, the American Sabbath Union obtained the signatures of the delegates of this vote, but failed; and instead the following was offered and adopted, and the delegates of labor unions here assembled, the rest day about Sunday be guarded against the "infraction of labor;" when no boss upon the labor of them. Mr. Blaney iterates into a demand for a closed Fair. In the face of the fact that the same organization had asked for an open Fair, and the ongoing argument, the question in favor of Sunday closing was passed by the convention as a substitute; therefore be it resolved, that the Knights of Labor in annual convention assembled at Indianapolis, Ind., do pass the following resolution by a delegation of representative ladies from the Woman's Christian Temperance Union organization, in session at the same time in Boston:—

> That we believe the World's Exposition should be closed to work on Sunday and open to visitors and for the purpose of educational, refinement of meetings, reformatory and philanthropic.

> That the General Assembly is in favor of the World's Fair at Chicago being so managed that employés be compelled to work more than forty-eight hours a week.

And T. V. Powderly, Grand Master Workman of the Knights of Labor, in

sign the petition praying Congress not to close the result of the passing legislation, and thus violate the First Amendment to the Constitution, which says: "Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof."—*W. A. Colcord, in Druid Advocate.*
