A good many petitions are now being received by the World's Columbian Exposition Commission asking that the great Fair be open on Sunday. A Chicago paper of May 14, gives the number of individual signatures to these petitions as 12,000. This does not include the names secured by the Seventh-day Adventists who have thus far only asked Congress not to legislate upon the question in any way. The signatures to their petitions would probably foot up a good deal more than twelve thousand.
