The Methodist Conference, at Omaha, is reported as having indorsed the idea of the formation of a National Sabbath Union. Whether it is to take the place of the American Sabbath Union, or is to be a higher degree of that organization, or is merely for the purpose of obtaining another organized body to vote often, early, and late, is not stated.
