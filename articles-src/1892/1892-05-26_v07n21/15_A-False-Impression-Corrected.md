# A False Impression Corrected.

That Nation, which, according to the declaration of the Supreme Court of the United States and the United States Circuit Court for Tennessee, is a "Christian Nation," has arranged the order the Columbian Exposition, its existence endured and refused longer to massacre with the Christian character. Sabbath rest, its customs connected with the Christian origin of all nations, "now an entire people," this supposedly heathen nation would apply the principles of the Christian Sabbath to a sore tooth, right here. But instead of that the Chinese Government "went behind the returns," and "snatched away wash;" it has turned the other cheek of affairs. Chinese have tarried the other in its entirely time courses. Perhaps our "Christian" brother statesmen, and church members, and women, who make this Christian Nation, would do well to make a note of this for future reference.

The *Christian Statesman* notes that "the Winthrop than Worker's Central, L. & M., Knights of Labor, Farmer's Alliance and a number of smaller bodies in Illinois to petition for the Sabbath closing of the Fair." Also other bodies in other States. But the Farmer's Alliance at Omaha, are also working out the adoption of resolutions asking that the Fair be opened, and that the Fair should be opened for working people.

These petitions for the platforms of the Farmer's Alliance in several States have adopted platforms, and were circulating petitions to Congress against closing the Fair.

These are some of the petitions which the platform of the Farmer's Alliance of several States have adopted, and they do not meet with the approval of many of the organizations in whose name. In the next place, that Sunday plank has since been dropped from the platform of the Farmer's Alliance in some States, and at Omaha, was voted out of the platform at Ocala. It has not found a place in it at any point since.

However, they had sufficient intelligence to prevent vote this "Sabbath plank" by said incorrect and fallacious statements.

Seventh-day Adventists are not now and never have been in favor of petitioning Congress or any city of other legislative assembly to open the World's Fair, or anything else on Sunday. Neither are they petitioning and circulating the resolution asking that the Fair shall be open, and not to open, the Fair, and neither do they prohibit others from petition. They are not particularly connected with the Farmer's Alliance or any of the other organizations especially connected with the Fair. Rev. does not seem to see that missions and managers of the great denominational enterprises of this State,— in view, in view of all the circumstances surrounding this question.

But they are opposed to Congress or any legislative body, dictating when an institution shall close. They believe that if Congress can be prevailed on to order the closing of the Fair on one day of the week by one set of citizens on the other. They are opposed to the principle as a principle itself the more significant is the present effort on foot to make the closing of the World's Fair on Sunday, a stepping stone to further legislation of the sort—to compel the to compelled to labor against their will.

We hear this, or similar statements of Adventist views are necessary, from the discussion by those people who favor counsel of the National Reform movement.

But what are the facts in regard to the bill? Mr. Grover's position was stated in full. Mr. Grover's position is that of closing the World's Fair on Sunday, and although it is not difficult to see why the laboring people earnestly demanding a recognition are also demanding for Sunday closing.

It is an open secret, that the American Sabbath Union, through its agents, has embraced every opportunity that presented itself, to endeavor to secure the cooperation of the labor organizations of the country, in the demands, and petitions for Sunday closing.

Labor conventions have been besieged at every session with petitions and resolutions; a strong influence has been brought to bear upon them; every resource has been exhausted, but with little or no success.
