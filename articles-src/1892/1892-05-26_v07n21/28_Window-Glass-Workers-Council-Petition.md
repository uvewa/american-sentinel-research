THE Christian Statesman notes that "the Window Glass Worker's Council, L. A. 300, Knights of Labor, representing 6,000 workmen, has authorized its officers to petition for the Sabbath closing of the World's Fair," and says: "This action and that of the Farmer's Alliance at Ocala, are the workingmen's answer to the infidel's and trafficker's argument that the Fair should be opened for workingmen."

The reference to the Sunday plank of the Ocala platform of the Farmer's Alliance is scarcely a happy one, if it is intended to prove by it that the farmers, as a class of workmen, approve of Sunday laws. In the first place, it is very doubtful if that platform met with the approval of many of the actual working farmers of this country; in the next place, that Sunday plank has since been disapproved of by the very ones who spiked it to the tail end of the platform at Ocala. It has not found a place in any official utterance of the party since. Why not? Because they had sufficient intelligence to perceive very soon that religious observances, which are matters of individual choice, have no place in a political platform.
