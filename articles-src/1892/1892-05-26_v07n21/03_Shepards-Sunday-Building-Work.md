SUNDAY, May 15, while Col. Elliott F. Shepard was attending a meeting in Omaha, in the interests of better "Sabbath observance," twenty-six men were working on his new building in New York. It is but just to say, however, that the contractor states that the work was done without Mr. Shepard's knowledge.
