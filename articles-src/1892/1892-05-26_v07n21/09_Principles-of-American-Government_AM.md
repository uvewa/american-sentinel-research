# Principles of American Government.

THE principles of this Government are built upon religious liberty. Man was created to be free—a slave to no man and of means free to seek for his own happiness, to worship or not to worship God, himself in matters of conscience. A love of liberty seems to be implanted in man. The struggle of the race in its efforts to free itself from the political chains of tyranny and despotism, is a theme of intense interest. For long ages the "divine right of kings" to rule, was an undisputed question, except by the more daring or ambitious. This tyranny was made more cruel by the union of Church and State—the greatest scourge that ever befell a nation or people. This Church-State rule has been more terrible than all the plagues that have ever swept the land. But a desire for freedom is found all through the ages.

The Great Charter of England marks an era in the progress of liberty, but the designs were never fully realized. The greatest reason why it was so, is doubtless this Church and State rule. Let the Church be united with the State, it however slight a degree, and true liberty can not exist. When the New World was found there had come for a new experiment in government affairs, and a new Government founded upon entirely different and opposite principles—that it should be the province of the Government to be a government in which the people should govern; to interfere neither with the will of one man or any set of men, but all of the people should be free. A Government where the civil and religious rights of any one man, were to be as sacred as the rights of any other man. In fact, a Government where the rights of

the minority—be that minority ever so small, should be sacredly guarded. There was no room in the Old World for such a plan. At even one or however, but its growth be impeded, and its fruit be most poisonous; by the influences the most necrently disaster around in the Old World. New territory was found, and it seemed to the most favored of all lands.

That experiment was tried in this country. This country has sustained its open the beavers, liberty to all. This foundation stones civil and religious— has risen up before the nations, an object of wonder and wonder of all the world. Our principles of civil and religious liberty are enticements written as without a parallel in the history of nations. But we must not forget that "material vigilance is the price of liberty."

—*Public, a Zenith Tribune.*

We are not afraid to trust these men who are trying, and the lives of our families, as well, at the care of millions of dollars' worth of property. We have them every day, not only as employees, but as employers, as hosts of labor, wage earners, to as hosts of labor, are not capable of judging as to what is for their own good and well being, and yet at the same time they are constantly growing in the art and growth by the aid of the moral teachings that is to be done to tell men, at the hands of these men whom our heavenly Father has divinely commissioned to the work of imparting moral instruction? Such an opinion can not for a moment be entertained.
