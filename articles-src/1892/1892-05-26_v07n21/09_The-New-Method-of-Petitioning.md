# "The New Method of Petitioning."

THIS is what the Christian Statesman says about what it calls the "new method of petitioning":

The old method of petitioning, by miscellaneous signatures, obtained hastily at the door and on the street is not only slower, but more likely to result in mistakes than the new method, by deliberate vote, after explanation and discussion, in citizens' meetings, labor lodges, and church assemblies. The indorsements of organizations also show, by the name of the organization, just what sort of people are favoring the movement.

As intimated by the Statesman, "the new method of petitioning is by deliberate vote." That is, the one who presides at any meeting presents the petition, and as many as desire to do so vote in favor of it. The negative side of the question is either not put at all, or else put in such a way that nobody feels free to vote against the petition. The chairman then certifies that the petition was indorsed by the "unanimous" vote of a church, or other society, of so many members, giving the whole membership, when probably not half were present, and not all present voted. This has occurred many times. Such votes are almost always "unanimous,"—on paper,—even when a few have the courage of their convictions and vote against the "petition."

Then, as THE SENTINEL has explained before, a petition for the same thing is presented before different organizations having largely the same membership, so the same persons are counted again and again. For instance, Mrs. A is a member of a church. The pastor presents the petition, and it is, of course, adopted by unanimous vote—of those present. Mrs. A is not present but is counted as one of the several hundred members represented by the petition. The same lady is also a teacher in the Sunday school; the superintendent presents the petition, which is adopted, and Mrs. A. is counted again together with her several children. But that does not end the matter. Mrs. A is also a member of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, and is counted again in that. Then the State Conference or Association of the denomination of which she is a member meets; again she is counted. Then comes the General Conference, or Assembly, or Synod of the same denomination, and again this much counted individual helps to swell the number of petitioners. Is it any wonder that under the new method of petitioning Michigan and Ohio were enabled to furnish between one and two million more petitioners than the entire population of the two States? Is not the whole system a pious fraud?
