At a recent meeting in Nashville, Tenn., called for the purpose of taking some action upon the question of closing the World's Fair on Sunday, two gentlemen present had the tenacity to vote against the resolutions demanding Sunday closing. As might have been expected they were promptly insulted by the chairman, who prefixes "Rev." to his name. The negative side of the question upon the adoption of Sunday-closing resolutions is put only as a formality.
