THE following petition from Chicago lawyers has been sent to Congress by the National Religious Liberty Association, relative to the closing of the Fair on Sunday:—

To the Honorable the Senate of the United States in Congress Assembled:

We, the undersigned, citizens of the United States, hereby respectfully, but decidedly, protest against the Congress of the United States committing the United States Government to a union of religion and the State in the passage of any bill or resolution to close the World's Columbian Exposition on Sunday, or in any other way committing the Government to a course of religious legislation.

The National Religious Liberty Association is a Christian organization opposed to Church and State union, but is being aided by various liberal minded people outside the society. Petitions will be circulated among various professions separately.
