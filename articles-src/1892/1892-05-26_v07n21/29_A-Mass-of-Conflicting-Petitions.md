THE Washington Post, of May 18, says, in its column of congressional notes, under the sub-head "A Mass of Conflicting Petitions":—

It might appear, if one were to judge by the large number of petitions and remonstrances presented in the Senate yesterday on the subject of having the World's Columbian Exposition closed on Sunday and the sale of intoxicating liquors on the grounds prohibited, that there was no public matter interesting the people in all parts of the country to a degree at all approaching the interest felt in that question. But the church associations and the temperance societies on the one side, and the Seventh-day Baptists and the liberals on the other, have been striving with each other as to which will pour a larger volume of petitions into the baskets of the Quadro Centenial Committee, for and against these propositions. And so, for the last month or two nearly half of the morning hour of the Senate has been taken up in the formal presentation of these petitions, until the thing has become quite monotonous.

While this paragraph is intended to be entirely impartial, and probably was written by one who does not sympathize with those who would have Congress arbitrarily close the World's Fair on Sunday, yet it conveys an erroneous idea. It is remarkable how impossible it is for this question to attain to an accurate statement in the public prints. In the first place, those who are petitioning that Congress should take no action to close the World's Fair on Sunday are not striving to outdo anybody in point of numbers. That, certainly, is not necessary in a matter of principle, and they are simply striving to call the attention of Congress to the fact that there is a vital principle involved in this question. This is a subject in which majorities do not properly rule.

Again, these different parties are not arrayed strictly "for and against these propositions," as the Post says. One party is petitioning for positive action closing the Fair. The other party is not asking for positive action requiring it to be open, they would protest against that as earnestly as against the present proposition. The opposition is only petitioning that the Government remain neutral, where, of right and propriety it ought to be neutral, that and nothing more.

And again, as to the sale of liquor, this the petitions of the opposition do not touch. While the majority of them comprehend, no doubt that this is a matter properly under the jurisdiction of the local management and the law of the place, yet the unqualified view of almost the entire body, of those now petitioning Congress not to take any action on Sunday closing, is that the manufacture and sale of liquor should be done away entirely, always and everywhere.
