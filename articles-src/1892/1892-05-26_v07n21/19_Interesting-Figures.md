### Interesting Figures.

We published some months since a table showing the various amounts appropriated by the Government for the support of denominational Indian schools from 1887 to 1891 inclusive. The renewed interest in the subject occasioned by the action just taken by the Methodist Conference in favor of the proposed Sixteenth Amendment calls for the republication of the figures which are as follows:—
