## NATIONAL RELIGIOUS LIBERTY ASSOCIATION.

The Denver Daily News suggests that if the Fair is to be closed on one day of the week to satisfy one religious element, it should also be closed on any other day that other religionists should see fit to ask.

LADY SOMERSET has addressed letters to the archbishops and bishops and the heads of all religious denominations in the United Kingdom, asking their support for legislation, in Parliament, favoring Sunday observance.

AT a meeting of the Woman's National Press Association held lately at Washington, D. C., the question of opening the World's Fair on Sunday was discussed. The members generally took part in the discussion, and the majority favored the opening of the gates.

THE Southern Presbyterian General Assembly, in session at Hot Springs, Ark., May 24, passed resolutions demanding that the World's Fair be closed on Sunday. It is a noticeable fact that very few, if any, religious bodies most nowadays without passing such resolutions. Yet many still tell us that they can see no menace in this to our freedom either civil or religious.

ON Sunday, June 12, a reporter for the Sun was refused information as to the name of a smallpox patient just sent to North Brother Island, on the ground that the Health Department being closed on Sunday no information could be given. That is to say that although open for business, the office was "constructively" closed, and therefore, as, by fiction of law, no business was being transacted, there could be no information to give. Great is king humbug!
