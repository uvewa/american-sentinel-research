On another page of this paper will be found a detailed account of the trial of W. S. Lowry, one of the four Seventh-day Adventists, now in jail in Paris, Tenn., for doing quiet farm work on Sunday. We trust that every reader of THE SENTINEL will peruse the whole report carefully. It is a sample of the other cases tried the same day.

In these cases the defendants all refused to plead guilty or not guilty, because they felt that they could not honestly either assent to or deny the indictment as a whole. It was true that they had worked on Sunday. They felt that it was not true that the labor was "to the great annoyance and disturbance of the people, to the evil example of others, a public nuisance, against the peace and dignity of the State."

It will be observed that in the case of W. S. Lowry only a single bit of Sunday work was proved, except by the first witness, one of his own brethren in the church. And a single instance of Sunday work would not constitute a nuisance, even under Tennessee law. Without the testimony of T. F. Dortch, W. S. Lowry could not have been convicted; and yet, the indictment charges that it was work "to the great annoyance and disturbance of the people." If this were true why were not some of "the people" there to testify to the annoyance? There can be but one answer to the question, namely, that the "annoyance" and "disturbance" was only the intolerance which burns eternal in the breast of the bigot at the knowledge that others believe and practice differently from himself. It was simply the annoyance of knowing that Mr. Lowry was a Seventh-day Adventist, and that it is the habit of Adventists to rest on the seventh day and to work on Sunday.

THE character of the "annoyances" and "disturbances" occasioned by the Sunday work of the Seventh-day Adventist in Tennessee, is well illustrated by the following incident related to the writer by one who was present:

Shortly before the prosecution in question, a Methodist living a little out of the Adventist neighborhood, said to a member of the Adventist Church:

"You people are doing a great deal of harm in this country."

"Why, how is that?" said the Adventist.

"We are quiet, inoffensive people."

"Yes," responded the Methodist, "but you are in for your church too [the Methodist] would have regular meetings here at Springville, and all the young people who now go to your meetings would be working members of the Methodist Church."

"Well," responded the Adventist, "if we're in error correct us and we will all be the better for it."

"That just what we're going to do," replied the Methodist; "we're going to prosecute you."

And yet some people say that these Sunday prosecutions are not religious persecutions; but only the enforcing of the civil law. Well, that is all any religious persecution ever was. No one is singled out for persecution of such violence, religious persecution has always been under the color and forms of civil law.

ANOTHER noticeable feature of these Sunday cases is the latitude taken by the Attorney-General. For instance, the law confines the inquiry to one year before the preceding the finding of the indictment.

Attorney-General asking T. F. Dortch these questions:---

*q.* How near do you live to him [the defendant, Mr. Lowry]?

*A.* About three-fourths of a mile.

*q.* How long have you lived there, Mr. Dortch?

*A.* About eight or nine years.

*q.* How long has he been living there?

*A.* About fourteen years.

*q.* Have you seen him at labor, his common avocations, every day labor, within that time?

This was so slip on the part of the attorney for the State. He did the same thing in other cases, and persisted in it until told by the Judge to confine his questions to the twelve months immediately preceding the finding of the indictment.

ANOTHER inconsistency in these trials was that while the Judge charged the jury that it was "not a question of religious belief or conviction at all in either one way or the other," the Attorney-General asked such questions as these:---

"Is it the habit of members of your church to go to church on Sunday?"

"There is a number of you gentlemen that belong to that church living in the same neighborhood?"

"Have you seen him go to church on Sunday?"

What place have such questions in cases that have nothing to do with "religious belief or conviction at all in either one way or the other"? The fact is that such a thing is a question of religious belief and conviction, and it is impossible to make it anything else.

IT has all along been stated in these columns that the law compels the observance of Sunday it leaves a man perfectly free to rest on any other day he may see fit. This assertion was made by Mr. Dortch himself in the case of W. S. Lowry, but in the case of James Stem, another of the men convicted for Sunday labor, the claim was disproved, and it was shown that a man who observes Sunday rest just as certainly recognizes Saturday labor for the ensuing six days as a man disposed upon manual labor for a livelihood. The Sabbath, or rest-day, and six work-days, constitute the week. C. P. B.
