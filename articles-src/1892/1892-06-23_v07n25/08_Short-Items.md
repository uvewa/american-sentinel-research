THERE is an effort in Chicago to prevent the authorities from granting public funds to religious institutions. The following paragraph, taken from the Chicago *Tribune* of May 7, will materially aid in accomplishing the purpose:---

Yesterday's meeting of the Women's Alliance, Fourth Unitarian Church, turned out to be one of the most interesting ever held. "The House of the Good Shepherd" was discussed at some length. Mrs. H. D. Garrison reported having visited the place. She said the house found it barred and locked and bolted so that no one could see the inmates and that she had been refused admittance except at stated intervals and that she was turned away by a Mother Superior. The latter, however, appeared before the Juvenile Court to testify, and told that to start one for Europe it would not be common enough. Mrs. Henrotin, upon investigation, found only two girls in the House, to both of whom she had received the custody, and when they were to start for Europe it would not be common enough. Informed her that they had a permit from the Government. Inspector McBride, upon investigation, found not a single girl in the house whose relatives were all dead, who at once ended the conversation, which was to have furnished the Juvenile Judge a report.

The matter, too, was called to the attention of the Chief of Police. If the people of Chicago persist in their agitation the Sunday Law and the religious institutions will have the Church take charge of them. In order to detect a number, they would have to justify the Judge in directing him to commit murder. Dr. Rainsford of Chicago, the pastor of St. George's Church, said: "The only way is to have other ministers showing that they have no talent in the Christian obligations of dealing with evil by opposing it."

These are tricks that is too slow and too hard to change the hearts of men, so that they shall hate evil and love good. They prefer stirring them to make a short cut by telling evil in order to get good. If the purpose is to use the press for charity, they can stand. If they think a man is easy, they can themselves worthy in the estimation of the people; and that without self-sacrifice, even from self-renunciation, they can descend into deep depths of moral degradation and filth and tell others sacrifice their self-respect, you can make all of them moral by civil law. If they will not degrade themselves for nothing, tell them to depreciate. If they will not depreciate for nothing, they can themselves worthy in the estimation of the people that moral principles, and as purifies teaching them, the newspaper shall take the place of such pulpits and proclaim the bleached gospel of civil law for the preservation of society. Hence, all churches now receiving State appropriation, and this national organization for church inspection, and dictation as to the use made of the appropriation, or religious that appropriation. This last is the proper thing to do.

them. In order to detect a number, then, they would have to justify the Judge in directing him to commit murder. Dr. Rainsford says, if a number don't wish to stay, we will have the Church take charge of them.

Other ministers are showing that they have no talent in the Christian obligations of dealing with evil by opposing it.

These are tricks. It is too slow and too hard to change the hearts of men, so that they shall hate evil and love good. They prefer stirring them to make a short cut by telling evil in order to get good. If the purpose is to use the press for charity, they can stand. If they think a man is easy in his wickedness. It is taken for granted that ministers should actually sacrifice themselves for others, even as Christ also did. If they will not degrade themselves for nothing, they can descend into deep depths of moral degradation even though self-renunciation. They are becoming to the highest religious standard and that too in a matter concerning religion, where that standard has fallen so low among many ministerial ministers.---*The Interior.*
