A "WITCH" has been sentenced to death in Mexico. The victim is a girl only twenty years of age, and her death offence is being credited by the people with that miraculous power in healing of diseases of disease, for which she steadfastly refused to accept compensation. But this is Mexico.

IT seems that consciences, Christian men, observing the Sabbath Sabbath, are taken from their families and food and imprisoned, and sentences issued against their property to pay the fine of their persecutors. And their only offence from is quietly working on Sunday in order that they may provide things necessary in this sight of all men. This is not in Mexico, but in the United States, "the home of the free!"

But it is according to law---and so are the witchcraft proceedings in Mexico, and were indeed years in Massachusetts for that reason.

It is a matter of testimony in the late Tennessee Sunday cases that while none of the witnesses were disturbed they all "heard some complaints." What the nature of the complaints were we are left to surmise, except of a slight clew given by one witness who stated that "some thought the work ought to be stopped." The indictment that the annoyance was only of that large and sharp class complaint in men's minds by the knowledge that everybody does not agree with them. It could be felt just as keenly fifty or a hundred miles from the scene of the work as within sight or sound of it, and is, in fact, no annoyance of which the State has a shadow of right to take cognizance.

It seems a little strange that the courts of Tennessee hold that work done on Sunday by Seventh-day Adventists "is to the great annoyance and disturbance of the people, to the evil example of society, prejudicial to public morals, and a public nuisance to the citizens of the county, and against the peace and dignity of the State," when the judges and attorneys who prosecute these cases for the State know that the Adventists are among the very best citizens of the State. Were the people of the State all as well disposed

and as conscientious as are these Adventists there would be no need either of criminal courts or of prisons. Indeed, all courts might be disbanded, for whatever slight differences might arise would be settled by arbitration. Schools would abound, but saloons would be unknown. Is it reasonable that the example of such people is evil, and prejudicial to public morals?

It may not be amiss to remind the readers of THE SENTINEL that in their zeal for the mouth of the country the supporters of Sunday-Sabbath scored, some by laws sent from the States of Ohio and Michigan petitions purporting to represent nearly two million more people than the total population of both States!

It seems that the Attorney-General of the Northwestern District of Tennessee to make no good his threat to prosecute the Adventists to the full extent of the law; he not content with fining some of them for quietly pursuing their vocations on Sunday, he is endeavoring to take their property for the payment of costs. How many, or all the Tennessee convictions, we believe, property that can be taken under the law of Tennessee. A homestead, and innocently farming implements are, we understand, exempt from such seizure.

THE "licenses" which this imprisoned Adventist has, and of which the sheriff must deprive him and his family to satisfy the majesty of Tennessee law, are a spring wagon used for going to meeting, and for general trucking about---marketing and farm products, etc.---and a cottage upon the property of Mr. S. who has voluntarily come to this in Tennessee that Seventh-day Adventists can have only the answer of life. The "licenses" are only for those who honor the Sunday. It is well to have this issue clearly placed, and its meaning fully understood.

*The Christian Nation* and Christian Statesmen in their notes on the National Sunday-rest bill, bore on the third and sixth chapters of Daniel, both justly distinguish to civil law when it contravenes the law of God. How then can they condemn conscientious observers of the seventh day for obeying that part of the commandment which says, "Six days shalt thou labor and do all thy work"?

The fourth commandment puts a difference between the seventh day and all the other six days, and that is the part of a purpose, namely, to distinguish the seventh as God's rest day, the memorial of his work in creating the heavens and the earth. To treat all days alike or to habitually treat two days alike by abstaining

from work upon them is simply to violate the fourth commandment. It is just as impossible that the conscientious observer of the seventh day should also habitually observe the first day by laying aside all secular labor and business, as it is that he should labor on the Sabbath. Those who assert that Sunday laws do not invade the realm of conscience, lack either knowledge of the subject or candor to express their convictions.

IT is announced that now, "after an agitation of a quarter of a century, the Hungarian Chamber of Deputies has adopted a resolution which extends to the country to religious equality by calling for the Government to introduce bills, making it possible, among other things, for Christian and Jews to intermarry, and to convert or become Jews in faith." This is all plain enough, but not as the statement can make that "the new legislation will affirm the supremacy of the State over all creeds." That is, that where, in the past a single creed or the State, now the State is the ruler of all creeds. Old. And this is heralded to the world as a victory for religious liberty. How much liberty is there in a system in which the Church in supreme in its sphere, the State supreme in its sphere, that neither sphere no more holds sway than Polaris and Crete.

THE National Prohibition Convention, held at Cincinnati, as well, at all others, at *v.*, and a, *vr.*, June! This is an excellent restatement of the political first principles of the conventions of the party. In its latest letter to the paper, Count De Winslow, junior, Chairman of the Executive Committee against that policy of silence should be applied to the previous platform "if it is known to be doubtful at the hands of the Convention." In the careful study of No. 69 of *the Sentinel Library* (devoted to this particular subject), he says:

> Mr. Holliway, at the last interest in this Convention, Mr. Holliway, "I think it is folly to relate to a proposition to change the name of the party, and to any question relating to a Sabbath rest reform parties." This is significant, but not altogether reassuring. Some are enough of these National Reform forces will get together to accomplish something toward an organization and develop for the overthrow of liberty of conscience.
