# NATIONAL RELIGIOUS LIBERTY ASSOCIATION.

THE *Jersey Daily News* suggests that if the Fair is to be closed on Sunday for the benefit of a religious element, it should also be closed on any other day that other religious should ask for this same privilege.

LADY SOMERSET has addressed letters to the settlements and bishops and the heads of all religious denominations in the United Kingdom, asking their support for legislation in Parliament favoring Sunday observance.

AT a meeting of the Women's National Press Association a paper was read by Mrs. upon the question of opening the World's Fair on Sunday in which she set forth the Sabbatarian arguments. It was followed by a spirited debate on the subject in the discussion, and the majority favored the opening of the Fair on Sundays.

THE Southern Presbyterian General Assembly held at Hot Springs, Ark. May 24, passed resolutions protesting against opening the Fair closed on Sunday. It is a noticeable fact that very few religious bodies pass resolutions without also passing such resolutions. Yet many still tell us that all opposition to this is due to our own will or religious.

ON Sunday, June 12, a reporter for the *Sun* was posted just next to North Berrier Island, on the outskirts of New York City. A steamboat whose Sunday no information could be given. That is right. If the Sunday law is to be enforced against all, there could be no information to give. Great is consistency.

THE *Mail and Express* publishes the following:

The news that a number of German families who are members of the congregation are opposing the Czar's empire because they refused to give up their religious observances, naturally recalls the persecution of the Jews, and the treatment of the Danudes, residents that the Russian Government is not more tolerant now of religious dissent than of old. The persecution of the Jews is but one, although the principal illustration of this well-known trait.

The attention of the *Mail and Express* should be called to the fact that those German dissenters are Baptists and is now a determined effort to drive out these Russian Baptists---that there is no trouble with conscientious men, because of a difference in religious belief.

As yet only has Congress been asked to manage the local affairs of Chicago on Sunday during the coming exposition, but here is one more injunction to the Columbian Commission as to what the managers of the Fair must do. We clip this paragraph from the *Christian Advocate*---

> We have asked, unmistakably in favor of the Sunday closing of the World's Fair from the most representative assemblages, the Baptist, and quarters at Geneva, and also the interesting volume may be obtained from the Secretary upon claims in England. Recently other petitions on the same subject have been received by Dr. Allen, of the New York Sabbath Committee, for transmission to the Columbian Commission, one from the Workingmen's Sabbath Association of New York, from our Consulate-General from the Workingmen's Sabbath Association at Glasgow. And now comes another memorial from our Consulate-General, from a convention the Sunday observance has just been in session for three days in Stuttgart, in Germany, attended by

representatives from different parts of Europe, at which was Count Von Lux, heretofore Chairman of the Emperor of Germany. The session of the convention was fully reported in the German press, as was shown in the reports and discussions. On the last day, Count Von Lux, as honorary President, delivered an address of great power on behalf of Sunday observance, in the course of which a petition was unanimously adopted asking for the closing of the Exposition at Sunday both for the sake of the numerous employes, who would either be deprived of a precious day of worship and rest on behalf of labor of the week, and for the influence its opening on a world which would have upon the lives from the Old World in showing how the great Republic of the West is driving the institution of the Sunday rest, to which they in great effort.
