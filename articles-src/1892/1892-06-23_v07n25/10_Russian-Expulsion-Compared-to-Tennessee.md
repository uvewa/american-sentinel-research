THE Mail and Express publishes the following:—

The news that a number of German families who settled at Kieff, Russia, have been driven out of the Czar's empire because they refused to give up their religion and join the Russian Orthodox Church, confirms the opinion of those who, like M. A. Leroy-Scaudien, maintain that the Russian Government has adopted the policy of gradually driving out all strangers from the country, and that their expulsion of the Jews is but one, although the principal manifestation of this policy.

The attention of the Mail and Express should be called to Arkansas and Tennessee, where there has been and is now a determined effort to drive out peaceable and worthy citizens, acknowledged to be conscientious men, because of a difference in religious belief and practice.
