A WEST VIRGINIA exchange notices the presence of a lecturer named Bennett at Berea and other places in West Virginia, in the interests of the Prohibition and Farmers' Alliance parties, both of which seem to have entrusted their cause to his advocacy. This speaker, who has been dubbed the "Kansas Cyclone" by his adherents, came out openly, it seems, and "plainly stated the design of the parties he represented; he plainly declared their intention to make everything secondary to the agitation of the Sunday question. Immediately following the speeches of Mr. Bennett, the Republican primaries were held, and religio-political matters discussed on every hand." Political religion is certainly becoming popular when its voice is heard from the stump.
