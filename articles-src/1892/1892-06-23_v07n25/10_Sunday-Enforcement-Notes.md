# Sunday Enforcement Notes

A WEST VIRGINIA exchange notices the presence of a lecturer named Bennett at Berea and other Virginia towns, acting in the Virginia list of the Prohibition and Farmer's Alliance parties, both of which were to be in the field for the coming election.

CHARLOTTE, N. C., June 14.---The city council passed this evening a very stringent blue-law ordinance.

IN relation to politics and religion in New Jersey, a very good case in point was furnished by the Sunday closing law.

UNDER the head of "The Law Defied," the *Witness*, of May 9, has the following about the dedication of St. Joseph's Cathedral in Hartford.

A CANADIAN daily paper complains that the fining of a Jew in Toronto recently for selling on Sunday opens up the whole question of much importance and much difficulty.

# "The Prohibition Party and Freedom of Conscience"

No. 69 of the "**Sentinel Library**," is just the thing. It sets forth clearly the proper sphere of civil government, and can not fail to fix the attention of candid, thinking people. Eight pages; price, one cent. Sent in large quantities.
