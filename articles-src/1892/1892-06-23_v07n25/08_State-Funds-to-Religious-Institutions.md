THERE is an effort in Chicago to prevent the unconstitutional appropriation of State funds to religious institutions. The following incident as recorded in the Chicago Tribune of May 7, will materially aid in that direction:—

At yesterday's meeting of the Woman's Alliance, some commotion was raised by the reading of a report from a committee which endeavored to "inspect" the House of the Good Shepherd.

The report claimed that nine of the members visited the house, found it barred and locked like a prison, and were refused admission by Sister Philomena, who gave as a reason the absence of the Mother Superior. The latter, however, appeared after the committee had shown sufficient persistence. The Mother Superior said that as she was about to start for Europe it would not be convenient to show them through. The committee informed her that they had a permit from the Governor to visit all institutions receiving public money. This authority did not move the Mother Superior, who at once ended the conversation, which was carried on through the bars.

The committee then sent two of their number to invoke the aid of the Chief of Police, while the remainder sat in a little closet and regaled themselves, according to the report, with crackers and cheeses. While waiting for developments they again sent for the Mother Superior, who sent Sister Philomena in her place. The sister in answer to numerous questions said that she had been there thirty years but knew nothing about two hundred and sixty girls, inmates, their names being changed when they entered. Any records kept were not for the public.

The sub-committee finally returned with a letter to the Mother Superior from Judge Scales advising her to allow the women to go through the house. Another refusal was the result. A positive "no" was also given when the committee sent a message asking if they could do so at some future time. A threat was then made to call a police officer, and this having no effect, the committee gave up the siege as hopeless, and retired.

The Catholic Church, and all other churches now receiving State appropriations, must either submit to the State inspection, and dictation as to the use made of the appropriation, or relinquish that appropriation. This last is the proper thing to do.
