NOT only has Congress been asked to manage the local affairs of Chicago on Sunday during the World's Fair, but all Europe is now giving its advice to the Columbian Commission as to what disposition it shall make of its Sundays, as shown by this paragraph from the Christian Advocate:—

"We have already noticed memorials in favor of the Sunday closing of the World's Fair from the International Federation of Europe, with its headquarters at Geneva, and also the interesting volume of memorials from representatives of different classes in England. Recently other petitions on the same subject have been received by Dr. Atterbury, of the New York Sabbath Committee, for transmission to the Columbian Commission, from the committee of the Free Church of Scotland, from the Workingmen's Sabbath Association of Glasgow, and from some prominent business firms of Glasgow. And now comes another memorial from the Continent. An international congress on the Sunday observance has just been in session for three days in Stuttgart, in Germany, attended by representatives from different parts of Europe. Its president was Count Von Bernstorff, Chamberlain of the Emperor of Germany. The sessions of the congress were largely attended, and much interest was shown in the reports and discussions. On one occasion the famous ex-Court Preacher Stoecker delivered an address of great power before an audience of three thousand persons. By this congress a petition was unanimously adopted asking for the closing of the Exposition on Sunday, both for the sake of the numerous employees, who would otherwise be deprived of their Sunday rest after the hard labors of the week, and for the influence which such an example would have upon the visitors from the Old World in showing how the American people appreciate the divine institution of the Sunday rest, to which they owe to a great extent their national and economical greatness."
