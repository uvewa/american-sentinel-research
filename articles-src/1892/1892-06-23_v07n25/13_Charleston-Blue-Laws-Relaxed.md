THE attention of Mr. Johnstone, of South Carolina, is called to the following dispatch:—

CHARLESTON, S. C., June 14.—The city council to-day, under pressure of public opinion, adopted a resolution authorizing the Mayor to relax the stringent blue Sunday laws recently enacted under the law, as adopted by the present administration. The only article purchasable in this city on Sunday was the Sunday cocktail, which was of course obtained through side doors. The soda water, ice cream and fruit stands were hermetically sealed, and even the drug-stores were prevented from selling sweet stuff. The public became restive, especially as murder and crime seemed to be on the increase. Hence the resolutions adopted by the Board of Aldermen to-day.

Perhaps the call for the establishment of political religion, from South Carolina, is not quite so pressing as its representative has thought. If that be so, when the debate comes up in the House, on the conditioning of the five million loan to the Exposition, on Sunday closing, his voice will not be heard thirty-seven times in favor of enforcing political religion at Chicago.
