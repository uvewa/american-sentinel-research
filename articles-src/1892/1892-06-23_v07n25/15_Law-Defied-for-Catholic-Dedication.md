UNDER the head of "The Law Defied," the Woman's Voice, of May 14, has the following:—

On Sunday, May 7, St. Joseph's Cathedral of Hartford was dedicated. The Romanists asked that special trains be run for their accommodation. The New York, New Haven and Hartford road refused to apply to the railroad commissioners for permission to run trains, the Sunday railroad law not permitting the running of any trains between 10.30 A. M. and 3 P. M., except to meet demands created by the public necessity or in the interests of mercy. Mr. Noonan, local Superintendent of the New England road, made application a week ago to the commissioners for a permit to run special trains for the accommodation of visitors to the dedication. The commissioners refused the request, but Mr. Noonan announced that three special trains would be run between Waterbury and Hartford, within the prohibited hours. The penalty is two hundred and fifty dollars for each offense.

We doubt whether such a defiance of law would have been permitted had Protestants been the aggressors. The impudence of Romanists in making such a demand contrary to law, shows how sure they are of their power.

Consistency in the observance of Sunday does not exist any more within the Church than without; and such an incident as this should convince some of the truth of that fact, and of the consequent inutility of Sunday laws.
