# Tried for His Faith.

We have given in the last two numbers of THE SENTINEL, a detailed account of the trial of the Seventh-day Adventists in the Circuit Court of Henry County, at Paris, Henry County, Tenn., for working on Sunday. The following is a full report of one of the cases, and is fair sample of all the others. Editorial comment upon it will be found on the first and last pages of the paper.

The trial was held in Paris, Henry County, Tenn., May 12, 1892, before Judge W. H. Swiggart. The counsel for the State was Attorney-General E. C. Lewis. The defendant, W. S. Lowry (the same who was convicted about a year ago on trial for his religious faith, the editor of which case, including the brief of counsel, in accordance with Luke 12:11, 15, is in the SENTINEL LIBRARY, No. 56).

The Court (to defendant): Have you an attorney?

*A.* No, sir.

*q.* Are you not able to hire one?

*A.* I am not able to hire one.

*q.* Do you propose to try the case without a lawyer?

*A.* I am not able to furnish a lawyer, the case has been forced upon me.

*q.* You are entitled to a lawyer if you will take a little time and look around among the members of the bar.

*A.* I do not want any.

The jury were sworn in groups of four, each juror placing the tips of his fingers upon a copy of the Holy Bible, while one, who had the book repeated the oath, which closed with the words, "So help me God."

*Grand Jurors of the State of Tennessee,* (Jan. Term, 1892.)

*The body of the county aforesaid, on their oath, present: That W. S. Lowry, late of the county aforesaid, on or before the finding of this indictment, and within one year thereof, being a person of the age of twenty-one (21) years, on Sunday, did perform and engage in his common avocations of labor, to wit: hauling wood, hauling, and other common labor, being work of his ordinary calling in life, and which said labor was not a work of real necessity, and said performance of labor on Sunday was public, and to the great annoyance and disturbance of the people, to the evil example of others, a public nuisance, against the peace and dignity of the State.*

The Court (to defendant): Do you plead guilty, or not guilty?

*W. S. Lowry.* I can not plead either way to all that; there are some things in that indictment which are true, and some which are not true; for you to plead guilty or not guilty on the whole indictment I can not do it; because every clause in it is not true.

*M. C. Carter* is "swearing in" by all the other

a Mr. Cox, who was not an Adventist, had been working on his farm on Sunday to work six days? *Answer.* "Yes sir." The witness was then asked by the Attorney-General: "You do not think it necessary for people to work on Sunday, do you?" *Answer.* "No, sir; it is not at all necessary. Mr. Cox had already testified that it was necessary to work six days; therefore, according to this witness for the State of Tennessee, the man who believes that he ought to keep the seventh day, is, by the Sunday law of Tennessee, under the necessity of violating either his conscience or the law of God. He is not left perfectly free to keep any day, but must keep Sunday, a day which he has not sanctioned the inconsistency of life. C. P. B.

How long has he been living there?

*q.* Have you seen him at labor, his common avocations, every day labor, within that time?

*A.* Yes, sir, within the last year, up to the first of January.

*q.* How many Sabbaths have you seen him at labor?

*A.* I could not say how many different times.

*q.* Many?

*A.* Yes; Sundays.

*q.* How many different. I have seen him. I know how many times.

*q.* What kind of labor did you see him at during that time? Various kinds of work, and different kinds of work.

*A.* I have seen him splitting rails.

*q.* Well, I think it is not necessary.

*Attorney-General:* Anything else?

*A.* Well, I have seen him at work, but I do not remember what.

*Attorney-General:* Most any kind of work? See him hauling?

*A.* Yes, I have seen him driving a team; hauling wood.

*q.* Did you see him chopping any?

*A.* I do not remember that.

*q.* Did you see him at work on Sunday at any other kind of labor?

*A.* No; sir; I do not remember that he hunted on Sunday.

*q.* You say he has been living there fourteen years. Did you ever know him do on Sundays as the other men on the other days of the week?

*A.* It is, and was in his habit. Mr. Carter said he had known defendant six years. He did not know what he would do on other days: not whether he would do on Sundays that he would do on other days?

*A.* Yes, he does about the same; various kinds of work.

*q.* What will he do Saturday?

*A.* He will do Saturday what all hands will; clean up and get ready for the Sabbath, and he kept Saturday, and I believe he generally suspends work at twelve o'clock on Friday.

*q.* In other words, he recognized Saturday as his Sabbath?

*A.* Yes, sir; he did.

*q.* And he devotes his every day avocations to all days of the week except Saturday?

*A.* Yes.

*q.* Have you seen him at all these sorts of work? Well, I suppose most every one.

*W. S. Lowry.* The indictment charges that this labor was performed to the annoyance of the people. Has my work on Sunday ever disturbed by my work, or did it interfere with your labor, or common avocations on Sunday?

*A.* No.

*q.* Do you think a man ought to have the privilege of worshiping God according to the dictates of his own conscience?

*A.* I think every man ought to have the privilege; that is all I know about the matter; that is, so long as a man does not step on my toes, he can follow the dictates of his own conscience, I think.

*Attorney-General:* Are you a member of the Seventh-day Adventist Church or some other?

*A.* No, sir.

it is necessary to create a plea of not guilty for the defendant.

The Court (to clerk): Enter a plead not guilty.

The witnesses for the State were called, and as with the jury, each witness placed his hand upon a copy of the Bible while being sworn.

IMPORTANT DECISION IN TENNESSEE.

The Court: Mr. Lowry you have the right to be a witness, or to plead your case? If you want to be a witness, be sworn; if not, you would like to make a statement.

*Mr. Lowry.* I would like to make a statement to the jury if I wish.

STATEMENT OF W. S. LOWRY TO THE JURY.

I would like to say to the jury, that, as has been the habit of the Seventh-day Adventists, I observe the seventh day of the week as the Sabbath. I work on Sunday, just as other people work the other five days; but I do not do unnecessary work, which comes on Saturday. I observe that day the same as the other churches observe Sunday. I try to do what is right and keep a good conscience towards God, and it takes my labor on six days to make my living. I have a good sized family, and if any necessary items, and do my work as quietly as possible, and during religious services in that community I have always observed them so that they were not disturbed. Here I am before the bar, and the laws of God require that I should obey the laws of God, and if I could obey man and not disobey God, I would gladly do it. The laws of God, which I regard as higher and more sacred than the laws of the State, I do require to do my work on six days, and I have obeyed officers and authorities enforcing the law. I have tried to be a peaceable citizen.

ARGUMENT OF ATTORNEY-GENERAL. W. S. LOWRY.

May it please the Court. Gentlemen of the jury: Mr. Lowry's case is concerned, that we have a law in the State of Tennessee requiring a proper observance of the Sabbath. There are certain safeguards thrown around that day safeguards of protection. The State must protect its citizens, and so far as the laws of Tennessee are concerned, it is a violation of the law of the State; and it is not a matter of opinion; it is a question of fact; it is not a matter of conviction as to whether he believes it or doesn't believe it. The Constitution guarantees him the right of worship, and the Constitution guarantees unto him, and to every citizen, the right to worship God according to the dictates of their own conscience; whether they prefer, or to keep any other day. If your Honor please, if upon the facts presented here and proven by these witnesses, this man, even upon his own ideas and his own ideas of these things, was conviction should follow upon those facts, and conviction must follow upon the evidence in this case, and those facts in this commonwealth. And the American people by the almost unanimous voice of all christendom, have said the Sabbath, have set apart the first day of the week, and they say that day shall be kept holy, and they have, at the same time, provided that any man who doesn't believe as they do can substitute what he believes; but when he does substitute it, he has laid it a work that is necessary, a work that is called for in order to protect the interests of the community at large.

Now Mr. Lowry has not gone to pull an ox out of the ditch, or do any of those necessary things that are permitted to a man under the law who works on Sunday. While the Constitution guarantees to Mr. Lowry, as I have said, the right to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience; if of his church elders would disturb him, he would have the same safeguards thrown around him, and

the same statues protection given him in that we have given all citizens of the State. But he must bow to the laws of the State of Tennessee; he must bow to the laws of this County, for which he has been arraigned before you twelve good men; and must be enforced by the courts of the country. I am sorry for the defendant, I pity him, and I am free to say to this jury that no one wants to distort him from his regular work on Sunday. It is not a question of whether he believes in the Sunday law; because he does not dispute that he follows the dictates of his own conscience during the week: he follows the dictates of his own conscience, follows during the week, but admit it, and given that this prosecution has been carried into the higher courts of this country, that this people has been sustained by the Supreme Court. The fact is that a man can not justify himself in the violation of the law upon the grounds of his religious belief. The question you have to determine here is, how that a man who claims to be a peaceable, law-abiding citizen, can set aside the laws of his State. The laws of the State protect him; the laws of the protections that are thrown around the holy day protect him; he is entitled to all the protection by the laws of the State; and it is a question that is very easily disposed of, it seems to me.

It is a question that has been decided by the highest courts in this land over and over again, that notwithstanding a man's religious convictions or religious beliefs, no law could be enacted that would touch his religion. But Sunday is a civil institution. It is a rest day. It is a day that we are taught to respect, that we have been taught from our mothers' knees and on up, in our very midst, as it were, to know and revere and treat as a day of rest.

I regret that we have that class of people among us that differ in the beliefs of the American people,---while I regret that there is that difference. Now why should the law provide for those who want to rest on Saturday, and say to those that they must keep Sunday; that is to say these men keep Saturday, too, and can keep Saturday and Sunday too if they wanted to. I bring this in to be regarded, because of the fact that as far as I know that the defendants have never claimed this; and I want the case to go to the higher courts, I want all the officers of the court, to see that this indictment and all the proceedings are regular. This Court will do. So far as I am concerned it is a case of conscience with me as well as Mr. Lowry; and I will now submit this case to the jury.

CHARGE OF JUDGE SWIGGART TO THE JURY.

*Gentlemen of the jury:* This indictment against the defendant charges him with the misdemeanor offense of committing a nuisance by craftfully, unlawfully doing and performing his common avocations upon Sundays. It is charged that on Sundays, being a person above the age of twenty-one years, and within one year before, and up to the taking of this indictment, he was doing and performing upon Sundays publicly his common avocations, to wit: hauling wood, hauling, and performed and followed his common avocations of labor on Sundays.

Our law recognizes that a man on Sundays is doing various and drives other kinds of work on Saturday than upon any other day. That he is to be encouraged in the observance of the day, as a matter of charity; and that it was and is to the best interest of the State to encourage a respect for the observance of Sundays for the benefit of the people, and a public nuisance to the citizens. The Legislature has had the power to enact such laws, and the courts to enforce them, and upon a verdict of guilty, the State must prove the guilt of the defendant beyond a reasonable doubt.

It must appear from the proof that the offense was committed in Henry County, within twelve months prior to the finding of the indictment.

It must appear from the proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant did, on Sundays, perform and engage in his common avocations of daily work, and did engage in his daily vocations, to wit: hauling wood, hauling, and other common labor, or some portion of it; and that it was done publicly and to the annoyance of the people, and the evidence must show that fact, and within twelve months before this indictment was returned by the grand jury at the present term of the Court. I do not think the facts are not proven beyond a reasonable doubt, you are to acquit.

It is not a question of religious belief or conviction at all, in either way or the other. It is a question of the violation of the statute; it is a violation of the laws of the State. It is not a matter of belief; it is not a question of the Sabbath, or as to what the particular religious opinion of the defendant may be, or the

religious opinions of other people in the community. The question for you to determine is whether he comes under the laws of the State.

If you find that the proof clearly beyond a reasonable doubt satisfies you of the guilt of the accused, it will be your duty to find him guilty, regardless of any opinion you may have as to the propriety of the law itself. The law is on the statute books and you are required and the citizens are required to observe the laws of the State. It is a question of fact with you, and the fact is only one, whether he has been proven to be guilty. You are the judges of the facts. I am the judge of the law, so far as this case is concerned for the present. You are to look to the manner and intelligence of the man, and if you have any reasonable doubt as to his guilt you will give him the benefit of it. It is your experience, from the knowledge of man, and the manner of acting upon it, and the fact as it will fix a reasonable construction, with the view of reaching a correct conclusion with the facts.

If you find beyond a reasonable doubt, that he is guilty, and guilty, gentlemen of the jury, and should be so found, you will find the amount of his fine, which should not be less than one ($1.00), dollar, and should not be more than three dollars; and you can fix any sum that you consider proper under the provisions of the statute; and also whether you are of the opinion that the penalty should be under fifty cents for each day he is proven to have worked, plus costs, as provided by Section 2 of the statute.

You may retire, gentlemen.

After a short deliberation the jury returned a verdict of guilty.
