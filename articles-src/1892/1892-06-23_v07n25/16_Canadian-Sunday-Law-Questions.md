A CANADIAN daily paper remarks that "the fining of a Jew or two in Toronto recently for working on Sunday would seem likely to raise a question of much importance and much difficulty. Some Christians, like the Jews, keep Saturday as a holy day and would work on Sunday if they were not subject to penalties. Why should they be? Why should the laws recognize the opinions of any ecclesiastical authority or set of authorities as to which, Saturday or Sunday, is the divinely appointed day of rest?"

The question is entirely pertinent. There is absolutely no good reason for such regulations, but very many reasons why there should be nothing of the kind.
