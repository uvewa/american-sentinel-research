# A Judicial Profession of Christianity for the Nation.

[*Further comments on the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States, delivered at Battle Creek, Mich., May 14, 1892, as reported in THE AMERICAN SENTINEL of May 26.*]

When Henry VIII wanted a divorce from Catherine of Aragon so much that his political ends could so as to gratify it, and Henry took the position that the civil government instead of the Pope should control the church. This brought about the break between the civil power of England, his wife and the Pope. This separated the Church of England from the Catholic Church. Then that which had formerly been the Roman Catholic Church in England, became the Church of England, the same as before, only under the headship of the church instead of the Pope. Then "Body Politic" for the maintenance of the faith.

Under Edward VI, a few very slight changes were made; rather very few the more decidedly Catholic faith. Under Mary, a decided effort was made to bring back that religion. Mary succeeded, and Elizabeth reverted from the position taken by her father and Edward, and it was the same as before. Then that which had formerly been the Catholic faith in the Church of England became complete Mary's scheme, but could not, and was not allowed, to those who still clung as they were left by Edward, for the nation's people all who were the friends of the individual life, she included strongly to reform. But even in the time of Elizabeth, the sum of the matter is, that the religion professed in the Church of England, in Queen Elizabeth's time, was a religion which just as near to the Roman Catholic religion as was possible, without absolutely including the papacy.

Now the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States finds to establish what is the religion of this Nation, and hereby by this decision the court declares it to be the Christian religion, according to the meaning of the Constitution of the United States, that the language of the Constitution and the language of all American law in recognition of religion, "having one meaning." It is to be accepted also that the religion established should be as much like the papal religion as possible, whilst keeping precisely that religion itself, as the (privacy say) that it would be said "that they should make room for Protestants only."

Yet the court does not propose to by giving any other creed or name for recognition. It proceeds next to introduce Protestantism, as follows:---

The colonial compact made by the Pilgrims on the *Mayflower:*

> Having undertaken for the glory of God and advancement of the Christian faith, the Pilgrims came from colony in the northern Parts of Virginia; to form a compact, to combine ourselves together into a civil Body Politic, and Furtherance of the ends aforesaid.

Having thus established what it chooses to declare to be "the Christian faith" as the religion of the Nation, the court then proceeds to cite historical evidence that it is legitimate in the eyes of the country in maintaining "the discipline of the church. This it makes by the compact of those Puritans who settled Connecticut, as follows:

> Forasmuch as it hath pleased God the Father, and many of the inhabitants and residents of Hartford and of Windsor and of Wethersfield, now cohabit and inhabitants and residents of Windsor, Hartford, and Wethersfield, who knowing where a people are gathered together the word of God requires that to maintain the peace of such to be observed. And well knowing where a people are gathered together the word of God requires that to maintain the peace and union of such a people there should be an orderly and decent government established, according to God, to order and dispose of the affairs of the people at all seasons as occasion shall require, do therefore associate and conjoin ourselves to be as one public State or Commonwealth, and do, for ourselves and our successors, and such as shall be adjoined to us at any time hereafter, enter into combination and confederation together to maintain and preserve the liberty and purity of the Gospel of our Lord Jesus we now profess, as also the discipline of the churches, which, according to the truth of the said Gospel, is now practiced among us.

Now this "historical" citation, the Supreme Court just so certainly establishes the Puritan religion, and establishes "the Body Politic" for the maintenance of the faith and discipline of the church as the previous ones it establishes the Christian religion as the religion of the Nation. And this decision declares that the language of the constitution and the language of the national Constitution is "one the same." Then according to the meaning of this language, the Supreme Court has decided that the civil power, upon which this State Government, and the power by which is to maintain the discipline of the church! Now the mischief of this thing has been shown over and over again, especially in the case of the Puritans themselves. It is well known that that persecution was brought about by the national enforcement of Sunday; the enforced observance of religion, was done by the enforcement of Sunday laws; the entire State of Connecticut, in which the decision the Supreme Court fully establishes, and sanctions and justified by its (mis)interpretation of the national Constitution.

So far, therefore, in this decision, we have two things established: first, that the maintenance of the discipline of the church is a function of the civil power. What next?---Why, the question of the religious test as a matter of conscience, and the religious test oath as a qualification for office. The established churches came to America under William Penn's grant of privileges to the people of his colony in adopting "the Declaration of Independence, in which "the Creator" and "Supreme Judge" are appealed to, and in the adoption of "a new world," and "Divine Providence" is affirmed, and the Constitution of Illinois in which God is recognized, the court cited from the Constitution, the Mayflower, the New England compacts, declarations, and believers, and for the purpose of establishing the legality of the religious oath as national.

That it is the duty of every man to worship God, and further it is declared in so doing, in all, persons are equally entitled to protection in their religious liberty, whether, to be

ought, by any law, to be molested in his person or estate, on account of his religious sentiments, or for his religious worship, and that no person shall by law be obliged to join or support or be classed with or associated to any religious establishment or worship contrary to or against his consent, nor be compelled to pay tithes or contributions, unless on contract, to maintain any minister or ministry, contrary to what he believes to be right or has deliberately or voluntarily engaged himself to perform.

The court cites these as religious expressions, and says that are "everywhere present," in the acts of a people who honor and worship a God and that, and under that dispensation, such being the spirit of this people, what are the conclusions that necessarily follow, is to say to the world in the world at work.

Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.

> "That is, in other words, no man shall have the right to hold any position or principles of religious belief, principles of religious government, in any State of the State. That has been the basis of the history of the Catholic Church. It is the very doctrine of the Catholic Church. It is the doctrine of Rome, before the Papacy supplanted it. And this decision of the Supreme Court has particular gods of his own, escapes State interference, it is that true Christian religion is established in this country." But the court continues this quotation.

That no religious test ought ever to be required as a qualification to any office of public trust under the United States.

> And further, that no religious test shall be required as a qualification for any office of public trust; *nor shall the Legislature prescribe any religious test whatever.*

That is the provision and the requirements of the National Constitution. But, says the Supreme Court, that speaks the voice of the entire people, the United States, and that the Constitution has always had, these American State language, have "one meaning." And although the United States Constitution declares that no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification for any office or public trust under the Government, the Supreme Court by appeal to the several States, interprets it to mean that no other religious test shall ever be required than that which "the Christian religion" and "the Christian Nation" shall prescribe. Its language "one meaning" and that one meaning is, "the Christian religion and the Christian Nation" alike, this decision establishes a national religion, with a religious test oath and the maintenance of the church by the civil power of the Nation, and the requirement of the religious test-oath as a qualification for office. And the decision of the Supreme Court in this, support of religion. He is justified and with just as much propriety as was the support of religion, of Massachusetts, as follows in full:

> And says the court, This document and the legislation, "have one meaning." These American State language, have "one meaning," denied by those who drew and perceived them, the voice of the entire people "speak the voice of the entire people, for them, by them, to be Christian Nation."

And says the court, This document and each of these State constitutions, these American languages, have "one meaning," denied by those who drew and perceived them. The people of the United States declare that the effect of the proposed
