# "The Gentleman from South Carolina."

A POSTAL card has been received at this office from a gentleman in South Carolina, "A South Carolina Man," bearing the stamp "June 8, Vox et Praeteria Nihil, No. 24, of Hon. Geo. Johnstone is unjust and unfair."

If this gentleman from South Carolina will obtain copies of the *Congressional Record* of the resolutions of May 25 and 27, and read the report there published of the proceedings of those dates with reference to the question of the Sunday closing of the World's Columbian Exposition, we are confident that Mr. Johnstone, to the claims in reference to the Government exhibit at the World's Fair in the Sunday civil appropriation bill, left times but feeble ground, such as would justify a far-sharper criticism than THE SENTINEL has yet made from South Carolina, in this matter, than his express statement of further appropriation for expenditures necessary to the Government exhibits at the Exposition.

To this represent of further appropriation for expenditures necessary to the Government at the Exposition, Mr. Taylor, of Illinois, had offered an amendment under discussion in any particular, that no portion of the money hereby appropriated shall be used for the purpose of keeping the doors of the House was confined to the exhibits by the Government, and the demand that alone. And yet, ignoring this fact, Mr. Johnstone offers an amendment, "That no part of the amount hereby appropriated shall be used for the purpose of keeping the doors of the Exposition shall be closed on Sunday," and on this amendment, was, to make the United States Government exhibit at the World's Fair Managers that although Government had appropriated no money for the purpose, which would keep its exhibit open on Sunday for the Government exhibit as well as for the general and also for the individual exhibit of the States should be closed on Sunday, and opened on Sunday the Government would do this; that the Government make its individual exhibit. Mr. Johnstone's own words show that this is what he intended, for in replying to Mr. Taylor, of Illinois.

As the paragraph relates to the exhibit to be made by the United States and the several States of the Union. It is so clear, I think, that it plainly says that this exhibit by the Government concerns to have the Exhibition remain closed on Sunday.

And again in another place:---

This amendment if adopted would simply mean that part of the Federal Government, and all others exhibit at the Federal Government, and all others exhibit at the Columbian Exposition, and that the fair should be closed on Sunday during the Exhibition.

And again in still another place:---

The point I desire to emphasize is, we have a right to cast this appropriation of money of the Government, on terms dictated by the people with which, the fund is to be expended shall it not be.

And again, at the close of the second day's argument on the amendment offered by Mr. Dockery: "That the Government exhibit at the World's Columbian

Exposition shall not be proposed to the public on Sundays" had been adopted, Mr. Johnstone, is in said no condition the exhibit of the Government upon the Sunday closing the entire Fair, offered his previous proposition as an amendment to the substitute, even after that had been passed as the completed action upon, the subject and there was nothing before the House.

Mr. Johnstone's seat in this matter is shown by the Record which names him as being in the first thirty-seven times in the different rollcalls. In six of these cases he offered that proposition; he assumed the responsibility and the authorship of the position of this question upon the House, and in every case the satisfaction that which was done is the matter, although it is different from that which he wished done, not to a kind, but only in degree. This kind of legislation asked, and which was secured, is religious legislation. It legislates upon religious questions contrary to the Constitution of the United States is it was established, and it is not? If it is, as how will deny, Congress was adopted by the Constitution is justified in legislating upon religious questions and Mr. Johnstone with one exception gave his influence to that, and not only ignored an express provision of the Constitution, but he, more than any other, tempted to delude Congress into meddling in an appropriation, a measure not only really compelling the Managers of the World's Fair to themselves close, but are since also to a religious sect furnishable by state also provide and make an assembly of the appropriation for its own exhibit.

Mr. Johnstone's course in this was more, we were really being made a subject of considerable censure, what characterized him, facts could be used which would to form wrong or injustice. W. H. M.
