# The Republican Platform and the Catholic Church.

THE Republican National Committee was urged to adopt the proposed Sixteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, offered by the National Reform Association and its allied organizations, as a plank in the Republican platform.

The memorial to the committee claims that---

> This Amendment has been introduced into the Fifty-first, and again into the Fifty-second Congress; its constitutionality has been affirmed by the Supreme Court Grant; introduced by Mr. States, passed the Senate without debate; it was endorsed by the Republican convention of 1876, the broadest religious organizations of the country, ninety patriotic organizations, and very many of the leading papers of the country.

This is the anti-Roman Catholic constitutional amendment, and the demand is that the platform of the Republican Party shall commit the nation to anti-Catholic worship in religion. This is as extremely dangerous to religious liberty as it would be to have a union of religion with the politics of this Nation, and originates as much in bigotry and religious intolerance as any demand that Roman Catholics ever made. This amendment proposes to take all the schools under their charge, and in some cases, especially in the case of the Indian schools, to get the Government money in support of religion. She is justified and with just as much propriety as was the support of religion by the State of Massachusetts, as follows:

> That no State shall ever make or maintain any law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; and that each State shall maintain a system of free public schools.

the rendering of financial aid by the Government to organizations falling under their definition of sectarianism. They would earnestly pray that it prohibited the Government, either State or national, from promoting or giving any sanction to any religion by legislation.

But the Republican platform did not contain such a clause as that asked, unless this can be so construed.

We declare our devotion to liberty of thought and conscience; of speech and the press; and we approve the refusal of the last Republican Congress to countenance interference in the affairs of the education of the children of any community, and we believe in the spirit of religious liberty, we are opposed to any union of Church and State.

It may be found, upon analysis, quite difficult to obtain any definite meaning from this clause, but perhaps the nearest that we come to what it was drawn to convey, says, is to conceal thought. W. H. M.
