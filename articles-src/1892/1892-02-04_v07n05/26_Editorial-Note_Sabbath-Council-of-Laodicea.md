AT an entertainment given by the Humboldt Verein, of Columbus, Ohio, in that city, lately, during an address upon the subject, "The Sabbath and the New Testament," Dr. J. B. Schuller said:—

> "Finally in 364, the council of Laodicea declared the Sunday as the weekly rest day, for those Christians who wished to keep one, and prohibited for the first time the keeping of the Old Testament Sabbath ordained by Jehovah himself. Notwithstanding this decree of the church, the quarrel about the Saturday and Sunday Sabbath never ended in the Christian Church; at present it appears to break out anew. Two great Christian sects, the Seventh-day Adventists, and the Seventh-day Baptists, which keep the Sabbath according to the Decalogue, are persecuted by all Puritan Christian sects, who influence and control our legislative bodies. To our shame it must be said that the Republic has degraded herself to imprison and fine peaceable and industrious citizens because they worship God according to the dictates of their consciences—though our Constitution proclaims freedom of conscience to all. The American Sabbath question is not merely a question of how people spend their weekly rest day, but a great principle, liberty of conscience is involved; the existence of our Republic and her liberties depend on it. If her citizens submit to one of the dictates of the enslaving power of a despotic Puritanism, gradually they will submit to all."
