The *Christian Nation*, the organ of the Reformed Presbyterians, the prime movers in the National Reform movement, has a department devoted to "Christian Politics," conducted by Prof. W. J. Coleman, Professor of Political Science, in their denominational college. At the head of this department, in their issue of December 9, is the following:

> God, who is the source of all authority, has appointed our Lord Jesus Christ the ruler of nations. The Bible, God's revealed will, contains law for nations, and is the standard by which all moral issues in political life are to be decided. National acknowledgment of this authority, and obedience to this law, constitute a truly Christian nation.

Where is the Bible warrant for this statement? Christ says very plainly, John 18:36, "My kingdom is not of this world." Then any scripture that would convey the idea that he is king of the nations, must be made to apply to a time in the future beyond "this world." For nothing could be plainer than his statement, "My kingdom is not of this world."

Further, where is there a scripture which teaches us to take the Bible as a standard for "all moral issues in political life"? The Bible is a standard to the Christian in every form of life, and it can be to none other. And for the Christian to undertake to intrude it as a standard of "political life" is simply to compel contempt for the very book the teachings of which he is trying to advance. Have we not had enough of this old idea that we must compel men to believe and think according to some man-made standard? For when the Bible is set up as a standard and the civil power attempts to compel the observance of its teachings, it is not the Bible, but their ideas of it, that are thus being imposed upon the people. And it is a sorry thing for the country that so much of this sixteenth century rubbish is being brought out and ardently advocated.

But how about that "Christian nation"? "National acknowledgment, and obedience to this law constitute a truly Christian nation," so says the quotation. Has this Nation ever made any such acknowledgment? Most assuredly not. Then according to the above definition, this is not a "Christian Nation." Yet all these National Reformers are constantly urging measures upon us, because, they say, we are a Christian Nation. When it serves their purpose best, they insist that we are a Christian Nation, but at other times they manufacture definitions that show us not to be such at all. While in reality it takes more than simple definitions or assertions to make either Christians or Christian nations.
