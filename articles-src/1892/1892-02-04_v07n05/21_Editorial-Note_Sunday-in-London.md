UNDER the title, "Sunday in London," the Jewish Times gives a picture of London Sundays which does not comport with the accepted idea of the enforced Sunday quiet of that city. The Times says:

> "For a large portion of the poorer classes in London, Sunday is the great trading day—a weekly fair, on which they make the bulk of their purchases. From an early hour till noon, and more or less through the day, whole streets and quarters of the metropolis are turned into noisy open markets. All the shops are open, costermongers throng the walks, groceries, bread, meat, clothing, fish, vegetables, crockery ware, cheap jewelry, all sorts of things bought by the lower classes are cried and sold.—The crowd, one half women, is impassable. It is ragged and dirty as well. The noise is deafening. In vain the church bells are ringing; they are not heard nor heeded.

> "At one o'clock the public houses are opened, and the thirsty crowd rushes into them for gin and beer. The squares and streets of the fashionable quarters are as quiet as any one could desire. The shops in the better class of streets are all closed. except confectioners and tobacconists—cigars and sugar plums being necessarily sold on Sundays; but just turn out of Holborn in Leather Lane, or visit the new Cut, in Lambeth, and a half dozen other localities, on Sunday morning, and you will hear what no one can describe.

> "As to the people who market on Sunday, it is the only day on which they have leisure and money to make their purchases."
