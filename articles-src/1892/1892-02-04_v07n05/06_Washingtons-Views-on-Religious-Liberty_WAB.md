Although Washington had never as decided views as had Jefferson, Madison, and Monroe on individual liberty, yet being so prominent in our revolutionary history, and subsequently being selected by the American people as their first president, and having well defined religious views, we naturally look to him for the more conservative view of religious liberty,—the views which have been more generally followed in practice by the American Nation. He was more a practical man than a philosopher; and, especially in his youth he followed more in the line of custom and conservatism than in the more advanced ideas of civil and religious liberty of the times. But as time went on and he had more to do with government, as he was brought more in contact with other statesmen, his views became more and more marked in favor of absolute liberty, whether political or religious.

Illustrative of his views early in life, Sparks says that—

> In his first military campaigns he was careful to have religious services performed regularly in camp. Even in the midst of active scenes at the Great Meadows this was the daily practice. During the French war, when the Government of Virginia neglected to provide chaplains for the army, he remonstrated against such an impropriety, and urged his request till they were appointed.

Washington was an active church member, and "while in retirement at Mt. Vernon," says Sparks "he took a lively interest in church affairs, regularly attending public worship, and being at different times a vestryman in two parishes." And one entry in his diary is, "Went to church, and fasted all day." Although he had seven miles to go to attend church, Sparks says that "a Sabbath rarely occurs in which it is not recorded [in his diary] that he went to church. If there was an omission it was caused by the weather, or badness of the roads."

So from Washington being a conservative man and always taking a lively interest in church affairs, his ideas on religious liberty will ever be interesting as marking the conservative view on that question; while the views of Jefferson and Madison will be equally interesting as marking the more advanced ideas of the times. The views of both classes are impressed upon the State documents of the times, and represent the ideas which were intended to be inserted in the great fundamental charters of the American political system.

In a reply, August 19, 1789, to an address from the Protestant Episcopal Church, Washington says:—

> On this occasion it would ill become me to conceal the joy I have felt in perceiving the fraternal affection which appears to increase every day among the friends of genuine religion. It affords edifying prospects, indeed, to see Christians of every denomination dwell together in more charity [in the United States, under our secular Government], and conduct themselves in respect to each other with a more Christian-like spirit than ever they have done in any former age, or in any other nation. *Writings of Washington, Vol. 12, page 404.*

Again, in a letter to Sir Edward Newenham (Oct. 20, 1792), while President, he writes:—

> Of all the animosities which have existed among mankind, those which are caused by a difference of sentiments in religion appear to be the most inveterate and distressing, and ought most to be deprecated. I was in hopes that the enlightened and liberal policy, which has marked the present age, would at least have reconciled Christians of every denomination so far that we should never again see their religious disputes carried to such a pitch as to endanger the peace of society.

In his often quoted reply to the address of the Baptists of Virginia, in May 1789, Washington thus set forth his views on this important question:—

> If I could have entertained the slightest apprehension, that the Constitution framed in the convention, when I had the honor to preside, might possibly endanger the religious rights of any ecclesiastical society, certainly I would never have placed my signature to it; and, if I could now conceive that the general Government might be so administered as to render the liberty of conscience insecure, I beg you will be persuaded, that no one would be more zealous than myself to establish effectual barriers against the horrors of spiritual tyranny, and every species of religious persecution. For you doubtless remember, that I have often expressed my sentiments that every man, conducting himself as a good citizen, and being accountable to God alone for his religious opinions, ought to be protected in worshiping the Deity according to the dictates of his own conscience.

Like Madison, too, he held that this liberty is a right, not merely a blessing conferred by the Government. It is the citizen's place to assert his religious rights, not to ask for this liberty as a favor from the Government. And when Government has guaranteed all these rights—absolute freedom in religious worship—it has done no more than was its duty to do and a citizen is under no special obligation to the Government on that account. The citizen pays his taxes, to have his rights secured, and the Government is then in duty bound to protect his religious rights just as truly as it is bound to protect his life or property. Washington says:—

> Government being, among other purposes, instituted to protect the consciences of men from oppression, it certainly is the duty of rulers, not only to abstain from it themselves, but according to their stations, to prevent it in others.

> The liberty enjoyed by the people of these States, of worshiping Almighty God, agreeable to their consciences, is not only among the choicest of their blessings, but also of their *rights* [italics Washington's]. While men perform their social duties faithfully, They do all that society or the State can with propriety demand or expect; and remain responsible only to their Maker for the religion, or mode of faith, which they may prefer or profess.—*Reply to Address of the annual Conference of Quakers, October 1799. Writings of Washington, Vol. 12, page 168.*

He wrote a number of other equally emphatic epistles declaring these same views. But probably no document, in reference to religious liberty during his administration, caused so much discussion or settled more authoritatively the American doctrine of the relation of government and religion than did the treaty with Tripoli, made Nov. 4, 1796. Article 11, of that treaty asserted emphatically that "The Government of the United States of America is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion;" this statement expressing the views of the Constitution that was then taken by all parties—both its friends and its enemies; the former considering this a laudable characteristic, while the latter considered it a fatal defect: but at that time there was no question but that the Constitution completely secularized our political system, and the Tripolitan treaty was merely a statement of the generally accepted idea at home, an idea which the administration wished also to have understood abroad. The Government was not founded on, nor did it favor or establish any religion whatever; but was founded on natural rights—the rights bestowed by the Creator—and all had an equal claim on governmental protection,—religious belief in no way affecting such a claim either pro or con.

"These views of toleration," says Sparks, "and of the connection between religion and government, are often repeated both in his private and public writings." *Writings of Washington, Vol. 12, appendix, page 404.*

From these views, from a conservative standpoint, we can see how clearly and how thoroughly were the ideas of religious liberty implanted in the minds of American statesmen a century ago. And it is only by standing uncompromisingly upon these American principles that we can successfully oppose the threatened dangers of Sunday laws and religious teaching in public schools.
