The New York *Voice*, the leading organ of the Prohibitionists, has been making some very severe criticisms of the churches and ministers that have not endorsed the Prohibition Party movement. The denunciations have been carried so far as to recommend that Prohibitionists withdraw from "such churches and have nothing to do with them." If the *Voice* correctly represented the sentiment of the Prohibition Party, it could be readily seen that what it proposes to build up is a pure hierarchy. For if a man can do nothing in his church that is out of harmony with the decrees of the political bosses, what is it but a political party domineering over the consciences of men in matters of religious faith? But it is a source of encouragement to know that some Prohibitionists dissent from such theories, as the following editorial, with the heading given above, in the *Lever*, a Prohibitionist paper of Chicago, will show:

> The *Lever* believes that great harm may come to the cause of prohibition by the intolerant attitude of some of its most devout friends who will not brook the contrary opinion of other men or give excuse. The New York *Voice* has of late spoken out against the Church as in league with the saloon, and from all quarters have come the praises of well meaning men. Urged on by such radicalism, this authority sets itself up as a high pope, infallible in judgment, unerring in reason, and ex-communicates the whole body of 4,000,000 church voters who do not vote as it dictates.

> The Prohibition Party has nothing whatever to do with the Church. Let the Church purge itself. The Prohibition Party is not the Church. It is time men see these things. There is wickedness in the Prohibition Party, there have been wrong actions, and yet no one makes a stronger protest than Prohibitionists when some church or minister attacks our party. The Church has some right to take cognizance of wrong in our party, for the Church is an organization which treats of morale, but the Prohibition Party has no right to take cognizance of evil in the Church. The party was not organized for reforming the individual but to correct the abuses of the State. If moral betterment comes with it, that is but a result. Too long already has the Prohibition Party gone on the line that its mission was reformation of the individual. With that the party has nothing to do.

> The party is organized to control government, to fill the offices for the purpose of carrying out certain acts necessary to make what it believes to be the best government. The party in power is the government. In this country Church and State have been declared forever divided. If the party in power is to prescribe the duty of the Church, then is the State acting for the Church, and the Church is under authority. The Prohibition Party has no right to say what shall constitute the religious belief of any Church. The moment it does that it sets itself up as a religious hierarchy. If the Methodist Church says to license is sin, let the Church attend to its own sinners. The Prohibition Party is not here to punish sinners or lay down a rule of morale. The worst sinner in the United States, if he works and votes for the Prohibition Party, is just as good a Prohibitionist as the saint-liest bishop in any church who votes the same ticket. . . . The welfare of the citizen in the future world is not the concern of the Prohibition Party organization. . . .

> A political party does not offer spiritual advice; it does not pretend to even favor the Christian religion. A Jew is just as welcome as the Christian; a pagan or an atheist should be also. Even the drunkard, if he votes the Prohibition Party ticket, is a Prohibitionist, and is welcome.

> The Church is organized for one purpose, a political party for another. It is not the object of the Church to govern in civil affairs; it is not the object of the party to govern in religious affairs.

This is sober sense. If the principles here expressed had been understood and acted upon from the beginning, the liquor question would be in a fair way to be settled to-day, and the manufacture and sale of all destructive agents soon be under complete control. The Prohibitionists are responsible for their own failure because of their error in attacking a civil question from a religious and moral standpoint.
