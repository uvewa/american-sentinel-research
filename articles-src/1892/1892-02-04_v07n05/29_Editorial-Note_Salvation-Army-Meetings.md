THE English Courts have very properly affirmed the right of the Salvation Army to hold out-door meetings in England. The facts are thus stated: The army held meetings on Sundays in the open air, the authorities pronounced them violations of the Improvement act, and by special decree forbade all such meetings under penalty. The decree was disregarded. Arrests followed.
