THE Christian Statesman, in an editorial, voices this threat against the World's Fair management: "Let it also be remembered that the charter of the World's Fair binds it to observe the laws of Illinois, and it will be seen that if petitions fail, prosecutions will be in order."

The same editorial quotes Senator Pettigrew as saying the subject of the Sunday-closing petition was a local issue, and on that account thinks that "evidently the Senator uses his head only for a hatrack." It is a problem what use for a hat at all they can have who think the United States can properly interfere with the municipal government of Chicago to say that the World's Fair, or anything else within that municipality, shall close on Sunday or any other day.
