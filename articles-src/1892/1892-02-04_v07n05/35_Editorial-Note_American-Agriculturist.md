An epitome of the present situation of American agriculture forms a prominent and the most practical and valuable feature of the American Agriculturist (New York) for January, in which issue this old reliable magazine celebrates its fiftieth anniversary. In this epitome our relation to the world's food supply is given, and an estimate of American production and requirements. It is the first complete presentation of the laborious studies of C. Wood Davis, and apparently justifies his predictions of the brilliant future that awaits the American farmer. Mr. Davis's opinions and data carry great weight in the commercial and agricultural world because of his exhaustive inquiry of production in its relation to population, not only in the United States, but in all the principal importing and exporting countries of the world. He shows that from 1870 to 1880 the bread-eating populations increased 11.4 per cent. and the wheat area 15.6 per cent., while the rye area was unchanged, but during the ten years just closed, the increase in the wheat and rye area was but 1.4 per cent., against an increase in the bread-eating populations of 14 per cent. In other words, consumption increased ten times as fast as production. These studies show that in 1871 the total wheat exports of the United States, Europe, India, and Australia were only 120 million bushels, while the price in India, on the Atlantic Seaboard, at Chicago and in Liverpool averaged $1.46 per bushel. The price steadily declined to $1.13 as the average in 1883, when exports had more than doubled, and has since fallen to 88c, as the price for 1889. Hence, the probability of an advance in future.
