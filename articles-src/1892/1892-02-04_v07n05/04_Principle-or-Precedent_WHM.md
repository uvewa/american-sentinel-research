THE Government of the United States, upon which the State governments individually depend, and to which they look for their authority, was established upon certain fundamental principles. These were declared in the Declaration of Independence, of which the Constitution is the formal authoritative expression, developed into legislative form, to be the self-evident truths of the equality of all men in the eyes of their Maker, for he is no respecter of persons; and that all, without exception, are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that to secure these rights this Government was instituted, deriving its just powers from the consent of the governed,—as fully described in the terse Saxon of that representative American, which no voter can fail to understand, "A government of the people, by the people, and for the people." It is these principles and such as these which make the "fundamental legal basis" upon which this Government is established, and upon the security of which depend the liberties and the consequent welfare and prosperity of the American people. The binding force of these principles has been acknowledged in the Constitution-making of every one of the forty-four States of the Union. That they are fundamental in our national polity, and constitute the safe-guard of every citizen within American boundaries,—even following him as a sort of political halo which makes him a marked man in foreign lands, is the patriotic creed of every American,—his sacred profession of political faith and belief. And well it might be, for here is the gospel of equal justice to all men, without distinction, first preached on earth by Jesus Christ, and now first formulated into human law. For the first and only time in the history of the world, unadulterated civil justice and equity, without qualification, finds its open expression as the basis of the governmental fabric. These principles are divine. With the same even hand with which Christ himself discriminated between things civil and things religious, human enactment and divine command, this distinction is made in the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution and its amendments, and through them all, is as true to the line as though given by inspiration. These are the principles of a just government, as blessed as the gospel, for they are gospel, and as eternal as God and his justice.

But co-existent with these principles in the fundamental law stands a body of statute law, having its origin in human error and dependent for its maintenance upon judicial and legal respect for its age, as a precedent which has stood in the common law, since when the memory of man runneth not to the contrary, and in English Church and State statute law, since the enactment of the laws of King Athelstan and the Statute 27 Henry VI., of which Blackstone, in his chapter on "Offenses Against God and Religion," says:—

> Profanation of the Lord's day, vulgarly (but improperly) called Sabbath breaking is a ninth offense against God and religion, punished by the municipal law of England. For besides the notorious indecency and scandal of permitting any secular business to be publicly transacted on that day, in a country professing Christianity, and the corruption of morals which usually follows its profanation, the keeping of one day in the seven holy, as a time of relaxation and refreshment as well as for public worship, is of admirable service to a State, considered merely as a civil institution. It humanizes, by the help of conversation and society, the manners of the lower classes; which would otherwise degenerate into a sordid ferocity and savage selfishness; it enables the industrious workman to pursue his occupation in the ensuing week with health and cheerfulness; it imprints on the minds of the people that sense of their duty to God, so necessary to make them good citizens; but which yet would be worn out and defaced by an unremitted continuance of labor, without any stated times of recalling them to the worship of their Maker. And therefore the laws of King Athelstan forbade all merchandizing on the Lord's day, under very severe penalties.

> And by the statute 27 Hen. VI., c. 5, no fair or market shall be held on the principal festivals, Good Friday, or any Sunday (except the four Sundays in harvest), on pain of forfeiting the goods exposed to sale. And since by the statute 1 Car. 1, c. 1, no person shall assemble out of their own parishes, for any sport whatever upon this day; nor, in their own parishes, shall use any bull or bear-baiting, interludes, plays, or other unlawful exercise, or pastimes; on pain that every offender shall pay 3s. 4d. to the poor. This statute does not prohibit, but rather impliedly allows, any innocent recreation or amusement within their respective parishes, even on the Lord's day, after divine service is over. But by statute 29 Car. II., c. 7, no person is allowed to work on the Lord's day or use any boat or barge, or expose any goods to sale; except meat in public houses, milk at certain hours, and works of necessity or charity, on forfeiture of 5s. Nor shall any drover, carrier, or the like, travel upon that day, under pain of twenty shillings.

Judge Cooley's comment upon this in his edition of Blackstone's commentaries is:—

> In the United States, generally, by statute, persons are prohibited by law from following their ordinary calling on Sunday, and contracts entered into on that day are made void. These statutes have sometimes been assailed as unconstitutional, because encroaching upon religious liberty; but the courts have sustained them.

In that last clause lies the clue to the cause of the survival of this fatal error which has set at variance the constitutional fabric and the statute law of this Nation.

In 1741, by and with consent of his majesty's council, and General Assembly of North Carolina, his excellency Gabriel Johnson, Esq., Governor of that province, enacted a Sunday law in consonance with the law of King Athelstan, and the statutes of Kings Henry and Charles,—which recites that,—

> Whereas, in well regulated governments effectual care is always taken that the day set apart for public worship be observed and kept holy, all and every person or persons whatsoever shall on the Lord's day, commonly called Sunday, carefully apply themselves to the duties of religion and piety, etc.

This was enacted while the province was subject to a State religion, but was retained after the Revolution, and incorporated into the laws of Tennessee, and in 1803, after Tennessee had been admitted to statehood, the Legislature passed an act of similar import in the direct line of descent from the professed religious act of North Carolina. This act, and those, which, by the force of the erroneous precedent, thus established, have grown up around it, constitute to-day the religious laws of Tennessee, and are responsible for the antagonisms which exist now between the constitutional and statute law of that State which have become manifest in the case of the State of Tennessee vs. R. M. King, and other cases more or less similar.

In this hasty outline a clue is given to the origin of the conflicting principles and precedents,—one arising from the divine principle of unalloyed right, the other from the precedents of human error. The principle stands eternal and alone, the precedents multiply continually. There is no question as to which will eventually conquer; but when, how, and through what bitter tribulation?
