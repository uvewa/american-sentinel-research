THE United Presbyterian tells of the organization in Butler, Pennsylvania, of a "Lord's Day League," the object of which, is "to restrict Sabbath desecration." In other parts of Pennsylvania the same end is sought by means of "purely civil" organizations known as "Law and Order Leagues." The good people of Butler will probably learn erelong that when they wish to invoke the civil law to enforce religious ordinances, the temper and prejudices of the American people demand that they shall mask their real designs under the cloak of civil order. Barnum's success as a showman is said to have been due to the fact that Americans love to be humbugged, and whatever success attends the "civil Sabbath" movement, must be attributed to the same peculiarity of the American mind.
