W. J. ROBINSON, D.D., has, in the United Presbyterian, of December 24, 1891, an article, from which the following facts are extracted just as he gave them:—

> During the past summer a certain excursion boat, called the Mayflower, plying the rivers about Pittsburg, commenced a series of Sabbath day trips from Pittsburg to McKee's Rocks. Large crowds of pleasure loving Sabbath desecrators availed themselves of the opportunity to spend the Sabbath in that suburban retreat. The Law and Order Association of Pittsburg and Allegheny promptly made information against the officers and crew of the Mayflower, for violation of the statute of the commonwealth, forbidding worldly employment on the Sabbath. They were duly convicted and fined, according to the statute, by the magistrate. Appeal was taken to the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, on the ground that the defendant boat was used as a ferry, and, therefore, came within the exceptions of the act of 1794. Now, to the joy of every lover of good order and decency in our county, the judgment of the lower court was affirmed by the superior. The decision is especially gratifying in the fact of the manifest heartiness with which his honor, Judge Ewing, makes it, and the assurance which is thus given that the judicial authority vested in him is freely wielded against this demoralizing Sabbath excursion business. . . . He says: "These Sabbath trips of the Mayflower were palpably mere pleasure excursions on the part of the passengers, and were mere special excursions given by the boat owners for hire, without the shadow of protection under the proviso to the act. The defendants were clearly performing their ordinary worldly employment, and were not in any sense ferrymen."

Upon the mere question of law the Judge was probably correct. It is very likely that the intention of the lawmakers was not to except such excursions. But that only proves that Sunday laws, instead of being in the interests of the "toiling masses," the "poor laboring man," as is so persistently plead for them, if rightly enforced, make it impossible for tens of thousands in our large cities ever to visit the country and receive the benefits which come from such recreation; and which are so eagerly sought by those who, by their occupations, are necessarily confined within hot offices and dirty shops during the hours of labor, and whose means do not enable them to have bright airy rooms in which to rest and sleep.

The cheap, Sunday excursion is about the only recreation within the reach of multitudes, and while it is not perfect it is decidedly preferable to spending the day in the saloon or even in many so-called "homes" in the tenement districts of our cities. If the State will insist upon the people being idle upon one day in the week, whether they want to or not, instead of making it impossible for them to exchange the city for the country for a few hours, it should encourage something of this kind. The better way, however, would be to leave the individual as free upon Sundays as upon other days to do as he wills, and then, what are now troublesome questions would easily adjust themselves. The readiness of our courts to enforce such laws as the Pennsylvania Sunday statute of 1794 is an evil omen for the rightful liberty of the individual citizen, and a cause for alarm rather than congratulation.
