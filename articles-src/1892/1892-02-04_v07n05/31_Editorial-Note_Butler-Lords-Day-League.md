THE United Presbyterian, of Pittsburg, is authority for the statement that the "Lord's Day League," of Butler, Pennsylvania, is endeavoring to suppress the sale of Sunday papers in that place on the "sacred day of rest." "Those who have the matter in hand," says the Presbyterian, "are not to be turned aside by taunts and bluster; too long have Christian people been quiescently permitting 'Sunday' newspapers and saloon-keepers to define what is lawful on the Sabbath." There is no "civil Sabbath" or "American Sunday" nonsense about this. The mask is thrown aside and it is boldly declared that they seek to enforce a religious institution. If this were done everywhere the question would be very much simplified.
