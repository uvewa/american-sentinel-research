# Principle or Precedent?

THE Government of the United States, upon which the State governments fully depend, and to which they look for their authority, was established upon certain fundamental principles. These were declared in the Declaration of Independence, of which the Constitution is the formal authoritative expression, developed into legislative form, to be the self-evident truths of the equality of all men in the eyes of their Maker, for he is no respecter of persons; and that all, without exceptions, are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that to secure these rights this Government was instituted, deriving its just powers from the consent of the governed,\u2014as set forth distinctly in the famous declaration of that representative American, which no voter must fail to understand, "A government of the people, by the people, and for the people." It is these principles and such as these which make the "fundamental legal basis" upon which the Government is established, and upon the security of which depend the liberties and the consequent welfare and prosperity of the American people. The binding force of these principles has been acknowledged in the Constitution-making of every one of the forty-four States of the Union. That they are fundamental in our national polity, and constitute the safe-guard of every citizen within American boundaries,\u2014even following him as a sort of bullet-proof hall which makes him a marked man in foreign lands, is the patriotic creed of political faith and belief. And well it might be, for here is the gospel of equal justice to all men, without distinction, first preached on earth by Jesus Christ, and now first formulated into human law. For the first and only time in the history of the world, unamended civil justice and equity, without qualification, finds its open expression as the basis of the government here. These principles are divine. With the same even hand with which Christ himself distributed between things civil and things religious, human conscience and divine command, this distinction is made in the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution and its amendments, and through them all, is as true to the line as though given by inspiration. These are the principles of a just government, as blessed as the gospel, for they are gospel, and as eternal as God and the right.

But co-existent with these principles is the fundamental law\u2014even a body of statute law, having its origin in Roman statute law, having its origin in Roman law itself, and depending for its maintenance upon judicial and legal respect for its age, as a precedent which has stood in the common law, since when the history of man runneth not to the contrary, and in English Church and State statute law, since the enactment of the laws of King Athelstan and the Statute of Henry VI., of which Blackstone, in his chapter on "Offences Against God and Religion," says:\u2014

> Profanation of the Lord\u2019s day, vulgarly (but improperly) called Sabbath-breaking, is a ninth offence against God and religion, punished by the municipal law. For, besides the notorious indecency and scandal of permitting any secular business to be publicly transacted on that day, in a country professing Christianity, the keeping of one day in the seven holy, as a time of relaxation and refreshment as well as for public worship, is of admirable service to a State, considered merely as a civil institution. It is by the help of conversation and society, the inseparable part of our lives; clearly it enables the industrious workman to pursue his occupation with health and cheerfulness; it imprints on the minds of the people that sense of their duty to God, so necessary to make them good citizens; but which yet would be worn out and defaced by an unremitted continuance of labor, without any stated times of reckoning them in the worship of their Maker. And therefore the laws of King Athelstan forbids all merchandising on the Lord\u2019s day, under very severe penalties. And by the statute of 27 Hen. VI., c. 5, no fair or market shall be held on the principal festivals, Good Friday, or any Sunday (except the four Sundays in harvest); on pain of forfeiting the goods exposed to sale. And also by the statute 1 Car. II., c. 1, no person shall assemble out of their own parishes, on the Lord\u2019s day, for any sport or pastime; nor, in their own parishes, shall use any bull or bear-baiting, interludes, plays, or other unlawful exercises or pastimes, on pain that every offender shall pay 5 s. or sit in the stocks for two hours.

Now the origin of the conflicting principles and precedents,\u2014one arising from the divine principle of inalienable right, the other from the precedents of human error. The principle stands eternal and holy, the precedents modify continually. There is no question as to which will eventually overcome; but when, how, and through what the actual tribulation\u2014
