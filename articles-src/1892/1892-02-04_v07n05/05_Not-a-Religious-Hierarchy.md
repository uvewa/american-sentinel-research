# “Not a Religious Hierarchy.”

THE *New York Voice*, the leading organ of the Prohibitionists, has been making some very vigorous criticisms of certain churches and ministers that have not endorsed the Prohibition Party movement.

The denominations have been carried so far as to occasion that churches have withdrawn from “such churches and have nothing to do with them.” If the *Voice* correctly represented the sentiment of the Prohibition Party, it could be really seen that what it proposes to build up is a pure hierarchy. For if a man can do nothing in his church that is not of harmony with the decrees of the political bosses, what is it but a political party demanding and the coercion of men in matters of religious faith? But it is a source of national argument to show that some Prohibitionists dissent from such theories, as the following editorial, with the heading given above, in the *Lever*, a Prohibitionist paper shows:—

The *Lever* believes that great harm may come of the cause of prohibition by some of the most devout friends who will not see it.

The *New York Voice* bar of late spoken with no uncertain voice against national churches, and from all quarters have come the protests of the church-going Prohibition voters. At the same time, the enforced unity set itself up as a high pope, in excommunicating the whole body of 3,000,000 church voters who do not vote as it commands.

The Prohibition Party has nothing whatever to do with the Church. The second great principle of the Prohibition Party platform is the States’ rights on these things. There is wideness in the party for the better class of voters on all sides except convictionists and saloon-keepers—cigars and cigarettes—just as much so as for prohibitionists. Put just turn out of Hollister to Coulter Lane, or into any city, N. Y. City, Louisville, and a half dozen other localities, on Monday morning, and you will hear what one can see for themselves.

As to the people themselves, is it any worse on the days on which they have leisure and money to spend in resorts to which to eat and sleep?

The cheap, Sunday excursion is about the only recreation within the reach of multitudes, and while it is not perfect it is decidedly preferable to spending the day in the dilapidated misery-cursed tenements or “walking” in the basement districts of our cities. If the State will insist upon the people being idle upon one day in the week, whether they want to or not, instead of making it impossible for them to exchange the city for the country for a few hours, it should take concrete something of this kind. The better way, however, would be to leave the individual as free upon Sundays as upon other days to do as he wills, and then, what is not troublesome nor oppressive will easily adjust themselves. The readiness of our courts to enforce such laws as the Pennsylvania Sunday statutes of this is the evil omen for the rightful liberty of the industrial citizen, and a cause of far more rather than congratulation, to a Christian.
