RELIGION being a matter of private concern, something between the soul and its God, civil government organized solely for the public good, can not extend its agency to the administration or regulation of religion, without usurping the divine prerogative, and trampling on man's rights at the same time. No human authority can divorce a soul from his obligations to the law of Jehovah, nor properly coerce one into piety, since his reason and conscience are peculiarly his own, and must remain so, as long as he lives. Man's obligations, therefore, which bind him to God, make him free in this respect, from human authority. Yet religious freedom is not freedom from all human authority, but freedom to follow the dictates of conscience without hindrance.
