# The National Reform Scheme.

NATIONAL Reformers, so-called, in their energetic and persistent efforts to clothe the civil government with authority to repudiate the idea of any separation of church and state, and to make the State force church and points of religious usage as a great a priority, cite the same national will of their scheme comes to the surface. The plot of this modern Politico-religious Judgeism that is the so-called American Sabbath Union, with its religious organizations, is to lead the way to obtain general favor among the people. But when these two purposes have been accomplished, they stand behind the civil power and clamor for the punishment of dissent or disobedience before Pontius Pilate called for the crucifixion of the Prince of Peace.

The civil power that with Christ had no quarrel and whose representative would have shed his blood had it not been overborne by the overwhelming pressure brought to bear by the ecclesiastical powers by priests of the popular religion. It has ever been so. A Pontius Pilate figure heads about the real victims of the situation, but the charges of the victims of the hate, and the charges and the claims for punishment always come from the ecclesiastical or religious source. It has been so from the very beginning. It is the principle to defend its theself against an enemy of civil power, or to do the bidding of the Spanish Inquisition, and the bloody massacre of St. Bartholomew. On this point, Father Westager, D.D., a Jesuit, has the following testimony.

Every man not blinded by bigotry knows perfectly well that the Spanish Inquisition, and the massacre of St. Bartholomew, the cruel persecutions of the Waldenses, the burning at stake of Cranmer, Ridley and Latimer, and the execution of the Catholics in England in Queen Elizabeth’s and other reigns, had nothing at all to do with the Vespers, and the massacre of St. Bartholomew. While it lasted, the Pope exercised their almost direct offices to operate in the entire actions and processes alone—Catholicity, Protestantism, and infidels and unbelievers.

On which side of this diabolical transaction the Pope exercised his offices to “coerced action” and “perved above,” appears from the following testimony:—

When the letters of the Pope were read in the assembly of the sacrificing, by which he assured the Pope that all was enacted by his free person will and command of the king, it was immediately deemed that the Pope should march with his soldiers to the church of St. Mark, and in the most solemn manner give thanks to God for so great a blessing conferred on the face of Rome and the Christian world; and that, on Monday and after, the Christians and the church alike called to Minerva, at which the Pope, Gregory XIII., and the cardinals were present was publicly should be published throughout the whole Christian world, and the cause of its declared to be, to return thanks to God for the extirpation of the enemies of the truth and the church in France. In the evening, the cannons of St. Angelo were fired to testify the public joy the whole city illuminated with bonfires; and no one sign of rejoicing omitted that was usually seen for the greatest victories obtained in favor of the Roman Church.—*Encyclopaedia of Religious Knowledge, page 69.*

The same methods have been used against heathen by hideous systems of religion. When Buddhism had no far-off influence to Hindustan, as to render the danger the popularity of the Brahman system, that sect, “turning the destroying with the rival power, so effectually purified Hindustan from the offensive heresy, that scarcely a vestige of the Buddhist superstition is now to be traced in that country.”

In so far as any Christian church claiming for civil law to enforce or rule of its dogmas, or tages, however specious their pretense, they are fallen from the grace of God, and when a civil government accede to such demands it puts a sword into the hands of the Church wherewith to punish dissenters, and it always results in persecutions of God’s own people, although others also may be made to suffer and bleed.

“The injustice of persecution for conscience sake must appear plain to every one that possesses the least degree of thought or feeling.” To banish, imprison, plunder, starve, hang and burn men for religion is not the Gospel of Christ; it is the gospel of the devil.” We prefer new beginnings, Christianity, evidences, violence, except once; and that was it drives had made out of the temple, and not to drive them in.
