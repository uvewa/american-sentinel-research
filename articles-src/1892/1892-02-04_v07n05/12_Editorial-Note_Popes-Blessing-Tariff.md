The New York Sun is authority for the following story, which a Catholic paper remarks, "has a touch of humor in it:" "Officers of the Custom House were suddenly called upon not long since to decide the proper tariff on the Pope's blessing. A New Yorker while abroad bought two rosaries at eight dollars, for his maid servants, and then expended four dollars in having them sent to Rome for the Pope's blessing. On reaching New York the honest importer explained the whole matter to the customs officers, and said he was willing to pay duty on the full value of the articles. Accordingly he was assessed forty per cent. on rosaries as such, and thirty-five per cent. on the Pope's blessing as an article 'not otherwise provided for.'"
