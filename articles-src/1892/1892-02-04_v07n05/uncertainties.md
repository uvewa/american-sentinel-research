# Uncertainties Log - Volume 7, Number 5 (1892-02-04)

## General Notes

The OCR transcription was generally of high quality. Most text was clear and readable.

## Specific Uncertainties

### Page 6, Line 250
- **Issue:** Possible OCR error in name "Josua"
- **Transcribed as:** "We believe in the religion taught by Josua Christ."
- **Confidence:** LOW
- **Reason:** Should likely be "Jesus" - appears to be OCR misreading

### Page 6, Line 262
- **Issue:** Possible OCR error in street name
- **Transcribed as:** "43 BORN ST., NEW YORK CITY."
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM
- **Reason:** Earlier in document correctly shows "43 BOND ST." - this appears to be OCR error reading "D" as "RN"

### Page 6, Line 269
- **Issue:** Partial name/text unclear
- **Transcribed as:** "R. C. PORTER / A. F. RALLENGER / BROESTANT"
- **Confidence:** LOW
- **Reason:** These appear to be names but second line likely should be "BALLENGER" and third line unclear - possibly organizational title or role

### Page 7, Line 372
- **Issue:** Word unclear
- **Transcribed as:** "PORTFALD"
- **Confidence:** LOW
- **Reason:** Should likely be "PORTFOLIO" based on context

### Page 7, Lines 379-380
- **Issue:** Possible OCR errors in article title
- **Transcribed as:** "A Spoll of Office"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM
- **Reason:** Should likely be "A Spoil of Office" - appears twice in advertisement

### Page 7, Line 381
- **Issue:** Word unclear
- **Transcribed as:** "most tallest of story"
- **Confidence:** LOW
- **Reason:** Grammar suggests "most talked of story" or similar phrase - OCR likely misread

## Resolution Notes

- Line 250: Left as "Josua" - appears in declaration block that may have original typo
- Line 262: Left as "BORN" - transcribing exactly as OCR read it
- Line 269: Left as transcribed - unclear organizational context
- Line 372: Left as "PORTFALD" - exact OCR reading
- Lines 379-380: Left as "Spoll" - exact OCR reading
- Line 381: Left as "tallest of" - exact OCR reading
