A GENTLEMAN writes from Texas to a subscriber to THE SENTINEL:—

> "I rejoice to find that there is such an able organ devoted to maintain or rather to complete the secularizing of the State.

> "Danger is threatening both from the Catholic and from the evangelical side. So long as dogmatic zealots are conscious of forming a weak minority, they are loud in their praise of religious toleration and liberty. Whenever they feel, that, under its sheltering influence, they have gathered sufficient, strength they treacherously return to their old tricks of using the State, in order to compel others to conform to their exclusive canons. . . ."

> "It is important to keep the public vigilantly informed of the sly manoeuvrings of those un-American schemers, who are endeavoring to re-enthrall human conscience; and on this account I hope THE AMERICAN SENTINEL will be zealously and extensively circulated."
