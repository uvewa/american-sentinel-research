# Editorial.

*THE Busy Bee*, of Cumberland Gap, Tennessee, complains that that town is trying to the devil as fast as any town can go.” And yet the Gay in it a sign says where they are exceedingly zealous in enforcing the Sunday law—against seventh-day observers. What can the matter be!

\*\*\*

CATHOLICS are demanding the resignation of Mr. Ben. Butterworth, Secretary of the Executive Committee of the World’s Fair Commission, “for alleged insults” to the Pope;” and “offensive allusions to the crucifixes in Italy.” But this is worse than the National Reformers would, if they could, disfranchise all who refuse to subscribe to their creed. The spirit is the same, whether it be Roman or so-called Protestant.

\*\*\*

The English Courts have very properly sustained that right of the Salvation Army to hold out-door meetings in England. But facts are also stated, “The United States army has meetings on Sundays in the open air, the authorities making exemptions that violates of the Improvement act, and by special decree forbids all such meetings under migratory circumstances.” The decree has abrogated. Amendments are as follows.

\*\*\*

The amendment to the Constitution of the United States proposed by the National League for the Promotion of American Institutions, is good as far as it goes, but it comes short of what we say it ought to be. The proposed amendment reads:

No State shall pass any law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, or use its property or credit, or any money raised by taxation, or authorize either to be used, for the purpose of founding, maintaining, or aiding by appropriation, payment for services, expenses, or otherwise, any church, religious denomination, or religious society, or any institution, society, or undertaking which is wholly, or in part, under sectarian or ecclesiastical control.

\*\*\*

If the word “religious” were substituted for the word “sectarian” in the last clause, the amendment would be as nearly perfect of things human generally are; but as it is now stands, and as its framers and friends intend it, it leaves the door open for the coldest thing which they please to call “unsectarian Christianity.” However, the amendment as proposed is better than nothing, and might be so construed by the courts as to put an end to the relics of Church and State union that have come down to us from colonial times.

\*\*\*

The United Presbyterians, of Pittsburg, authority for the statement that the “Lord’s Day League” of Butler, Pennsylvania, is endeavoring to suppress the enforcement of Sunday papers in that place on the Sabbath. The leader is determined to fight the matter to the bitter end. “The Prohibitionist says the course to be pursued was to attack saloons and bluster; too long have Charlotte, this people been being quietly permitting Sunday” newspapers and saloon-keepers to define what is lawful on the Sabbath.” There is no “civil Sabbath” or “American Sunday” nuisance about this. The language makes it plain that the agitators of the church that they seek to enforce a religious institution. If this word were drawn where the question would be very much simplified.

\*\*\*

In the *Watchman*, of Sept. 17, 1891, Rev. A. S. T. Sweedily, D.D., in recording the result of “normal observations” in Central Park, this city, on “two unmistakably Sunday* *afternoons,” states this conclusion:—

In the duty to rest, to resolve at home and abroad the continental Sunday must be contested and defended as it is, that the Sunday of continental Europe is to us in all a norm of a holy day. Secularized as it is, it has not become secularist in all directions and all purposes. The working class itself in the one to suffer most, both materially and spiritually, from such a measure of the supposed or so-called reform.

\*\*\*

Upon this the *Sabbath Outlook* comments thus pertinently and pungently:— “To say ‘wander on continental state or ‘continental Sunday’ is the original and primary type it is a day of indulgence for the flesh. The Puritan interest to change; but the “wild-olive” will not bear sweet grapes. Because this is so, we have long seen agreed Mr. Timothy’s conclusion that it must be contested and denounced.” The well-coming doctrines which the Timothy is in fact the merest of disgrace to its own authority and its very and a hollow pretension. To any thoughtful Christian cling to it against God’s community, they use must be surprised.

\*\*\*

What answer can the Sunday advocates make to this? Sunday, as the *North British Review* puts it, was the “wild olive of all pagan times,” and a holiday will remain in spite of all efforts to clothe it with a sacred character.

\*\*\*

*The Pacific Health Journal* and *Temperance Advocate*, and the *Sabbath Recorder* both come to us this month greatly improved in appearance and as usual filled with excellent matter. The former journal should be in every home in the land, and the latter ought to be used by every worker in the Sabbath school.
