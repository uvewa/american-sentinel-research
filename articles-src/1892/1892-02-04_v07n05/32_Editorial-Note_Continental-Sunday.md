IN the Watchman, of Sept. 17, 1891, Rev. A. S. Twombly, D. D., in recording the result of "personal observations" in Central Park, this city, on "two unemployed Sunday afternoons," states this conclusion:—

> Judging, then, by results at home and abroad, the continental Sunday must be contested and denounced. If in any sense a holiday, it will soon cease to be in all senses a holy day. Secularized in any one direction, however useful in a general way, it will become secularized in all directions and departments. The working classes will be the ones to suffer most, both materially and spiritually, from such a misuse of its supreme privileges and divine appointments.

Upon this the Sabbath Outlook comments thus pertinently and pungently:—

> Does Dr. Twombly not remember that the "continental Sunday" is the original and primary type of Sunday? It's pagan holidayism was so prominent even in the time of Tertullian, that he called it "a day of indulgence for the flesh." The Puritan movement tried to change it, but the "wild olive" will not bear sweet grapes. Because this is true, we have long acted upon Mr. Twombly's conclusion that it "must be contested and denounced." The swift-coming decline which Dr. Twombly sees is but the return of Sunday to its natural and historical level. It will find that level, quick and sure. If Christians cling to it against God's commands, they will go down with it.

What answer can the Sunday advocates make to this? Sunday, as the North British Review puts it, was the "wild solar holiday of all pagan times," and a holiday it will remain in spite of all efforts to clothe it with a sacred character.
