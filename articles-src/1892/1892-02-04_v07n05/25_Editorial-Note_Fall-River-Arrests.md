THE Sunday crusade has been begun in earnest in Fall River, Massachusetts. The drug stores on Sunday, January 24, displayed signs upon their counters, "No cigars sold to-day," "No soda sold to-day," in order to avoid even the appearance of infringement of the Sunday law. The New Bedford Standard, of January 25, in a special despatch from Fall River, says:—

> "William Griffin and Patrick Connors were each fined twenty-five dollars and expenses in the Second District Court this morning for keeping open shop on the Lord's day. In the shop of Connors the police found him, Samuel Ashworth, and John Griffin, engaged in a social game of "seven up," and each was fined ten dollars and expenses, on a charge of gaming on the Lord's day. These are the first cases that have come to the attention of the court since the new crusade of the police began, but as a great many complaints were lodged by the officers yesterday, there is considerable probability that arrests and raids may be frequent during the week."
