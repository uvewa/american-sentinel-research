THE Pittsburg Commercial Gazette says that the instigators of the action against the publishing and selling of newspapers in that city on Sunday are a joint committee of the American Sabbath Association and the Law and Order League, and that these societies have a strong support there. A reporter represents Rev. J. T. McCrory, one of the editors of the Christian Statesman, as saying, when asked if the various denominations were in sympathy with the movement, that he believed "it would have the sympathy of all of them. . . . The society has been successful in removing all the most glaring desecrations of the Sabbath, with the exception of the Sunday newspapers; and to be true to its interests and objects it must suppress that. . . . The relation of the religious side of the question to the subject need not be considered as a factor; it is sufficient that the civil Sabbath is broken in this manner, and it is this evil that is sought to be remedied. . . . It may as well be definitely understood that this matter will be pushed home until the evil is suppressed. The law is clear on the subject."
