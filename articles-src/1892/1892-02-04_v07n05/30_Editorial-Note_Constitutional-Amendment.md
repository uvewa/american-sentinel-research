THE amendment to the Constitution of the United States proposed by the National League for the Protection of American Institutions, is good so far as it goes; but it comes very far short of what it ought to be. The proposed amendment is as follows:—

> No State shall pass any law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, or use its property or credit, or any money raised by taxation, or authorize either to be used, for the purpose of founding, maintaining, or aiding, by appropriation, payment for services, expenses, or otherwise, any church, religious denomination, or religious society, or any institution, society, or undertaking which is wholly, or in part, under sectarian or ecclesiastical control.

If the word "religious" were substituted for the word "sectarian" in the last clause, the amendment would be as nearly perfect as things human generally are; but as it now stands, and as its framers and friends intend it, it leaves an open door for the colorless thing which they please to call "unsectarian Christianity." However, the amendment as proposed is better than nothing, and might be so construed by the courts as to put an end to the relics of Church and State union that have come down to us from colonial days.
