# Washington's Views on Religious Liberty.

ALTHOUGH Washington had never as decided views as had Jefferson, Madison, and Monroe on individual rights, yet history, and subsequently being elected by the American people as their first president, and having well defined religious convictions of his own, he was by far the more conservative view of religious liberty,—the views which have been more generally followed in practice by the American Nation. He was more a practical man than a philosopher, and yet especially in his youth he followed more the line of custom and conservatism than the more advanced ideas of civil and religious liberty of his time. But as time went on and he had more to do with government, as he was brought more in contact with other statesmen, his views became more and more in favor of absolute liberty, whether political or religious.

Illustrative of his views early in life, Sparks says that—

In his first military campaigns he was wont to issue orders requiring soldiers to attend divine worship; but later in the midst of active action as the great Commander-in-Chief, and later still during the French war, when the Government of Virginia offered rewards to soldiers for enlistment, it provides no regulation for the exercise of compulsion against such an imposition, but left it to each man’s belief and voluntary preference.

Washington was an active church member, and “while in retirement at Mt. Vernon,” says Sparks “he took a lively interest in all church affairs regularly attended public worship, and held office at different times as vestryman in two parishes.” And on one entry in his journal, is “Went to church and fasted all day.” Although he had never made up his mind to attend church, he says that “a Sabbath rarely occurs in which it is not attended [by him] unless the weather or bad roads prevent.”

So from Washington being a conservative man and always taking a lively interest in church affairs, his ideas on religious liberty will ever be interesting as marking the conservative view on that question; especially so as the advancing ideas of his time will be equally interesting as marking the most advanced ideas of that time. The views of both classes are impressed upon the State documents of the time, and represent the ideas which were intended to be inserted in the great fundamental charter of the American political heritage.

In a reply, August 18, 1789, to an address from the Washington Protestant Episcopal Church, he said:—

On this occasion it would ill become me to conceal the joy I have felt in perceiving the fraternal affection which appears to increase every day among the friends of genuine religion. It is a subject of gratifying prospect, indeed, to see Christians of every denomination dwell together in more charity, and conduct themselves in respect to each other with a more Christian-like spirit than they have done in any former age, or in any other nation.

Again, in a letter to Sir Edward Newenham (Oct. 20, 1792), while President, he said:—

Of all the animosities which have existed among mankind, those which are occasioned by a difference of sentiments in religion appear to be the most inveterate and distressing, and ought most to be deprecated. I was in hopes that the enlightened and liberal policy which has marked the present age would at least have reconciled Christians of every denomination in America; that our particular religious disputes might be consigned to such a pitch as to endanger the peace of society.

In his often quoted reply to the address of the Baptists of Virginia, in May 1789, Washington thus set forth his views on this important question:—

If I could have entertained the slightest apprehension, that the Constitution framed in the convention, where I had the honor to preside, might possibly endanger the religious rights of any ecclesiastical society, certainly I would never have placed my signature to it; and, if I could now conceive that the general Government might ever be so administered as to render the liberty of conscience insecure, I beg you will be persuaded, that no one would be more zealous than myself to establish effectual barriers against the horrors of spiritual tyranny, and every species of religious persecution.

For you doubtless remember that I have often expressed my sentiment, that every man, conducting himself as a good citizen, and being accountable to God alone for his religious opinions, ought to be protected in worshipping the Deity according to the dictates of his own conscience.

Like Madison, too, he held that liberty is a right, not merely a blessing. Liberty is not a grant—it belongs in the citizen’s place to insist his religious right, but to ask for it only as a favor, and at the pleasure of the Government. And when asked if the Government of the United States would protect freedom in religious worship,—it has no claim on anyone from a duty to do what is asked of it from no practical purpose [by the] Government on that account. The citizen pays his taxes to have his rights secured, and the Government is the instrument of the roads.

bestowed by the Creator—and all had an equal claim on governmental protection,—“religion shall be in no way abridging or establish either pro or con.”

“To see of toleration,” says Sparks, “this is the connection between religion and government, as often repeated both in his private and public writings.” *Writings of Washington, Vol. 19, appendix, page 4.*

From these views, from a conservative standpoint, we can see how clearly and thoroughly were the ideas of religious liberty implanted in the minds of Americans a century ago. And it is these American principles that we can successfully oppose the unconstitutional and un-American movements in favor of Sunday laws and religious teaching in public schools.
