# Sunday Laws Oppress the Poor.

W. J. ROBINSON, D.D., has, in the *United Presbyterian*, of December 16, 1891, an article, from which the following facts are extracted just as he gives them:—

During the past month a certain tramp, called the *Mugdeer*, plying the rivers about from Pittsburgh to McKee’s Rocks. Large numbers of pleasure loving Sabbath desecrators availed themselves of the opportunity to spend the Sabbath in their sinful errands. The Law and Order Association of Pittsburg and Allegheny promptly made information against the officers and crew of the *Mugdeer*, for violation of the statute of the commonwealth, forbidding worldly employment on the Sabbath. They were duly arrested and tried according to the statute, by the committing Magistrate, and not before a jury; citizens of Allegheny County, on the ground that the law was within the exception of the act of 1794, namely to be the go-at of every form of good ordered and decent in our country, the judgment of the lower court was affirmed by the superior. The result is especially gratifying to the fact of the manifest fairness with which his honor, Judge Williams, makes it, and the sentences which it then gives that the judicial authority vested in him is freely wielded against this discriminating Sabbath excursion business.

In reply: “Those classes of the *Mugdeer* that procure and provide daily excursions on the part of the passengers, make use of the privilege for the purpose of weekly excursions for them, without the shadow of protection under her proviso, in law. The complaining parties were clearly performing their ordinary worldly employment, and were not in any form exempt.”

Upon the more question of law the Judge was probably correct. It is very likely that the intention of the lawmakers was not to except such excursions. But that only proves that Sunday, instead of being in the interests of the “resting masses” the “poor toiling laboring man,” as it is so persistently plead for them, is largely of entirely selfish and aristocratic, tens of thousands in large cities who ever visit the country and receive the benefits which come from such recreation, and which are so eagerly sought by those who, by their occupations, are necessarily confined within lot offices and dirty shops during the hours of labor, and whose means do not enable them to have bright spots in resorts to which to eat and sleep.

The cheap, Sunday excursion is about the only recreation within the reach of multitudes, and while it is not perfect it is decidedly preferable to spending the day in the dilapidated misery-cursed tenements or “walking” in the basement districts of our cities. If the State will insist upon the people being idle upon one day in the week, whether they want to or not, instead of making it impossible for them to exchange the city for the country for a few hours, it should take concrete something of this kind. The better way, however, would be to leave the individual as free upon Sundays as upon other days to do as he wills, and then, what is not troublesome nor oppressive will easily adjust themselves. The readiness of our courts to enforce such laws as the Pennsylvania Sunday statutes of this is the evil omen for the rightful liberty of the industrial citizen, and a cause of far more rather than congratulation, to a Christian.
