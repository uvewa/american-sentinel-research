THE newsboys of Pittsburg protest against any interference with their Sunday selling of papers, and have passed a series of characteristically worded resolutions, in which they petition "other labor people who are older and bigger than we are to help us in our fight to keep our rights and liberties." The Paper Carriers Union also condemned the action of the Law and Order League and appealed to labor unions and workingmen generally to assist them in protesting against "an objectionable and obsolete law." The glass-workers have also adopted similar resolutions.
