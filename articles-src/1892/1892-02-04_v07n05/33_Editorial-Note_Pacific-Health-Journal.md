THE Pacific Health Journal and Temperance Advocate, and the Sabbath School Worker both come to us this month greatly improved in appearance and as usual filled with excellent matter. The former journal should be in every home in the land, and the latter ought to be used by every worker in the Sabbath school.

The Health Journal is $1.00 per year; the Worker, 50 cents. Both are published at Oakland, California.
