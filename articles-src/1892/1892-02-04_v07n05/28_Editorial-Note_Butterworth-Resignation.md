CATHOLICS are demanding the resignation of Mr. Ben. Butterworth, Secretary of the Executive Committee of the World's Fair, because, forsooth, of alleged "insolence to the Pope," and "offensive allusions to the crucifixes in Italy." But this is no worse than the National Reformers, who would, if they could, disfranchise all who refuse to subscribe to their creed. The spirit is the same, whether in Romanists or so-called Protestants.
