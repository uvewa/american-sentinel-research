The Catholic Review complains that "the Government in Mexico is ruled by masonic lodges." A bad state of affairs, indeed, for the government should be controlled by the people; but since in Mexico it seems to be a choice between secret lodges and a corrupt and scheming priesthood, the Government is probably better off in the hands of the former.
