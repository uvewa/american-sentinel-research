THE Youth's Instructor, Battle Creek, Michigan, enters upon the new year greatly enlarged and improved, and is now one of the very best youth's and children's papers with which we are acquainted. The very reasonable price, seventy-five cents per single subscription, puts it within the reach of every family; and its fine illustrations and interesting reading matter can not fail to make it very popular. A feature which will commend it to thousands of little folks is the "Children's Department." If you have not seen the Instructor write to the publishers, Review and Herald, Battle Creek, Michigan, asking them for a copy.
