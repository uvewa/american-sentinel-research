# Editorial Notes.

THE Duluth Tribune thinks that “the nearest souls who are aiming to merit heaven by mending their neighbor’s religion will have to fall way themselves.”

\*\*\*

The order prohibiting the landing of immigrants to Manly, without giving the Immigration Bureau removed to Ellis Island, has been revoked, “pending instruction from the home office,” and religious are again allowed to land as soon as they whatever chance of getting in at all have.

\*\*\*

The Society of Christian Scientists of Boston, Massachusetts, takes a column in the issue of the *Christian Journal* of January 13, in their department instead of “Industrial Reform,” and publishes in the heading of principally adopted in 1886. These may concluding to one common end; for the realization and the redemption of the political economy of man.

\*\*\*

At Fall River, Massachusetts, the Society have laws passed to see that the law was not infringed, partied against those who opened their doors for hire during the day. This is quite a remarkable example of religious effort. If there are people anywhere in Fall River, they must have recalled when Feelings the village beside of children childhood’s days who have the town to see that no one else shall have any.

\*\*\*

The newsboys of Printing protest against any interference with their Sunday selling of papers, and have passed a street of characteristic youthful resolution, in which they prefer “value labor and laws” who are older and larger than was in the making of to not fright or keep out rights and free labor. The Paper Carriers Union also determination against discriminating passed to labor unions and workingmen generally what the Printing Commercial told was “just and equitable and alsmotic law.” The glass workers have also protested.

\*\*\*

*The Printing Commandel Gazette* says that the instigators of the action against the publishing and handling of newspapers on their to day a Sunday is a joint committee of the American Sabbath Association and the Lord and Order League, and that these societies have a strong rapport there. A reporterly represents that E. T. McKinley, and of the actions of the *Christian Statesman*, as saying, when asked if the various associations were to arraigned with the movement, that he believed “it would have the sympathy of all of them.” The society has been successful in receiving all the most glowing desertations of the Sabbath, with the exception of the Sunday newspapers; and to be true to its interests and objects it must suppress that . . . . The relation of the religious side of the question to the subject must not be considered as a factor; it is sufficient that the civil Sabbath is broken in this manner, and it is this that is claimed to be the strength of the movement. It is definitely understood that this matter will be made a feature of the coming campaign of the joint committee on the subject.”

\*\*\*

A GENTLEMAN writes from Texas to a subscriber here:—

“I rejoice to find that there is such an alliance as the *American Sentinel*. All honor to the cause which it serves, against the efforts of the churches to bring the same from the political side and from the evangelical side. So long as dogmatic Christianity, or any phase of it, remains in its political, they are loud in their praise of religious toleration. The absorbing influence having been gathered sufficient, through they immediately turn to hard old tricks of using the State, in order to compel all to yield and do the bidding of religious authority than scholarship, who are endeavoring to re-establish Roman control; and in this attempt I hope THE AMERICAN SENTINEL will be zealously and extensively read.”

\*\*\*

Under the title, “Sunday in London,” the *Jewish Messenger* from a correspondent in London says: “A town does not comport with the accepted idea of the Sabbath. Sunday is in England a day of gloom, a dismal one. For a large portion of the poorer classes in London, Sunday does not bring rest. At day break fair, on which they make the bulk of their purchasing. One late through the day, while streets and quantity are in the better letter of rest on all sides except convictionists and saloon-keepers—cigars and cigarettes—just as much so as for prohibitionists. Put just turn out of Hollister to Coulter Lane, or into any city, N. Y. City, Louisville, and a half dozen other localities, on Monday morning, and you will hear what one can see for themselves.

As to the people themselves, is it any worse on the days on which they have leisure and money to spend in resorts to which to eat and sleep?

\*\*\*

The cheap, Sunday excursion is about the only recreation within the reach of multitudes, and while it is not perfect it is decidedly preferable to spending the day in the dilapidated misery-cursed tenements or “walking” in the basement districts of our cities. If the State will insist upon the people being idle upon one day in the week, whether they want to or not, instead of making it impossible for them to exchange the city for the country for a few hours, it should take concrete something of this kind. The better way, however, would be to leave the individual as free upon Sundays as upon other days to do as he wills, and then, what is not troublesome nor oppressive will easily adjust themselves. The readiness of our courts to enforce such laws as the Pennsylvania Sunday statutes of this is the evil omen for the rightful liberty of the industrial citizen, and a cause of far more rather than congratulation, to a Christian.

\*\*\*

The grand old State of Tennessee is a good Christian, not to take his face by fear of the law as a hushy without violating the law. The Jew is just as appropriate to sacrifice the right of the citizen including his right to be under no security of his conscience whatever.

\*\*\*

THE *Christian Statesman*, in an editorial, voicing this threat against the World’s Fair management: “Let it also be remembered that all the world that the World’s Fair binds it to observe the law of Illinois, and if it will be seen that the enforcing of its provisions will be in order.”

\*\*\*

The same editorial quotes Senator Pettigrew as saying the subject of the Sunday closing petition was a local issue; on that account thinks that if “it is a problem which one for it not a national one.” It is a problem which one for it not a last national question it is a religious question, and properly interests with the municipal government because of its local character. It is hoped the people within that municipality, shall close on Sunday.

\*\*\*

A PENNSYLVANIA pastor, a reader of *Two Sentinels*, writes, from a town of Central New York, that the *American Sentinel*, is the cleanest, truest, representatives, and says plainly:— “I for one am heartily ashamed of it . . . being as neutral as its religion; that religion alone, and not politics, is what is needed. I would . . . make the public school, as pure religion of the State, the great organ for the moral development of the country. But I believe there is more danger from religious than from secular influence. I used to think about ‘keep the Bible in the public schools.’ But I have come to the conclusion that it would be better to keep it out.”

\*\*\*

The Sunday censorship in its many ramifications is in full sway in Fall River, Massachusetts. The Drug stores in the city are not allowed to sell cigars on Sunday. Tobacconists cannot sell them either. “No cigars sold to-day.” “No soda sold to-day” are signs of the observance or rather the infringement of the Sunday law. The New Bedford *Standard* recently recorded this item from Fall River:

“A case was on the docket in the second District Court this morning for keeping open on the Lord’s day. Seventeen parties indicted for selling cigars on Sunday were on hand, but only police found thin. Samuel Aldsworth, and several boys, were tried for selling newspapers on the street on Sunday. Aldsworth was convicted. He is suspected of gaming on the Lord’s day in New Bedford.”

No attempt was made by any of the defendants to get bail. It is claimed there was no alternative for the magistrate, but as a great many complaints were lodged against them, and as trial was made only by frequent and insistent charges.

\*\*\*

As no entertainment given on Sunday ever was enforced in the State or in the Nation, it can impose no obligations upon the subject. “The Sabbath and all Church institutions are strictly voluntary.”

\*\*\*

“Finally it is, Mr. L. and others of Laodicean declared or stated condition, a matter for Christianity to deal with,” etc.
