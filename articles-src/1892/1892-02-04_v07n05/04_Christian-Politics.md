# Christian Politics.

THE *Christian Nation*, the organ of the Reformed Presbyterians, the prime movers in the National Reform movement, has a department devoted to “Christian Politics,” conducted by Prof. J. C. K. Milligan, Professor of Political Science, at their denominational college. At the head of this department, in their latest issue of December 9, is the following:—

God, who is the source of all authority, has spoken in his word concerning civil government, as to all other life. God’s revealed will, contains law for both magistrate and citizen. It is not left to the discretion of either to decide what duty is. National allegiance to God and obedience to divine law, constitutes a truly Christian state.

Where is the Bible warrant for this statement? Christ says very plainly, “My kingdom is not of this world.” “Yea, and why, even of yourselves, judge ye not what is right?” By what scripture that would fix him to be king of the universe, be made to apply to a state or to the future beyond “this world.” For nothing could be plainer than the statement, “My kingdom is not of this world,” which teaches us to take the Bible as a standard “for all moral interest in the world;” the Bible is as absolute to follow in the administration in every form of life, and it can be no more other. And as the Christian is scarcely to tolerate it in as a standard of “republican life” it is simply to be contempt for the very book the teachings of which these men profess to follow. We had not had enough of this old idea that religion must compel men to believe and think according to some man-made standards. For when the Bible is set up as a standard and the civil attempt to compel the observance of the teachings, it is not the Bible, but their ideas of it, that are being imposed upon the people. And it is a sorry thing for the country that as much of this sixteenth century rubbish is being brought out and actually advocated. But how about that “Christian nation,” “National acknowledgment, and obedience to his law either day or way”
