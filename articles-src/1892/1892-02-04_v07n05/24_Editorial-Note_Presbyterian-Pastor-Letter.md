A PRESBYTERIAN pastor, a reader of THE SENTINEL writes, from a town of Central New York, his approbation of the principles which THE SENTINEL represents, and says further:—

> The State, as such, according to our Constitution, must be neutral as to religion; that religious education must be assumed by the Church; and that much of what is said by church writers on the question of religion and the public school, is pure prejudice, and will not stand candid examination. I will add that I believe the real trouble with Protestant Churches is their abominable inertia, laziness let us at once say; and that we have come to find it easy to shout 'keep the Bible in the public schools,' rather than bestir ourselves and give the children of our parishes real religious instruction."
