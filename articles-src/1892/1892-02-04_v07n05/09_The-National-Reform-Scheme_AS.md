NATIONAL Reformers, so-called, in their energetic and persistent efforts to clothe religious laws and usages with civil power, repudiate the idea of any intention to unite Church and State, but only to enforce such points of religious usages as are of a purely civil character. When off guard, however, the true animus of their scheme comes to the surface. The pilot wheel of this modern Protestant Juggernaut is the so-called American Sabbath Union, as an organization best calculated to lead the way to obtain general favor among the people. But when once their purpose has been accomplished, they will stand behind the civil power and clamor for the punishment of dissenters as they who before Pontius Pilate called for the crucifixion of the Son of God.

It was the civil power that put Christ to death; but that power would never have shed his blood had it not been for the overwhelming pressure brought to bear upon the Governor by the priests of the popular religion. It has ever been so. The Papacy denies having shed the blood of the victims of its hate, and charges all the responsibility upon the secular power. Upon this principle it defends itself against all charges of complicity in the horrors of the Spanish Inquisition, and the bloody massacre of St. Bartholomew. On this point, Father Weninger, D. D., a Jesuit missionary, bears the following testimony:

> Every man who knows anything of Spanish history knows perfectly well that the Spanish Inquisition, so far as it is objectionable, is of purely political origin, and has nothing at all to do with the claim of the Catholic Church. Like the Sicilian Vespers, and the massacre of St. Bartholomew, it was a purely political persecution against heretics and unbelievers. While it lasted, the Popes exerted their utmost efforts to control its action and prevent abuse.—*Catholicity, Protestantism, and Infidelity, page 245.*

On which side of this diabolical transaction the Pope exerted his efforts to "control action" and "prevent abuse," appears from the following testimony:—

> When the letters of the Pope's legate were read in the assembly of the cardinals, by which he assured the Pope that all was transacted by the express will and command of the king, it was immediately decreed that the Pope should march with his cardinals to the church of St. Mark, and in the most solemn manner give thanks to God for so great a blessing conferred on the See of Rome and the Christian world; and that, on the Monday after, solemn mass should be celebrated in the church of Minerva, at which the Pope, Gregory XIII., and cardinals were present; and that a jubilee should be published throughout the whole Christian world, and the cause of it declared to be, to return thanks to God for the extirpation of the enemies of the truth and church in France. In the evening the cannons of St. Angelo were fired to testify the public joy; the whole city illuminated with bonfires; and no one sign of rejoicing omitted that was usually made for the greatest victories obtained in favor of the Roman Church.—*Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge, page 926.*

The same methods have been used against heretics by idolatrous systems of religion. When Buddhism had so far gained influence in Hindostan as to endanger the popularity of the Brahman system, that sect, "arming themselves with the civil power, so effectually purified Hindostan from the offensive heresy, that scarcely a vestige of the Buddhist superstition is now to be traced in that country."

In so far as any Christian church clamors for civil law to enforce any of its dogmas, or usages, however specious their pretense, they are fallen from the grace of God; and when a civil government accedes to such demands it puts a sword into the hand of the Church wherewith to punish dissenters, and it always results in persecution of God's own people, although others also may be made to suffer with them.

"The injustice of persecution for conscience' sake must appear plain to every one that possesses the least degree of thought or feeling. 'To banish, imprison, plunder, starve, hang, and burn men for religion is not the gospel of Christ; it is the gospel of the devil. Where persecution begins, Christianity ends. Christ never used anything that looked like force or violence, except once; and that was to drive bad men out of the temple, and not to drive them in.'"

Each man must accept or reject the Bible for himself, and the consequences of his decision he must abide. It is a matter between his own soul and his God, and the State has no right to exert its influence to turn him either this way or that.
