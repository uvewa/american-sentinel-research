AT Fall River, Massachusetts, the Sunday laws were strictly enforced on Sunday, January 24. In order to see that the law was not infringed, patrolmen passed through the suspected districts every hour during the day. This is quite a remarkable example of religio-legal atavism. If there are any centenarians in Fall River, they must have recalled with mingled feelings the village beadle of their childhood's days who patrolled the town to see that all attended meeting on the "first day."
