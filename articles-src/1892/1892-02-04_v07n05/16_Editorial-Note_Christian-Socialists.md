THE Society of Christian Socialists of Boston, Massachusetts, takes a column in the issue of the Christian Statesman of January 23, in the department of "Industrial Reform," and publishes its declaration of principles adopted in 1889. Thus gradually, different organizations and influences are combining to one common end; for the realization and legal enforcement of the political theory of Christianity.
