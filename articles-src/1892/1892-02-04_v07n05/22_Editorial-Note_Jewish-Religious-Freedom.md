The Chicago Israelite says, "What religious freedom the Jews enjoy in this country they are as much entitled to as Catholics, Protestants, or any one else, and there is no need to make special acknowledgment of what is theirs by right. Religious liberty was not discovered and patented in the United States, there have been and are other nations just as free in that respect as we are, and probably a little more so. In fact, it would be well to wait a while before striking off a coin in commemoration of religious liberty in this country. There are statutes in some States still unrepealed which disfranchise a Catholic or Jew, and even in the grand old State of Tennessee a good Christian can not take his hay in out of the wet on a Sunday without violating the law. The Jew is just as appreciative as anybody else of the rights he enjoys, but being his rights he is under no necessity of making a special spectacle of his gratitude."
