# Prophecy against National Reform.

IF an article in these columns last week, it was shown from the second chapter of Daniel, that Christ is not now the world\'s king; and, that the time of the setting up of the everlasting kingdom of God in this world is yet future. It is the purpose of this article to show that the seventh chapter of Daniel teaches the same great truth, still more distinctly than the second chapter.

In the chapter under consideration is recorded a vision given to the prophet Daniel, "in the first year of Belshazzar, king of Babylon." In relating this vision the prophet said: "I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the four winds of heaven strove upon the great sea. And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from the other." Verses 2, 3. Then follows a description of the beasts, which it is not necessary to give in this connection; suffice it to say that in verse 17 we are told that these four beasts symbolized four kings, or more accurately, as we learn from verse 23, four kingdoms. This is the view universally taken by commentators. Dr. Albert Barnes, who is recognized as an authority by Protestants generally, enumerates these kingdoms as Babylon, Medo-Persia, Grecia, and Rome. Of the latter power he says: "The fourth kingdom, symbolized by the four beasts is accurately represented by the Roman power." And again, "The fourth beast, so mighty, so terrific, so powerful, so unlike all the others\u2014armed with iron teeth, and with claws of brass\u2014trampling down and stamping on all the earth\u2014well represents the Roman dominion."

But the special point of interest in this prophecy, in this connection, is that presented in verses 23-27. In verse 7 the fourth beast is represented as having ten horns; and in verse 8 the prophet tells us that he "considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them another little horn, before whom there were three of the first horns plucked up by the roots; and, behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking great things." This horn attracted the attention of the prophet, as no other part of the vision did, and he made special inquiry concerning it of one of the angels that "stood near." He said: "I would know the truth of the fourth beast, which was diverse from all the others, exceeding dreadful, whose teeth were of iron, and his nails of brass; which devoured, broke in pieces, and stamped the residue with his feet; and of the ten horns that were in his head, and of the other which came up, and before whom three fell; even of that horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spake very great things, whose look was more stout than his fellows. I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them; until the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the Most High; and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom."

Then the angel answered: "The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be diverse from all kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces. And the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that shall arise: and another shall rise after them; and he shall be diverse from the first, and he shall subdue three kings. And he shall speak great words against the Most High, and shall wear out the saints of the Most High and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time. But the judgment shall sit, and they shall take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy it unto the end. And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High, whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him."

This little horn Protestants very generally refer to the Papacy. In common with other commentators, Dr. Barnes takes this view, and asks: "Could any symbol have been better chosen to describe the papal power than this? Could we find any now that would better describe it?" Of the "great words," the same writer remarks: "Can any doubt that this is true of the Papacy?" and of the "wearing out of the saints of the Most High," he says: "The Inquisition, the persecution of the Waldenses, the ravages of the Duke of Alva, the fires of Smithfield, the tortures of Goa,\u2014indeed the whole history of the Papacy, may be appealed to in proof of this application to that power." But we need not multiply words on this point: few Protestants will deny this application of the prophecy.

Now to the particular point in all this against the National Reform theory, that Christ is now this world\'s king. In Daniel 7:25, already quoted, it is said of this blasphemous power which all commentators agree is the Papacy, that he should speak great words against the Most High, and wear out the saints of the Most High, that he should think to change times and laws and that they should be given into his hands "until a time and times and the dividing of time." This many commentators hold to be twelve hundred and sixty years; and certainly the Papacy held almost unlimited sway for nearly that length of time. Yet it was not established when the Apostle Paul wrote to the Thessalonians (2 Thess. 2:3-8) that the day of the Lord could not come until the wicked power, of which he had told them, had been revealed and had done his work. The marginal references to the second chapter of Second Thessalonians, testify to the fact that this power is by Protestants held to be the same as that described in the seventh of Daniel.

That wicked power has been revealed, and has done the very work that the word of God said it would do; but "that day" has not yet come, for the papal power has not yet been destroyed by the brightness of Christ\'s second coming; neither has His kingdom been set up in the earth, for the apostle plainly connects the second advent and the kingdom. In his charge to Timothy (2 Tim. 4:1), he says: "I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick [living] and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom; preach the word." If National Reformers would only heed this admonition we should hear less of the wicked nonsense that Christ is now this world\'s king; also of the kindred foolishness that he can become such by political action. The dominion of this world is promised to Christ (see second Psalm), but it is to be given to him, not by man, but by the Father; and when it is so given he will come and destroy the wicked powers of earth, restore it to its Eden glory, and reign over it forever, even for ever and ever. "We, according to his promise," "look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness." 2 Peter 3:13. This is the word of God and we confidently rest upon it, being assured that what he has promised he is able to fulfill, without the impious aid of those who like Uzzah, would put forth their hands to steady the ark of God\'s eternal purpose.
