THE *Press* of recent dates we noticed an article with the above caption, which, with the principles of the editor, on this basis to comment upon. From the general tenor of the article, we judge that when Sabbath is used, Sunday is meant, and we use the word Sunday, Sabbath, and all rest upon it as a misapprehension. The *Herald* states: "But it is an institution which all men, be they of any religion, must reasoned and kept holy, and we are no longer able to dispense. For this reason the law says, 'You must rest.'" The argument: We are no wiser and must rest. That is right. We are no wiser one, either; why then stand and be entitled to respect. On the other hand, we do not have the one way the argument of whether they say. We do not believe it should be kept holy, should not be entitled to respect. One day. The truth is, if the spirit of the Constitution in force, there would be no basis of respect on either hand, for the Constitution is to perfect harmony with the Bible in this as in every other matter.

"We believe in one day's rest." That is right. So do we. One day in seven; one day. But how about "the other fellow?" How shall we decide which is right? As the Sabbath law is a religious institution, there is no other way but the Bible, but as all are not agreed as to what the Bible teaches, and since to not believe the Bible is the word of God, what are we to do? Each one pays his proportion to the support of the Government, which, by the people, and for the people; now a

general observance of the law. The shopkeepers are that they favor the movement, and such may not be discarded or despised in their air. Here but because of compensation.

Such things as this mark the continual growth of the movement for enforced Sunday observance. Bad, as it is to be expected, are supplemented by congressional, legislative, and judicial action.

At the closing session of the great Christian Endeavor convention at Madison Square Garden, those present, claimed to be twenty thousand in number, adopted with great enthusiasm resolutions asking Congress to make Sunday closing a condition of further appropriation for the World's Fair—more than Baptist, Young People have met in convention at Detroit, Mich., several thousand strong.

*Resolved*, That the Baptist Young People's Union of America direct the most earnestly the most really calm the attention of the Christian people of America to the fact that the Sabbath. The representatives of these various organizations ask their Representative to pass the Brecke bill containing the appropriation of one hundred thousand, providing the signature of introducing liquors on the grounds.

From the National Reform Kindergarten grows.

The little village of Munson, Wis., is a farming community, and the present time over the first day closing question. An ordinance has been passed requiring all candy stores, saloons, etc., to be closed on Sunday. We are told that so far the only business man has a candy store with a butcher shop in the back; and he sold candy, and candies, and on cream, and as soon as it was found out that a violation of his law, the constable hunted a confection reader was arrested and fined three dollars and costs in all it footed up about twelve dollars.

Why is it a crime to sell ice cream on Sunday and a virtue to sell it on other days, is a question that Sunday-lovers have never fully answered on the basis that all they want to require a civil rest with no religious element in it. Why is it not just as well to sell candy and ice cream on Sunday, and perfectly civil on other days of the week? If there were no religion in this difference this would not appear. Just so far as these laws are made, we shall not be entitled just that far we have a union of religion with the State.
