# Sunday Law in Tennessee.

The following private letter, which we are permitted to publish, will be readily understood by all those familiar with the suit in the cases of the Henry County, Tenn., Adventists, suffering imprisonment for working on Sunday:—

> Henry Co., Tenn., July 13, 1892.
>
> My Dear Bro. ——: I am still doing my time in prison. I am well and feeling fine in every respect. Brother Dortch's time was out yesterday, July 12. He has been faithful and well received, and is advertised to be sold on the Sabbath to the highest bidder, August 14, to raise enough to pay his fine and costs.
>
> The sheriff came in last evening and told me that I would have to go out on the public road and work at forty cents per day to pay for the rest of my fine. I told him I would work all the time I could, but would not work on the Sabbath. The law does not allow prisoners to work on Sunday, so I shall not be required to do so.
>
> What we will have to suffer when we are put to work on the Sabbath ——. But I must not look at the dark side.
>
> W. H. Lowry.

The penalties usually inflicted in prisons for breach of prison discipline. It is absolutely false that Sunday laws leave people free to keep another day.

Another illustration of how Sunday laws do not leave men free to observe another day was furnished some time since in Maryland. The facts were published in THE AMERICAN SENTINEL at the time, but we give them again: April 12, 1892, William R. Hubbard, a Seventh-day Adventist was summoned to testify as a witness in a law suit in Chestertown, Md. He declined to be sworn or to testify on the ground that it was the Sabbath he could not conscientiously testify. The Judge said that the law says that we shall observe but one day as the Sabbath and that day is the first day, Sunday; and sir, you must either testify or go to jail.

The young man went to jail for his fidelity to his religious convictions. He was not left free to keep the seventh day.

ARKANSAS furnished another recent illustration of the freedom (?) enjoyed under Sunday laws to observe another day. Only a few weeks since, John Haddock, a Seventh-day Adventist living near Van Buren, Ark., was summoned to serve on a jury. He went to the Judge and asked to be excused on the ground that he could not conscientiously serve on Saturday, as he regarded that day as the Sabbath. The Judge answered: "It is not your day; not your Sabbath. You have got to obey the laws of the State." We have not yet learned the finale of this case, but certainly Mr. Hubbard was not left perfectly free to choose any day. Even if he was finally excused it was only by the courtesy of the Judge, and no man is a free man who is dependent on the whim of another for the right to obey his conscientious convictions.

SUNDAY laws leave nobody free, for one is not free to do that which he is compelled to do. Freedom to do implies equal freedom not to do. Nobody thinks of saying, "I am free to pay taxes;" or, "I am free to do jury duty;" or, "I am free to pay duty on imports." On the contrary, the man says, "I must go and pay my taxes;" "I have been summoned on a jury and must serve;" or, "I will have to pay $600 duty on the goods from Liverpool." The good citizen is willing to do these things when he feels that the good of the community requires it, but he never calls being free to do them; he does them from obligation, not from volition.

The *Chicago Tribune,* of July 19, quotes a "leading attorney" of Paris, Tenn., as denying that there is in the case of the imprisoned Adventists any element of religious persecution. In this, however, he directly contradicts Judge Hammond, of the United States District Court, who, while in sympathy with Sunday laws and the enforcement of them, said in the case of the late R. M. King:—

It is an anomalous tantalizing spectacle to see the Sunday advocates trying to justify the continuance of these prosecutions, and at the same time denying that it is not in conflict with the utmost degree of religious freedom.

Yet in the face of every constitutional provision, State and national, touching the question, Judge Hammond permits in justifying this palpable conflict with the divine rights of religious freedom, by still pressing it.

He also admits that the real underlying ground of this Tennessee Sunday law is—

> the bare fact that the mass (of the people) desire to devote the day to religious uses, to secure rest from distraction by the noise and activity in civic matters, and the protection of the sensibilities of those who so devote it. . . . The State must be freely recognized and allowed to protect religious observances—Sunday.

In this the Judge does not only admit but justify the very thing which the "leading attorney" of Paris denies, that enforcing the Tennessee Sunday law against observers of the seventh day is religious persecution, but he attempts to justify it. If this principle is to prevail, all that is required to make religious persecution again general is its application.

It will be remembered that in the trial of the writer of this letter, the Adventist, instructed said—

"The Christianity punishing no less, to command other citizens, the right to keep Saturday if it sees proper, is protection that is given to other citizens of this protection that it gives to other citizens of this State; but it must not look at the dark side."

But now this is changed; and the law of Tennessee affords this man no protection for keeping Saturday, the seventh day, but compels him to work on that day under the penalties usually inflicted in prisons for breach of prison discipline.

We are not by any means ready to admit that it is the early Christians who say persecute the Jews and the Seventh-day Adventists. Neither the early Christians nor any other Christians, either now or at any other time, ever did persecute. It may persecute, he is not a Christian in that. It is true that the early Christians persecuted, primarily the Jews, but actually all other religions. Other religions were persecuted, but this persecution was then the foundation of the thing in which the persecution was then legalized and made constitutional by the decree of the "intolerable tendency of the logic" "doxe," and such only it is now.

W. A. COLCORD.
