Rev. Charles Ferguson, Rector of St. James Church, Syracuse, N. Y., in an open letter of advice to the locked-out laboring men of Homestead, Pa., who recently had so desperate a conflict with the Pinkerton men, says:—

Demand just what the public conscience demands and nothing more. You will thus repel the charge of lawlessness and put yourselves in accord with the supreme law of the land and the court of final appeal. For the public welfare is the supreme law, and the public conscience is the final interpreter of that law.

Make no threats, then, but trust your case to the conscience of the country. There are most evident signs on every hand to-day that that conscience is clear and uncorrupted.

Rest your case on the public conscience. You can not win against that; you can not lose if that be on your side.

This shows what sort of a foundation we have for justice and just dealing in this country at the present time. There is not an appealing to the fundamental principles and the inalienable rights of mankind, but to the capricious standard of public sentiment. This is exactly in harmony with the ipse dixit of Judge Hammond, in his decision in the King case, wherein he says:—

The courts can not, in cases like this, ignore the existing customs and laws of the masses, nor their prejudices and passions even, to lift the individual out of the restraints surrounding him because of those customs and laws before the time has come when public opinion shall free all men in the manner desired.

When such a standard as this is called for and upheld by both judges and priests, we may well join the lamentation of the prophet Isaiah, "None calleth for justice, nor any pleadeth for truth. . . . Judgement is turned away backward, and justice standeth afar off; for truth is fallen into the street, and equity can not enter. Yea, truth falleth; and he that departeth from evil maketh himself a prey."

The fact that conscientious observers of the fourth precept of that code which God himself spoke on Sinai and wrote with his own finger on stone, have been spied upon, arraigned before magistrates, condemned in the courts, and are this day confined in prison walls, is a sufficient comment upon and condemnation of such a standard, and attests to the correctness of the application of the scripture just quoted to the present condition of things in this Government.
