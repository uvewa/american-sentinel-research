The New York *Press* says of the action of Congress in passing the proviso requiring the Sunday closing of the World's Fair, "The prejudice that would transgress in the name of the Founder of Christianity the very spirit of his teachings is pitiable."

**INFORMATION** has been received through a Danish paper, published in Atlantic, Iowa, that two hundred arrests for violating the Sunday law have been made in Oklahoma. The chief crime for which they are charged is selling cigars on Sunday. A county official is among the number arrested.

For some time there have been continual efforts in Atlanta, Ga., to compel the closing of all business on Sunday. Recently this work has taken a new turn. Detectives, or paid spies, traverse the streets on Sunday, hunting "blind tigers" (persons selling liquor on the sly) and their mode of catching them is to buy a drink and then cause the arrest of the seller.

The newspapers throughout the country comment most unfavorably on the action of Congress in reference to the World's Fair. One Chicago paper declares that our congressional doctors of divinity must have previously read up the proceedings of the Councils of Nice and Trent, and other similar dogma manufacturing bodies, to have modeled their course so closely after their example, on the Sunday question.

**IMMEDIATELY** upon the passage of the Sunday closing proviso to the World's Fair appropriation the Chicago Turretes, numbering some five thousand, passed resolutions condemning the action of the Senate and declaring that it would cause a falling off of at least 12,000,000 admission tickets. A delegate meeting of representatives of forty-eight labor and other societies also protested against Congress attempting to close the Fair on Sunday.

The following paragraph is taken from an editorial in the *Rocky Mountain News*:—

"At the Omaha mass meeting, called to consider this question [Sunday closing of the World's Fair], Judge Lawrence held enforced Sunday observance to be necessary, 'so that the churches might have a chance to draw the people to church.' The churches are in a bad way if they depend for reinforcements on making things so uncomfortable out of church on Sunday that people will be drawn there as a choice between two evils, for that is about the inference to be deduced from Judge Lawrence's reason for Sunday laws."

The *Sun* publishes this dispatch from New Orleans, of the date of July 17:—

The Sunday law was enforced at New Orleans today for the first time in four years, all the stores and bar-rooms being closed. This result was brought about by the agitation of the labor organizations. Four years ago the first Sunday law was passed. It was very unpopular here, where Sunday has always been a gala day, and became a dead letter almost from the start. The bar-rooms were the first to defy it. Then the cigar stands, barber shops, and finally, the clothing and other retail stores reopened. The violations of the law became so general that it bore hard on the wjerks and other employees. A few days ago the labor organizations held a special session to consider the matter, at which thirty-three associations were represented. The question of the retail stores remaining open on Sunday was discussed and the general conclusion reached that the present system was oppressive to the employees.

A delegation waited on the mayor and asked him to enforce the law. Several of the retail merchants were notified and agreed to close to-day. Last night the police force was detailed specially to hunt up all late offenders, and the result was a general observance of the law. The shopkeepers say that they favor the movement, and each says that he kept open only because his neighbors did, and because of competition.

Such things as this mark the continual growth of the movement for enforced Sunday observance, and, as is to be expected, are supplemented by congressional, legislative, and judicial action.

At the closing session of the great Christian Endeavor convention at Madison Square Garden, those present, claimed to be twenty thousand in number, adopted with great enthusiasm resolutions asking Congress to make Sunday closing a condition of further appropriations for the World's Fair. Since then the Baptist Young People have met in convention at Detroit, Mich., several thousand strong, and at that meeting this was adopted—

Resolved, That the Baptist Young People's Union of America, in convention assembled, most earnestly calls the attention of the Christian people of America to the importance of closing the World's Columbian Exposition, and requests the House of Representatives to pass the Senate bill containing the provisions for closing the Fair on Sunday and prohibiting the sale of intoxicating liquors on the grounds.

Thus the National Reform kindergarten grows.

The little village of Mosinee, Wis., is having some excitement at the present time over the Sunday closing question. An ordinance has been passed requiring all candy stores, saloons, etc., to be closed on Sunday, but butcher shops are exempted. One man has a candy store with a butcher shop in the back part. A neighbor sent to his store for some ice cream, and as soon as it was found out that it had been sold to him, the combined butcher and confection vender was arrested and fined three dollars and costs, amounting in all to about seventeen dollars.

Why it is a crime to sell ice cream on Sunday and a virtue to sell it on other days, is a question that Sunday-law advocates have not fully explained on the basis that all they want is to require a civil rest with no religion whatever in it. Why is it uncivil to allow a man to cool himself with ice cream on Sunday, and perfectly civil on other days? If the religion were taken out of the question this difference would not appear. Just so far as these Sunday laws are enacted and enforced, just that far we have a union of religion with the State.

The New York Press says:

The Chicago saloon-keeper contemplates the action of Congress in ordering the World's Fair closed on Sundays with a pious smile, and thanks heaven there is still some virtue left in the hearts and minds of our national lawmakers. Meanwhile he increases his stock of whisky and otherwise prepares for a big Sunday trade during the Exposition season.

The Press has the best of authority for making such a statement, for the Wine and Spirit Gazette, which is the organ of the saloon trade, declares unhesitatingly, that—

the liquor dealers of Chicago are among the staunchest opponents of the opening of the Fair on Sunday. If the Fair grounds are closed on Sundays thousands of visitors will most likely patronize on that day the numerous beer gardens, concert halls, and other places of amusement where liquor is sold. A golden harvest is expected by the liquor dealers of Chicago from the closing of the Fair on Sundays.

The Christian Statesman has denied that the liquor element of Chicago is in favor of closing the Fair on Sunday. It is a question of veracity between the Statesman and the Gazette.

This from the Sheldon Mail, of Sheldon, Iowa, is an evidence how thoroughly the leaven of Sunday law is permeating the whole country:

Careful inquiry proves that the recent Sunday law proclamation by the Mayor of Sheldon is being generally observed. The business houses are closed all day, and the laws providing for the observance of the Sabbath are carefully obeyed. This is a credit to Sheldon, or to any other town. The violation of law and the desecration of the Sabbath is never a credit or an advantage to any community, but rather a reproach and a detriment—something to be carefully avoided. The Mayor of Sheldon is to be honored for issuing the proclamation, and the people of Sheldon are entitled to commendation for obeying it. In the vast majority of cases the violation of the law and the desecration of the Sabbath are purely matters of habit, and not the result of inborn depravity or of vicious tastes or desires. Such violations of law and of good morals usually begin in very trifling oldness. The habit is formed and grows imperceptibly, and thus, unconsciously and thoughtlessly we do evil to an extent not realized by us until our attention is called to the matter. We believe if other mayors would follow the example of Mayor Bowley, they would find the people ready to respond to the appeal. Try it.

The very simplicity of this acceptance of the authority of civil law for the regulation of the religious habits of the community, and the appeal to the mayors of municipalities to issue their proclamations, is very suggestive of the extent to which this delusion has filled the minds of even the most well intentioned.

The Chicago Tribune has sent a special correspondent to interview the Seventh-day Adventists under arrest at Paris, Tenn., and a three column article appears in its issue of July 10, giving the facts in their case together with some reference to previous cases of the same nature in Tennessee, and the expressed opinions of some of the residents of the village of Paris in reference to this particular matter. The reporter quotes one gentleman as stating some very practical facts, and saying that he is "of the opinion that the State of Tennessee is straining at a gnat and swallowing a camel in this matter. That in doing so the State winks its eyes on other offenses. He had seen games of cinch and baseball in Paris, Sunday, and no one was indicted. The railroads worked gangs of men right in the town limits and nothing was said. People hired livery teams and went out for pleasure Sunday and were not molested.

"When reminded that the Supreme Court's point was that it was where violations constituted a nuisance that the statute could be brought to bear, the gentleman declared that the testimony against these men did not show that the work they had done was a nuisance. On the contrary, the witnesses had stated there was no nuisance, and yet the jury had found for the State, and in his opinion it was simply catering to a sentiment in the community, which wouldn't hesitate to go fishing Sunday, but felt outraged because these men, who were otherwise harmless, observed Saturday as a day of rest."

In concluding an editorial on the speech of Mr. Palmer in the United States Senate, with reference to the Homestead labor troubles, the Atlanta Constitution, of July 11, said:

This is a time when our statesmen and leaders of public opinion should take counsel of their second sober thought before they speak. We are in great danger of mixing up moral rights with legal rights. All that can be expected in this world is the enforcement of certain plain and undeniable rights concerning life, liberty and property. If our lawmakers are going to jump into the tangled wilderness of moral rights they will become as confused and visionary as the wild reformers of the French revolution. Moral rights can never be agreed upon; they can never be defined, arbitrated and enforced. They must be left to be regulated by public opinion. It is better to leave some wrongs unrighted than to plunge a nation into a mad crusade, giving Peter's property to Paul, and trying to make men love one another through the agencies of the sword and dynamite. Fortunately, the American people are too sensible to lose their heads when such questions are discussed. The Republic of Washington and Jefferson has no place in its orderly machinery for the experimental follies of either a Bellamy or a Herr Most.

The Constitution makes mention quite often of the arrests in that locality for Sunday labor. Why not publish a few editorials, in this strain with reference to the attempt to regulate the people's morals by the enforcement of Sunday laws.
