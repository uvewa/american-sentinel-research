THOSE officers of the law who excuse themselves when persecuting men for conscience' sake by saying, "It is the law," would do well to ponder Rev. 1:7: Be-hold he cometh with clouds, and every eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him. The officers acting under orders might well have plow, "It is the law is' yet God holds them to strict account for their part in that the initial Christ. Nothing excuses participation in the persecution of the innocent.

To read that "the Emperor and Empress of Germany are much interested in the spiritual interests of their people, and are said to be taking official steps to increase religion facilities and have daily services in the churches." does not seem strange. But to read of Congress granting rectors of the World's Fair to provide a half for religious services, and to introduce such institutions to conduct Sunday services therein, is startling. What has become of the First Amendment to the national Constitution?

THE Nineteenth Century Christians that close every town upon the subject of religion, because we now hear nothing of the Father who is a "jealous God, visit the iniquities of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation equally;" and because there is now no burning at the stake here as a preparation for the hereafter. But Christianity has not ceased to be because of these things. It has been proclaimed. "This is a gospel world" now, thank God, but not because of the modified conception of God's character. "God is love," and all his dealings with his creatures are tempered with love. And it is this love implanted in the heart by the divine Spirit that transforms the nature and makes the man a Christian; for "he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him." The decay of vital piety in the last days, and the reason for it, is thus foretold by the Apostle. Paul. 2 Tim. 3:1-5.

The sophistry that justifies Sunday laws is mature in its deceptiveness. For example, in an address before the late Methodist General Conference at Omaha, Rev. J. W. Hamill said:

It is true that we can not compel persons to keep the Sabbath day, to that extent it is a religious and not a civil duty; but it is our privilege to insist as a part of the discipline of the Lord to be the best materials of citizenship.

As exemplified in the laws of a number of States this means that everybody must keep from doing the token of their obedience from their common labor upon this day; and this is just what the Sunday law advocates mean by it; they admit their inability to compel men in actual worship, but insist upon their right to compel them to respect or honor the dogmas. Rome never did more.

The trouble is that men love themselves more than they love God. As a natural result they are "without natural affection, truce-breakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good." And as while it is true that we have not now burning at the stake, we do have fines and imprisonment for conscience' sake, and social ostracism, religious boycott, and political blacklisting, all in the interests of degenerate Christianity. The more modern methods are becoming the less real become more refined.

*Union Signal,* of July 14, has the following:—

There was an unprecedented sight on the Chisholm trail this week, when thirty-five hundred head of cattle were driven from the feed lots and a copy of the Bible in the ranch and said to be owned by one generous soul in his convictions of his heart; he had made condemning the World's Fair by appropriately so, the showing of Christianity. He kept up, and all day work the stock hands were driven from the territory, through the Indian Territory, to Kansas—and was the genuine article, all because each officer wants to do right, and he and all his co-workers in the cause say, and all say that, and they do not, say they the little cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates." As we have before observed it the Texans are not at all that in need, and by enforcing all civil and all that is heed, and their Sabbath Sabbath day, and their lives.

"During the reading of that great commercial house one of the Sabbath laws in and upon the presence of the market, she had been. There were meritable works and were counted, and we have been the good of the world. Senator Stewart of Nevada then Senators Morgan and Harris of the Democratic side. These appeared on the side of the Senate from the chair. Senator Quay was satisfied with his provision was one that the Sabbath closing of the World's Fair. The Bible was an one returned to him, and locked up his saloon. The copy consequently turned to us."

What possible construction is there to the foregoing except one? It is the enforcement of religion. The seventh day is the fourth commandment of the Decalogue, and the closing of the World's Fair on Sunday is enforced. The Commandments stipulated that the observance of the seventh day, which means Saturday, and not the first day of the week, which Sunday. This is Scripture against this movement as regards religion Sunday is the better supported by any such construction as religious upon those the Declaration of Independence. Moreover, if newspapers, each of its own party, many of which agree, Mr. Quay is not being straightforward in his political methods. His position is to be distinguished, as soon as that time by political demographers on this question are satisfied they are dealing with real facts.

of right that "religion, or the duty we owe to our Creator and the manner of discharging it, can be dictated only by reason and conviction, not by force or violence;" and hence "that all men should rest, start, then, be a voluntary one; it must be rest day, moral law, be a voluntary one; it must be unto Christ"—not with eye-service as men-pleasers, but servants of Christ doing the will of God from the heart; with good will doing service as unto the Lord, and not unto men.

If all this be true of Sunday what fully yet let me have replied to my conscience or the rights of the man the people wish to honor. Why not just as well ask for laws enforcing baptism and the Lord's supper?
