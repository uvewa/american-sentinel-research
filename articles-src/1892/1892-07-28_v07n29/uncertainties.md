# Uncertainties - American Sentinel, July 28, 1892 (v7n29)

## General Note

The scan quality for this issue is significantly degraded, making precise transcription difficult throughout. Many passages required best-guess readings based on context and partial letter shapes. The following specific uncertainties are documented, but the overall transcription confidence for articles 04-12 is LOW to MEDIUM due to scan resolution limitations.

## Article 04: "As It Was Then So It Is Now" (Page 3)

- **Page 3, Left Column, entire article**
  - **Second pass completed:** Yes
  - **Confidence:** LOW
  - **Reason:** The scan resolution makes many words difficult to distinguish. The article discusses Roman persecution parallels with Tennessee Adventist persecution. Some phrases may be imprecise, particularly in the middle and lower portions of the column where the text is smallest.

## Article 05: "Is It Christ's Commission to His Followers?" (Page 3)

- **Page 3, Middle Column, bottom section**
  - **Second pass completed:** Yes
  - **Transcribed as:** Best reading of the Tribune quote about church in politics
  - **Confidence:** MEDIUM
  - **Reason:** The Tribune quote text is partially obscured. Attribution "A. O. TAIT." is clear.

## Article 06: "Intolerance in Tennessee" (Page 3, Right Column)

- **Page 3, Right Column**
  - **Second pass completed:** Yes
  - **Confidence:** LOW-MEDIUM
  - **Reason:** Multiple passages are difficult to read due to scan quality. References to Judge Cooley, Judge Hammond, Idaho, and Mormons are visible but surrounding text is partially unclear.

## Article 07: "False Lights on the Shore" (Pages 4-6)

- **Pages 4-6, spanning multiple columns**
  - **Second pass completed:** Yes
  - **Confidence:** LOW
  - **Reason:** This is the longest article in the issue, spanning approximately 3 pages. The Roger Williams historical content is extensive. Many passages about the colonial period, Cotton, Salem church, and Pokanockit are difficult to read precisely. The article flow across pages 4, 5, and 6 is complex and some paragraph ordering may be imprecise.

- **Page 5, Left Column**
  - **Transcribed as:** "Eye Salve" views of Roger Williams
  - **Confidence:** LOW
  - **Reason:** Small text, degraded scan quality

- **Page 5, Right Column, "Mr. Douglas Campbell" reference**
  - **Second pass completed:** Yes
  - **Confidence:** MEDIUM
  - **Reason:** The name is partially visible; context suggests this is Douglas Campbell who wrote about Puritan institutions

## Article 08: "Don't Trespass With It" (Pages 4-5)

- **Page 4, Middle Column**
  - **Second pass completed:** Yes
  - **Confidence:** MEDIUM
  - **Reason:** The article about church-state separation and public schools is somewhat clearer than others, but some passages about the Sixteenth Amendment and Jewish school attendance are approximate.

## Article 09: "The New York Press First" (Pages 6-7)

- **Pages 6-7, Left and Middle Columns**
  - **Second pass completed:** Yes
  - **Confidence:** LOW-MEDIUM
  - **Reason:** This article discusses Sunday closing, the New York Press editorial, and includes short items from Munson, Wisconsin and other locations. Some passages about the "Orleans Herald" reprint at the end of page 6 middle column may be misattributed.

- **Page 7, "From the National Reform Kindergarten" section**
  - **Confidence:** MEDIUM
  - **Reason:** The Munson, Wisconsin anecdote is reasonably clear.

## Article 10: "National Religious Liberty" (Pages 6-7, Right Column)

- **Page 6, Right Column**
  - **Second pass completed:** Yes
  - **Confidence:** LOW-MEDIUM
  - **Reason:** The article references the National Religious Liberty Association and various newspaper editorials. Multiple passages about Oakland persecution and Danish paper are approximate.

- **Page 7, Right Column - Book Advertisements**
  - **Note:** Book advertisements (Siberia and the Nihilists, Samuel Crowther, Edwin Bainbridge, Henry F. Stanley, The Ride Bible, etc.) were NOT transcribed as they are advertisements, not articles.

## Article 11: "Rev. Mary T. Whitney" (Pages 7-8)

- **Page 7, Middle Column**
  - **Second pass completed:** Yes
  - **Confidence:** MEDIUM
  - **Reason:** The Whitney letter about Sunday petitions is reasonably clear. The Hamill address text overlaps with content also appearing in the National Religious Liberty article - this may be a duplication issue in transcription.

## Article 12: "Editorial Notes" (Page 8)

- **Page 8, multiple columns**
  - **Second pass completed:** Yes
  - **Confidence:** LOW-MEDIUM
  - **Reason:** Multiple short editorial paragraphs. The references to Rev. 1:7, Emperor of Germany, World's Fair, and Paul's epistle are clear. Other connecting text between these references is approximate.

- **Page 8, Right Column, Union Signal excerpt**
  - **Confidence:** LOW
  - **Reason:** The cattle drive anecdote is difficult to read and may contain significant errors.

## Overall Recommendation

This issue would benefit from higher-resolution scans for verification. The articles with the highest confidence are the three already transcribed (01-03). Articles 04-12 should be considered draft transcriptions requiring verification against better source material.
