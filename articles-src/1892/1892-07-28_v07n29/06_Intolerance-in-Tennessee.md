Lawyers may split hairs upon the question whether this is or is not a Christian Nation, but real lovers of liberty desire that there shall be in the whole land the utmost realization of that absolute religious freedom and immunity from persecution for opinion's sake in matters of religion which it was the aim of the Federal Constitution to assure. It is true that making its own beneficent declaration for religious freedom the Constitution left to the States absolute power on the subject, and any of them might if they chose establish a creed and a church and maintain it, but such has not been the desire of any of them. Throughout the Union religious tests in the matter of the elective franchise and of office-holding have entirely disappeared, save that the new State of Idaho has entered the Union containing a clause in its fundamental law disfranchising members of the Mormon Church merely as such sectarians.

This is a Christian Nation in the sense that it is not a pagan, a Mohammedan, or a Buddhist nation, but as Judge Cooley says, "The law does not attempt to enforce the precepts of Christianity on the ground of their sacred character or divine origin. Some of these precepts, though we may admit their continual and universal obligation, we must nevertheless recognize as being incapable of enforcement by human laws. That standard of morality which requires one to love his neighbor as himself we must admit is too elevated to be accepted by human tribunals as a proper test by which to judge the conduct of the citizen, and one could hardly be held responsible to the criminal laws if in goodness of heart and spontaneous charity he fell something short of the good Samaritan." He declares further that "Christianity is not a part of the law of the land in any sense which entitles the courts to take notice of and base their judgment upon it, except so far as they can find that its precepts and principles have been incorporated in and made a component part of the positive laws of the State."

There is upon the statute book of Tennessee some such law regarding the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday, as is found in the statutes of Illinois, but it would be impossible in Illinois to give that statute any such construction as has been given in Tennessee, not by a State court alone but also by Federal court, whereby citizens of Tennessee have been subjected to most outrageous abuses of their liberty. There are in Tennessee, as in almost all other sections of the Union, persons who hold tenaciously to the commandment that the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord. They do not follow the mass of Christians and substitute Sunday for the ancient Sabbath. Having sacredly observed the seventh day these devotees pursue their ordinary vocations Sunday. In Union county a citizen who plowed corn in his own field Sunday was prosecuted before a justice of the peace and fined. The fine was paid. Such punishment did not placate the prosecutors. The man was indicted as guilty of the crime of public nuisance in that he had unnecessarily engaged in his secular business and performed his common vocation of life on Sunday, work represented as not necessary and not done as a matter of charity, and in the doing of which there was a disturbance to the community in which it was done and an offense to the moral sense of the public. He was found guilty upon this indictment and fined $75 and costs. The case went to the Supreme Court of the State. The judgment was confirmed. A writ of habeus corpus brought the convict before the Federal Court of the western district of the State, and that court would not assume to say that there was wrongful conviction or any lack of due process of law. Several like convictions have been had. There was no pretense, except in the indictment, that anybody had been at all disturbed by this secular employment. The peace was in no way threatened. No more was proven than that the Christian neighbors were scandalized that the law should be thus broken. And the great commonwealth of Tennessee has at its mercy some half-dozen patient, industrious, well-meaning citizens, religious beyond the ordinary practice of ordinary Christians, and so holds them because of an intolerance which, whatever may be the technical law, is opposed to the very spirit of our republican institutions.

There seems to be no remedy for it, and these men must serve out their sentences. But the sooner Tennessee places itself, through its legislature, upon a par with liberal, right-minded people everywhere in the republic the better it will be for both the moral and the material prosperity of that State.
