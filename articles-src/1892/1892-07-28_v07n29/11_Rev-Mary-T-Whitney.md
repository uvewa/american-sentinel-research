REV. MARY T. WHITNEY, of North Cambridge, Mass., writes thus to the *Union Signal,* of July 14, 1892:—

I have been a devoted Woman's Christian Temperance Union worker. I was forced to sign and circulate a petition coming from said suggestions until I came to the following petition; then I had to stop.

My reason for thus refusing to sign such petitions evidently is because she places such an unworthy construction on the fact that the religious observance of a day can rightly be enforced upon the people; for while she admits that Sunday be observed as "a day of religion," she also says—

It is also a day of temptation to thousands. "A man always finds some work for idle hands to do;" and the old saying is, and Christianity is a fact— "It is easier to do evil than good."

We would that there were more who could see thus clearly about this question of Sunday and Sunday enforcement.

An address delivered at the mass meeting held in the interest of Sunday observance during the late Methodist General Conference at Omaha, Rev. J. W. Hamill, D. D., said:

The Lord's day is a Christian institution and not a mere moveable or a sinner's Sabbath. The Lord's day is a day unto the Lord. It is no more possible for a person to an abstinence or a perfectly or simply ceremonial way the sacraments of the Lord's nuptials; then for such as one to keep in his casement the Lord's day. The proper observance of the Christians Sabbath is an act of worship; it is a religious duty.
