The Boston Traveler quotes the following from the Congregationalist:—

This is how the Church should enter politics. She should enter them in the person of every member. She should enter them through every door through which she can force her way. She should be found at the caucus. She should be heard from at the polls. She should make enough commotion to prove that she is alive at every session of legislature, city council, or board of select men. She should know all about the financial situation of town, city, county, and State, and should do what she can to improve that situation.

She should completely understand the management of the public schools, and determine the character of school boards and school teachers. She should have a most weighty opinion, carefully formed, and most enthusiastically expressed, regarding every matter of public interest. Every member of the church should do all these things. We shall differ from and with each other in our conclusions about some things, no doubt, but if we have the right spirit, and if we engage in political life for the sake of our Lord and Master, we shall soon see the devil's hosts fleeing before the onset of the victorious army of saints.

The title of this extract was, "The Church in politics." But where is the Church of Christ told to use any such methods in causing the "devil's hosts" to flee before it? The position in the Congregationalist presupposes the idea that the nominal Church is right, and if its decrees could be carried out, sin and misery would vanish, and earth would be turned into a "paradise below." The Church of the Middle Ages thought the same thing, and the history of the ecclesiastical tyranny of those times forcibly discloses the fatal mistake.
