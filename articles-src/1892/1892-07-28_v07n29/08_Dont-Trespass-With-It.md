IN every stage of the world's history there has arisen a class of men bent on converting the world and all mankind. At this time a class of "evangelists" pop up and watch the Sixteenth Amendment. Ostensibly, the object of the Sixteenth Amendment is to protect the public school system. In reality it is a fight between Catholics and Protestants for the control of Christianity.

The divorcing of Church and State is one of the pretenses of the "evangelist," and so long as they maintain the present form there could be a divorce there must be a divorce. But so long as the civil laws of marriage not existing between Church and State there can be neither a legal nor an "evangelist." This Sixteenth Amendment, as it stands, ought to be made by order to the Constitution of the United States. It is well known that the clerks of a class, throughout the United States of America, are the framers of the character and exponents of the public school system as the best evidences of their faith in the free school system, is that ninety-six per cent. of all Jewish children born in this country to-day attend these schools. It is further known that the Jews ask as little in the way of religious concessions in them as any other class of citizens. We might add some satisfying evidence, on the charge of opinion, that the Jewish children of the public school system compare favorably in point of intelligence, department and regularity of attendance, with any class attending these schools. With all we are opposed to any interference in public education. We would not subscribe to any law, any attempt to engraft upon it any form of, accepted by our own church,—free—absolutely free—from any taint of the church or whatever you may want to call. We do not, however, think it advisable to imbue with the Christianity of the United States on this question. It is foreign to the purpose, character, object, scope of the United States Constitution as embraced in it with its matter.

We say then that the provision of fundamental law of a free country, which guarantees religious freedom to all equally and secures the rights of the citizen and determines the bounds of a free man.

The Federal Government has nothing to do with the public schools. The public school depends entirely upon State laws. State provision for their support and take control of their affairs.

While each State is independent of the other, a comparison of the modes, methods and ideas underlying the legislation of the different Union States allows them to be very similar in character and form, so that practically we have one system of free education throughout this land. It is easy to see that this is a good fact, and it is left to the good sense of the whole people to look after their own affairs in this particular. To this extent they are self-governing.

Some people are determined and all anxious to do good, but they think they can not do it except through legislation, and when rebuked at that they resort to constitutional amendment. We scout the idea of any such forced good. English from which we derive our system of jurisprudence, has no Constitution itself. Whatever then, whether these congregations "go there." The only result can be the establishing of a precedent. Now, in this country, Congress, or any other legislative or executive institution, could only meddle itself if a deliberate and attempted to do what it never was forced to do.

We have not forgotten the Blair Bill. It follows that the only source of political civil education is the school of life—"there the people have a direct interest in the education to whatever it may be, or whatever purpose they can say will have been a force to it; to remain." We are fully aware that the people cannot be taxed for the whole or portion of school tax paid by Catholic parents to maintain parochial schools. They might the better support their parochial schools by the abatement of their tax.

There is nothing in the Constitution exceptions to this rule. No fear on this account is necessary if it can be shown that the people, the Catholic people, rise up in a body against it, and see to it that it is left in the hands of the people themselves by the State.
