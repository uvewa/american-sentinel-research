The Jewish Messenger flatters itself that the platform of the Society of Christian Endeavor is "a plea for the unification of the human race," and says:—

Here is an opportunity for the Society of Christian Endeavor to aid in quenching the fierce and destructive fires of bigotry, race hatred, and religious prejudice. Let this society, in its strong union of creeds, raise its voice against the warfare waged for centuries against the Jew. Let its members develop and stimulate a genuine brotherly feeling for their Jewish neighbor, in whose faith and in whose doctrines the Christ they worship was born and reared.

The Sun, in commenting upon this, and other favorable expressions in reference to the great Christian Endeavor convention from Jewish papers, finds in it all a pleasing "evidence of the great fact that in this country, the believers in every creed not only maintain the rights of all creeds, but can live together in peace with personal good will."

It is sad that this is not true. One of the most prominent and dramatic incidents of the whole convention was the enthusiastic expression of a determination not to "maintain the rights of all creeds." The opportunity to aid in quenching the fires of bigotry and religious prejudice was there, but it was ignored at its very inception. The hope of the Messenger was blighted before it scarcely had budded.

This marvelous society, numbering so many tens of thousands of those who are just at the age when the maturing mind receives its most lasting impressions, is made one immense school of political religion where the legal enforcement of Sunday observance is taught as one of its principal religious tenets. The Christ whose worship they profess was indeed a Jew, and he observed the seventh day, but that will not prevent them from scorning the day he kept and persecuting all who observe it whether Jew or Gentile seventh day keeper.

Everything that appeals to the imagination clusters round this organization, but it is training its members to be the determined upholders of as great an error as the world has ever seen. The beautiful enthusiasm of youth will in a few years harden into the stern determination to realize in practical form the lessons in religious law now being learned. These youths and maidens whose hearts are now so full of tender religious sentiment will be the persecutors of the soon coming years. It is the inevitable result of the errors they have been taught. How great is the responsibility of those who are teaching them these errors!
