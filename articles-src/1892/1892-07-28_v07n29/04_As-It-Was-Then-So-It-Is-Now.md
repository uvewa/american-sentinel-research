LIKE the four Adventists now in the jail at Paris, Tennessee, undergoing persecution for conscience' sake have attracted the attention of people everywhere, so in the days of ancient Rome, even those governors who cared not for the worship of the gods, and had nothing to gain either in wealth or in influence by persecuting the Christians, could see in their refusal to obey the laws relating to idols of paganism, nothing but willful obstinacy and downright stubbornness. Arnobius (in "The Republic," Book 10), reported much which tallied remarkably with what is heard to-day with reference to the law to be much more worthy of consideration than the conscience or the rights of those who are affected by the enforcement of such laws. Such an one was Pliny, who said, "I asked them whether they were Christians; whatever, this positiveness is inflexible (*pertinacia et inflexibilis obstinatio*), that 'the majesty of the governors'" would sooner pardon in them a disregard for the established forms of worship of the gods, than their want of submission to his authority! They did not ask any part in these idolatrous entertainments of heathen worship; to bow to images and to burn incense, and swearing by the gods.

Still others were disposed to be favoring to the Christians, and wished to help them in their difficult positions, and to temper as far as possible the severity of the laws against them. And when the Christians were brought before their tribunals, they would make personal appeals to the Christians to submit. As a common, however slight, that would justify the governor in certifying that they had complied with the law. This alone would release them,—not only from that particular offense, but from whatever other charge might be made.

Both governors would plead with the Christians to this effect, "I do not wish to see you suffer; I know you have no real harm, but there stands the law. I am here as the representative of the empire to see that the laws are enforced. I have no personal interest whatever in this matter; therefore, I ask you, for your own sake that you will in some factor or another comply with the law."

The gods, however slight, whereby I may be relieved from exercising this penalty by careful passing not to offend. All that is required is that you shall worthily the gods. Pray God to one of the gods, or from what harm is there in complying with the law which commands us to worship the gods? "I do not ask you to believe in them. Why not say, 'The Emperor our lord;' 'I swear by the fortune of Cæsar as images.'" Merely do either of these two simple things. But I only require that you have conformed to the law, and release you from all and all future prosecutions of the empire.

When the Christian replied that he could not, under any form or pretense whatever, worship any other god than the Father of the Lord Jesus Christ; nor honor any other by any manner or offer of sacrifice;—the governor, not knowing the meaning of the statute, then the governor, in his utterly unable to comprehend what is called conscience, and seeing all of which he considered the kindest possible efforts offered counted not only of no worth but were a reproach, is professed utterly at this often turned into wrath. He constituted a man's refusal to obey the civil law upon inscrutable and obstinacy, and that therefore such a man was unworthy of the slightest consideration. He held it also to be only a proper result for him to attend the penalty which the law prescribed.

Another thing that made the action of the magistrates, was not only their protection, but also their inability to compel men in a religious worship, but their assertion of the right to demand obedience. And this did the more important from the fact that it was made by the governors of the conquered.
