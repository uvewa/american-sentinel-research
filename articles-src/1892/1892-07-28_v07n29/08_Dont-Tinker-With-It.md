In every stage of the world's history there has arisen a class of men bent on improving the world and its Creator. At this time a class of "evangelists" pops out and wants the Sixteenth Amendment.

Ostensibly, the object of the Sixteenth Amendment is to protect the public school system. In reality it is a fight between Catholics and Protestants—all Christians.

The divorcing of Church and State is one of the pretense of the "evangelists." We have always supposed that before there could be a divorce there must have existed a marriage. The facts of a marriage not existing between Church and State in this country is no fault of those "evangelists." This Sixteenth Amendment is supposed to be made to, or tacked on to the Constitution of the United States. It is well known that the Jews, as a class, throughout the United States of America are the staunch friends and supporters of the public school system, and the best evidence of their faith in the free school system is that ninety-nine per cent. of all Jewish children born in this country attend the public schools. It is further known that the Jews ask as little preference or favor in the public schools as any other class of citizens. We might add without subjecting ourselves to the charge of egotism, that the Jewish children in the public schools compare favorably in point of intelligence, deportment and regularity of attendance with any class attending these schools. With all this we are opposed to any interference in this matter in the shape of constitutional amendment. We would not tamely submit to any encroachment upon the school law, any attempt to engraft upon it any color of so-called religion. We want it free—absolutely free—from any taint of the church by whatever name you may call it. We do not, however, think it advisable to tinker with the Constitution of the United States on this question. It is foreign to the spirit, character, object or scope of the United States Constitution to cumber it with this matter.

What is the Constitution? It is "the fundamental law of a free country, which characterizes the organism of the country and secures the rights of the citizen and determines his main duties as a freeman."

The Federal Government has nothing to do with the public schools. The public schools depend entirely upon State laws, State provision for their support and State control of their affairs.

While each State is independent of the other, a comparison of the modes, methods and systems of public instruction in the different States of the Union shows them to be very similar in character and form, so that practically we have one system of free education throughout this country. We may attribute this result to the fact that it is left to the good sense of the people of each State to control its own affairs in this particular. To this extent we favor State sovereignty.

Some people are determined at all hazards to do good, but they think they can not do it except through legislation, and when repulsed at that they resort to constitutional amendment. We scout the idea of any such forced good. England, from which we derive our system of jurisprudence, has no written Constitution. What then would those irrepressible "goodies" do there? The only resort open to them would be an act of Parliament. Now, in this country, Congress, not having any control over State education, could only meddle itself by a federal school system. This it has wisely refused to do.

We have not forgotten the Blair bill. It follows then that the only source of power on the school question is the State—there the people have a direct voice in the matter and what they want in this particular they can and will have. Here let it remain. We are fully aware that the Catholic clergy would like the share or portion of school tax paid by Catholics to be under their control so that they might better support their parochial schools. There are, however, honorable exceptions to this rule. No fear on this score need be entertained, for the reason that the people, the Catholic people, rise above their teachers. Let this question be left in the hands of the people themselves.
