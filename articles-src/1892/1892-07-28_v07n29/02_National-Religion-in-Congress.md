# National Religion in Congress.

The honorable Senate and House of the Congress of the United States have both passed the proviso of making a Congressional appropriation for the World's Fair. To be sure the House refused to make the appropriation recommended by the Fair recommended by the Senate and originally asked for by the Directory, but, although, nevertheless this was too much for Congress to do this without throwing religious freedom to the heart to be let stifle, and consequently with the provision must be passed although it is well to effect in this journal its principles. The legislation as to the World's Fair appropriation is this: The Senate passed a civil appropriation bill that all possibility of its passage for its purpose was lost; the bill was loaded down with so many appropriations for the running expenses of the Government that nobody could vote against it. Then the Sunday closing proviso is passed in the House; in the face of the defeat of the Sunday closing proviso the Senate is the appropriation, in order that the appropriation may be made, with a proviso in case the conference of the House and Senate should decide in favor of the appropriation and it finally be granted. Then, it may said, the Sunday closing proviso has been passed in the appropriation, with Sunday closing, if the appropriation is granted at all. The bill providing for the running expenses of the Government must be passed, whether appropriation is granted or not, whether the Fair is closed on Sunday or not, the congressional attitude is still the same. The Congress of the United States has made a law respecting religion. In the Senate the proviso was first adopted. It seemed to pass by a large majority. In the House it passed, July 19, by an overwhelming vote of 147 to 61 with 130 not voting. The *New York World* says, the congressmen are willing, as the New York *World* states in order to win the religious vote and its influences in order that they may carry the election, to make a public pretense of a piety which they do not practice.

Senator Peffer, of Kansas, who has not said anything in the Senate so far as to hurt the native candor of speech, said during the debate in the Senate:—

In addition to all the theological and historical discussion of the theological history of Sabbath observance, I think it enough for my present purpose to know that though it may be that in every State of the Union the Union laws the recognize the day commonly called Sunday which practice for what is termed the observance of that day, is held to no provision in the Constitution of the United States. We have the capital of the Nation, though to-day no churches are maintained from the public treasury, we do not yet forbid any of its citizens to be in the habit of meeting our mail twice every day.

We are told by the friends of the Sunday institution of going up and down the river, we are in the habit of making laws to prohibit the free exercise of our own, taking care of ourselves during Sunday or any other day. There is not a syllable in the Constitution of the United States from beginning to end in the way of expressing dissent from senators who feel an interest in the observance of Sunday.

Now I desire to call the attention of the Senate to the fact that the provision of the closing of the Fair on Sunday, so that I do not desire the setting apart of Sunday for religious purposes. That is not what I desire, but my object is to call the attention of the Senate to the fact that no authority in this Congress has ever legislated in reference to religion in any form; that the observance of Sunday is alone hypocrite. That is the exact position of the proposition at this time. We are legislating upon the subject.

The proposed law, Mr. President, in one respect, prohibits the free exercise of religion.

Now my point, Mr. President, is this. There is no authority in the Constitution of the United States that can be appropriated to day for this great Exhibit if it is in violation of the spirit and of the fundamental law of the Constitution. That is what we mean by "Congress." Who but the church makes this petition? The church. They feel that we, as private citizens are opposed to it, it is true. Not only, Mr. President, does this proposed law prohibit the free exercise of religion, but it is a law respecting religion. We have had a little bit of experience on this subject. We have three laws on our statute books concerning the free exercise of religion, three days being by laws of Congress set apart as holidays, one of them being for a Fourth of July and in celebration of a great event at Appomattox. Notwithstanding that, however at the same time, there are days in which we celebrate this anniversary, we have our Sunday morning exercises, as on all other days.

There is only one other general law which we propose, which, however valuable it may seem, it comes very forcibly. I think, the majority of Congress and of the American people have at this time an erroneous idea of the extent and the meaning and the purposes of the Sabbath laws:—"I will read it for the purpose of"——

The proposed law prohibiting the closing of the World's Fair on Sunday provides for: First, it positively authorizes the distribution of ardent spirits on Sunday. Second, a congressman stated to me not an hour ago that this bill, as he understands it, is a piece of court of heaven to serve the devil, and, he says, to make such legislation is not only un-Christian legislation but absurd legislation.

There is a union of Church and State. There is a religion which undertakes to deal with God in a way that I do not believe in. If a man wants to go to church on Saturday night, they camped until the next morning. Is there the slightest evidence of the divine endorsement of the Congress of the United States?

Mr. President, I think we ought to drop this Sunday question entirely from the appropriation bill. We had better leave it to our constituents, out of Congress entirely, and let them run their churches as they please and worship God there, and raise their children and their friends, through Christian endeavor agencies, and every other institution that tends to the proper exertion of walks of life. Congress can not guide their opinions. Give them the Book and allow them, whenever whenever it has a chance—never fails it to open a wider road, and work out our salvation for ourselves without the aid of Congress. It is not a governmental prerogatives the idea that the sectarian Church is right, and I think the decree could be carried out, sin and misery would vanish, and earth would, in its own estimation, become a "paradise below." The Church of the Middle Ages through the same thing, and the history of the exercise a public tyranny of those times forcibly discloses the fatal mistake.

If it is true that one one thirty-second part of the citizens of the United States have expressed to Congress the opinion that they ought to make as a proper exercise of their rights to close the World's Fair on Sunday, this would be so only on the basis of the consent of the seventh of the time, it nevertheless in behalf of them all, legislate upon the subject, and their interests, therefore, whether that is what Senator Peffer applied said:—

We come from (begins illegible) upon the senate from Pennsylvania (Mr. Quay) offered an amendment to the appropriation bill, to the effect, from the senate from Pennsylvania upon the senate from Maine (Mr. Hale), upon the people of this country, which have been excited have towards us and their representatives in the Congress. This is my understanding of that section of the Constitution which has a reference entirely to church and State.

The argument is one that commends itself to the fact that the Constitution of the United States says that Congress shall pass no law in respect to religion, we must have the good ground to stand on to justify myself in offering this amendment, or otherwise the chairman has no right in offering this amendment as regards Church and State.

The strange thing which originates entirely within the body of the nation, to which they stand in connection, with a Republican chairman, and a Democratic chairman, to which Senator Quay said: this bill for the purpose of assisting the World's Columbian Exposition—more briefly, the World's Fair bill—was referred to our committee. The original cost of this business, proposed to amend the Senate bill by the insertion in the fourth section of this provision to the effect that the Director of the World's Fair shall close the exhibits on the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday. Mr. Chairman: or perhaps in the United States, and the proposed amendment comes from that body of citizens called the American Sabbath Union. Mr. Howell, referred to in the Democratic major report to the favorable consideration of the of the House of Representatives.

It came from the Reformed and the Assembled and from where there is no space to quote these proceedings; that the World's Fair be closed on Sunday. It was signed by seven millions. These arose to oppose this measure; yet it produced the legislation; the petition was sent to the House who fulfilled there the desire of the petitioners to close the Fair.

This is what the political parties do, not for religious capital, but for what the House has been pleased to call "political capital, for while the House of the entire citizens of the United States are making their claim to deference to the government of the country."

Was something some time ago upon the decision by Justice Brewer who "this is a Christian Nation." He was asked, "What next?" That has been done by Congress—now "What next?"
