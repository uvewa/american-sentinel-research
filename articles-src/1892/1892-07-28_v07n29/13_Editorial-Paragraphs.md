THOSE officers of the law who excuse themselves when persecuting men for conscience' sake by saying, "It is the law," would do well to ponder Rev. 1:7: "Behold he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him." The poor soldiers acting under orders might well have pled, "It is the law;" yet God holds them to strict account for their part in the death of Christ. Nothing excuses participation in the persecution of the people of God.

To read that "the Emperor and Empress of Germany are much interested in the spiritual interests of their people, and are said to be taking official steps to increase religious facilities and have daily services in the churches," does not seem strange. But to read of Congress gravely speaking a proposition to require the Directors of the World's Fair to provide a hall for religious services, and to invite eminent ministers to conduct Sunday services therein, is startling. What has become of the First Amendment to the national Constitution?

THE Twentieth Century thinks that Christianity has ceased to exist, except in name, because we now hear nothing of the Father who is a "jealous God, visiting the iniquities of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation;" and because there is now no burning at the stake here as a preparation for the hereafter. But Christianity has not ceased to be because of these things. There is less genuine Christianity in the world than formerly, but not because of the modified conceptions of God's character. "God is love," and all his dealings with his creatures are tempered with love. And it is this love implanted in the heart by the divine Spirit that transforms the nature and makes the man a Christian; for "he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him." The decay of vital piety in the last days, and the reason for it, is thus foretold by the Apostle Paul, 2 Tim.3:1-4:—

This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, without natural affection, truce-breakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good, traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God.

The trouble is that men love themselves more than they love God. As a natural result they are "without natural affection, truce-breakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good." And so while it is true that we have not now burning at the stake, we do have fines and imprisonment for conscience' sake; and social ostracism, religious boycott, and political blackmail, all in the interests of degenerate Christianity. The more modern tortures are none the less real because more refined.

THE sophistry that justifies Sunday laws is satanic in its deceptiveness. For example, in an address before the late Methodist General Conference in Omaha, Rev. J. W. Hamilton said:—

It is true that we can not compel persons to keep the Lord's day by law, but we can compel them by law to permit all the disciples of the Lord to be in the Spirit undisturbed on the Lord's day.

As exemplified in the laws of a number of States this means that everybody must keep Sunday to the extent of refraining from their common labor upon that day; and that is just what the Sunday law advocates mean by it; they admit their inability to compel men to acts of real worship, but insist upon their right to require outward conformity to their dogmas. Rome never did more.

REV. MARY T. WHITNEY, of North Cambridge, Mass., writes thus in the Union Signal, of July 14, 1892:—

I have been a devoted Woman's Christian Temperance Union woman for years, and never refused to sign and circulate a petition coming from that organization until I came to the Sunday petitions; then I had to stop.

Her reason for thus refusing to sign such petitions evidently is because she does not believe in enforced idleness, or that the religious observance of a day can rightly be enforced upon the people; for while she admits that Sunday is observed as a "day of religion," she says:—

It is also a day of temptation to thousands, for "Satan always finds some work for idle hands to do," as the old proverb has it, and Sunday is a "day of idle hands."

We would that there were more who could see thus clearly into this question of Sunday laws and Sunday enforcement.

IN an address delivered at the mass meeting held in the interest of Sunday observance during the Methodist General Conference at Omaha, Rev. J. W. Hamilton, D. D., said:—

The Lord's day is a Christian institution and not a mere moralist's or a sinner's Sabbath. The Lord's day is a day unto the Lord. It is no more possible for a person to observe in a perfunctory or simply ceremonial way the sacrament of the Lord's supper, than for such an one to keep in like manner the Lord's day. The proper observance of the Christian's Sabbath is an act of worship; it is a religious duty. It was written in the Virginia bill of rights that "religion, or the duty we owe to our Creator, and the manner of discharging it, can be dictated only by reason and conviction, not by force or violence." The duty to observe the Lord's day must, then, be a voluntary one; it must be with fear and trembling, in singleness of heart as unto Christ—"not with eye-service as men-pleasers; but as the servants of Christ doing the will of God from the heart; with good-will doing service as to the Lord and not to men."

If all this be true of Sunday what folly to ask for laws requiring its observance? Why not just as well ask for laws enforcing baptism and the Lord's supper?

THE Union Signal, of July 14, has the following:—

That was an unprecedented sight in the United States Senate last week, when Senator Quay sent a copy of the Bible to the clerk and said he wished a certain passage read as his speech on the motion he had just made conditioning the World's Fair appropriation on Sunday closing, "Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days shall thou labor, and do all thy work: but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy maneevant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates: for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day, and hallowed it."

The press report says:—

"During the reading of this great commandment in the presence of the modern law-givers, there was profound stillness throughout the chamber. They were familiar words and were reverently heard, but no sooner had the clerk stopped reading than Senators Reagan and Harris of the Democratic side, asked why the whole Decalogue should not be read. Senator Quay was satisfied with his presentation of the case. The octavo copy of his family Bible was at once returned to him, and locked up in his desk. The Quay amendment was passed."

What possible connection is there between the fourth commandment of the Decalogue, and closing the World's Fair on Sunday? The commandment enjoins the observance of the seventh day, which is Saturday, and not the first day of the week, which Sunday is. This scripture makes no more reference to Sunday observance than does the Declaration of Independence. Moreover, if newspapers, even of his own party, may be depended on, Mr. Quay is not straightforward in his political methods. The query arises, Do political demagogues, as soon as they espouse the Sunday law craze, become saints? No cause supported by such methods should receive the support of right minded people.

BY SPECIFIC GOVERNMENTAL ACTION, THIS IS NOW BOTH A CHRISTIAN NATION AND A SUNDAY-KEEPING NATION.
