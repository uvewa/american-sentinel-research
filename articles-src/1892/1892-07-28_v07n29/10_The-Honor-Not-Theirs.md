In some mysterious manner, the Puritans have acquired great fame as the founders of a republic, the fathers of our system of public education, the establishers of freedom of speech and religious equality, and so on through the list of political, religious, and social blessings the Americans enjoy. "The claim has been so often made for them," remarks an exchange, "that the Puritan refugees from England are supposed to have a patentee ownership of most of those things of which this country is proud, such as refusal to be taxed without representation, township government, freedom of worship, and education for everybody."

"But little by little," says a New York paper, "we are finding out that the Puritans were nothing but a lot of despote borrowing a few good ideas and evolving on their own account a great many brutal notions. The latest historian to dig up facts about these overrated patriots is a Scotchman, Mr. Douglas Campbell, who has effectually robbed them of many of their laurels. In studying the jurisprudence of colonial New York, Mr. Campbell found that the institutions supposed to have been derived from New England were not at all due to English Puritans."

Of his discoveries in New York colonial law, Mr. Campbell says:—

And here I met a series of surprises, for I encountered at every turn traces of institutions and ideas generally supposed to have been derived from England, or at least to be of New England origin, but which clearly, so far as concerned New York, were derived from a different quarter. Here were free schools, and the system of recording deeds and mortgages, lands held in common by the towns—all under the old Dutch rule; here the doctrine was first laid down by a legislative assembly that the people are the source of political authority; here were first established permanent religious freedom, the right of petition, and the freedom of the press. On the other hand, here were no executions of witches or Quakers, and no kidnapping and enslavement of the Indians.

In comparing this record with that of New England, the points of contrast were no less remarkable than those of resemblance, while all the deductions from such a comparison were opposed to the ideas inculcated by our current histories. From their earliest school days Americans have been told that this Nation is a transplanted England so that we must look to the motherland as the home of our institutions. But the men who founded New York were not Englishmen; they were Hollanders, Walloons, and Huguenots. The colony was under Dutch law for half a century; its population was probably not half English even at the time of the Revolution, and yet here one finds some of the institutions which give America its distinctive character, while, what is more remarkable, no trace of those same institutions can be found in England. What was their origin became to me an interesting question. New York, which was first settled, certainly did not derive them from New England, and New England probably did not derive them from New York. Could there have been a common fountain which fed both these streams, the debt to which has never been acknowledged? Of course, the Netherland Republic must have been this fountain, if one existed; but to prove its existence and the mode in which its influence was exerted on New England required an examination far outside the records of New York.

From all of which it appears, as another suggests, that "Americans will have to transfer their reverence from the Puritans to the Dutchmen of Holland, and Forefathers' Day will have to be celebrated with long-stemmed pipes and schnapps instead of in hard cider. And the Puritans who made life a burden to all who differed with them religiously will take their proper place in history as a narrow-minded colony of bigots who somewhat hastily concluded that the chief end of man was to glorify God by hanging witches, whipping Quakers, and enslaving men distinguished from themselves in savagery only by the color of their skins."
