The honorable Senate and House of the Congress of the United States have both passed the proviso of Matthew S. (aint?) Quay respecting religion at the World's Fair. To be sure the House refused to appropriate the five millions of dollars for the Fair recommended by the Senate and to which the Sunday closing proviso was attached, but nevertheless this was too good an opportunity to stab constitutional religious freedom to the heart to be let slip, and consequently the religious proviso must be passed although it be void in effect in this special instance. The legislation as to the World's Fair appropriation was first inserted into the sundry civil appropriation bill that all possibility of a presidential veto might be avoided; being incorporated into the appropriations for the running expenses of the Government it must stand with the entire bill. Then the Sunday closing proviso is passed by the House, in the face of the defeat of the appropriation, in order that the appropriation may of necessity carry the proviso in case the conferees of the House and Senate should decide in favor of the appropriation and it finally be granted. Thus, in any case, the Sunday closing proviso follows the appropriation. The appropriation, with Sunday closing, if adopted, becomes an integral part of the bill providing for the running expenses of the Government. And, whether the appropriation is granted or not, whether the Fair is closed on Sunday or not, the congressional attitude is still the same. The Constitution is stultified. Congress has made a law respecting religion. In the Senate no division was taken upon the Sunday closing question. It seemed to pass by a large majority. In the House the Sunday closing was concurred in by a vote of 147 to 61 with 120 not voting. And this because the honorable congressmen are willing, as the New York World pithily puts it, "to sacrifice both the Fair and its usefulness in order that they may make an insincere and hypocritical pretense of a piety which they do not practice."

Senator Peffer, of Kansas, who has not been so long in public life as to have lost his native candor of speech, said during the debate in the Senate:—

Mr. President, I do not care to go into a discussion of the theological history of Sabbath observance or of the keeping of Sunday. It is sufficient for my present purpose to know that though it may be true that in every State of the American Union the laws recognize the day commonly called Sunday and attach penalties for what is termed the desecration of that day, in truth in not one of the States is the law practically observed. We here at the capital of the Nation, though to-day we are engaged in a theological discussion concerning the observance of the first day of the week, are in the habit of receiving our mail twice every Sunday. We are in the habit of going away from the city and of returning to the city; we are in the habit of going up and down the river; we are in the habit of going out on little private excursions of our own, taking care of ourselves during Sunday the same as we do during other days.

I mention this, Mr. President, not for the purpose of expressing dissent from senators who feel differently about the matter, nor do I wish it to be understood that I do not desire the observance of Sunday, or that I do not desire the setting apart and the consecration of a rest-time for the people, but my object is to call the attention of the Senate while we are discussing this matter to the patent fact that a great deal of this talk of ours about the observance of Sunday is sheer hypocrisy. That is a strong word, I know, but there is a great deal of truth in it, and I do not know how better to express my feeling upon the subject.

Mr. Morgan, senator from Alabama, said:—

This proposed law, Mr. President, in one sense prohibits the free exercise of religion. . . . Today there is attempted a union of Church and State. What is this demand that this money shall not be appropriated to-day for this great Exhibition, except that the church demands that it shall have assistance in closing these gates by act of Congress? Who but the church makes this demand? Not one church, but many churches. Some churches are opposed to it, it is true. Not only, Mr. President, is it the union of Church and State, but it is an attempted union of politics and religion.

We have had a little bit of experience on this subject, and I want to show how sacred and how safe the Sabbath is in the hands of the Congress of the United States. We have three laws on our statute books in regard to the Sabbath. One of these laws prevents the faculty of West Point from compelling the boys to continue their studies on Sunday; another just like it relates to the faculty at Annapolis. Notwithstanding that, however, according to the Rules and Articles of War, and the universal practice in the Navy and also in the Army, we have our Sunday morning reviews, in which we ascertain the condition and strength of the Army in all particulars.

There is only one other general law which we have attempted to pass on this subject, which illustrates very forcibly, I think, the morality of Congress in dealing with the Sabbath. Here is the utmost endeavor of Congress in respect to the observance of the Sabbath heretofore. I will read it:

SEC. 209. No malt, corn, grain, or other material shall be mashed, nor any mash, wart, or beer brewed or made, nor any mill used by a distiller, at any time between the hour of 11 in the afternoon of any Saturday and the hour of 1 in the forenoon of the next succeeding Monday; and every person who violates the provisions of this section shall be liable to a penalty of $2,000.

There the Congress of the United States expressly authorizes the distillation of ardent spirits under its law, but when they come down to 11 o'clock on Saturday night they put on "the livery of glee count of heaven to serve the devil in," and they exempt from 11 o'clock on Saturday night until 1 o'clock on Monday morning out of the period of time when there shall be any work done in the making of whisky.

There is a union of Church and State. There is a union of politics and religion. Brew on, malt on, distill on, mash on, work for the devil until 11 o'clock on Saturday night, then suspend until 1 o'clock on Monday morning and go to work again, says Congress. That law stands there; and that, I repeat, is the utmost endeavor of the Congress of the United States in preserving the sanctity of the Sabbath!

Mr. President, I think we ought to drop this subject, unless we can do better than that. I think we had better leave it to our constituents, our friends, our people, this grand and splendid people of the United States, to direct themselves and their children and their friends, through moral influence and moral power and through the light and blessedness of religion, into higher walks of life. Congress can not guide them there. Congress serves the mammon of unrighteousness whenever it has a chance—never fails to do it. It was the wisest of all the provisions in the Constitution of the United States, or rather in the amendments, that Church and State should be divorced from each other.

Senator Sanders, of Montana, very pertinently spoke for the great unrepresented majority:—

If it be true that one thirty-second part of the citizens of the United States have expressed to Congress the opinion that they ought to make, as a condition precedent to an appropriation of this character, the closing of the gates of that Exposition one-seventh of the time, it nevertheless remains the duty of Congress to stop and enquire in behalf of the 63,000,000 people who have not thus expressed themselves, whether that is wise or no.

Again Mr. Morgan, of Alabama, most aptly said:—

Mr. President, after the impassioned address of the senator from Georgia [Mr. Colquitt], upon the subject of this Sunday amendment proposed by the senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Quay]—and I think the argument naturally arises out of the excitement and feeling, to say nothing of the animosity, which have been excited here towards certain classes of people—that Congress ought to be very careful not to interfere in those matters of legislation which have reference entirely to church affairs.

I thought when I called the attention of the Senate to the fact that the Constitution of the United States separated Church and State, that I had pretty good ground to stand on to justify myself in obeying what I conceive to be my duty under that instrument and to oppose on this floor the connection of Church and State.

Here is a measure which originates entirely with the Senate, a Republican body, with a Republican committee, with a Republican chairman, and a Republican majority throughout. They brought in this bill for the purpose of assisting the World's Fair, and certain other Republicans who thought that there might be a good chance to make political capital out of this business, proposed to amend this bill by inserting a provision against opening the gates on Sunday. The most astute politician in this Chamber, or perhaps in the United States, originated that amendment, and the last one who was on the floor, the senator from New York (Mr. Hiscock), referred to the Democratic majority of the House of Representatives and said that this amendment would not be welcomed over there.

Others in both the Senate and the House, from whom there is no space to quote now, had the courage and the statesmanlike sense to oppose this measure yet it passed the Senate as a party vote, and going to the House fulfilled there the stricture of Mr. Morgan as to its being a measure brought forward and to be used for political capital, for while the House defeated the appropriation it passed the Sunday closing clause in deference to the aggressive demands of a misguided religious sentiment.

When commenting some time ago upon the decision by Justice Brewer that "this is a Christian Nation," the question was asked, "What next?" That has been answered. What next?
