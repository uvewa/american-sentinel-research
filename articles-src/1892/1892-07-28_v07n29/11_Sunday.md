In the *Herald* of recent date we noticed an article with the above caption, which, with the permission of the editor, we would like to comment upon. From the general tenor of the article, we judge that when Sabbath is used, Sunday is meant, so if we use the word Sunday, do not look upon it as a misquotation. The *Herald* says: "But it is an institution which is least 20,000,000 people believe should be remembered and kept holy, and we see no reason why they should not be entitled to respect." That is right. We see no reason, either, why they should not be entitled to respect. On the other hand, we can see no reason why the 45,000,000 who do not believe it should be kept holy, should not be entitled to respect as well. The truth is, if the spirit of the Constitution was carried out, there would be no lack of respect on either hand, for the Constitution is in perfect harmony with the Golden Rule. The *Herald* further says, "We believe in one day's rest." That is right; so do we. Perhaps not the same day. But how about "the other fellow"? He, it would seem, disregards every day. How shall we decide which is right? At the day in question is a religious institution, there is no other way but the Bible; but as all are not agreed as to what the Bible teaches, and some do not believe the Bible is the word of God, what are we to do? Each one pays his proportion towards the support of the Government, which, by the way, is a Government of the people, by the people, and for the people; now is it not reasonable that the Government should deal out equal and exact justice to all classes and to each individual? Indeed it is, and that was foreseen by our forefathers, who framed the Constitution of these United States, and so they inserted in Art. IV. of that document, "No religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office of public trust under the United States." And, as that was not strong enough, they added, in Art. I, an amendment which reads as follows: "Congress shall make no laws respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof." This certainly ought to be protection enough for anyone, and would be if the men we place in office did not violate their oaths to support the Constitution of the United States. But what can we think of a professed Christian people, "20,000,000 strong though they be," who will bribe these officials by "petitions and promises of support," to violate their oath of office? Surely it would seem that they did not deserve much respect.

But we are happy to state that there is not one in one hundred that realize what they are doing. In fact the Christians of this country are helping to load a gun that, when it is exploded, will recoil upon themselves. The *Herald* believes in certain Sunday laws; so do we. We believe also in Monday laws, but we do not believe in discriminating between the two. A law that is good for one day is good for every day. There never was a Sunday law made yet, "exclusive of other days," but resulted in persecution to a greater or less extent. The first Sunday law was made by Constantine, A. D. 321. It was an innocent looking affair in and of itself, but it grew; the church got stronger and demanded more. And so it continued until it was so firmly locked in the embrace of civil government, that they united and became one, and over 50,000,000 martyr's graves tell the moral. All churches and all denominations are protected in their worship, and it is right they should be. Farther than this the State can not go without infringing upon the rights of others. The Sunday saloon closing business comes under the same head. It should be closed Sunday; it should also be closed Monday, and every other day. Is whisky any more whisky on Sunday than on Monday? Is there any more drunk in it one day than another? It is the same argument as in the village of Albion to-day over granting the drug stores a license. If they are granted a license, it will be because they are druggists and are befriended by officials of the law regardless of justice. It is the same with closing saloons on Sunday. It is the day to be protected, not the liquor traffic stopped. If it was, they would make a law a little stronger and stop it every day.

Now, my Sunday law friends, a few questions: "Isn't the gospel just as powerful to-day as it was in the days of Christ? Did he call upon Caesar to help him, or did he say that they that take the sword shall perish by the sword? Did not Paul say to Timothy, that in the last days there would be a people having a form of godliness, but would deny the power thereof?—2 Tim. 3:1-5. Are there not a people of to-day who have a form of godliness that deny the power of God by appealing to Caesar for Sunday laws? Or do they mistrust that God will have nothing to do with Sunday, and their only hope rests in Caesar?
