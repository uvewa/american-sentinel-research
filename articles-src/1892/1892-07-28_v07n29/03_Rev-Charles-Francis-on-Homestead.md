# Rev. Charles Francis on Homestead.

REV. CHARLES FRANCIS, Rector of St. James Church, Syracuse, N. Y., in an address upon the employment of non-union men and the killing of laboring men of Homestead, Pa., who would not submit to the employment of the Pinkerton men, says:

> Authority to enforce public order means the State, and nothing more. You will see that the employment of armed men by individuals for the suppression of disorder is not competent for any aggregation of private citizens; it is an usurpation against the Government. For the public welfare is the supreme law of the community, and its corollary that the State alone shall make war.
>
> Make so therein, then, let trust your case to the law. Let no man take the law in his own hands, and signs on every hand to-day that that committee is the natural remedy.

This shows what sort of a foundation we have for any legislation for the rights in this country at the present time. There is not an applying the Declaration of principles and the inalienable rights of mankind, but in the republican standard of public sentiment. This is the extreme harmony with the open title of Judge Hammond.
