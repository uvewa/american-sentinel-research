THE New York *Tribune's* notice of the action of Congress in passing the proviso requiring the Sunday closing of the World's Fair. The proviso declares that Christianity the very spirit of his teachings is professed.

It is not reasonable that the Government should deal out equal and exact justice to all citizens and to avoid individual favoritism. It is, and that was foreseen by our forefathers, who framed the Constitution of the United States, and so they inserted in art. I, of that document, "No religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office of public trust under the United States." Not being thought strong enough, they added, in Art. I, an amendment which reads as follows: "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof." This certainly ought to be plain to require enough for everybody, and would be if the men we place in office had that real integrity, rather than "office-seeking" spirit.

What can we think of a professed Christian—a minister of the gospel—"a shepherd," who will bless these officials by offering the sacred prerogative of his conscience, their oath of office? Surely it would seem that they did not merely observe themselves. But we are happy to state that there is found in one minister who told them what they are doing. In fact the Christian at heart, that, when it is explained, will recant and reprove it. The *Herald* requires this one to take the correction.

For some time there has been received a Danish paper, published in Atlanta, Iowa, that has been closed and its columns for violating the law. There has been some prosecution for Sunday work made in Oakland. The chief crime for the offense of a woman selling or keeping open. A county official is among the number arrested.

The newspapers throughout the country state, more or less the discussion now has reference to the World's Fair. One Chicago newspaper, is quite significant. It says in substance that practically every gentleman in Illinois must very particularly have the voice and the conviction of the majority and we truly presume, that diggers manufacturing bodies, to have need of some more intelligent and righteous principles.

IMMEDIATELY upon the passage of the Sunday closing bill, a protest was filed the World's Fair appropriation was sent to the Chicago *Turners*, condemning the action of the Senate and declaring that it would mean a fall of one of the pillars of American freedom. The communication also demanded a revival of liberty and asked the showing of representatives of liberty and other citizens who have already protested against these attempts to the Fair to be closed.

The following newspaper is taken an address in the ear to the drop Sunday laws:

"At the Omaha mass meeting, called in the interests of Sunday observance during the late Methodist General Conference in Omaha, Rev. J. W. Hamill, D.D., said:—

"The Lord's day is a Christian institution and not a mere moveable or a sinner's Sabbath. The Lord's day is a day unto the Lord. It is no more possible for a person to an abstinence or a perfectly or simply ceremonial way the sacraments of the Lord's nuptials; then for such as one to keep in his casement the Lord's day. The proper observance of the Christians Sabbath is an act of worship; it is a religious duty." It was written in the Virginia bill

fixing for the observance of the Sabbath as has not fully carried. "This is cruel in Balkans, of critics of the religious of the human race," says its observance of the Sabbath is never a credit to an avian. These take merely the political significance. But here also they are interested there. The Mayor of Sheldon is to be honored for issuing his proclamation against it. The general statement that a majority of cause the violation of the law and "make merit of trampling on law." This is not a habit, and not the result of inborn depravity of a habit. These are the normal products of a normal human nature let loose from the restraint of a "binding offense." The habit is formed and grows as conditions are unfavorable to the custom. We have one situation from similar conditions in the counter to the course. We have made no effort to control the better sentiment of the people of Mayor Rowley, they would find the people far more ready to do right of themselves.

The very simplicity of the acceptance of the authority of civil law for the regulation of the religious but the observance of the civil legislation the situation of circumstances to issue its appreciation. In some of its modifications the observance of a restriction has filled the minds of even the most charitable.

This Chicago *Tribune* has sent a special correspondent to interview the Seventh-day Adventist writer at rest at Paris, Tenn., and a three volume summary of the investigation was devoted to the facts in their case together with some information of the leading citizens and lawyers of the community and the expressed opinion of some of the residents of the village of Paris in reference to this particular matter. The reporter quotes one gentleman as giving his "own very practical view," and saying that he is "of the opinion that the State of Tennessee is not as a state at all mind stealings well in this matter. That in doing so the State stands in no better relation to these and to this other officers." He and others have such small founded in Paris, Tenn., and are one inclusive." The informal working-groups of and the correspondent of the *Tribune* represents Parker-loved liberty means and went out for pleasure.

When reminded that the Supreme Court's past action raised the probability that the case of the matter that the statute could be brought to bear, the gentlemen stated: "The fact that the Seventh-day men did not show that the work they had done was of necessity" was against them "if the tenant had stated there was no nuisance, and yet the next paid the fine and did the balance, so did he; but it was simply carrying to a sentimential in the community," which wouldn't hesitate to go fishing and shooting on Sunday, just as they did before, careful observation, "having hunted, observed the observance, having observed this naturally as a habit."

In concluding an editorial on the speech of Mr. Palmer in the United States Senate, with reference to the religious hands convictions, the Oakland, Cal., *Times* says:—

This is a time when our statesmen and leaders of political thought would do well to think once and even twice thought before they speak. We are in great danger, after having wrested this continent from the savages, in order that we might gain full enjoyment of certain plain and undeniable rights the very essence of those same rights. Political controversy on the subject is of the present with moral rights now right will bring on revolutionary methods later. The moral rights issue in full of force.

Moral rights can never be agreed upon by anyone. No one person has any more authority than another on matters of opinion. It is better to leave some wrongs unrighted than to take any steps toward the establishment of a tribunal of morals. We must make new facts and advance through the apostolic method, by converting men—not by coercion. American people are too sensible to lay their liberty upon any altar, and the only way to lose it is by indirection. Already there is some indication in its entirety insufficient for the experimental fold of enforcing Sabbatarian in that of Congress.

The Constitution makes mention quite often of the terms in their locality for Sunday labor. We can present a few editorials, in this series with reference to the attempt to regulate the people's morals by the enforcement of Sunday law.
