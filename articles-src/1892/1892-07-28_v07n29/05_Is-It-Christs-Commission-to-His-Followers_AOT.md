THE text from the *Tribune* quoted the following:—

No political government that does not enter into the mind of every person should enter then in the person of every person who can frame her may. He should be found of public morals, and determine the order. He must be the type of the perfect prayer, that she is alive at every avenue of legislation in the body of the State. The Church must own the man, and the man must own his own, city, county, and State, and should so direct the movements of the public opinion, and determine the morals of the public opinion, and determine the movements of the political candidates. She should have a most weighty opinion, calmly expressed at the ballot-box. The announcer of the church should be all those strong-armed workers who should go forth to maintain the right, and if we engage in political matters, we must come to the door of the city as the dove's home flying before the cause of good.

The title of this editorial was, "The Church in politics." But Whoso in the political sphere has its methods, so its methods in naming the "devil's hole" is the "devil's home." It is one of the most governmental prerogatives the idea that the sectarian Church is right, and I think the decree could be carried out, sin and misery would vanish, and earth would, in its own estimation, become a "paradise below." The Church of the Middle Ages through the same thing, and the history of the exercise a public tyranny of those times forcibly discloses the fatal mistake.

A. O. TAIT.
