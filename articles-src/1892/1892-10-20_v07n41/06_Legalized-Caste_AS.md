The Government of the United States is a Government of the people in their united capacity. The "divine right" of an autocrat is not recognized here. The officers of the Government are delegates of the people and are amenable to the people for the use or abuse of their power.

The citizenship of this country is made up of all nationalities and religious beliefs, and is blended upon the constitutional foundation of equal civil rights and perfect religious freedom. No other union of discordant elements could be possible in an earthly government. No departure from this principle is possible without establishing the conditions of caste, and such conditions can only be created and maintained by brute force, or by coercion, and by such compulsion on the part of professed Christians collectively, or individually, as would be a repudiation of the principles upon which the propagation of Christianity was based by its divine Author, who declared: "My kingdom is not of this world;" "Resist not evil;" "Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you."

Every true Christian is Christ-like. "If any man have not the spirit of Christ, he is none of his." How then can a Christian go before a magistrate and swear out a complaint against a fellow servant because forsooth "he followed not us" as has been done in this last decade of this enlightened century? It is impossible. Such an act proclaims the hypocrisy of the complainant. In the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States declaring this Nation—Christian; and in the act of Congress enforcing a religious usage or the observance of Sunday by a potent financial consideration, this Government has given preference to the religious belief and practice of one class of religionists above others who honestly differ with them on religious issues, and has relegated such dissenters to a lower caste, although they are expected to be and are, equally with their peers, contributive to the support of the Government financially, politically, and physically in time of war. Such an act of Government is a practical repudiation of one of the most sacred provisions of the Constitution—religious freedom.

The intrinsic potency of this act of Congress, in closing the Exposition at Chicago, on Sunday, lies not so much in the immediate and local results of that act as in the precedent it establishes of making legislation possible upon every tenet or usage of the dominant religionists of the country. If, at the beck of a powerful clergy, congressmen can sacrifice their own better judgment and yield to the pressure of a fanatical demand for a Sunday law for fear of being "knifed at the polls," as has been done, it is very probable that the volume of legislation upon the Sabbath question and other religious usages will, unless freemen are alert, in the near future be limited only by the satiety of the clerical zealots of a corrupt and fallen Church.

A. SMITH.
