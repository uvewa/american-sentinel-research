# Legislation.

THE Government of the United States is a Government of the people in their united capacity. The citizen of the United States is an aristocrat is recognized here. The officers of the Government are delegated to the people and are amenable to the people. This being so the Government has no right to any religious legislation.

The citizenship of this country is made up of people of all religions and religious beliefs, and is founded upon the constitutional foundation of equal civil rights and personal religious freedom. Under this, no religious demands could be the possible condition of legislation in the sense of this from this principle is possible without direct violation of the Constitution. Any such conditions can only be created and maintained by brute force, manipulation, and by such compulsion on the part of professed Christian collectively, or denominationally, as would be a repudiation of the principles upon which the government is based: Christianity was based by its divine Author in these words: "My Kingdom is not of this world;" "Resist not evil;" "Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you."

Every true Christian is Christ-like. "If any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his." How then can a Christian, having the Spirit of Christ, make a complaint against a fellow servant before the civil courts for any religious matter, as has been done in this last decade of this enlightened century? It is impossible.

To so constitute the hypocrisy of the Supreme Court of the United States declaring this Nation a Christian, and in the consequence of the observance of Sunday by a so considered sanction of the supreme court. The Sentinel also gives preference to the religious above others who honestly differ with them on religious issues, and has relegated such dissenters to a lower caste, although they are expected to be and are, equally with their peers, contributors to the support of the Government financially, politically, and physically. In time, the thing is that on act of Congress is a practical repudiation of one of the most sacred provisions of the Constitution.

The intrinsic potency of this act of Congress, on Sunday, lies not so much in the vindication and results of that act as it lies in the precedent it establishes of making legislation possible upon every street and

in absolutely no good reason for the State may disbelieve it, but they can not deny it; they may reject it, but they can not disprove it. Many would not believe it, and said it would never come. We knew it and published that it would come. Now it has come. It is here. And this demonstrates unmistakably that we were right and they were wrong. To all these we now say, Come now and stand with us that's only may in the light of the great question.

And these are other things yet to come out of this which have come, which are so to be told as we are going to tell these things as we have told the others; for they are in the same connection.
