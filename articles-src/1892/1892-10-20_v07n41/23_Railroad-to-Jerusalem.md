THE Christian Cynosure sees in the completion of a railroad from Jaffa (ancient Joppa) to Jerusalem an indication of the fulfillment of the promise recorded in Ezekiel 37:21-27:

Thus saith the Lord God; Behold, I will take the children of Israel from among the heathen whither they be gone, and will gather them on every side, and bring them into their own land. . . . And David my servant shall be king over them; and they all shall have one shepherd; they shall also walk in my judgments, and observe my statutes; and do them. . . . My tabernacle also shall be with them: yea, I will be their God, and they shall be my people.

This is a divine promise and will certainly be fulfilled; but just how a railroad is going to help the matter is not clear. David is dead, and has been for a very long time. It is evident, therefore, that the promise is not one to be fulfilled in this age nor in a temporal sense. It is evidently a promise of the reign of Christ, the Son of David, and in be accomplished by a resurrection of the dead in Christ. This done, the Lord will scarcely need a railroad to gather his people. For "he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other." Matt. 24:31. The promises of God are not to be fulfilled by railroads, nor yet by acts of Congress, the National Reformers to the contrary notwithstanding.
