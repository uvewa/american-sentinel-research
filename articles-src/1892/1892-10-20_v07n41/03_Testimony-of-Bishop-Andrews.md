# Testimony of Bishop Andrews.

THE Jews are the ones who in this country are against the agitation that it is being made in the country for the enforcement of Sunday. Bishop Andrews, of the Methodist Episcopal Church, who has just returned from Japan, says that in that country they have no Sabbath: yet that country gets along in the very best manner. He also says by the very fact: "I said that he did not understand it, but that it was a fact. The Bishop was speaking on the occasion on the platform of a meeting held under the auspices of the New York Sabbath Union, and he had no intention of indicating that the Japanese government refused to in doleful tones, or that the Christians; but facts have always been united to unbalance, and the law above is now the law deadly because given by a friend.

Bishop Andrews is just like the defenders and all others who plead for what they call the American Sabbath are doing,—only seeking to conceal their real purpose, the enforcement of a civil rest by religions dogma by civil legislation.
