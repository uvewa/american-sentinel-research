THE Golden Rule, the organ of the Christian Endeavor Society, published in Boston, in an article by Rev. R. V. Hunter, Chairman of the Christian Endeavor Sunday Closing Committee, commenting on the action of Congress closing the World's Fair on Sunday, says:—

But our work is not yet done, Christian people must see that the Local Directory obeys the instructions of Congress. Said a commissioner to the writer since Congress took its action, "The World's Fair will be opened on Sunday. When the two million dollars are used up, the Fair people can do as they please. What can Congress do? Whom can Congress put in jail?"

The managers care nothing for law. They have arranged to ignore the statutes of Illinois. There is great danger that they will attempt to ignore Congress. They have shown that spirit. We need to be on the alert.

No, their work is not yet done. But it will, no doubt, be done quickly. Of all the pitiful things in connection with this great delusion one of the most pitiful is the deception by which these tens of thousands of youth are led to believe that they are doing God service in upholding measures which will bring persecution for conscience' sake upon their fellow-men.
