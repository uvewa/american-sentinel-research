# Not To Be Entertained.

THE churches of New York has this to say on the denominational question of public school questions:—

That the churches have moved and from all the sign of its houses demanding the Company Bill has been so amended as to render it useless. We regard it as an injustice that the Roman Catholic schools should be relieved of taxes by the public schools. This, however, is only throwing the old question into new prominence and will become the issue of the most important of the hour. The State furnishes no sectarian education to all, free and equal. Whatever the State does in this matter, it maintains it, and it is free in other respects: a measure; it is not a free office; and for what the State supplies to all it is entitled to all. It would seem quite reasonable, therefore, to hold that when there already exists the family and the Church where parents can teach what they please to their children, that they should be relieved of taxes for the schools that they are required to continue the use of. The State should have the right to levy taxed to collect of the court of furnishing street signs for schools the State furnishes to all.

It would seem that the public school has is not such a great burden but that it should be willing to assume a part of what it does in educating those who would otherwise grow up in ignorance. The Catholic proposition to divide the public funds upon sectarian lines ought never to be favorably entertained. Money raised by public taxation for school purposes should be expended by the State for schools. It serves the instruction, in attainment of knowledge, not in imparting a knowledge of the dogmas of a denomination; the churches have nothing to do with such questions.
