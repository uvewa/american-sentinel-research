THE Central Labor Union, of Boston, has petitioned that the Columbian Exposition be opened on Sunday, and at the same meeting requested the Massachusetts Mechanics' Charitable Association of that city, to open the doors of its Fair on that day.

The Boston Congregationalist comments upon this,—"Vigilance right here at home is necessary. Organized labor in this country is not led by wise men."

Whom does the Congregationalist assume possesses the wisdom of this country?
