# Some False Exposures.

THE Michigan *Christian Advocate* of September 10, notes the fact that on the formation of the new trades association that is now being formed in Chicago, and says:—

> That there should be no interference of any interference by the Church with the State. The first thing to be done seems to be to see that the new organizations need not be anxious. None of them seem to be in any existing relation with the churches. State legislatures are not interfering with the religious concerns of the churches. They are not interfering with the rituals of the churches; nor with the charities of the churches. No interferences of the administrations being provided by the Government of the United States for the accommodation of ministers who wish such ministrations. To deny them is to deny to these citizens what they give to all other citizens.

The SENTINEL has little in common with the avowed infidel. It does not regard all forms of infidelity as something which all agree by necessity. It can not and will not submit to the personal and private. And the *Federer* Storm is right. "Every man is responsible for his existence. The majority, however largely it may be, has therefore simply just no power to deprive the minority of any natural right. Upon this subject John Stuart Mill writes:—

> The right of the people to exercise such authority is not less dangerous because tolerated. The Government has no more title to it than the worst. And there are other things yet to come out of this which have created the great question.

We further maintain, that the State has so no right to make any difference whatever between the Christian and the "Free-thinker," or between the infidel. One is the one and the doctrine of the other. There is no middle ground. If the State may supply chaplains to teach Christianity latice to imitate "free thought." It has just as good a right to take the public money for one purpose as for the other. It should do neither. It is a fact that State-paid chaplains are ornamental rather than useful, and that prisons, army posts, and charitable institutions that are served by volunteer chaplains are much better served by volunteer missionaries than are those that have regular chaplains. As a general rule the regular chaplain is appointed on political "pull," while on the other hand the volunteer minister in such institutions engages in the work from love of the truth which he teaches and from a burning desire to do good and to save souls. These should be supported on the same footing to provide that the chaplaincy is provided by the State as supported chaplains, but very many reasonable men share that it is provided.

But for a fuller discussion of the question of employment of chaplains, we would respectfully refer the *Advocate* to a very able article on the subject by a Baptist clergyman, published in the *Washington Paper* of August 15th, 1891.

Notwithstanding the *Advocate*'s denial, the country is in danger to be forced from the Protestant churches; indeed that is just the impression from which danger threatening the country arises. The Protestant churches are asking special favors as charities. They have demanded the closing of the Exposition in recognition of religious institutions but are not asking on civil grounds. They never and have boasted that "the Christian churches can have anything they want."
