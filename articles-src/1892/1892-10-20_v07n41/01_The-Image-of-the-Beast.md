# The Image of the Beast.

MANY a time in the life of THE AMERICAN SENTINEL, have we told the people that the union of Church and State with national Sunday legislation would surely come. In fact THE SENTINEL never existed for any other purpose than to give notice that this was coming, and to awaken the people to the danger and the evil of it.

EXCEPT in a general way, however, we have never told in THE SENTINEL how we knew that this was coming. We have demonstrated over and over, by parallels of historical and ecclesiastical procedure that this evil thing must inevitably come as the result of existing conditions and of the efforts and aims of the churches; but the knowledge that it was coming was gained by many paths both the existing conditions and the efforts and aims of the churches to bring it about.

THE first thing that was ever done by the churches to bring this about was done more than forty years ago; and steadily on our part we have known for more than forty years that it was coming. The religious declarations that run through THE AMERICAN SENTINEL, published more than forty years ago, that there would be formed in this Government, through perversion of it by the ecclesiastical, the fundamental principles of the Government—the union of Church and State with national legislation establishing Sunday as the Sabbath, and with the churches controlling the government power to enforce Sunday observance. More than forty years ago we gave this announcement in print, and then, and through all the years since, this people have preached everywhere that this was coming and would surely be done.

And now that it has been done, and the entire belief of our position is borne out by us, we can steadily tell and only what we have been looking for all this time.

WHAT was it that told us that it was coming? We knew it by the Word of God, in the scriptures of the prophets. The prophecy that announces it is in the thirteenth chapter of the book of Revelation; and there all may read. In the first two verses of that chapter there is given a description of the rise and career of a certain power under the symbol of a beast. Then from the eleventh to the eighteenth verse inclusive, there is given the description of another power under the symbol of "another beast" and "the image of the beast." The first of these powers is also described as "the first beast" and "the beast which" had the wound by a sword." The full description of the first one is as follows:—

And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy. And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion: and the dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority. And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and his deadly wound was healed: and all the world wondered after the beast. And they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast: and they worshipped the beast, saying, Who is like unto the beast? who is able to make war with him? And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies; and power was given unto him to continue forty and two months. And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme his name, and his tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven. And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them: and power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations. And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world. If any man have an ear, let him hear. He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity: he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints.

Every person not a Catholic, who knows the A B C of history knows that this is a vivid sketch of the Papacy and its career up to 1798 A. D. Every such person knows that the one great power which has done the most damage, which has alone allowed those long centuries of evil and for the longest time is the Papacy. Every such person knows that the most blasphemous power that was ever on the earth is the Papacy. He also knows that the one power that has made war with the saints of God and has overcome them the most cruelly, and has persecuted them the most widely and for the longest time, is the Papacy. We know that to say this is not considered an improper Protestantism for these days; but proper Protestantism it is nevertheless; for this is true of the Papacy, and has been true of it for ages. And everybody, Catholic or non-Catholic, knows that the Papacy is the union of Church and State with the Church's power to command and the power of the State to be in enforcing her dictates, and compelling men to submit to her authority.

The description of the "other beast," or the image of the beast, is as follows:—

And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon. And he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him, and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed. And he doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men, and deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a sword, and did live. And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed. And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads: and that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name. Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is six hundred and threescore and six.

THIS prophecy says that it would be said unto them, that they should make an image to the beast. This would be to make an image to the Papacy. The Papacy being a union of Church and State with the Church using the power of the State to enforce the doctrines of the Church and to compel submission to her decrees; the making of an image of this would be to make a likeness of it, that is, an order of things by which a union of Church and State should be created, with the civil power in the hands of the Church to compel submission to Church's doctrines, and to enforce the Church's practices. But in order for this to be made, it must first be made in principle. That is, the Church and State in the place where this image is to be made must be in such condition "that they should make an image" of the beast. And in the whole United States—it is plain on the face of it that the image of the Papacy could not be made where there is a union of Church and State, and connection between the pretend of civil affairs and connection with the Church.

Now where was there ever a place or a Government on the earth where no union of Church and State exists in the original form of government, with the exception of the United States Government? Egypt, Israel, Babylon, Persia, Grecia, Rome, the ten kingdoms of Rome in the development from the beginning of its existence, as such, until this day, there was no union of religion and the State, while the religious power had no control of, or connection with, the civil power. This is the truth, and any one familiar with the history of the world, whether little or much. This being the case, it is clear that on the earth where it could be said they should make a union, the Government of the United States alone could this image of the beast—which is the Papacy—be made. There are many other reasons but as our space is limited this is sufficient for this place.

IT was because of this prophecy of Rev. 13:11-17 that it has been preached and published, for more than forty years that there would be formed in the United States a union of Church and State with National Sunday legislation.

AGAIN: Eight years ago this same denomination printed the following on the page of *The Sentinel:*—

> By the first beast is represented the Papacy—the union of Church and State, with the Church supreme, possessing the civil power, having authority to punish all dissenters. An image to this beast would be another union of Church and State, and an exact representation of this image is the work of that beast which has two horns like a lamb. And this would indeed be an image of the Papacy. When the churches shall have so far obtained the control of the State that they can use the authority of the State to further their own schemes and to carry out their own purposes, when they can wield the State to punish all who dissent from their dogmas, and compel all to submit to their doctrines and obey their mandates, when in short, the civil power shall be brought under the control of the ecclesiastical, as fully as held by them in compact, shall in letter and in fact form a union of Church and State as really and truly as this country has, we have formed an image of the Roman hierarchy.

This has been done. The churches of our land have united the Sunday movement, and then united with the Catholic Church itself; and in this unity they have influenced the State to enforce the Church's decree for Sunday observance; and it stands the Christian institution of Sunday. They have done it, but in the doing of it, they have the living image of the Papacy itself. Seven years ago we thus publicly stated that this would be done and now it has been done. Only in the making of the prophecy we published that it must come, and on the strength of the prophecy may a foreknowledge that it was done. The image of the Papacy, the Beast, has been formed, and lives, in the United States of America.

ONCE MORE: Seven years ago this same denomination printed the following in the second page of *The Sentinel:*—

> Compulsory sabbath and parsonage legislation will yield to the demand for National Sunday laws, and then there will be an image of the beast.

This present year the churches made this very demand. They gathered themselves together with their memorials and petitions to the Congress of the United States. And follows from Presbyterian churches in Rochester, N. Y., and surrounding, N. Y., from Methodist churches of Hartford, Conn., and surrounding,

> Resolved: That we do hereby pledge ourselves to do everything in our power to promote the observance of Sunday as a day of rest and worship; that we give our votes to, or for support to no political party or representative, unless such party or representative will assure us of legislation in the line of Sabbath reform measures, and we will refuse to vote for or support any political party or representative, who will not commit himself in this direction.

Consider the popularity and patronage which were thus put up at public auction and sold for Sunday legislation. The churches assembled in Congress did yield to the demand for a national Sunday law. There is a law in three distinct ways and places, and for all reasons conceivable. The image of the beast was there formed.

Now bear in mind that on the strength of the prophecy, the foregoing was first printed thirty-one years ago. And so far as the fulfillment of the prophecy goes, the very things have been done which thirty-one years ago we stated on this page would be done. The churches did this year send their petitions to Congress, with their demands in behalf of Sunday sacredness; and as the result Congress responded as stated by Senator Hawley:—

> I would vote the provision for the church in any form that the religion sentiment of the country demands it, I would repeal the provision in any form that the religion sentiment of the country demands it; I should provide provisions satisfactory to these petitions for Sunday observance.

And as expressed by the representative of 1,000,000 of the Christian Endeavor:—

> I have learned that we hold the United States Congress.

Yes, they have the Senate, and Congress, and everything else that is in their hands by which to sustain Sunday legislation. By the prophecy we knew forty years ago that it was coming; and now the facts we know now that it has come.

which, when passed, should be considered as a compliance with the petitions of the churches. The image is here. It is here as a fact.

It appears probable to us that this Sunday issue can never, in any way or form, be settled. Here is a point on which all Protestant sects can unite. A point on which they can fraternize, and the point is Sunday worship.

"Grant" us but power to give life unto this image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast shall be killed. From this text we may draw two conclusions:—

1. There will be a time when there is a controversy where the two-horned beast rules; for the provision is that the image of the beast may be formed. That time is here.

2. That it already has it in its power to give life to the image of the beast, that the image may be formed and executed. It is not in the power of the churches to do this of themselves but it is in the power of each individual church, each denomination, according to the dictates of their own convictions. They have held three Church Congresses and sent in Congress with 1,000,000 names agreed to it, representing 6,000 churches in the United States, and praying them to pass a solemn enactment that the World's Columbian Exposition should be closed on the Christian Sabbath.

Were the United States, as a body, to pass a law that the Exposition be closed on Sunday, it is evident that if such a law were passed and signed by the Papacy, for the law would then be in the hands of the Churches; and they could enforce their wishes on those who did not obey the Sunday statute.

Now bear in mind that on the strength of the prophecy, the foregoing was first printed thirty-one years ago. And so far as the fulfillment of the prophecy goes, the very things have been done which thirty-one years ago we stated on this page would be done. The churches did this year send their petitions to Congress, with their demands in behalf of Sunday sacredness; and as the result Congress responded as stated by Senator Hawley:—

And again upon this demand for Sunday legislation,—

> Forty gentlemen representing that, if they close on Sunday, religious organizations of the Congress of the United States. "We go back to our constituents and tell our Christian people you have come back here again. None of them will vote for an appropriation."

In the light and upon the strength of the prophecy, we published seven years ago this same denomination preached—in their own words we can publish and do publish—that this very thing which this prophecy is fulfilled. The image of the Papacy has been formed in the United States.

AND this is how we have known all these years that there would be a union of the Church and the State in the United States with national Sunday legislation. We have told it by preaching. We have told it by voice and pen. In THE SENTINEL, said of *The Sentinel*, all these years, that this was coming. Now it is here and no man can resist it. Here are the words which we published years ago and it is a literal come, so that all can see that they
