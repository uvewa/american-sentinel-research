MANY a time in the life of THE AMERICAN SENTINEL have we told the people that the union of Church and State with national Sunday legislation would surely come. In fact THE SENTINEL never existed for any other purpose than to tell that this was coming, and to awaken the people to the danger and the evil of it.

— o —

EXCEPT in a general way, however, we have never told in THE SENTINEL how we knew that this was coming. We have demonstrated over and over, by parallels of historical and ecclesiastical procedure that this evil thing must inevitably come as the result of existing conditions and of the efforts and aims of the churches; but our knowledge that it was coming antedated by many years both the existing conditions and the efforts and aims of the churches to bring it about.

— o —

THE first thing that was ever done by the churches to bring this about was twenty-nine years ago last February; while on our part we have known for more than forty years that it was coming. The religious denomination that now publishes THE AMERICAN SENTINEL published more than forty years ago that there would be formed in this Government, though prohibited by the Constitution and the fundamental principles of the Government, a union of Church and State, with national legislation establishing Sunday as the Sabbath, and with the churches in possession of the governmental power to enforce Sunday observance. More than forty years ago this denomination put this announcement in print, and then, and through all the years since, this people have preached everywhere that this was coming and would surely be done. And now that it has been done, and exists before our eyes, we see exactly and only what we have been looking for all this time.

— o —

HOW then did we know that it was coming? We knew it by the Word of God, in the scriptures of the prophets. The prophecy that announces it is in the thirteenth chapter of the book of Revelation; and there all may read it. In the first two verses of that chapter there is given a description of the rise and career of a certain power under the symbol of a beast. Then from the eleventh to the eighteenth verse inclusive, there is given the description of another power under the symbol of "another beast" and "the image of the beast." The first of these powers is also designated as "the first beast" and "the beast which had the wound by a sword." The full description of the first one is as follows:—

And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy. And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion: and the dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority. And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and his deadly wound was healed; and all the world wondered after the beast. And they worshiped the dragon which gave power unto the beast; and they worshiped the beast, saying, Who is like unto the beast? who is able to make war with him? And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies; and power was given unto him to continue forty and two months. And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme his name, and his tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven. And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them; and power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations. And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world. If any man have an ear, let him hear. He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity: he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints.

— o —

EVERY person not a Catholic, who knows the A B C of history knows that this is a vivid sketch of the Papacy and its career up to 1798 A. D. Every such person knows that the one great power to which all the nations have done homage the most and for the longest time is the Papacy. Every such person knows that the most blasphemous power that was ever on the earth is the Papacy. He likewise knows that the one power that has made war with the saints of God and has overcome them the most cruelly, and has persecuted them the most widely and for the longest time, is the Papacy. We know that to say this is not considered as proper Protestantism for these days; but proper Protestantism it is nevertheless. For all this is true of the Papacy, and has been true of it for ages. And everybody, Catholic or non-Catholic, knows that the Papacy is the union of Church and State with the Church in possession of the power of the State to use in enforcing her decrees, and compelling men to submit to her dictation.

— o —

The description of the "other beast," or the image of the beast, is as follows:—

And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon. And he exercised all the power of the first beast before him, and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed. And he doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men, and deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast, which had the wound by the sword, and did live. And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed. And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads: and that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name. Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast; for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six hundred threescore and six.

—o—

This prophecy says that it would be said unto them, that "they should make an image to the beast." This would be to make an image to the Papacy. The Papacy being a union of Church and State with the Church using the power of the State to enforce the doctrines of the Church and to compel submission to her decrees, the making of an image of this would be only to make or establish an order of things by which a union of Church and State would be created, with the civil power in the hands of the Church to compel submission to Church doctrines, and observance of church institutions. But in order for this to be made, it must be that before this there was no union of Church and State in the place where this is to be done. As it is necessary to say "that they should make an image" of the Papacy—that is, union of Church and State—it is plain on the face of it that this is said, and must be said, in a place where there is no union of Church and State, and where the Church has no control of civil affairs and no connection with the civil power.

—o—

Now where was there ever a place or a nation on earth in which there was no union of Church and State except in the United States alone? With the single exception of the United States Government, there never was a government on earth, pagan, papal, or professed Protestant, in which from the beginning of its existence, as such, until this day, there was no union of religion and the State, in which the religious power had no control of, or connection with, the civil power. This is the truth, and any one may satisfy himself of it by thinking, whether little or much. This being the truth, it follows that in the United States is the only place on earth where it could be said that they should make a union of Church and State. Consequently in the Government of the United States alone could the image of the beast—the image of the Papacy—be made. There are many other points corroborative of this, but this is sufficient for this place.

—o—

It was because of this prophecy of Rev. 13:11-18 that it has been preached and published, for more than forty years that there would be formed in the United States a union of Church and State with National Sunday legislation—that there would be made here an image of the Papacy. For instance: Thirty-nine years ago last January—January, 1853—a little pamphlet of about seventy-five pages, perhaps 2½x5 inches in size, was published, giving a brief exposition of Revelation 13, and especially that part in verses 11-18. On this point there was then written and printed the following:

The two horned beast says to them that dwell on the earth. "Make an image." The dwellers on the earth, or territory of this beast, it seems, have a part to act in this work. This clearly marks the United States as the scene of action. This is the manner in which laws are made here—by the representatives of the people. As all men by the Declaration are declared to be equal; it became necessary that some course should be taken by which all could have equal privileges in the construction of the laws. If the whole mass were called together, there would be an endless discussion and no laws made. Therefore the people were to elect such representatives as would carry out their principles; and they were to meet and make laws, which, when passed, should be considered the laws of the people. The image is to be formed by the people or their representatives.

It appears probable to us that this Sunday institution is the very point on which this union will be effected. Here is a point on which all Protestant sects can unite. A point which we may safely say is the important item in the faith of Protestants is their Sunday worship.

VERSE 15.—"And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed." From this text we may draw two conclusions:

1. The image of the beast is to be made in the same territory where the two-horned beast rules; for the two-horned beast can exercise that authority in no territory but its own.

2. That it already has it in its power to give life to the image of the beast, or cause the decree to be made and executed. Is it not in the power of the United States to pass such laws? They declare "all men shall be protected in worshiping God according to the dictates of their own consciences." We see the mass hold the first day of the week as a holy day. If a memorial should be sent in to Congress with 1,000,000 names signed to it, declaring that their rights were infringed upon, and praying them to pass a solemn enactment that the first day should not be profaned by labor, how soon the result would be a law upon the point:

Were the United States, as a body, to pass a law that Sunday should be kept holy, or not profaned by labor, there would be, I conceive, an image to the Papacy; for the law would then be in the hands of the Church, and she could inflict penalties on those who did not obey the Sunday institution.

—o—

Now bear in mind that on the strength of that scripture prophecy, this was printed thirty-nine years ago. And no man can deny that in this present year the very things have been done which in this exposition of the prophecy were said would be done. The churches did this year memorialize Congress, with threats, in behalf of Sunday sacredness; and as the result Congress responded as expressed by Senator Hiscock:

I would write the provision for the closure in any form that the religious sentiment of the country demands, and not stand here hesitating and quibbling about it. I should make this closure provision satisfactory to those petitioners who have memorialized us against the desecration of the Lord's day.

And as expressed by the representative "Christian lobbyist" of the churches:

I have learned that we hold the United States Senate in our hands.

—o—

Yes, they have the Senate, and Congress, and the law, and the Government in their hands by which to sustain Sunday as a sacred day and prevent its desecration. By the prophecy we knew forty years ago that it was coming. And by the facts we know now that it has come. The prophecy is fulfilled.

—o—

AGAIN: Eight years ago this same denomination printed the following on the same prophecy of Rev. 13:11-18:

By this first beast is represented the Roman Church, an ecclesiastical body clothed with civil power, having authority to punish all dissenters. The image of the beast represents another religious body clothed with similar power. The formation of this image is the work of that beast whose peaceful rise and mild professions render it so striking a symbol of the United States. Here is to be found an image of the Papacy. When the churches of our land, uniting upon such points of faith as are held by them in common, shall influence the State to enforce their decrees and sustain their institutions, then will Protestant America have formed an image of the Roman hierarchy.

—Great Controversy, Vol. i, page 270.

This has been done. The churches of our land have united upon the Sunday issues, and then united with the Catholic Church itself, and in this unity they have influenced the State to enforce the Church decree for Sunday observance and to sustain the Church institution of Sunday. They have done it, but in the doing of it, they have the living image of the Papacy in this land. Eight years ago we published that this would be done; and now it has been done. On the strength of the prophecy we published that it would come; and on the strength of facts, everybody may know that it has come. The prophecy is fulfilled. The image of the beast is made, and lives, in the United States to-day.

—o—

ONCE more: Seven years ago this same people published on the same subject these words:

To secure popularity and patronage, legislators will yield to the demand for a Sunday law.—Testimony 22, page 207.

This present year the churches made their demand for a Sunday law. They presented their memorials and petitions backed up with such persuasive words as follows from Presbyterian churches in Brighton, N. Y.; Parma Centre, N. Y.; and Rochester, N. Y., and recorded in Congressional Record, May 25, 1892, thus:

Resolved, That we do hereby pledge ourselves and each other, that we will from this time henceforth, refuse to vote for, or support for any office or position of trust, any member of Congress, either senator or representative, who shall vote for any further aid of any kind for the World's Fair except on conditions named in these resolutions.

To secure the popularity and patronage which were thus put up at public auction by the churches, our Nation's legislators assembled in Congress did yield to the demand for a Sunday law, and did enact such a law in three distinct ways and places; and for the reasons stated by themselves, thus:

If I had charge of this amendment in the interest of the Colombian Exposition, I would write the provision for the closure in any form that the religious sentiment of the country demands, and . . .

I say to the junior senator from Illinois [Mr. Palmer] he had better yield to this sentiment, and not let it go out to the country that there is the slightest doubt that if this money shall be appropriated, the Exposition will be closed on Sunday.

I should make the closure provision satisfactory to those petitioners who have memorialized us against the desecration of the Lord's day.—Senator Hiscock, Congressional Record, July 12, 1892, page 6733.

And again upon this demand for Sunday law, it was said:

Now, if gentlemen repudiate this, if they desire to reject it . . . I should like to see the disclaimer put in white and black and proposed by the Congress of the United States. Write it. How would you write it? . . . Word it, if you dare; advocate it, if you dare. How many who voted for it would ever come back here again. None, I hope. . . . You endanger yourselves by opposing it.—Senator Hawley, Id. page 6733.

In the light and upon the strength of the prophecy, we published seven years ago that they would do it. And now in their own words we can publish and do publish that they have done it. The prophecy is fulfilled. The image of the beast is made, and lives, in the United States to-day.

—o—

AND this is how we have known all these years that there would be a union of Church and State formed in the United States with national Sunday legislation. This is why we have been telling the people by voice and pen, in THE SENTINEL and out of THE SENTINEL, all these years that this was coming. Now it is here and no man can deny it. Here are the words which we published years ago that it would come, and no man can deny that.

Men may disbelieve it, but they can not deny it; they may reject it, but they can not disprove it. Many would not believe it and said it would never come. We knew it and published that it would come. Now it has come. It is here. And this demonstrates unmistakably that we were right and they were wrong. To all these we now say, Come now and stand with us that you may be in the right now on this great question.

And there are other things yet to come of this which has come, which are to be told and we are going to tell these things as we have told the others; for they are true.

A. T. J.
