THE following extract from a letter dated "Henry County Jail, Paris, Tenn., July 15," written by J. Moon, one of the persecuted Adventists, to his brother, Allen Moon, Washington, D. C., shows how the Adventists are discriminated against and singled out for a persecution for Sunday work:—

While I am writing to you, it being Sunday, there is a train load of workmen passing in the streets not thirty feet from the jail, going out to work; and they have done so every Sunday since we have been here, and it apparently does not disturb any one. But if a poor Adventist takes his hoe out in his field and labors on Sunday, it disturbs the people for miles around.

Surely "justice standeth afar off; for truth is fallen in the streets, and equity can not enter." The first case of this kind in the State of Tennessee was that of W. H. Parker, who spent seventy-four days in the Henry County jail in 1886. At the same time James Stem, one of the four men recently imprisoned, and William Dortch, father of the J. H. Dortch recently imprisoned, spent three months in the same jail for doing farm work on Sunday.

In 1890 occurred the case of R. M. King in Union County. This case was appealed first to the Supreme Court of the State; then to the Circuit Court of the United States, and finally to the United States Supreme Court, where it was suddenly terminated by the death of the defendant. "These persecutions," remarks a recent tract by the National Religious Liberty Association, "instead of destroying themselves by their own venom, have steadily increased in frequency and severity; and it now rests with the people of Tennessee to decide whether they will so adjust their laws as to make such persecutions impossible, or allow this outrage on the inalienable rights of God-fearing men and industrious citizens to go on."
