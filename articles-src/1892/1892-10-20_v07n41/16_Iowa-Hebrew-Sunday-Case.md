THE Dubuque Telegraph, of October 3, contains the following local item:—

Isaac Foster and Joseph Gordan were before Police Justice Hoffman this morning, charged with violating the Sabbath, contrary to the city ordinance. They are Hebrews living at Washington and 13th streets. Saturday they observed the Jewish Sabbath by fasting and prayer, it being the day known as Yom Kipper or the day of Atonement. Sunday they engaged in stone cutting in their own house which they are finishing. This annoyed their neighbors who caused their arrest. They pleaded not guilty this morning, and Justice Hoffman fixed their trial for Saturday next, the Jewish Sabbath. He did this because his calendar for the intervening days of the week is taken up with civil cases. It is understood the Hebrews will make a desperate fight and if the case goes against them it will be carried to a higher court.

Will the courts of Iowa be governed by the decree of the Supreme Court of the United States, that the civil control of religious matters in this country proves this to be a Christian Nation? Will they follow the precedents established in the case of R. M. King, of Tennessee, in both State and United States Courts; and of the similar cases, tried and to be tried, in Henry County, Tennessee? Will they follow these precedents? or will they not?
