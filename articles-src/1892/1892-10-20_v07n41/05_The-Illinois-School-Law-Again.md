THE Illinois compulsory school law is in a fair way to be somewhat modified erelong. A political paper in that State says of it:—

The Illinois school law, to which reference is made occasionally in the press, and of which the Prohibition Party is striving to make an issue, provides for the compulsory education of children to the extent of requiring that each child between the ages of seven and fourteen shall be sent to public school at least sixteen weeks each year. A child may be sent to a private school, however, instead of public, if the private school is approved by the Board of Education or directors of the city, town or district in which the child lives.

There is no controversy between parties in Illinois as to the propriety of a law compelling parents and guardians to give children a certain amount of school privileges. They are all agreed that compulsory education is a good thing.

There is objection, however, to that clause of the law which practically gives to the Boards of Education the right to decide whether a private school, to which it may be desired to send a child, is the right and proper one to be substituted for the public school. The people feel that after paying their school taxes they ought to have the right to send their children to private schools if they prefer without being compelled to ask the approval of a Board of Education.

Each of the two great parties stands pledged to the enactment of a compulsory education law which will resemble the present one, eliminating, however, the obnoxious provision giving to Boards of Education the right to interfere with private or parochial schools.

This is the very provision of the law which THE SENTINEL criticised some two years ago. Our position then was that to give the public school boards a right to supervise private schools was in effect to make them public schools, and that it was an invasion of the sacred rights of parents. THE SENTINEL was censured then for taking that position; now, however, the two great political parties are tumbling over one another in their haste to do the very thing we said should be done.
