# Weekly Rest Not Necessary.

That a Sabbath properly used is a good thing no one can deny, nor believe that God adapted everything to the wants of mankind; but it can not be proven by the prime object of the Sabbath and that it is a physical necessity to have a stated day of rest is not true and has never been demonstrated. In the country it has never been proven. The whole argument fails in the assumption—for it is merely an assumption—that men need a periodical rest of every seven days.

And this presumption has been well answered in the *Christian Statesman*.

Thus far the Jews. The reply rests upon the integrity of the Jews. Thus, it is said that it is a fact that in Germany, in Switzerland, in Austria the proportion is about the same. In Switzerland—which has no Sunday law—the authorities three express the comparative death rate out of 100,000 of the population. Norway and Sweden, thirty-six; Germany, thirty-one; France, twenty-two per cent. of the Christians. In Hungary, the death rate of the Jews, who are the most exact and methodical in their religious duties, is thirty-three; of the Christians, at forty-six.

This would seem to completely dispose of the standard argument for the necessity of a weekly day of rest. It is assumed that a weekly day of rest is absolutely necessary for the well being of the State; that in order for a part of the people to rest all must rest, and that all must be compelled to rest without a law compelling them to do so a Sunday is set apart as a day of rest. This claim has been urged as long and so confidently that many accept it without question; but that it is not true is shown.

The followers of the Jewish Sabbath observed with a weekly day of rest.

It will of course be urged that the Jews follow a regular health code, and that this is one reason for the low death rate among them. But what has then become of the argument that the day-of-rest-in-seven must be obtained unless all rest upon the same day? for as the Jews do rest in the manner instated by North or South in any vocation as a physical necessity, they rest upon a day which most around them call a workday, and they are not in the ordinary pursuits of life that give them the rest they really need.

The American Sabbath Union asks us, and must receive our answer.

And only if the Jews disproves the assertion that needful rest can be had without a weekly rest day—and many other parts are at work, but the facts disprove the whole theory—and disprove the claim, so confidently made by some, that a man actually needs a rest day in every seven; for it is a well known fact that very many Jews, profiting by a desire to gain, keep no day, but do business seven days a week.
