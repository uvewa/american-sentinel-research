# The Brooklyn Preacher, The Czar, and The Lord Mayor.

REV. DR. TALMAGE has returned to his work. He is not a happy and contented man. He went on a mission of charity in which the high hand had been taken out of its former as to what the left hand was doing. As a matter of course, therefore, a most delightful reciprocity of feeling was the not consequence, and Dr. Talmage profited much by the trip. His big heart has much crushed. He, consequently, comes back to Brooklyn with a well filled and courtly language of compliments still ringing in his ears. He has discovered new perceptions and un-American views, with which he has become infected, have not escaped both guarnation and the custom house officer. Immediately upon arriving at Brooklyn does the Doctor proceed to unpack his foreign goods and give them out liberally to the American public through the reporters. The newspaper of his substitution of Russian royalty is harmless, though amusing, and indicates a state of mind and a course of whose practice it should be to be no respecter of persons.

The Czar, I think, is one of the grandest of men, and he is one of the best men in the world. The Emperor, too, is one of the noblest characters of his kind. He also is doing the best he can for his people. The Emperor, too, is one of the noblest characters; his face beaming with kindness and benevolence.

It need be said of an aged historical ecclesiastic, to whom respect is given, of note whose lectures were once much in vogue, a man of culture, and a citizen of New York, that his lectures upon Queen Elizabeth, and his description of certain elements as being "retrospectively synonymous" of the royal legitimacy. Dr. Talmage has spoken very recklessly of his language between the world and spirit of mind of a mind overcome with sweet sycophancy, and courtly ritual, and royal finery, until he has become enamored of its royalty. But it was the utterances and reflections of the Brooklyn divine on the subject of religion and government, which inspired the delightful old lecturer, of which have their significance in the question which takes all its character from the pulpit.

Not only his conclusions, taken collectively, and many, from his personality, become somewhat impressive and therefore significant. The evidences are that the discrimination of the renowned preacher, not only is he afflicted with this overwhelming sycophancy; not only has he been deeply impressed with the royal prerogatives of king, and of king, but he has been wined and dined and banqueted and honored by the bishops and canons, and he has been brought to the point of responding to the toast of "Religion in America." These are the facts.

The Established Church and the Dissenters are doing a great work in Great Britain. It seems a wonderful thing to be invited as a guest at the Lord Mayor's London, and seat many

distinguished guests of the Church of England. I impressed the toast of "Religion in America."

It would be interesting to know what this popular preacher would in such a case say about religion in America. Did he stick to their doing neat with the writing of the fact that the law for the civil enforcement of tolerance of religious observance was foreign to the ideas of those who, in colonial times, had become the chief promoters of its public prosperity. Did he, Court, by judicial fiat, constitutes this a Christian Nation? Oh no; but he told those assembled of his intention to build an orphanage Home, and unwittingly was the flattery of the prelates and other dignitaries, telling them of the "beautiful daughters of a more beautiful mother." Think of it. Think. Did he tell them that these daughters, on in their only maturity, were proving their strange relations—setting their course with the State? Is what mingled languages of Church and State and have adopted the use of our old ones, or has he represented before the Lord Mayor, the Archbishop, and others a form of religion in America which has kept their pure and unspotted? How can one be free from the devil, and the State? But no! It is safe to say that the preacher was such a flatterer, that he was also so enamored of the Church, especially of its favors to the State which so grandly and so favors the Church, and so themselves, as represents, of all that he had seen, that he uttered not a word of condemnation for the union of Church and State in England, of which they are, only anxious to participate in the benefit, so blind to the fact that the old mother tongue the "Installed badge of privilege and true religion is the Church, which accepts of no relation with God that does not come from their own hearts, as they participate in the same things."

Not only the representatives of the Baptist denomination, but every man who is willing to hang on the favor of civil authority, denies the fundamental position of Old World Church and State.

He is for the popular religious movement that always emanates from man from the lowest element, said. But every man who does these things, has taken upon himself the responsibility of the Church upon him to stand against the current and the whole world which is foreign to him.
