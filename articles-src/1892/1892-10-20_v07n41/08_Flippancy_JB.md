HARMLESS, impersonal satire is above any hypercritical reproof; but flippancy of tone, or sneering at the opinions of those who differ with us on important subjects, places the sneerer in the seat of the scorner and under the condemnation of Jesus Christ (see Matt. 5:22). Discussing the divisions among Christians a recent writer uses a very common illustration, for example: "Is not this Quaker devout? The churchman looks on him as an excellent man but not religious, the Baptist thinks him deficient because he has not been immersed, and the Quaker in turn doubts the religion of his honest churchly friend because he goes to 'church' instead of to 'meeting' and listens to a priest instead of an exhorter." This is the style of a class of talkers who belittle doctrines about which other men disagree in order to exalt the importance of those doctrines of which they are special advocates. The quotation may correctly give the Churchman's opinion of a Quaker, but to say that immersion stands for all the difference between the Baptist and the Quaker or any other class of Christians, is untrue. Baptists are not ritualists as to baptism, unless they are of the denomination known as Disciples. If Christians are unable to agree with Christ Jesus that "thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness" by imitating their public profession of Christ with the symbol of death unto sin and resurrection unto righteousness and eternal life, it is at least charitable to doubt they understand what baptism is. The Quaker knows there is a vast deal more than the difference between listening to a priest instead of an exhorter in the distance between him and the churchman. There is all the large doctrine of the inner light, the operation of the Holy Spirit, and the testimony against a hireling ministry.

It argues (1) an assumption of the mental superiority of the person who thus emphasizes the apparent difference between Christians without notice of the real difference; (2) it is calculated by its tone of ridicule to lower in the mind of the person ridiculed his belief in the real difference between Christian denominations; and thus (3) by substituting a personal influence for the power of truth upon the conscience it saps the strongest foundation of character. For be it understood the enemy of souls is a person, an aggregate of personalities, chief of whom is Mephistopheles, the sneerer. From the pathos with which Jesus noted that woe comes from offenses he turned to the denunciation of woe against him by whom they come, the personality by which offenses are put in operation. They who would speak the truth in love will never barb the arrows of divine truth with flippancy or scorn.
