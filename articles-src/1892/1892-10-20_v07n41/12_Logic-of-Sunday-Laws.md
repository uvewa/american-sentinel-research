THE Signs of the Times pertinently remarks that "the men behind Sunday laws and religious persecutions are no worse than men in general. In persecuting those who oppose them, they but carry out the inevitable logic of their position. Of course, God will not help in what is not his. They have, therefore, gone down to Egypt for help, and they will have to take what Egypt has to give. This gift is spiritual death, however, to its recipients."

As citizens, we oppose National Reform, so-called, in all its phases, because it is un-American; as Christians, we oppose it because it is subversive of the principles of the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ.
