NATIONAL RELIGIOUS LIBERTY ASSOCIATION.

DR. A. T. RAVLIN, of San Francisco, Cal., has been speaking in Chicago in opposition to the Sunday closing of the World's Fair. He takes the position that those who are responsible for the closing of the World's Fair will also be responsible for the mischief which Satan will find for idle hands to do on that unoccupied day.

AT the convention of the Christian Church, in session at Washington, D. C., last week, resolutions were passed calling for the complete closing of the World's Fair on Sunday.

There are those in that denomination who do not sympathize with legislative efforts to enforce religion; some of the ministers present at the convention have a keen sense of the impropriety of such a course, yet no voice put itself on record against this error, even though it be known to be fatal to true religion. It is everywhere the same. Those who know the right in this matter among the popular churches, do not uphold the right. Why is this so?
