A CORRESPONDENT for the Chicago Inter-Ocean writing in reference to the World's Fair souvenir coins says:—

I would suggest that the acts of Congress relative to the passage of such a provision, together with the specification for the closing of the Fair on the Sabbath, be indelibly stamped upon the coin that all nations may look upon them, not only with respect but with profound gratitude that the American Congress of 1893 has shown to the world that the people of the United States believe in being obedient to the demands of their Creator, and respecting the Sabbath as all Christian nations should; and would also suggest that a proper inscription, in language expressive of the acts, be stamped upon the coin so that, in the lapse of time, through the generations to come, our children's children shall read the inscription on these coins and emulate the example of those who occupied the halls of Congress in 1892.

The maker of these suggestions is evidently a religious enthusiast, without a thought of the impropriety of the acts which he wishes to commemorate. He is right that, so far as this world is concerned, no more enduring record could possibly be made than an inscription upon a coin. But let him stop and think. Let him understand that this is not a record of true religion, only the evidence of a lack of it, and he will then see that it would be well placed as a stamp on the treasure of this world which we are told will corrupt and rust away.
