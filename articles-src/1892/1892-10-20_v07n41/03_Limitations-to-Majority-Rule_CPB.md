THE September number of the Tidens Strom, Copenhagen, has an article on "State Authority" which though general in its terms, and written entirely without reference to the United States, or even to republican government, is specially applicable to this country because of its intelligent discussion of the political dogma that the majority has an absolute right over the minority.

After showing that the "divine right" which formerly attached, in the minds of the people to the king, has in the popular thought been transferred to the law, the writer of the article in question says: "Is the minority obliged to obey the majority? Is not the demand as absurd as that which would compel one to obey another, because the latter was two inches taller than the former? If the majority rule in everything, then freedom has come to an end, a man becomes a slave and ceases to be a free citizen."

To many Americans this will be a startling proposition; but in the light of the following illustration, given in Tidens Strom, all must admit its absolute truth:

Suppose a number of people organize a circulating library. From the start the majority of subscribers rule through and by the directors. It seems the most natural way, for it has become custom. Some day the majority votes to sell the library and use the proceeds to pay their fares to the Congo State. Must the minority acquiesce in such a proceeding? Can it thus be deprived of its property? Has it not a right to demand to be paid back its money, etc.? When the minority agreed to be ruled by the majority it meant that that authority related to all main questions for the good of the library, and no further. An emigration to the Congo is not for the good of the library. The minority rightly considers itself robbed of its money.

But that no State is ever formed in this way is admitted. The individual is born a member of the State and no agreement is ever made. But does this change the principle? Does it alienate from the individual any natural right? Does it justify the State in taking from him any liberty which he might properly insist upon were a compact really entered into? To answer questions similar to these, the article under consideration says:—

As we can not live without order and government, and do not want to relapse into barbarism, let us imagine the way a State might be formed. In the first place, all future citizens would agree that they needed a compact for the protection of life, honor, and property, and they would be willing to submit to majority rule for such a purpose. If the same people in the next place were asked if they would let the majority determine the country's religion, mode of worship, agricultural methods, trade prices, modes in dress, hours of labor, etc., the most of them would say no, and no agreement could be arrived at. A "majority" by force or by circumstances could not in such affairs exercise any moral supremacy. Every dissenting citizen would be justified in opposing laws given by the "majority," or those in power.

The conclusion reached is that "State authority can go no further than to questions of common interest, questions upon which all agree by necessity. It can not and must not extend to the personal and private." And the *Tidens Strom* is right. There are limitations to even majority rule. The majority, however large it may be, has properly no just power to deprive the minority of any natural right. Upon this subject John Stuart Mill says:—

I deny the right of the people to exercise such coercion, either by themselves or by their government. The power itself is illegitimate. The best government has no more title to it than the worst. It is as noxious, or more noxious, when exerted in accordance with public opinion, than when in opposition to it. If all mankind minus one, were of one opinion, and only one person were of the contrary opinion, mankind would be no more justified in silencing that one person, than he, if he had the power, would be justified in silencing mankind.

Again, directly in the same line, Mill says:—

This, then, is the appropriate region of human liberty. It comprises, first, the inward domain of consciousness; demanding liberty of conscience, in the most comprehensive sense; liberty of thought and feeling; absolute freedom of opinion and sentiment on all subjects, practical or speculative, scientific, moral, or theological. Secondly, the principle requires liberty of tastes and pursuits; of framing the plan of our life to suit our own character; of doing as we like, subject to such consequences as may follow; without impediment from our fellow-creatures, so long as what we do does not harm them, even though they should think our conduct foolish, perverse, or wrong. No society in which these liberties are not, on the whole, respected, is free, whatever may be its form of government; and none is completely free in which they do not exist absolutely and unqualified. The only freedom which deserves the name, is that of pursuing our own good in our own way, so long as we do not attempt to deprive others of theirs, or impede their efforts to obtain it.

In the face of so clear a statement of the principles which underlie human liberty, few will dispute what Mr. Mill and the *Tidens Strom* have said; but some will take refuge in the plea that there is in this age no use in saying such things, because the trend of the times is toward the fullest and most perfect liberty. But this is a most serious mistake; such expressions only mark that lack of appreciation of the value of liberty which makes its overthrow easy. Upon this point Mr. Mill says:—

There is in the world at large an increasing infestation to stretch unduly the powers of society over the individual, both by the force of opinion and even by that of legislation; and as the tendency of all the changes taking place in the world is to strengthen society, and diminish the power of the individual, this encroachment is not one of the evils which tend spontaneously to disappear; but, on the contrary, to grow more and more formidable. The disposition of mankind, whether as rulers or as fellow-citizens, to impose their own opinions and inclinations as a rule of conduct on others, is so energetically supported by some of the best and by some of the worst feelings incident to human nature, that it is hardly ever kept under restraint by anything but want of power; and as the power is not declining, but growing, unless a strong barrier of moral conviction can be raised against the mischief, we must expect, in the present circumstances of the world, to see it increase.

And it is increasing at an alarming rate, and nowhere more rapidly than in our own country, and that for the reason that the "strong barrier of moral conviction" which once opposed it seems to have been entirely swept away by a flood of sickly sentimentalism which makes the State everything and the individual nothing; and which instead of developing men, would make of the individual members of the human family mere automatons all fashioned according to a single pattern, with no diversity, and, if possible, less force of character.
