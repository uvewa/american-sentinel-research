THE Michigan Christian Advocate of September 10, notes the fact that on the previous Sunday a Freethought Federation was formed in Chicago, and says:—

It claims to have as an object the prevention of any interference by the Church with the State. So far as Protestant churches are concerned the new organization need not be anxious. None of them want to be in any entangling alliance with the civil government. As churches they ask no special favors, and as organizations they do not intend to meddle with political affairs. The members of these churches as citizens will insist on religious ministrations being provided by the Government for those in its service, such as soldiers, sailors and legislators who wish such ministrations. To deny them would be cruel. These citizens will also claim that it is only decently humane in the State to furnish a chaplain who will be the sympathizing and helpful friend of prisoners in our penitentiaries. And they will claim also, what long experience has shown to be true, that telling mortals need a weekly day of rest. As the majority of people have special reasons for selecting a specific day of the week as this rest day, it is simple common sense they will assert on the part of legislators when ordaining a rest day to choose this day of the week. As a civil institution for the present welfare of the people, these Christian citizens will insist on this rest day, and all free thinkers may have against it to their hearts' content.

THE SENTINEL has little in common with so-called "Freethinkers." We regard all forms of infidelity as something to be avoided, deplored, and opposed by all proper means. But we maintain that the "Freethinker" is responsible alone to God for his belief, and that he has just the same right to be an infidel that we have to be Christians.

NO DISCRIMINATION PROPER.

We further maintain that the State has no right to make any difference whatever between the Christian and the "Freethinker," or between the doctrines of the one and the doctrines of the other. There is no more reason why the State should supply chaplains to teach Christianity than there is that it should supply chaplains to inculcate "free thought." It has just as good a right to take the public money for one purpose as for the other. It should do neither. It is a fact that State-paid chaplains are ornamental rather than useful; and those prisons, army posts, and charitable institutions that are without such chaplains are much better served by volunteer missionaries than are those that have regular chaplains. The reason for this is not far to seek; as a rule the regular chaplain is appointed not because of his piety but because of his political "pull;" while on the other hand the volunteer Christian missionary engages in the work from love of the truth which he teaches and from a burning desire to do good and to save souls. There is absolutely no good reason for State-supported chaplains, but very many reasons why there should be no such thing.

But for a fuller discussion of the question of employment of chaplains, we would respectfully refer the Advocate to a very able sermon on the subject by a Baptist clergyman, published in the Washington Post of August 25, 1890.

Notwithstanding the Advocate's denial, there is danger to be feared from the Protestant churches; indeed that is just the source from which danger threatens. The Protestant churches are asking special favors as churches. They have, as churches, not only asked governmental recognition of religious institutions but they have demanded such recognition, and have boasted that "the Christian churches can have anything they want."

WEEKLY REST NOT NECESSARY.

That a Sabbath properly used is a good thing none can deny who believe that God adapted everything to the wants of his creatures; but that physical rest is the prime object of the Sabbath and that it is a physical necessity to have a stated day of rest is not true and has never been demonstrated. On the contrary it has been demonstrated that there is no truth in the assumption—for it is simply assumption—that men must have a regular period of rest every seven days.

Less than two years since the following appeared in the Christian Statesman:—

Attention is being called to the comparative longevity of the Jews. Thus, it is said that in Polish Russia, in a population of ten thousand, three Christians die for every two Jews, and that in Austria the proportion is about the same. In Saxony, one Jew in fifty-one and one Christian in thirty-three expresses the comparative death rate. At Frankfort, fifty-four per cent. of the Jews reach their seventieth year, against thirty-eight per cent. of the Christians. In Hungary, the chance of life among the Croats is put at twenty years, the Germans at twenty-seven, and the Jews at forty-six.

This item furnishes a complete refutation of the standard argument for the so-called "civil Sabbath." We are told that a weekly day of rest is absolutely essential to the health of the people, and that in order for a part of the people to rest all must rest; and that as all will not rest without a law compelling them to do so, a Sunday law is a physical necessity. This claim has been urged so long and so confidently that many accept it without question; but that it is not true is shown by Hebrew vital statistics everywhere.

It will of course be urged that the Jews observe a regular weekly rest, and that this is one reason for the low death rate among them. But what then becomes of the assertion that the necessary rest can not be obtained unless all rest upon the same day? Clearly, it fails to the ground; for so far as the Jews do rest in the manner insisted upon by the Sunday-law advocates as a physical necessity, they rest upon a day when those around them are engaged in the ordinary pursuits of life; thus utterly refuting the contention of the American Sabbath Union that all must rest or none can.

And not only do the Jews disprove the assertion that needful rest can not be taken by a part of the people while the other part are at work, but the facts quoted from the Statesman also discredit the claim, so confidently made by some, that a stated weekly rest is a physical necessity; for it is a well known fact that very many Jews, yielding to the greed of gain, keep no day, but do business seven days each week.

TESTIMONY OF BISHOP ANDREWS.

Nor are the Jews the only living witnesses against the assumption that a regular weekly rest-day is a physical necessity of mankind. March 11, 1890, the writer heard Bishop Andrews, of the Methodist Episcopal Church, who had just returned from China, say that "in that country they have no Sabbath; yet laboring men live to be very old." He said that he did not understand it, but that it was a fact. The Bishop made this statement on the platform of a meeting held under the auspices of the American Sabbath Union, and he had no intention of discrediting the physical-necessity argument; but facts have always been unkind to falsehood, and so the blow was none the less deadly because given by a friendly hand.

All this goes to show that the Advocate and all others who plead for what they are pleased to call a "civil Sabbath" are only seeking to conceal their real purpose, which is to secure the enforcement of a religious dogma by civil law.
