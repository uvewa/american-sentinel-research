A question has been asked concerning the editorial article, "What Constitutes a Union of Church and State," which appeared on the second page of THE SENTINEL of October 6. The inquiry is, Was it the action of the bishops in deciding what was the Christian religion that formed the Roman Papacy? We answer, No. The next to the last phrase in the last sentence of the article referred to, should have been a separate sentence, or better yet, the beginning of a paragraph. It was designed to refer, not alone to the action of the bishops, but to those things also which led up to that action, and culminated in it. The editorial staff of THE SENTINEL is a unit on the questions discussed in its columns, and the paper will take no back step.
