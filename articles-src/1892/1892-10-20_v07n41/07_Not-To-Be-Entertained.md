THE Christian at Work has this to say of the attitude of the Catholics toward the public school question:—

In issuing a pastoral letter read from all the pulpits of his diocese denouncing the Compulsory Education law of that State, Bishop Jansen, of Illinois, takes the ultra Roman Catholic position that it is an injustice that the Roman Catholics should have to contribute to the public and the parochial schools. This, however, is only threshing the old straw over again. The simple fact is—and it has been iterated and reiterated a thousand times—the State furnishes non-sectarian education to all, for which all must pay. If the Catholics prefer one system and the Jews another, and the German Lutherans another—it matters not: it is the office of the State to furnish the facilities of public education, and for what the State supplies to all it is clear all must pay. That the children should be educated religiously goes without saying. For that office there exists the family and the Church. If, however, a religious organization prefers to establish religious schools, it is no more in order that they should be relieved of their share of the school tax than that the property of a blind man should be relieved of the cost of furnishing street signs for those who do read, or that a cripple should be free of paying taxes for repairing a road over which he is unable to travel.

It would seem that the public school tax is not such a great burden but that all should be willing to bear it for the good that it does in educating those who would otherwise grow up in ignorance. The Catholic proposition to divide the school funds upon sectarian lines ought never to be favorably entertained. Money raised by public taxation for school purposes should be expended by the State in giving instruction in the common branches of knowledge, not in imparting a knowledge of the dogmas of any religion, either true or false. The State has nothing to do with such questions.
