IN a recent communication to the Christian Cynosure, Rev. M. A. Gault says:—

For more than ten years I have given my time to National Reform work, and so long as health permits I feel constrained to continue the work. I have a growing conviction that this work is most important to the salvation of souls and the coming of Christ's kingdom. No department of Christian work is so necessary at this time, because so much neglected. More than nineteen-twentieths of the churches' efforts is now employed in applying the gospel to men in their individual, family and church relations, to the neglect of their civil or political relations. The strategic movement of Satan in these times is to get control of the world's politics and operate it against the churches. He is doing this by inducing Christian people to restrict their efforts to prayer-meeting, Christian Endeavor, missionary society and Y. M. C. A. work; and to neglect and even oppose efforts to bring religion in contact with politics.

Could their ever be a more emphatic denial of the importance and power of the gospel than are these words by Mr. Gault? Christ commissioned his apostles to preach the gospel and sent them out into an unfriendly world promising them a glorious triumph by divine power, but National Reform makes the success of the gospel dependent upon the favor of the rulers of this world.
