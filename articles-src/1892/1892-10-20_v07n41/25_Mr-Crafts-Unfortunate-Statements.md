Mr. CRAFTS is sometimes unfortunate in his statements, but never more so, for his own cause, than when at Coin, Iowa, September 20, he stated that "by writing letters twenty ministers in Kentucky made the congressmen from that State believe that the whole State was in favor of Sunday closing." This is really a confession of fraud—that the twenty ministers deliberately deceived congressmen in the interests of the "American Sabbath."

But it is not alone when speaking that Mr. Crafts says things which a more careful man would not say, and which a more conscientious man never would have occasion to say concerning a cause in which he was enlisted. An example of this is found in Our Day for October. Of the Sunday closing proviso to the World's Fair appropriation, Mr. Crafts said:

Professed friends of the Sabbath who have not helped to secure this victory by petition or letter or both may well hide their faces in shame. Fully 150,000 petitions were sent to pastors in the mails by great labor and at great cost, of which 100,000 should have come back from that number of religious organizations of various kinds, but not ten thousand of these organizations have so petitioned.

And yet, in the very same paragraph, indeed in the sentence just preceding this quotation, Mr. Crafts claims forty million people as desiring the closing of the Fair on Sunday. According to his own showing not ten thousand out of a possible 100,000 religious organizations in this country petitioned for Sunday closing even when the matter was brought home to their very doors and they were asked to do so. Then what authority has Mr. Crafts for claiming that these people who neglected, if they did not positively refuse, to petition, were in favor of something they never asked for.

As a matter of fact very many of the people who have been counted again and again, some of them several times over, as petitioners in favor of the Sunday closing of the Fair, are entirely indifferent upon the subject; while many of them are, like Bishop Potter and the Christian Union, in favor of having the Fair open at least a portion of Sunday. It is a bad cause that compels resort to the methods employed by Mr. Crafts and his coadjutors.
