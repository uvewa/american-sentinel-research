THE Christian Register mentions, with hearty commendation, the resolution of the New York State Board of Women Managers of the Columbian Exhibition, asking that the Exposition be kept open on Sunday. Still, although the Register comments at some length, it makes no mention of the real issue at stake in this matter.

But it makes up for this in another place by saying, editorially, under the title, "Congress and Christianity":—

"The American Unitarian Association let slip a great opportunity to put itself on record on the right side, when it took action in regard to the Sunday opening of the Columbian Exposition. Without any reference to what should be the proper decision of that question, the true ground would have been that Congress has no right whatever to pass special laws in favor of religion in any form. Before the law and Constitution of the United States, Jew and Gentile, Christian and pagan, stand with equal rights. It is a wonder that no one of us thought of it at the time. It is a wonder that, when opinion was divided as to what recommendation we should make to Congress, no one was wise enough to arise, and say that the whole scheme was foreign to the temper of Unitarianism and the spirit of our Government. We have been consistent heretofore in our opposition to the attempt to legislate Christianity into the Constitution of the United States; and now, unthinkingly, we fall into the trap set by the adversary of religious liberty, and go on record with the request to Congress that it shall take action in regard to the observance of the Christian Sunday. Are we mistaken when we say that the mere mention of this fact will convince all our readers that we might have taken higher ground in our May meeting? The question is likely to come up in our autumnal meetings. Let us fall back upon our record and fundamental principle, and say that all special legislation by Congress in regard to Christianity or any of its institutions, except to declare liberty of conscience to all men, is foreign to the spirit of our institutions. We see what has come of such legislation. Could anything be more pitiful than the readiness of habitual Sabbath breakers to put themselves on record, for political purposes, as being in favor of the 'Christian Sabbath'?

"The precedent is a dangerous one. Once let the question as to Christianity come before Congress; and who does not see that there is definite danger that a majority of senators and representatives will vote that Christianity is the law of the land, that this is a Christian Nation, and that we are bound to support by law Christian principles and to forbid unchristian practices?

"If, through inadvertence, we have slipped away from our well-defended post, let us make haste to renew our vigilance. There can be no doubt that every advocate of 'Christianity in the Constitution' has taken courage at his success in vindicating the honor of the 'Christian Sabbath' by voting a restriction on the loan granted to the Columbian Exposition. There can be no doubt that the next step will be taken with greater confidence and more hope of success. It is equally certain that, to make our influence felt, we must not merely support the legislation that we like, and oppose that which is not of our way of thinking, but we must resist all legislation which has the slightest tendency to limit religious liberty in belief, spirit, and practice. Let us remember that it was Anne Hutchinson's fruitful maxim, 'No man a delinquent on account of creed,' which put the spirit and letter of religious liberty into the Massachusetts Bill of Rights and the Constitution of the Commonwealth."
