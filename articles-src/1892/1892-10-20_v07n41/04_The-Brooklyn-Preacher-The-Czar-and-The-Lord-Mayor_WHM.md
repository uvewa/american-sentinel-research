REV. DR. TALMAGE has returned to his flock in a very happy and optimistic mood. He went on a mission of charity in which the right hand had been pretty well informed as to what the left hand was doing. As a matter of course, therefore, a most delightful reciprocity of feeling was the consequence, and Dr. Talmage profited greatly in the interchange of courtesies which ensued. He, consequently, comes home in a high state of elation. The courtly language of compliment still clings to his lips, and this with some very pernicious and un-American views, with which he has become infected, have escaped both quarantine and the custom house officers. Immediately upon arriving at his Brooklyn home the Doctor proceeded to unpack his foreign goods and give them out liberally to the American public through the reporters. The extravagance of his adulation of Russian royalty is harmless, though amusing, as the expression of a Brooklyn minister whose practice it should be to be no respecter of persons. He says:—

The Czar, I think, is one of the grandest men I ever met. He is as great as he is good and is doing the best he can for his people. The Empress, too, is a delightful woman. In every action she is an Empress, yet has the artlessness and simplicity of a child.

It used to be said of an aged historian of note whose lectures were once much in vogue among the literary "four hundred" of New York, that his lectures upon Queen Elizabeth quite betrayed the good old gentleman as being "retrospectively enamored of her royal highness." Either Dr. Talmage has spoken very recklessly or his language betrays the weak and pitiful state of a mind overcome with sweet words, and courtly tinsel, and royal flattery, until he has become enamored of royalty. But it was the harmless and platonic fire of a historical imagination which inspired the delightful old lecturer; while Dr. Talmage is infected with a passion which takes all its character from the conditions of the immediate present, and may, from his personality, become highly contagious. His symptoms are serious. The evidences are that the disorder has become chronic with him. Not only is he afflicted with this overweening admiration for royalty itself but he is also impressed with the royal prerogatives of religion, and is delighted to have hobnobbed and banqueted with the queen's bishops and canons of the Church of England. I responded to the toast of "Religion in America."

It would be interesting to know what this popular preacher said in such a hearing upon religion in America. Did he tickle their itching ears with the recital of the fact that the laws for the civil enforcement of religious observance which they had transplanted to American soil, in colonial times, had become the chief corner-stones upon which the Supreme Court, by judicial fiat, constitutes this a Christian Nation? Did he intentionally paraphrase Horace, and unwittingly make a scriptural reference, by telling them of the "beautiful daughters of a more beautiful mother" which had developed here. Did he tell them that these daughters, now in their early maturity, were proving their lineage and showing themselves worthy of their descent by their course with the State? In what mingled language of Church and State and banquet hall did he say all this? Or, did he represent before the Lord Mayor, the bishops, and the sanons, that religion in America which has kept itself pure and undefiled, unspotted from the world, the devil, and the State? Did he? It is safe to say he did not. But others greater than he are also so enamored of the State, and greedy of its favors to the Church, and to themselves, as representatives of the Church, that they have no word of condemnation for the union of Church and State where it exists. They, too, are only anxious to participate in the feast, blind to the fact that they are feeding upon the "funeral baked meats," of true religion in the Church, which accepts the advances of the State, and in their own hearts, as they participate in the worldly sacrilege.

Not only the representatives of the Church but the popular Church, at large, is willing to hang on the favor of civil rulers and share in and emulate the spiritual pollution of Old World Church and State union.

This is the popular religious movement of the hour in this country. No one man, however eminent, leads. But every religious teacher, however humble, should understand the responsibility which rests upon him to stand against the current and teach religion pure and undefiled, unspotted from the world.
