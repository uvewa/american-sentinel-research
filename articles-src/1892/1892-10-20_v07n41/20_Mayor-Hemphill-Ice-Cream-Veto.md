CONGRESSMAN HEMPHILL is Mayor of Atlanta; he is also Chairman of the House Committee on the District of Columbia, which, during the last session of Congress, reported favorably to the House the bill to prohibit the sale and delivery of ice on Sunday in the District of Columbia, as well as the provision punishing profanity in the District. It seems that as Mayor of Atlanta Mr. Hemphill is keeping up the record made in Congress on this question. Not long ago the Atlanta City Council passed an ordinance allowing the Atlanta Parcel and Express Company to deliver ice cream and such commodities on Sunday. This measure Mayor Hemphill promptly vetoed.

There was a ground upon which this measure should have been vetoed; it was not upon this ground, however, that Mr. Hemphill's veto was based. The Atlanta City Council has no right to say that the parcel delivery shall or shall not serve its customers on Sunday, any more than on any other day. If the veto had stated this and called for the repeal of other existing similar ordinances it would have taken the proper position; not otherwise.
