# The Illinois School Law.

THE Illinois compulsory school law is in a fair way to be somewhat modified, several modifications having been proposed.

The Illinois school law is one of which much has been made occasionally in the press, and of which the Catholics naturally complained. The law goes to the extent of requiring that each child between the ages of seven and fourteen shall attend some public school at least sixteen weeks each year. A child attending a private school approved by the Board of Education or directors of "the city, town, or village, and in which shall be taught in the English language" reading, writing, arithmetic, and United States history, is as free as the propriety of a law compelling parents to send their children to school at the very outset is questionable. They are all agreed upon the propriety of a law compelling parents to educate their children. Here too is a law which practically gives to the Boards of Education the power to shut up parochial schools, except such as they choose to approve; and this is the right and proper care to be substituted for the parochial schools the public school—where the State should train its citizens—to which Catholics and all must send their children to private schools is their own business.
