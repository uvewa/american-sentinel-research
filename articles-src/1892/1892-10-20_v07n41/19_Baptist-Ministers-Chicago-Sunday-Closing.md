THE Baptist ministers of the city of Chicago, in their Conference held Monday, October 3, passed resolutions endorsing the action of Congress in regard to requiring the gates of the Exposition to be closed on Sunday, and protesting against the repeal of the same by that body, when it shall again assemble. Mayor Washburne and other prominent citizens, were severely censured for their opposition to the Sunday closing act. It was noticeable that the Conference was not a unit, although the vote was declared to be unanimous. Some left before the vote was reached, and many that were present did not vote on either side.

There were about sixty ministers at the Conference. This is the first action this Conference has taken in favor of Sunday legislation. About one year ago, the same body had a similar matter under consideration, which provoked an animated discussion, in the course of which a prominent minister solemnly arose, shaking his arms, saying, "I imagine I can again hear the chains rattling on the arms of conscientious Baptist ministers."

These ministers are the representatives of the church that in the days of Cotton Mather, declared that it was not within the realm of the State to enforce obedience to any one of the first four commands of the Decalogue, for the reason that they alone related to man's duty to his God.
