We have no further news as yet from the Tennessee persecutions. But this is not strange inasmuch as the Tennessee Inquisition, like the Spanish Inquisition, is a star-chamber affair. Its work is done in secret, and the results are fully known only when warrants are served. It is not in its secret methods, however, that this Tennessee Grand Jury is peculiar, but in the fact that turning aside from its legitimate work, it has become an engine of religious persecution. Without doubt some of the Springville Adventists have been indicted, and will in due time be arrested; and in due course convicted and imprisoned, for the horrible offense of working on a day that other people devote, to a limited extent, to church-going, and very largely to visiting and other forms of pleasure-seeking.
