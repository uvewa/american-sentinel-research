THE Congregationalist has the following sensible item:—

It is reported that Commander Ballington Booth has publicly announced that the Salvation Army in America will vote with the Prohibition Party. We hope the statement is not true, and that, if it is true, Mr. Booth has made this pledge without authority. Any religious organization whose "commander" could command with authority its members to vote with any political party would be out of place in this country, a foe both to the Republic and the Christian religion.

This is true; but is it any worse for the commander of the Salvation Army to give such a pledge for that organization than for the leaders of the American Sabbath Union to make a similar pledge for their much larger following?—Certainly not.

The threat of political boycott, by which Congress was induced to pass the Sunday closing proviso to the World's Fair appropriation, was in effect an avowal of ability to control the votes of the church members of the land, and it was not an idle boast. The result is that the churches have learned that they hold the Government in their hands, and they will not be slow to use their power, and thus, according to the Congregationalist, they are "a foe both to the Republic and to the Christian religion."
