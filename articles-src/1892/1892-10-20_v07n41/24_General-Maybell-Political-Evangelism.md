A NEW religio-political reform has been inaugurated in this country by "General" Maybell and wife, late of San Francisco, now located at 19 Clinton Place, this city.

To a reporter of the Sun who recently interviewed him, the General said:

Our methods are different from those of the Salvation Army. That organization redeems individuals for the next world. We believe in trying to redeem them for this world. We are here to persuade them that the kingdom of heaven is at hand, and to make everybody happy. We do not deal in futures. We take care of the present.

All through our religion are the symbols of the male and the female, and our trinity is the father, the mother, and the son, or the people. The motherhood is as necessary as the fatherhood, and we sing:

Glory be to the fatherhood; that is wisdom;
Glory be to the motherhood; that is love;
Glory be to the people; that is the children;
God in three persons, blessed trinity.

Our creed is practical. We believe in politics. Politics is the expression of the male, and religion is the expression of the female. Both should cooperate. Religion is the architect and politics the builder. To reform the world we must see that politics does its work properly. We are political evangelists, and we are practical in our methods.

If we can get 5,000 followers here as earnest as those of the Salvation Army we can turn this Government upside down and reform it. It sounds like a wild theory, but it isn't, and I know it. There are many new things in our religion, and woman is one of them. The Trinity of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost does not mention woman. To have love we must have woman.

In our army the woman's rank is equal to the man's. When the army becomes strong enough to control elections women shall have her share of offices. Religion is the first and great commandment of our creed and politics is its law.

It may be two weeks more before we can hold any meetings here, but I tell you that as soon as we open up, our influence will be felt. We have new ideas: they are simple and they are practical. The Church of to-day preaches for the future. That is good, but how about the present? Let us take care of that first, and take the kingdom of heaven which is at hand.

Let us take it by practical methods. The Republican Party appeals to the head and includes the thinking men. The Democratic Party appeals to the heart and includes those in whom sentiment predominates. Both must go.

General Maybell may never be able to secure his 5,000 followers, but his idea of moral reform by means of political action is the popular one because it promises large results from very small effort. It is National Reform in Salvation Army guise, and may be one of the forces to contribute to the complete and perfect setting up of the American papacy under the name of Protestantism.
