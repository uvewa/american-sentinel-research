THE "Pearl of Days," says "the security or disaster of our American institutions depends upon the issue of this Sabbatic contest and the proper enforcement by civil enactment of all divine law that inures to the well being of the State."

To determine what portion of divine law inures to the well being of the State, and then to construe that portion and decide as to its application to the State, the proper terms by which to enact it into civil law, and fix the methods of its enforcement, has always involved those legislators who have attempted it in such a maze of evident error, contradiction, inconsistency and injustice, as ought in itself to prove to any intelligent being the impropriety of attempting to enforce the divine law by the civil.
