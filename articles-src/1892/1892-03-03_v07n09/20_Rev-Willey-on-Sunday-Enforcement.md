AN exchange reports Rev. J. H. Willey, of Syracuse, New York, as teaching in a sermon, lately delivered in that city, that in order to preserve the religious observance of Sunday the Government must legislate to that effect, and then enforce its laws,—and saying, "When the law is made then I appeal to you as a church; I appeal to you as Christians, stand by the ship of State and if any one dares to desecrate the day—over the rail with the wretch!"

To have carried out the nautical figure of speech to an exactitude he should have said, "Let him walk the plank!" It has been evident for some time that there are pirates on board this ship of State, who intend to mutiny, capture the ship, and do their best to send all who oppose them to Davy Jones' locker. They must be very sure of success to appeal so openly to their co-conspirators.
