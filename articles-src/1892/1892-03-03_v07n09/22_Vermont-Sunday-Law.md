THE CITROGRAPH, Redlands, California, publishes this, credited to the Grocer and Country Merchant, and heads it, "Absurd Laws."

"Commercial travelers, or others who carry accident insurance policies, should be careful when business or pleasure takes them to some of the eastern States, having Sunday laws, that they do not go shooting or fishing on the first day of the week. By a recent decision of the Vermont Supreme Court it was held in the case of Duran vs. Standard Life and Accident Insurance Company, that a person who walked from one town to another on Sunday for the purpose of hunting violated the laws of Vermont, which forbid hunting on Sunday, or traveling on that day, except from necessity or charity; that an injury occasioned by his slipping on frozen ground while returning home from hunting on Sunday was not covered by an accident insurance policy exempting the company from liability where a 'violation of law' was the act, cause, or condition, 'wholly or partly, directly or indirectly, producing the injury, or where the injury was affected by any such act, cause, or condition, or under its influence.' Residents on this coast, where the law is indifferent as to whether one attends church or goes fishing on Sunday, will find it hard to realize that such enactments as the Vermont Sunday law exist in any American commonwealth. It may be perhaps that to the existence of the narrow views, as expressed in the Vermont statute, is to some extent due the steady decline in the population of a State which has produced so many men of distinguished ability."
