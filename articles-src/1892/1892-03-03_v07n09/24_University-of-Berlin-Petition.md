Sixty-nine professors of the University of Berlin, including two of the theological faculty, have, it is stated, petitioned the Prussian Diet not to pass the Primary Education Bill, on the ground that the bill restricts the right of the State. It should be opposed on the ground that it restricts the right of the individual.
