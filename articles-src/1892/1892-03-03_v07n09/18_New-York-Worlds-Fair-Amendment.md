THE World's Fair bill, appropriating $300,000 for the exhibit of the State of New York, has been amended in the Assembly by the addition of a provision that the State exhibit should be kept closed on Sunday. The amendment was adopted by a vote of forty-nine to forty-seven. On motion of Mr. Bush the resolution was then laid aside, in order as the mover said, "to give the Republicans, who were trying to make political capital out of a religious question, time to think over the matter." The bill can be called up at any time, and if passed in this form by the Assembly will necessarily return to the Senate for its concurrence upon the amendment.
