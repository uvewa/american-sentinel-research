In Switzerland, as well as in Belgium, "Sunday postage stamps" are advertised for sale, that thus, by their use, the authorities may obtain an expression as to the sentiment of the people in reference to Sunday mails. In comment upon this the Northwestern Christian Advocate, remarks:—

It seems that the Government has not the courage to meet that question in a square and manly way. Oh, for more moral courage!

By this the Northwestern means, why did not the Swiss Government act despotically upon this question and do away with Sunday mails without consulting the wishes of the people in any manner. It would seem that in the eyes of that paper a religious despotism is the only moral and manly government.
