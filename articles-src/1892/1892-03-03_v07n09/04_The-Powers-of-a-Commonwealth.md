## The Powers of a Commonwealth.

THE distinction between sin and crime are many; but to make the discrimination it is necessary to mention but a few.

1. Sin is a breach of the law of holiness, a lapse out of the likeness to the divine plan. Whosoever will resort to infallible civil law. 2. Sin is defined by the moral law, crime by diversified statutes. 3. The penalty for sin is always the same, while penalties for crimes according to time and place; for sins are uniform. 4. Outward forms, may be crime, and crime may be identical with sin, but not necessarily so. For instance, civil laws permit the acquisition of property. But when the citizen to that end, the State does not question whether or not it has been honestly come at effect or not. Property is disposed of, and handsome profits realized, but the civil law does not demand a portion of the specious profits for charity. In its greedy desire to accumulate money, one may practically from a prospective customer the knowledge of an existing flaw in that which he is selling, and thereby secure the best of a bargain. It is abhorrent to take such a course, it is in fact a sin, yet the law does not oblige him to make restitution as it would do the equivalent, because that method of dealing is not considered a crime. Again a man's covetousness may lead him to carry for money. He has violated a plain command of God, and so committed sin, yet the marriage is regarded lawful by the State. On the other hand, it is possible for one to be convicted of crime by the civil law, when he has violated no precept of the moral law. In their zeal to protect what they regard their interests, some governments make laws of an oppressive nature, which those in whom they wish to dominate frankly can see no good reason. To illustrate: The United States has exclusive laws which forbid certain persons, from other countries, to land on its shores. Now suppose one of these unfortunates, is, defiance of the law, pursues happiness by quickly seeking to better his fortune in the forbidden territory, what precept of morality has he violated? None. His offense is apprehended by the civil law, and his liberty restrained, just the same as the most pronounced criminal.

An another illustration on this point, the following facts, relative to American slavery, may be cited. Prior to the era of the only resolution, in the freedom of 2,000,000 slaves, it was held to be a criminal offense to aid one of those bondmen to escape to English soil, or to harbor him while thus running the gauntlet for liberty. All along the northern borders of the slave States, benevolent Quakers, and others, operated what was then known as "under-ground railways," for the purposes of secretly being the unfortunate fugitives from freedom. But in every case they exposed themselves to the penalty of six months' imprisonment, a fine of $1,000, and civil damages to the same amount. To thus befriend a fellow-creature, held in bondage, was, under those statutes of men, thus constituted a crime and was a very severe one; while the abolitionist daring the ignominy of the statute to openly assist those condemned to servitude, yet who can say that the aid rendering advice and those men, defying the rigors of the civil law, were sin before the law of Jehovah?

Another, and a very relevant inquiry is, why a civil government can not treat sin as it is, that the attempt of the civil power to deal with the State must create and not equally, would be useless and nonsense. While the moral law calls for an extreme penalty upon its transgressors—even death, in one case and suffer the punishment prescribed, however severe, no penalty he accepts capital punishment, and of a necessity freely offered to all. The confinement sin, that alone or combination of the moral law may, upon genuine repentance, be forgiven of the national sin, congressional action in the name of Christ, have reparation, (see the letter, Ex. 20; 34:7), while the punishment, once the chase is free from the penalty of the moral law.

But suppose the State should punish crime as sin, and attempt to fix penalties in accordance with the extent of the wrong—would that constitute what it is the case, and brought before the judge for it. To this kind of every sin has it already been absolved from the civil court and into the Court of Heaven? If the Bible is true, the Sabbath, yet's acts at the agent of Jehovah, it would it not be legally bound to recognize validity of the expressions of plea, and discharge him? Carry the matter a step farther. Suppose the prisoner plead up, the to the time of his conviction by the law to fix they should it be convicted in violation, upon the verdict to that offend being sentenced to imprisonment, he, trusting to grace, takes open and hearty confession, and is thereupon "justified by faith," shall he have received full forgiveness of God the court? Could the court, the claim being that the State is empowered to punish crime for the purposes of discovering sin in those let the prisoner go? His history it certainly could, for when God gave that one free he is "free indeed."

It may be said that surely; such a process would destroy the power of the State to bring any one to justice. It certainly would, and that without penalty.

But still it will be the only logical conclusion of an attempt to make the civil law punish crime as sin against God; and all because the State, which is at best but a feeble power, assumes to assume the attributes and authority of Jehovah.
