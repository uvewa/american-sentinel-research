The World expresses itself upon the Sunday law of the State of New York thus:—

It is time for the Legislature to sweep away this relic of Puritanical intolerance. Its existence is not only a violation of the principle of our American system of government, and therefore a wrong to the individual; it is a direct incentive to evil.

Certainly, all religious laws in the State statutes are not only incentives to evil, but they are in themselves evil and only evil; they should be repealed; and if this "Nation" were only sufficiently "Christian" to understand the Bible and practice its teachings, they would be repealed before this present session of the Legislature closes.
