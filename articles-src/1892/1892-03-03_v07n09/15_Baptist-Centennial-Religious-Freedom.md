THE Christian Advocate notes the approach of the centennial anniversary of the constitutional establishment of religious freedom in this country, and says: "The Executive Committee of the American Baptist Home Mission Society has decided to call a celebration of the centennial of the incorporation into the Constitution of the United States of the clause forbidding Congress to make any law establishing or forbidding the free exercise of religion, as a triumph of Baptist principles. The ratification of the amendment was declared during the congressional session of 1791-92, so that we are now in its centennial year. Arrangements are on foot to make the celebration a marked feature of the Baptist anniversaries, in May next, in Philadelphia." At the same time they would do well to consider whether, in attending this anniversary, they are celebrating the birthday of a living principle in this Government, or have gathered to measure how much more than a word and a name that same amendment is after the lapse of one hundred years.
