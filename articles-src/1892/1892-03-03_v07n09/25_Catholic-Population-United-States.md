The Catholic Review claims that the Roman Catholic population of the United States is at least 20,000,000. Of these, 8,000,000 are "good Catholics," and the remainder, persons who believe the doctrines of the Catholic Church but who neglect confession and communion; the Review calls them "bad" or "indifferent" Catholics.
