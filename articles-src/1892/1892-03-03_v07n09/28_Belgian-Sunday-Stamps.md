There are in use in Belgium special postage stamps for those who do not wish their mail handled on Sunday. The object of the Government is to ascertain what proportion of the people of that country are practically opposed to Sunday mails. Remarking upon this fact an obscure National Reform organ, published in this city, says:—

Why not agitate for such stamps in this country? Why not write letters to Hon. John Wanamaker, P. O. Department, Washington, D. C., requesting that such stamps be prepared and put on sale? Surely the Superintendent of Bethany Sabbath school will do as much to give letter writers a chance to express their convictions as the Belgian Government.

Certainly; why not let those who want their letters delayed over Sunday have it so? The number however would be small, especially of those who are consumed by a desire to dictate to others what they shall and shall not do on that day. National Reform is not like charity; it does not begin at home: it seeks to reform the other fellow.
