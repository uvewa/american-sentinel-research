IN Minneapolis, "Mayor Winston has signed the amended liquor ordinance giving only the police of the city authority to make complaints against saloon keepers. It is stated that Superintendent Henderson has ordered the police to keep their hands off, and that saloons will open Sunday, beginning February 21. The whole matter will be carried to the Supreme Court, by a citizens' committee, on the plea that a person has the right to file information against another who is alleged to be breaking the laws of the State."
