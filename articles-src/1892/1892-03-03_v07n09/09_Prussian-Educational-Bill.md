THE lower house of the Prussian Landtag has been excitedly debating a new Educational Bill, which is practically a measure to make a State religion of which the German Emperor should be the Pope. The avowed object of the measure is to put the Prussian schools into the hands of the clergy, to make what is called religious instruction obligatory, and to exact from all students a full measure of conformity. In the language of the Imperial Chancellor, who is the chief advocate of the measure, "it is a bill against atheism." It would force doctrinal teaching upon children whose parents are opposed to such teaching; it would force Jews to accept Christianity,—such Christianity as the priests of the State religion might choose to teach. It sets up as supreme what is called in Prussia the "Confessions." The Emperor and his Lord Chancellor appear to believe that matters of faith can be easily regulated by statute, and that the people of Prussia are quite ready to put their consciences and their relations to God in the hands of the king. The opposition to the measure declares that it is an attempt to set up a political religion, which would practically result in the domination of an organized priesthood. The promoters of the bill admit the truth of the criticism, and attempt to justify it on the express ground that the real, vital question is whether Prussians are to be Christians or atheists. The discussion has been very warm, not a few of the government party being in the opposition. The Minister of Finance sees in it a menace to some of his plans for managing the monetary affairs of the empire, and has resigned. This is a singular comment upon the practical working of a religion made by law. We suggest that the advocates of legislation in behalf of religion and religious institutions in our own country make a study of this extraordinary Prussian movement.—Sabbath Recorder.
