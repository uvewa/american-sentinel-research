THE petition list of the New Jersey Legislature, for one day, protesting against the opening of the World's Fair, on Sunday according to the record, was quite large,—petitions being presented by Senators Roe, McMickie, Rogers, Perkins, Adrain, Miller, Cornish, and Hinckliffe, signed by "numerous of their constituents." The New Jersey Sabbath Union is making every effort to have the Legislature, commit itself on the question of Sunday closing of the Fair.
