Attention has been called recently, perhaps more emphatically than ever before, to some of the defects in the United States postal laws, by the exclusion of Printers' Ink, published in this city, from the privileges of second-class mail matter. That the decision is unjust and arbitrary must be clear to the average American mind; and that the law should be repealed or amended, which places such power in the hands of a single man, from whose decision it permits no appeal, is equally clear. On what principle the Post-office Department holds that Printers' Ink is third-class matter while it admits Book News as second-class, is hard to understand, unless indeed it is that the publisher of the latter publication is the Postmaster General. Mr. Wanamaker should spare time enough from political wirepulling, or if needs be, from his Sunday school, to see that his subordinates deal a little more justly with the people.
