AN evidence of how rapidly the idea of establishing national feast days, fast days, and religious and semi-religious holidays, is gaining ground, is the presentation in the Legislature of Minnesota, of a memorial asking for the passage of a law appointing October 13, the anniversary of the discovery of America, by Columbus, as "a day of national thanksgiving." Of this the Christian ad Work says: "We, together with the Lutheran Observer, have recommended the observance of Discovery Day for years."
