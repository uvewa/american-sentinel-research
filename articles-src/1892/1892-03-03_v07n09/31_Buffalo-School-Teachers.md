Certain clergymen of Buffalo have requested the Superintendent of the public schools, of that city, to furnish for publication in the daily press the names, together with the religious belief, of all of the teachers employed. The request was doubtless due to the charge that a number of Catholic teachers had been appointed by the superintendent. The superintendent's reply is respectful, as it should be, but it contains nevertheless a well-merited rebuke. He reminds the preachers that the laws and regulations governing the public schools of Buffalo do not require him to examine into the religious creeds of those who are employed, and further that for him to have attempted such an examination would have been impertinent and detrimental to the cause of education.

Commenting upon these facts, the Washington Post well says that "the school teachers of Buffalo are employed for the same reason that school teachers are engaged in other cities, and for this reason Superintendent Crooker's reply will interest the whole country. If any teacher is incompetent, he or she, as the case may be, should be promptly removed. But if no religious denomination is to be denied the privileges of the common school system it would be unjust to expect those of that belief to contribute to the support of the schools. This is an old question; the people are opposed to sectarianism in the schools, and the inquiring ministers of Buffalo are not altogether wise."
