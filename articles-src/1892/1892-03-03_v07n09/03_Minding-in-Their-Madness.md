## Minding in Their Madness.

"IN the Russian policy of persecution adopted towards the Jewish element," remarks the *Observer*, "there is apparently some method in the madness. According to the Vienna correspondent of the London *Jewish Chronicle,* M. Pobiedonostzeff was asked by M. Poliakoff, a well known Russian Jewish banker in St. Petersburg, whether it was true that the recent expulsion of Russian Jews was due to his initiative. M. Pobiedonostzeff replied that it was, and then went on to say: 'I admit that the harshness is great; but it was the working of the orders you refer to that was the logrotist of the orders yet not before me. In that memorandum it was pointed out how useful it would be to Russia if a considerable number, at least some three hundred thousands, of Jewish families could be compelled to embrace the orthodox faith, and thereby submit to or absorb the in Russia itself. The best way to this end, it was pointed out, would be to enforce the old statute against the Jews, because the classes most affected, viz., handicrafts, merchants, tradesmen, first-class merchants, doctors, lawyers, and so forth, would rather be converted than to be driven out of their blood and forced to reside within the pale of the Jewish pale. We Russians want new blood in our race, and none better could be found than that of the Jews, whose thrift, industry, soberness, domestic taste, care for learning and self-improvement, and a genius for trade, money making and money saving are just the qualities which we require, and which would come into our race by the infusion of Jewish blood. You can not amalgamate with the lowest classes of Jews. But I can not observe any bad qualities in the better class of Jews, like you, M. Poliakoff, and we hope to retain them by conversion, if we only leave them expulsion as an alternative.

All this was in my memorandum, and in an audience I had of the Czar, his Majesty shall deeply deplored the hope that tens of thousands of the better class of Jews would embrace the Orthodox faith, and thereby become Russians." The scheme is certainly a bold one and the statement of what would thus boldly announces it is at best an enormity. The views of M. Poliakoff on this subject would be instructive.
