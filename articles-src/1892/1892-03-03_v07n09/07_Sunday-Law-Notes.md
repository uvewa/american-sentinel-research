"McMaster's History of the United States" says of the code under which the French and Spanish of the New Orleans possessed territory—"the province of Louisiana to the United States in 1806,— no man whatever his color, could be suffered to work on the Sabbath, and on holidays, and fast days of the church. No Protestant could hold an office; or, even an arrested person, who was brought before one of them prosecuting him. If he had reviled the Sacrature or the Blessed Virgin, his property was confiscated and his tongue cut out." Although such penalties would not now be imposed because of being cruel and unusual, the author would the reviling of the "Blessed Virgin" to be treated as a penal offense, yet the denial of very criminal procedure is still retained, only modified out of respect to public feeling and its correspondence with Protestant tenets of Catholic creed.

The *Davenport, (Iowa)* *Gazette,* *Galveston, (Texas,)* credited to the *Grocer and Country Merchant,* and makes the following point:—

"Commercial travelers, or others who carry accident insurance policies, should be careful when business or pleasure takes them to some of the various States, having Sunday laws, they do not go shooting or fishing on the first day of the week. By a recent decision of the Vermont Supreme Court it was held in the case of Jones vs. Standard Life and Accident Insurance Company, that the beneficiary of a policy, who was killed on Sunday for the purpose of hunting violated the law of Vermont, which forbid hunting on Sunday, or traveling on that day, except from necessity or politeness, that an injury consequent by his stopping or from grounds while returning home from hunting on Sunday was not covered by an accident insurance policy. But does the court admit liability where a "violation of law" was the act, and if the person had done an act not of itself indirectly, producing the injury, or where the injury was inflicted by the act of another, on his direction, or under his influence. Residence on this count, where the law is indifferent as to whether one intended sincerely in good faith on Sunday, will find it hard to realize that such a construction as this can be put upon insurance policies by the moneyworth. It may be perhaps that to the entire of the matters view, as expressed in the Vermont statute, is to some extent the true moody decline to its laws or population a State which has produced so many men of distinguished ability.

At Pittsburg, where the Law and Order League is very active in trying to put down the Sunday labor, there was recently organized by the Printers' Assembly, a branch of the Knights of Labor, has passed the following resolutions:—

WHEREAS, There are many laws on the statute book of Pennsylvania, tended the compulsory observance of Sunday as a day of rest from the laboring of the laboring class, and

WHEREAS, the operations of the Law and Order League, mainly composed of disreputable persons, and controlled by Colonel E. J. Irish, in enforcing the laws enacted in the days of 1794, to the detriment of workingmen and their families, and otherwise making their lives oppressive than not—as the laboring classes that they have to educate themselves; therefore, be it

Resolved, That we denounce the attempts to engraft and blue Laws as blots upon the statute book; that we demand their repeal; that we denounce laws which permit foreigners to levy blackmail; that we demand that all citizens shall have the privilege of being heard in a court of competent and proper record, and further, be it

Resolved, That we call upon all citizens who have a regard for the liberties of the people and for religious, to cast their ballots for only those candidates for the Legislature who will pledge themselves to assist in the repeal of all Sunday or Blue Laws civil and other acts on the statute books of our State that are now being used to curtail the sacred and the liberties of our people.

It may be an extreme surprise to say the members of the Law and Order League—disreputable characters per se; more than all such leagues were a monument to lawful enterprise, the true resolutions show; from these resolutions, that the laboring men are getting their eyes open to the fact that Sunday legislation the American Sabbath Union, and other Sunday-law advocates would have it thought.
