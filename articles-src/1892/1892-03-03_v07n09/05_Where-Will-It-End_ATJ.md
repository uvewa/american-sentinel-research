## Where Will It End?

DOES any one suppose for a moment that because a set of fallible men are chosen by their fellows to represent their will in the management of a civil government, that therefore God really confers upon those civil power to be used to and in their discretion, as ministers of the divine will? If so, then it follows all the wickedness of civil rules is committed by God's authority. Who-ever do not know that many of the rulers of this world have been the most wicked men, and that they are sometimes perpetually corrupt and wrong upon self-indulgence, and they that themselves responsible for this, is to impose his character and discipline his name.

If it be said that civil government represent the authority of God only when they do right, that is virtually saying that rulers have just as much divine authority as a banking establishment when it does right. It certainly could mean no more. Let us therefore look at Romans 13 upon it.

"All moral beings, whether kings on thrones, or peasants in cottages, have a like warrant for doing right, in the passage of beings obliged thereby by the law of God. This warrant includes the civil ruler; but he has no special application that distinguishes him from others.

Justice rendered by the private citizen is just as righteous as similar justice rendered by the courts."

"To say that government, established by equity and perpetuating the rights to which they originated, the access to which and representation of the divine will in any other sense than that of existing in the providence of God, is to give his authoritative sanction upon the facts of history. The divine right of civil rulers would be a mere namysimus without proof of all it claims but when it was denied; and not when put the Alexanders, the Neros, the Caligulas, and all the bloody tyrants of history into the catalogue of civil rulers, then the doctrine is rendered impossible by the attributes and moral enormities of such incumbents."

Does any such attempt to Christianize civility because the teaching of Christ was, and is, to do unto others even as we would have them do unto us. This gives the fullest possible liberty of religious thought and action, unless, indeed, our Brethren and friends are pressed to admit that they will like to be compelled to acquiesce in some empire's religious observance which is utterly contrary to their own desires,— a conclusion whose self-contradiction is so evident that it needs no refutation.

Our national greatness arises not so much from our own favored position and from our natural resources as from the just and equal protection which our laws offer to all who come within our boundaries. Most the oppressed of all the earth have found a welcome, and the very name American has almost become a synonym for civil and religious freedom. But to send legislative aid in behalf of any religious institution, is not only a confession of weakness, but is also an attempt to coerce the religious conviction of men; since the all-comprehending definition of the liberty of individual opinion, and making more guardians that them as, at the best, making them one as though they believe something which they do not believe, which is nothing but, in fact, then making hypocrites out of them.

It may be said by way of objection to this reasoning, that we have no national religion but a civil one. But if we, may it be so much enthusiasm maintained by the Church over the question it may be asked that the prime movers are found chiefly among the militant and missionary of the great religious bodies of the land. Their zeal are restless ones which would easily come within the jurisdiction of civil law, so they as they are not to take care to those things if it is from motives of patriotism that they are working? The fact simply is that the representation of this of Sunday has movement not constituted active scholarship that will it has the inner character of the day that they desired to have the power as that of divinely constituted.

"Fruit of Days," says "the security of delivering the full Sabbath contrast and the issue of this Sabbath contest and the proper and legitimate inheritance of the successive nations to the well being of all the nations of the earth—and its interest also as relating to the well being of the State, and the relations that relate and settle so to its appreciation of the right alike of all under a common law, and the methods of the enforcement, and in the great interest of justice, does not stop will be enforced under endorsement of religious principles. And, of course, if the law vindicate us he lawfully compelled to attend church on Sunday, he should similarly be obliged to financially keep in good support the various church's establishment of it. Not only so, but it follows, as naturally as sunrise so night follows day, that the civil power shall have the right to decide which church each individual shall support, what constitution or which in each case, what particular form of belief or profession of faith shall be required of him. That is the civil power will be not a tool in the hands of the religious, but its master, an absolute arbiter, and the two will be completely united as they ever were in the palmiest days of the Roman hierarchy. By party of reasoning, the State will then have power to decree what shall and be believed, so that what is now simply a difference of religious opinion will then be heresy, and will be punishable as a crime under the laws of the State, the same as murder, felony, etc.

Let no one say the picture is overdrawn, for instead of being exaggerated, it is not fully filled out. Let the precedent once be established for the Church to dictate to the civil power, and the tyranny of religious persecution will just as surely throttle liberty of conscience as it did during the Dark Ages.

The book of religious liberty and freedom of thought is too precious a heritage to be squandered for a mess of political pottage. The advocates of the present movement in favor of Sunday legislation had better ponder deeply upon these questions. The measures contemplated by them will lead unto dangerous ground, and their inevitable end, if carried into effect will be to revive the bigotry, cruelty, and religious persecution of the past.

When the United States shall have precedent for law, enabling powers to such base ends, "Ichabod" may well be written over the portals of her legislative temples, for they will have departed. Let the people beware of the first step.
