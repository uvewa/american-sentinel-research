In 1890 the friends of the "poor laboring man" in New Jersey made an effort to prevent his being "compelled" to work on Sunday; and this is what the New Jersey Agriculturist for July of that year said of it:—

An attempt was made to prevent berry-picking on Sunday in certain districts of New Jersey, but fortunately failed. The loss of a single day means the loss of thousands of dollars in the berry business. If the Lord saw fit to ripen berries on Sunday it is a crime against common sense and the goodness of the Giver to allow the berries to perish. A work of necessity done on Sunday need not fear censure from sensible Christian people.

The Sentinel does not believe that berry-picking is a work of necessity in any such sense as that claimed by the Agriculturist; nevertheless the note shows that Sunday-keeping is not insisted upon in the interests of the tolling masses, but in the interests of those who regard Sunday as a sacred day.
