"McMASTER's History of the United States" says of the code under which the French and Spanish city of New Orleans was governed before the cession of Louisiana to the United States in 1863,—"Wretched indeed was the plight of the friendless offender, or even an accused person, who was brought before one of these perambulatory judges. If he had reviled the Saviour or the Blessed Virgin, his property was confiscated and his tongue cut out." Although such penalties would not now be imposed because of being "cruel and unusual," neither would the reviling of the "Blessed Virgin" be treated as a penal offense, yet the spirit of this very criminal procedure is still retained, only modified out of respect to public feeling and to correspond with Protestant instead of Catholic creed.
