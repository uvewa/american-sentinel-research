## Is It the Sabbath?

As THE SENTINEL has repeatedly stated, the most indubitable argument against the State has no right to decide religious questions, for to pass upon the truth or falsity of religious doctrines. It follows that the State has no right to examine the claims of Sunday, or of any other day, and decide that either that it is, or that it is not, the Sabbath. Inasmuch, however, as State recognition of Sunday as Sabbath necessitates its demanded on the ground that it is the Sabbath, and as that involves the law of God, and binding alike upon nations and individuals, the question, "Is it the Sabbath?" becomes a pertinent and interesting subject of personal inquiry, though, as before intimated, the merits of the examination can not affect in any way the right of the State to legislate upon the question. The State has none no such right.

Having made this proposition, we call to mind, for the reader's attention is invited to an examination of the claim that Sunday is the Sabbath.

That Sunday is by many regarded as the Sabbath, and that it is actually kept by some as such, does not affect the question. Is Sunday the Sabbath in a Bible sense, or by divine authority? This is the claim made by Sunday-law advocates. The claim that its observance shall be enforced by civil law. What then say the Scriptures of truth on this subject?

The first mention of the Sabbath in the Bible is in Genesis 2:1-3, where we learn that the seventh day God rested the work which he had made, and sanctified it, and as a day of rest from his work. This is the Sabbath day from all his work which he had made.

God blessed it because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made; and God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it; because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made. It is clear here that in is no command to keep the Sabbath, neither indeed is it called by that name; but we were told Gen. 2:3, it was sanctified, which means set apart for a holy use; and in Mark 2:27 we have the assurance of the Saviour that "the Sabbath was made for man." It seems reasonable, that at the very dawn of human history God gave man his holy day. But be that as it may, there is in Ex. 20:8-11 a positive command given: "Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy," and it is explicitly stated: "the seventh day is the Sabbath." "For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and he rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed it."

This identifies the Sabbath of the fourth commandment with the seventh day of creation week, not with a seventh day after six days of work, but with the seventh day, the memorial of the finished creation.

This is very frequently pointed out to the children of Israel before the giving of the law by the absence of manna upon it, and by the fact that that gathered upon the sixth day would keep over the Sabbath, while if kept over to any other day, what was left of it could not be kept in any other time. The record is thus briefly given in Ex. 16:23-30:

"And the Lord said unto Moses, and I will rain from heaven for you, and the people shall go out and gather a certain rate every day, and if you prove them, whatever with him, or six or one. And it shall come to pass, that on the sixth day they shall prepare that which they bring in, and it shall be twice as much as they bring; and they said so. And it shall come to pass, that on the sixth day and not what I was. And Moses said unto them, for the Lord has given you the Sabbath. This is the thing which the Lord hath commanded, Gather of it every man according to his eating, as cone for every man, according to the number of your persons; take every man for them which are in his tents. And the children of Israel did so, and some gathered more, and some less. "And Moses said, Let no man leave of it till the morning." And some heeded, but the children of Moses, but some of them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and stank; and Moses was wroth with them. And they gathered it every morning, every man according to his eating; and when the sun waxed hot, it melted.

And it came to pass, that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for one man; and all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses. And he said unto them, This is that which the Lord hath said, To-morrow is the rest of the holy Sabbath unto the Lord; bake that which ye will bake to-day, and seethe that ye will seethe; and that which remaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the morning. And they laid it up till the morning as Moses bade them; and it did not stink, neither was there any worm therein. And Moses said, Eat that to day; for to-day is a Sabbath unto the Lord: to-day ye shall not find it in the field. Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day, which is the Sabbath, in it there shall be none.

"So the people rested on the seventh day."

From Josh. 5:12 we know that the manna continued until they had entered the land of Canaan, forty years after they left Egypt. Thus fifty-two times every year for forty years, or a total of 7,800 times, was the identity of the seventh day, the Sabbath, pointed out to the children of Israel by the direct method of the manna keeping over the seventh day and none falling upon the seventh day. And this was not a man that the fourth commandment required be kept as of God to be kept, assuredly, it is a good question; and that day of rest was kept at the time of the crucifixion, not only by the Jews, but by the followers of Christ also, is expressly stated in Luke 23:56, and it was these women or of certain women that "they returned and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the Sabbath day according to the commandment." Now up to the end of the week, or very early in the morning, they came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared.

From the text just quoted we learn two things; first, that at the time of the crucifixion of our Lord, the fourth commandment pointed to the observance of the Sabbath; for the women kept it "according to the commandment;" and second, that that day was the day just preceding the first day of the week, which must necessarily have been the seventh day of the week. Furthermore, it is very evident that the fourth commandment requires, not the observance of a seventh day, but of a very particular day after six days of labor; the seventh day of the week.

This is the week as created and well recognized through all history, as having its divisions of time, and that consequently the seventh day of the week is likewise a well defined period of time, is attested to all history. "Since early historical times the week as well as the other three days are so well attested, and not other than the four divisions of the month are recognized as having with it to any degree of weekly. Moreover, the week in all ages runs on manipulable witnesses in all parts of the Monroe account, and it entails an impassable monument to the original Sabbath, the seventh day of the week.

Aside from the Bible, the strongest evidence, also, as to the origin of the week is its universality. Some have thought that it might have been suggested by the four changes of the moon, but it is sufficiently disproved by the theory that the moon does not change once in seven days and it even its days varying from each other considerably as may be. There is nothing extrinsingly in with the week itself beyond its coincidence with the period of creation, nothing in nature to suggest an septenary cycle, and it is practically beyond dispute, as the *Encyclopaedia Britannica*, article "Calendar" states.

As the week forms neither an aliquot part nor a major part of the lunar month, its use, it will be noticed will not be a loss in civil or religious life in the Roman Empire, without a trace of beginning or possibility.

As the Saturday article, article, "Babylon," says:

The week of seven days to use from an indefinite antiquity, and is found to have been used in the time of the earliest monuments.

This fact constitutes the week as not an invention of any nation, its regular use among all the nations and languages of the world, and its history proves it to be from the basis of the Creator, whose purpose it has forever to eventually succeed in differentiating.

But, if it is within the province of this article to investigate the matter in all its details, it is also its privilege to speedily state: it shall be kept, and as the great complaint against Sunday violation, both present, seems to be an account of religious worship, as from the church itself, we will proceed from thence, not only a judicial creation that can be shown is, that in the original Sabbath nor is more a second, not embittered in such a mass of evident error, commending by judicial legislation, feeling to grant so as to justify prejudice being the foundation of false law.

"Fruit of Days," says "the security of delivering the full Sabbath contrast and the issue of this Sabbath contest and the proper and legitimate inheritance of the successive nations to the well being of all the nations of the earth—and its interest also as relating to the well being of the State, and the relations that relate and settle so to its appreciation of the right alike of all under a common law, and the methods of the enforcement, and in the great interest of justice, does not stop will be enforced under endorsement of religious principles. And, of course, if the law vindicate us he lawfully compelled to attend church on Sunday, he should similarly be obliged to financially keep in good support the various church's establishment of it. Not only so, but it follows, as naturally as sunrise so night follows day, that the civil power shall have the right to decide which church each individual shall support, what constitution or which in each case, what particular form of belief or profession of faith shall be required of him. That is the civil power will be not a tool in the hands of the religious, but its master, an absolute arbiter, and the two will be completely united as they ever were in the palmiest days of the Roman hierarchy. By party of reasoning, the State will then have power to decree what shall and be believed, so that what is now simply a difference of religious opinion will then be heresy, and will be punishable as a
