## Editorial Notes.

WHY not write letters to Hon. John Wannamaker, P. O. Department, Washington, D. C., requesting that stamps be prepared and put on sale especially for Sunday use? They could do the school will do as much to give letter writers of those to express their convictions as the Belgian stamps to others.

Certainly; why let not those who want their letters delayed over Sunday have it so? The trouble however would be met by especially of those who are constrained by a desire to dictate to others what they shall and shall not do in that day. National Reform is not like charity; it does not begin at home; it seeks to reform the other man.

In Switzerland, as well as in Belgium, "Sunday postage stamps" are advertised for sale, that thus, by that use, the authorities whose authority an expression of opinion of the sentiment of the people in reference to Sunday mails. It is commend upon this the Netherlandian Christian Advocate.

---

It seems that the Government has not the courage to take its own stand on this subject. Why. Oh, for some manly courage.

By this the Netherlandian means, it is plain did not the State Government act desperately upon this question and do away with Sunday mails without consulting the wisdom of the people in any manner. It would seem that in the eyes of that paper's a religious deposition is the only proper thing in a Republican Government.

ATTENTION has been called recently, perhaps more emphatically than ever before, to some of the defects in the United States postal laws, by the exclusive of the *Printers' Journal,* published in this city, from the privileges of second-class mail matter. That the decision is unjust and arbitrary in the case, is abundantly shown by the evidence; minded; and that the law should be repealed or amended, is the opinion not only it, in the hands of a single man, from whose decision is persona no appeal, is equally clear. On what principle the Post-Office Department holds that *Printers' Jol* is a third-class matter while it admits *Bab. Wees* as second-class, is hard to understand, unless indeed it is that the publisher of the latter publication in the *Printer's Journal,* has been more industrious to spare more time from political wire-pulling, or caters to, from his bootleg, or school, so to set that his subscribers deal a little more justly with the people.

---

Certain clergymen of Buffalo have required the Superintendents of the public schools, of that city, to furnish for publication in the daily press the names, together with the religious belief, of all of the teachers employed. The request was doubtless due to the charge that a number of Catholic teachers had been appointed by the superintendent. The superintendent's reply is respectful, as it should be, but it contains nevertheless a well-merited rebuke. He reminds the preachers that the laws and regulations governing the public schools of Buffalo do not require him to examine into the religious creeds of those who are employed, and further that for him to have attempted such an examination would have been impertinent and un-American.

---

COMMENTING upon these facts, the Washington *Post* well says that "the school teachers of Buffalo are employed for the same reason that school teachers are employed in other cities, and for this reason, Superintendent Crooker's reply will interest the whole country. If any teacher is incompetent, he or she, as the case may be, should be promptly removed. But it is the province of the community to be to demand that he will be expected to those who hold a certificate to contribute to the support of this. This is an old question; the people are opposed to sectarianism in the schools, and the inspiring ministers of Buffalo have simply fanned the flame."

---

SIXTY-NINE professors of the University of Berlin, including twelve of the theological faculty, have, it is stated, petitioned the Prussian Diet not to pass the Primary Education Bill, on the ground that the bill restricts the right of the State. It should be opposed on the ground that it restricts the right of the individual.

---

THE Catholic Review claims that the Roman Catholic population of the United States is at least 10,000,000. Of these, 8,000,000 are "good Catholics," and the remainder, persons who believe the doctrines of the Catholic Church but have neglected confession and communion; the Review calls them "bad" or "indifferent" Catholics.

A Warsaw paper says that "at a recent special meeting of the Burlington, Iowa, branch of the Sunday Observance Union, resolutions were adopted strongly urging all persons interested in the prosecution of a baseball club that dares to play ball on Sunday, from coming, to insist that no game be played on Sundays, and pledging the Union to the enforcement of the Sunday observance law."

---

THE World correspondent upon itself by the Sunday law of the State of New York saying:—

It is time for the Legislature to sweep away this relic of Puritanical Intolerance. Its existence is not only a violation of the principles of our American form of government, and has been practically be beneficial. It is a direct borne out by experience.

Certainly, all religious laws in this State's statutes are not only impossible to enforce, but they are in themselves evil and only evil, they breed in reproach; and if this "Nation" were only sufficiently "Christian" to "understand the Bible and respect its teachings, they would be repealed before the present session of the Legislature expires."

---

THERE are, it is one in Belgium special postage stamps for those who do in wish their mail handled on Sunday. The objects of the Government is to ascertain what proportion of the people of that country are practically opposed to Sunday mails. Remarking upon the fact an accurate National Reform organ, published in this city, says:—

Why not agitate for such stamps in this country?

---

IN 1889 its friends of the "poor man's legislation or" in New Jersey made an effort to prevent his being "compelled" to work on Sunday. So what is this? was the New Jersey agriculturist for July of that year said:

An attempt was made to prevent berry-picking on Sunday. Berry-picking is a form of labor one which no right against persons coming upon some field or garden to collect the ripened fruit, and making it a crime punishable against the offenders. But the most despicable of these Sunday legislation schemes possible.

---

THE SENTINEL does not believe that beer-picking is a week of labor and a half within the calendar of the year. How is it, that the calendar, which involves its own agricultural; nevertheless the store the shows Sunday keeping let us hint continued further yet, in the interests of the baking business, but in the interests of those who object.
