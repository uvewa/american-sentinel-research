## Some More Tennessee.

THIS sin of blasphemy and profanity is one in which those who have so undertaken the defense of the faith by the sword of the civil law have ever raised with some pretension. The code of Tennessee has proceeded to place profanity within the jurisdiction of the courts of that State and has left the discrimination as to what is profanity with the courts. The Tennessee code of 1858 has three sections:

SEC. Any person who shall profanely swear or curse the hearing of any justice of the peace, not being a justice, shall forfeit and pay fifty cents for every such oath.

SEC. Any person assaulting any public office who shall, by being in their presence, profane, or swear, shall forfeit one dollar for each oath or curse.

SEC. Any person who shall profanely swear in the presence of any court of record, shall pay a fine at the discretion of the court, and be imprisoned not exceeding twenty four hours.

This internal evidence contained in the opinions of the judges given in some of the cases reported will be sufficient to detect the animus of this law, and prove whether it be civil or religious in character. Profanity was first held to be indictable, in Tennessee, by Judge Caruthers in the case of State vs. Graham at the September term of Court held at Knoxville, in 1853, 3 Sneed 134. In this case the judge adopted the inherited principle of North Carolina cases, and in support of his course referred to the Carolina law of 1741, as usurped by Governor Gabriel Johnston, under a Church and State rule, in which a graduated series of fines was established for the punishment of the offense, according to the condition of the offender and the place in which the profane speech was spoken. This settles how grave courts are misadvised, from their similar form, patterned after the English law of 1711, with the provision that the Tennessee law carries the penalty of three hours in the stocks which Governor Claiborne added to the act, in addition to the fine. This act of 1712, as it has been perversely seen, is, without possibility of denial, a religious law in form and intent. It makes no pretense of being anything else. Yet from it this statute is copied; and to it Judge Caruthers refers as authority. The Judge knew that the derivation of this law led farther and closer to church English statute of 1 Edw. c. 21, which is constructed in precisely similar lines, of a graduated series of fines for persons of different ranks, viz., in different situations—as in the provincial Carolinian code. His authority, the statute Tennessee blasphemy law—is found in the "Blackstone's Commentaries," from the chapter on "Offenses Against God and Religion." This law here led to the source found is to be religious there, and through all its legal wanderings its whole course. But Judge Caruthers saw that these authorities would only uphold the punishment of single offenders for the mere justice of the peace, therefore he practically inferred that such an offense could be cited as authority the Carolina precedent wherein the original statute or the preamble of the English law were incorporated as their own arguments by the Tennessee courts, and the judges legislated by a system. This is evidently profitable to the church which is liable to indictment and that the charge: "Did it in the public street curse and swear and take the name of God in vain," was good, and toiled in the court might be justled as a common nuisance.

Having quoted from the Church and State laws of the English province of Carolina, and the laws of England itself, of a professedly religious purpose, with the intent to make his position still stronger, this precedent has gone to the American statute book.

second commandment, and the general injunctions and precepts of religion, it operates as contempt for holy things;— therefore he follows the Carolina preceding Judge, concludes as he so expressed it: "it is difficult to conceive how profane cursing and swearing in public could fail what of that the law denominates a nuisance."

In holding that Judge seems entirely unconscious of the fact that he is ignoring the explicit wording of the statute of the State, as well as that of the different laws of the several States, and that the expressed language of the statute, in its one section, "shall forfeit and pay fifty cents for every oath," and in another section, "shall forfeit one dollar for each oath or curse," showing that it was the clear design of the statute to provide for a repetition of oaths by affixing a penalty equal to each and every profane expression, and that it was not to establish a new precedent to which the Carolina judge not only went beyond the limit of the jurisdiction, but directly contrary to the established language of the statute of his State.

The first reported case of this character came before the March term of court, 1871, having been appealed from an arrest of judgment in the October Court in 1869. The presentment charges the defendant with uttering "profane and blasphemous language to the scandal and annoyance and scandal and nuisance of all good citizens." The propriety of the cause was well considered by Judge Nelson, and after maturely taking the law, he decided the question in two concise sentences, thus:—

An offence to be indictable, must be in violation of some statute—or at least, be recognized by the courts as indictable. The enunciation of oaths is nowhere in our statute, or in any decision known to us, declared indictable.

This would put an end to the mischief of such an assumption; but, for some reason, the defendant is believed to have withdrawn, or the State to have declined, and the case remained under the code.

This was only two or three years before Tennessee's statute was, by the efforts of some religious zealots, amended, and became a dead letter in human practice. A North Carolina judge in 1869 decides that as the act of uttering a single expression of profane swearing is a fineable offense under the law of Carolina, he therefore does not see why its repetition should change its character from a misdemeanor,—therefore it is a nuisance and is indictable—and, forty-four years after, Judge Caruthers, by decision of the Supreme Court of Tennessee, puts in the local and settled law of that State, the same double error, of attempting to mate a judicial pronouncement with a law in which is solely an offense against God and his law, and selecting the expression of the law, from a petty offense under the jurisdiction of a justice, to an indictable referred to a higher court. The erroneous precedent is established, and as appears from the next case reported it is followed thereafter, without question or comment; and the only reason that the judge thinks necessary to give in support of such a course is the citation of the single precedent.

It is noticeable that the two cases thus far cited have served to give the highest judicial authority in the State to the statutes of the Carolina law against blasphemy and profanity into the Tennessee law, and to extrude its extension into an indictable offense when repetition might give color to the claim that the language was a nuisance. These two cases, that of State vs. Graham, 3 Sneed 134, decided by Judge Caruthers, and that of State vs. Brooks, 4 Heiskell 130, decided by Judge Nelson, have gone far and no farther.

In the September term, 1877, comes the case of State vs. Graham, 7 Lea 107, in which Judge Cooper, after having quoted these two cases, confines himself:

And it was said by the eminent judge who delivered the opinion in the case of State vs. Graham that an indicted act of profanity was only a misdemeanor that by the general law of Tennessee, code, section 1718, which imposes a small penalty for each oath, was recoverable before a justice of the peace. If it is possible, however, for a repetition of oaths on a single occasion, or at different occasions, to so find its way to the bench of a higher court, he held it to be a nuisance.

In the case then under his consideration the Judge held that the profanity was only fineable, not indictable, because the profanity was not in public, and although two *nolles* were proved against him it was only on the testimony of two unwilling witnesses, yet it is well worthy of note that in the italicised sentence Judge Cooper has given sanction to an enlargement of the sphere of possible indictments in those cases not before contemplated.

In the very next reported case, State vs. Young, 7 Lea, 444, counsel for State has taken advantage of this extension of its definition to confuse the special point of profanity, which he himself suggested, to that of blasphemy, and has referred to a decision as authority, to fix that doctrine as a precedent to be followed in succeeding cases. The matter was brought before the Supreme Court on an appeal on error from the Circuit Court of Wilson County. In the Circuit Court it was moved to quash the indictment on the grounds that but one offense was charged, and that an offense only punishable by fine, and not to be prosecuted upon before a justice of the peace. The Court overruled the motion and Young was convicted. He took this appeal on error from that judgment.

In delivering his opinion Judge Cooper said and held:—

A single act of profanity would not ordinarily, be sufficient to convict as indictable. But, an indictment, even a single oath, either by its form, or the circumstances of the utterance—the occasion in which it was uttered, might be a nuisance. Graham vs. State, 1 Lea 119. Whether it can or can not would be a question for the jury under a proper charge. The question, however, upon the second ground of the motion, brings before us the question directly, whether the oath was repeated enough—we will not say often enough—to make it a nuisance—by means of which the single oath would have become a nuisance

But it would be difficult to embody in an indictment the form and manner of utterance, or the act of circumstances which would so, or make the single oath a nuisance.

Now in this case, the profanity was remarkably guarded, that his severity of the provincial law in the case of profanity and blasphemy, been increased for severity by a justice of the peace to be indictable by jury and charged, and for the higher court. For this there is authority at least in judicial legislation entirely. It is also in judicial legislation entirely so. It is judicial in form whether it is legal. Under it the first assertion of a wreck of profanity is liable to indictment of those who by law will be subject to a heavy fine. This, in its effect to any event, will act a greater publicity given to the case and consequently wider dispersal; and this notwithstanding that the statute takes the contrary direction. The purpose the provision for them a stated penalty for each oath, so that the law might be applied to the applications of the statute was in a judicial entirety, and without shadow of evidence, to be found in the language of the statute itself or its evident intent.

This—*This* is plainly given by the noble and almost imperceptible influences of the assumption that this is a "Christian Country." That continuously crops up, and in the religious, not civil, aspect is the source found to be religious there, and through all its legal wanderings, its whole course.

If the reign of precedent is allowed to pass, and if there is no one to call attention to the fact, in the past, that this will force it into the basis of the assumption of living entirely under religious rule, without any of the safeguards of a republican form of government.
