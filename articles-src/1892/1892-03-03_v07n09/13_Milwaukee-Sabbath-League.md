AN association, to be known as the "Milwaukee Sabbath League," has been lately established in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. In the resolutions adopted at its organization the aid of all citizens is invoked to secure the enforcement of Sunday laws, and it is "demanded" that the Wisconsin exhibit at the World's Fair be closed on Sunday.
