A Western paper says that "at a recent special meeting of the Burlington, Iowa, branch of the Sunday Observance Union, resolutions were adopted strongly urging all persons interested in the proposed organization of a baseball club in Burlington, for the coming season, to insure that no games be played on Sunday, and pledging the Union to the enforcement of the Sunday observance law."
