"ETERNAL vigilance is the price of liberty;" power is ever stealing from the many to the few. The manna of popular liberty must be gathered each day or it is rotten. . . . Only by unintermitted agitation can a people be kept sufficiently awake to principle not to let liberty be smothered in material prosperity.—Wendell Phillips.

Toleration denotes neither the freedom of religion from State control, nor the equality of all religions before the law. On the contrary, it implies either a preference by the State for some one form of faith or worship, though other forms are permitted; or the right of the State to regulate the administration of ecclesiastical affairs by the civil law. In the etymological sense, toleration is the permitting of that which is not fully approved. In the ecclesiastical sense, it means definitely the allowance of religious opinions, and modes of worship, in a State when contrary to or different from those of the established church or belief. Toleration is a concession, in part, of that control over religion which the State assumes to exercise, but which it so far permits to fall into abeyance.

This is not the condition of things in the ideal American State. The religious liberty, guaranteed by the ideal American State, is absolute freedom of religious opinion and worship, a vested right of conscience, not derived through any grant of the civil power. All that the ideal American State can do is to protect her citizens in the enjoyment of these vested rights. Liberty of opinion, liberty of worship, liberty in all matters pertaining to religion, is not a privilege created, or conceded, by the State, but is a right inherent in the personality of the individual conscience; and the ideal American State is pledged not only not to interfere with that right, but to protect it.—Rev. T. De Witt Peake, Methodist.
