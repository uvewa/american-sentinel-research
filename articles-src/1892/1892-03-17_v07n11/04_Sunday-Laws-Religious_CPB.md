IN an article in Our Day for January, 1891, Rev. W. F. Crafts said:

It is significant that the American Secular Union, instead of condemning all Sabbath laws, asks only for the "repeal and prevention of all laws enforcing the observance of Sunday as a religious institution, other than an economic one justified by physiological and other secular reasons." As there are no Sunday laws that enforce its religious observance, this "plank" "nailed on the fog," is waste timber.

The words, "There are no Sunday laws that enforce its religious observance," which we have italicised, are not in form a denial that there are "laws enforcing Sunday as a religious institution;" but we will not charge Mr. Crafts with making a show of denying a thing, while designedly not doing so. Though not saying it in so many words, he must be understood from the connection as intending to deny that there are in this country "laws enforcing the observance of Sunday as a religious institution." A denial, however, is one thing; and the proof, quite another. And in this case, the proof in support of Mr. Crafts' denial is not only not forthcoming, but the facts prove exactly the contrary.

To enforce "the observance of Sunday as a religious institution," can mean neither more nor less than enforcing the observance of it because it is a religious institution; and further, that the observance required must in some degree be in keeping with the supposed character of the day. That all this is true of the Sunday laws now upon the statute books of the several States is the object of this article to show.

That the Sunday laws of the older States are derived largely from English statutes, will not be denied; and that the newer States have modeled their Sunday laws after the Sunday laws of the older States is equally true. It follows, that to learn the real character of Sunday legislation, we must go to the source whence it is derived. We have at hand, however, only a single English case (Bloxsome vs. Williams, 5 D. & R. 82), decided in 1824, in which the judge said: "The object of the statute is to prevent persons keeping open shop and disregarding the decency of the Lord's Day." In New York in 1811, Judge Kent said of the requirement to keep Sunday, that "the statute has for over a century recognized the sanctity of the obligation, and punished its violators." In 1834, another New York judge (Boynton vs. Page, 12 Wend. N. Y. 57), referred to "the public order and solemnity of the day." In 1859, we are assured (Campbell vs. International Soc., 4 Bos. N. Y. 298) that the statute of New York "explicitly recognizes the first day of the week as holy time; and thus it has brought us back to the full, enlarged and absolute rule of interdiction which we find prevailed in the earliest laws of Christian States." Even as recently as 1882 (12 Abb. N. C. 455 N. Y.) we find this significant question: "Is it not obvious that by reason of keeping a store open for business, a temptation is presented to those who have no regard for Sunday, as holy time, to violate the law?"

The Pennsylvania Reports furnish numerous similar cases; for instance, we find (Jean-delle's case, 3 Phil. 509) a judge declaring that "the day is clothed with peculiar sanctity;" while another jurist in the same State (Eyre's case, 1 S. & R. 347) declares that "Sabbath-breaking is a violation of a divine as well as a human law." In still another case (Johnston's, 22 Pa. 102) the judge said: "The learned counsel for the plaintiff has entered largely into the question of the origin and sanction of the Christian Sabbath. It may not be essential, but it is far from being irrelevant, to the decision of the present case, to sustain the *divine authority* of its institution." "It is set apart by *divine command* and human legislation as a day of rest." "We have no right to give up this institution. It has come down to us with the most *solemn sanctions*, both of *God* and man, and if we do not appreciate it, we are at least bound to preserve it."

Concerning two Kentucky statutes it is observed (Moore *vs.* Hagan, 2 Duv. 437) that "one applied exclusively to Sunday as sacred, and the other to holidays as secular;" while in the same case the object of the Sunday law is declared to be "to aid in securing it [Sunday] against desecration."

In Iowa, one of the newer States, it has been held (Davis *vs.* Fish, 1 Green 40) that Sunday is "sacred, set apart for rest." In North Carolina it is declared (Ricketts' case, 74 N. C. 184) that "all religious and moral codes permit works of necessity and mercy on their sacred days;" and in Georgia, it is held (Weldon's case, 62 Ga. 449) that in that State, "as in England, Sunday is a holy day. The code denominates it the Lord's day, and as the Lord's day all courts and magistrates are to consider it." This list might be greatly extended, but it is not necessary; the proposition under discussion is that "we have no laws enforcing the observance of Sunday as a religious institution." The supreme courts of several of the States themselves being the judges, we have such laws.

But one question remains to be settled, namely, have we laws which require an observance of Sunday in keeping with the supposed sacred character of the day? Again let the courts answer. In Georgia it has been held (44 Ga. 204) that the power to legislate in regard to Sunday "is a very high prerogative, and is supported by the principle involved in the preservation of morals and duties of the citizens upon the Lord's day;" while in Ohio it is said (Wright, Ohio 754) in the case of a deed executed upon Sunday, that "both parties partook of the sin of violating the Sabbath."

Ringgold, author of "Legal Aspects of the First Day of the Week," cites a comparatively recent English case in which it was said "the statute, in express terms, provides that every person shall apply himself to the observation of the Lord's day publicly and privately; so that private, as well as public conduct, was expressly within its contemplation." Upon this, Mr. Ringgold remarks that "there is no lack of American authorities which recognize the legal consistency of the English view, and adopt the same reasoning. In support of this he cites cases in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New Hampshire, and New York. In Massachusetts it has been held that "all arguments drawn from the Jewish law respecting the Sabbath are out of place, except so far as any provisions of that law may have been recognized and promulgated by our Saviour, or by legislative authority of our own commonwealth." "We are," says the Court, "far from questioning the religious obligation which all Christians are under to separate to religious uses the first day of the week, since the legislative power has exacted the observance of it as such." In Pennsylvania (Waf's case, 3 S. & R. 48), it is declared that "it is of the utmost importance that they [the people] be reminded of their religious duties at stated intervals;" and in Tennessee we have this opinion (2 Yerg. 31): "It is correct, as advanced by the defendant's counsel, that no worldly labor or business ought to be carried on on the Sabbath day. It is, at least, unseemly, subversive of good morals, and as it appears to me, not in union with the principles of our holy religion." And again; "The object of the law . . . was to prevent the desecration of the day, which by our law is dedicated to the duties of religion." 1 Swan 413.

Have we indeed no laws enforcing the observance of Sunday as a religious institution? What answer must honest men give to the question?
