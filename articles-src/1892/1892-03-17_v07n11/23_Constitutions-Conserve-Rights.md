CONSTITUTIONS are usually the fruit of agitation, and are framed by men jealous for their rights. They are designed to be the conservators of the inalienable rights of the individual citizen; the citadel of defense alike against the usurpations of one, of the few, or of the many. Constitutions are supposed to be, and should be stable; the will of the majority is fickle, and liable to sudden and unreasonable changes; hence, Constitutions are just as essential in popular governments like our own as in any other.

AND not only are Constitutions necessary, but the people must be constantly reminded of their rights as individuals. As Wendell Phillips has so aptly said: "Some men suppose that in order to the people's governing themselves, it is only necessary that the rights of men be printed, and that every citizen have a copy; as the Epicureans two thousand years ago imagined God a being who arranged this marvelous machinery, set it going, and then sunk to sleep. Republics exist only by being constantly agitated. . . . Never to our latest posterity, can we do without prophets . . . to trouble the waters, that there may be health in their flow." Mr. Eaton's article proves the truth of these words, for it demonstrates the present need of such prophets.
