ABOUT one hundred and fifty informations have been lodged against newsdealers and others in Pittsburg, for violation of the Sunday law, up to the present time; and in nearly every case a fine of twenty-five dollars has been imposed, with costs added. These cases have all been appealed, and March 11 fixed for their final hearing.
