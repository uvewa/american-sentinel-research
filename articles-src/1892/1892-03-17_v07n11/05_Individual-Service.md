THERE are many who seem to think that the keeping of the Sabbath is not an individual service, but a community one. They seem to think a man is unable to meet the requirement of the fourth commandment of God's law unless his right to engage in the performance of certain secular duties is denied him by the civil power, thus restraining from all unnecessary work on that day. The great plea made by the friends of Sunday laws is that all men who desire to keep that day holy are hindered from so doing by the unnecessary work done by those who do not regard it as holy time.

But this claim is not true in the least degree; because if it were true, God would not in just, in his requirements, command a man to keep the Sabbath day. He commanded the Sabbath to be kept, "Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy," means much more than merely abstaining from secular employment on that day. The creation of labor is only the outward sign of an inward regard for the holy ordinance of the Sabbath day.

Now if it be true that one man can not keep the Sabbath because of a neighbor, nor can the man himself who is engaged in secular enterprise keep it in his heart, but not in his works, the work that is done by the man next door neither disturbs him nor hinders him from keeping the Sabbath.

All the Scriptures show that the history of this dispensation world will end in great carnage. The kingdoms of this world are the enemies the Father placed at the foot of the Son. See again Ps. 2:7-9; 110:1; Heb. 1:13; 10:12, 13. When the kingdoms are given to Christ the nations are angry, and the wrath of God is upon them to take them out and to bring upon them from labor on that day. If God takes a good thing and makes it a commandment, then if God does as he does, his neighbor is in need of nothing; and if God would guarantee work on that day, the Almighty would be doing it by personal supervision and not by compounding. But there is one thing certain, it is that this is beyond the control of man. He can close his shop, he can refuse to buy or sell. 2 Cor. 6:1, 182.

The liberty of rest for such demands makes the Sabbath the property of God. What has wrought the change? If in those days it was "hallowing" and festal "the seventh day" without a law compelling others to observe it in absence he is keeping Sunday without a "law of rest for man."

This greatest government can win is, that its citizens know their rights and dare maintain them.—*Wendell Phillips.*

It is not sufficiently emphasized that the Jew is left absolutely free to observe the seventh day. He can close his shop, he can refuse to buy or sell. 2 Cor. 6:1, 182.

The liberty of rest for such demands makes the Sabbath the property of God. What has wrought the change? If in those days it was "hallowing" and festal "the seventh day" without a law compelling others to observe it, the man who rests that day is keeping to his conscience.

There is only one way in which a man can disturb his neighbor's conscience by working on the day his neighbor observes as the Sabbath. He can not disturb his conscience in the least if that conscience is first right between himself and his God. If it is not right, he can be very easily disturbed by the course of some one whose conscience is "void of offense toward God and men."

To illustrate. Railroads and steamboats have run, and factories have been operated all over this country on Sunday, and they have been comparatively unmolested in their disregard of the day. But who has been prosecuted for Sunday work? A typical case is that of a quiet farmer in the State of Tennessee, who was arrested for working in his back fields, where he was out of sight or hearing of any religious gathering; and where he could disturb no one by his work. What was there about this man that he should be prosecuted for quietly working where he could disturb no one, while in all the immediate vicinity of busy hands were running railroads, steamboats, telegraph lines, and following almost every vocation under the sun? —Because this man had conscientiously rested on another day, and had performed his duty to his Maker, and felt in his heart not the slightest need of another day as a sacred day. This case and a few others like it show where the efforts of those who favor Sunday legislation are tending.

It is not so much those who work on Sunday who offend, as it is those who deny the sacredness of the day by resting on some other day, which is sacred to them, and which answers the demands of the conscience. In the Selma, without faults, man and woman were condemned, not for being without and without bail for defraying the quality of witchcraft, and if a man confessed himself a wizard or a woman confessed herself a witch, it was extraordinary to release them from the death to which they had been condemned. "No parallel between the insane fanaticism of that time and the movement in our day which seeks to put a popular belief in the fundamental law of the land on an understanding of the people," says legal authority, seems a very appropriate consideration. Persecution has never been directed so much against those who denied God, as against those who departed from the popular mode of worshiping.
