DR. BONAR has well said that "a false zeal in religion is always, in some respect or other, misdirected zeal, or a zeal not according to knowledge—a zeal seeking some false end, or, while proposing to itself a good end, seeking its promotion in some unauthorized way." This describes National Reform exactly. "Jehu," continues the same writer, "had a zeal, which he called zeal for the Lord of Hosts. His fault was, not that he was too zealous, but that his zeal was really directed to his own advancement. The Jews, in the days of Christ, had a zeal for God, but it was so misdirected as to fire them with a frenzy to destroy the Son of God and extinguish the Light of the world. There are countless forms of false zeal now at work; but in all cases they sin not by excess, but by misdirection. Some are planning with zeal to spread some of the corruptions of Christianity, and to carry men away from its great and cardinal truths."

These words were not written of National Reform, but they are just as applicable as though they had been penned with special reference to it.
