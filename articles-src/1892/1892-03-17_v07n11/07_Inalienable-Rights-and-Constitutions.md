The *Catholic Review* says: "There is but one spot on the face of the earth where a man can hold up his head and say, 'I am allowed by practice to believe I think is the right one.'" Let us pray that this great religious liberty "will last forever." And what would its effect be to pray that Roman supremacy can dominate here.

At first it seems a strange thing that people reared in a land of comparative freedom should have to put an appreciation of religious liberty; and yet such is practically the case. The principle is illustrated by the fact. The people gradually only those who labor properly appreciate the freedoms. The most frightfully founded by the father, by whom tolerance and all it was accumulated, is frequently squandered by the sons, reared in ease and accustomed to wealth. It is indeed true, as Wendell Phillips has said: "The masses of the people of each liberty he gathered each day of it its very existence."

Their lack of any proper sense of the meaning or value of the sacred rights of the individual, is well illustrated by the stated articles in the *Boston Traveller,* by Mr. Eaton, Esq., of Memphis, Tennessee. In the stated in the article Mr. Eaton says—

"Our national idea of the land embodied in page 3, United States Constitution is that established church, or ecclesiastical or religious organizations, or, the supreme law other that be the Supreme Court of the United States, being the palaces; and the people—public sentiment—public opinion being the real source of political power."

This paragraph expresses a great truth, and a fatal one. The truth is that "the Constitution is the supreme law of the land;" the fallacy, that the will of the people, aside from the Constitution, is supreme; or that it ought to be supreme. That which should be supreme in civil government, and that which political constitutions should guarantee, is inalienable human rights. But that Mr. Eaton does not at all appreciate these facts is evident from those propositions which he lays down in the course of his articles.

The people, and the State, are sovereign in all things whatever; as between persons of equal rights.

But the people have of right no such powers as those claimed for them by Mr. Eaton. Nothing whatever can justify the majority in meddling with the inalienable rights of the individual. As John Stuart Mill never wrote a truer thing than when he said—

The people need it legitimate. The best government has no more title to it than the worst. It is as noxious, or more noxious, when exerted in accord with public opinion, than when in opposition to it.

The idea that whatever the majority desire is right is no more true now than it was when the majority demanded the crucifixion of Christ, or when the majority justly demanded the hanging of witches in Massachusetts, or when, as in our own day, the commune of a Russian village ordered the selling of innocent men and women to Siberia. It is possible for majority rule to be just as tyrannical and just as wicked as the rule of a single man.

The Declaration of Independence sets forth this: "That all men are created equal, that they are by their Creator endowed with certain inalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these rights governments are instituted among men." The difference between this declaration and the propositions laid down by Mr. Eaton, is as great as the difference between night and day.

Governments are not instituted to determine, "to decide where my rights end and yours begin, Freddy." My rights begin where yours begin, and end only where they begin. Except in so far as the law, in the large, can of right make it otherwise. Governments are instituted, not to create, but to defend rights; to guarantee to the individual the unhampered exercise of his rights; and when "public sentiment" forbids this, the will of the people becomes a tyrannical will in the Government. And it is for this very reason that Constitutions are made—to restrain and hold in check the majority from trampling upon the rights of the minority, no less than to protect the majority against the usurpations of the few, or of one.

Governments are usually the fruit of agitation, and are framed by men jealous for their rights. They are designed to be the conservators of the inalienable rights of the individual citizen, the citadels of defense alike against the usurpations of one, of the few, or of the many. Constitutions are supposed to be, and should be stable; the will of the majority is fickle, and liable to sudden and unreasonable changes; hence, Constitutions are just as essential to popular government as for one as in any other.

As not only are Constitutions necessary, but the people must be continually reminded of their rights as individuals. As Wendell Phillips said, "Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty." The people, in order to govern themselves, suppose that in order to properly give that to their rights, it is only necessary that the rights of men not be ignored, and that every citizen have a copy; as the Express was two thousand years ago imagined God a being who arranged this marvelous but seemingly contradictory world, and then fell asleep. Republics exist only by being constantly applied.——Never to cut polished ivory, cast me no divided mirrors.—to trouble the waters, that may be well in health in their River. Mr. Eaton's articles prove the truth of these words; or, to demonstrate the pressing need of such prophets.

How a denomination comes to direct its representation in a State Legislature is not easy to say. Even in Manitoba the manner of the members of the Legislature are supposed to be so close to represent the citizens of the districts in which they severally reside. They are not put there to represent the trust and represent not to the trust but certain religious organizations among the people.

Suppose that most or all of these people, to establish a great truth in that it is trust of membership of that communion. But if "many" of the members of the Legislature of Manitoba simply are in favor of reform, they should at once sweep from the statute book of all legislation against any and all laws that present disfigure it. Christian men and women of former ought to be fair. However, if the statement is correct that "most, if not all, represent their districts," but their churches should aim nothing in the lack of real reform, not be expected of them.

The question of closing the World's Fair on Sunday has been brought before Congress by Religious Legislation. This is the account given by a New York paper:

Senator Hiscock's resolution to ask Congress to request the management that the World's Fair be closed on Sunday, came up in the Senate and caused an extended debate. Senator Quay desired the resolution to go over, but Senator Hiscock insisted upon its being voted on at once, and carried, saying that this country could properly observe and maintain the Sabbath.
