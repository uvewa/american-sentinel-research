IT has been seen that in extending the field of judicial interference with the relation by Sunday labor and profanity, and in importing into the practice of the courts the principle of the exclusion of witnesses for lack of religious belief, the progress of judicial legislation on religious questions in Tennessee has been quite rapid, and apparently without a compellent whatever to its advancement. On the subject of Sunday contracts, however, the courts have hesitated, unwillingly, yet compelled from lack of precedent and definite authority, either ancient or modern. The opinions of the judges in the cases reported show that they have in each case regretted the absence of such decree of precedent and authority as would have enabled them to have still further strengthened and extended religious law in Tennessee, by adding to it the clause that all contracts made on Sunday are void. It would have required no whiter judicial interpretation than has been indulged in, therein, the desire to make the family and Sunday labor inviolable, but to Sunday contracts have fallen, have lacked the boldness necessary to establish such an innovation in the law however desirable it may have seemed to them, and this advance is left to some religiously irreligious enthusiasm which as yet is to come. The cases reported are of interest as showing the manifested desire to declare Sunday contracts void, and a disappointment almost amounting to chagrin, that a sufficient color of law or precedent could not be found to support a decision to a definite conclusion.

The Confederate notes as accepted under protest and afterward brought suit for indemnity. The partition was made by the petitioner that the transaction took place on Sunday and was void. Of this, the judge says, in considering the grounds relied on, for a refusal—

One of those grounds is that the acceptance of notes was made on Sunday—but the same, in the exercise, by the bank of its "common and ordinary calling."

But the contract was clearly construed, and the prayer of the plaintiff for relief was granted to either.

The plea was immensely good and here the parties in this case were not in a position to take advantage of it, not being able to come before the court with "clean hands."

Again at December term 1880 occurred the case of *Moody vs.* Vantinor, 2 Lea 119, when it was attempted to break a contract it was invalid, as claimed, on Sunday. But it was shown that the contract was not fully completed on that day, only negotiations entered into, and again it continued.

A contract is to be held void because made on Sunday, only when it is fully completed on that day. If it had been technically complete and if no further action were necessary, the contract would have been presented to the court. That is not, however, the ordinary case, and it is usually an impracticable case, to decide a matter of so much importance.

In these cases the gradual progress of judicial settlements towards a decision that all contracts entered into on Sunday are void, is manifested. In both the cases the judge, although he deplored the necessity of such a decision, was still very certain that Sunday contracts were valid, while in the last the judicial feeling is that it is a question of "great gravity," and of much importance, "not yet satisfactorily settled." In Tennessee the judicial mind is still open to conviction that all Sunday contracts are void.

It has proved upon other similar questions that this wish has brought forth its desired decision, and the evident teaching of this experience and the tendency is that nothing is not impossible in the matter of Sunday contracts whenever another case shall come for adjudication.
