It is not sufficiently emphasized that the Jew is left absolutely free to observe the seventh day. He can close his shop; he can refuse to work.—W. F. Crafts, 1884.

The liberty of rest for each demands the law of rest for all. W. F. Crafts, 1892.

What has wrought the change? If in 1884 the Jew was "left absolutely free to observe the seventh day" without a law compelling others to observe it also, how is it that in 1892 the Christian is not free to keep Sunday without a "law of rest for all"?
