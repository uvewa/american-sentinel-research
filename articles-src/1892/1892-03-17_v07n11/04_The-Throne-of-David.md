IT has heretofore been shown in THE SENTINEL that Christ is to possess, at different times, two distinct forms of kingship—a priesthood kindly after the order of Melchisedek; the other a nation or civil kingship, after the order of David, or, more properly, as the successor of David on his throne. The radical defect in all the positions organized by the so-called National Reformers is, that they make no distinction between these magnitudes as to time or nature. They liberally quote those prophecies which refer to Christ's reign on the throne of David, and apply them to his present reign on the throne of his Father in Heaven, as priest after the order of Melchisedek.

Yet in the Old Testament he was represented by those two kindly personages, Melchisedek and David. Melchisedek was both king and priest. Paul, in his letter to the Hebrews, abundantly proves that Christ is now fulfilling the kingly priesthood in Heaven. And that is the only kingdom he now has.

Let it be borne in mind that David David was no priesthood. No one exercised at priest to act as he did throne. Then, Uziah, himself to act as priest, but was smitten with leprosy for his presumption. And Christ will not be a priest on the throne of David, for no priesthood belongs to that throne.

The people then demands are, is sufficient to occupy two distinct thrones at different times? Yes, that is exactly what the Scriptures teach. The proof is found in his own words, as follows: "To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne."

There is no question or difference of opinion as to the present position of Christ, he is acting as priest on the throne of his Father. And if the people were not "slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken;" if they gave ready heed to the "scriptures" as they should, there would be no question about Christ yet occupying as his own the throne was given to David to which he was born heir. In regard to this throne, and its occupancy, we turn to the Scriptures.

The angel, in foretelling to Mary the birth of Jesus, said: "The Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David, and he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end." Luke 1:32, 33. Peter, speaking of the resurrection of Christ, shows that it was in the fulfillment of the promise to David. Of David he said: "Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne, he seeing this before, spake of the resurrection of Christ that his soul was not left in hell; neither his flesh did see corruption." Acts 2:30, 31.

To this throne Christ was to be raised by his ascension? No. When Christ was raised from the dead, the throne was not ready. But he was raised in order that through death he might destroy him who had the power of death. Yet from the dead Christ arose in the power of his resurrection. And now, as long as Jesus lives, no other can claim that throne. It is his by heirship, and it is the one upon which the faithful, overcomers will sit with him, after he resigns the position on the throne of his Father in Heaven.

In Rev. 11:15 it is a declaration often quoted by the National Reformers, and always by them misapplied. We will examine its terms: "The seventh angel sounded; and there were great voices in Heaven, saying, The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord and of his Christ, and he shall reign forever and ever." Immediately following (verses 17, 18) are words which the Reformers never quote in this connection. They are the words of the four and twenty elders. "We give thee thanks, O Lord God Almighty, which art and wast, and art to come; because thou hast taken to thee thy great power, and hast reigned. And the nations were angry, and thy wrath is come, and the time of the dead, that they should be judged, and that thou shouldest give reward unto thy servants the prophets and to the saints, and them that fear thy name, small and great; and shouldest destroy them which destroy the earth."

"The seventh angel sounded." There are seven trumpets in the book of Revelation, bringing to view facts concerning the nations, covering the entire period of the dispensation, from the first trumpet to the last, and close up the dispensation. This is no insignificant event. It is affirmed in the following:—

1. "Thy wrath is come, and the time of the dead, that they should be judged."

Paul at Athens said that God had set a day for judging the world, and would carry out his plan. "The seventh trumpet that opens the judgment." The error of the National Reformers is, their misapplication of the prophecies. They press them into the service of their own cause without any regard to their connection or relation. It is an error, and the source of error, it is in perverting the Scriptures. So Satan misapplied Scripture to the Saviour; but as said 2 Pet. 3:1 will readily see that his misapplication was with premeditation. In that case it does not refer directly, but it does refer to the saints in the coming time of trouble, during the presence of the judgment of God's wrath. See Rev. 16. We have no doubt that if the Reformers were told of their errors they would reject the truth they claim. But the appointed day of judgment has arrived, it is the time of the judgment of the dead, then all become as one. But when the dead are up, they would give a negative answer. All these things come under the seventh trumpet which shall dominion over the nations will be given to Christ; but not while in his people, not during their position.

2. "And that thou shouldest give reward unto thy servants the prophets," etc. This refers to nothing less than the destruction of the prophets when, as had all the earth, will mourn for his bursting upon humanity. Rev. 1:5-7; 2:26, 27.

Jesus said to his disciples, "Depart from me, ye cursed, to all the temporal things that the trumpet has taken." (See Rev. 22:12.) "Behold I come and my reward is with me." Mark 15:34 "and the nations were angry, and the wrath is come." See Rev. 11:18. Again Psa. 2:6, 7, 8, "Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion." Acts 3:19, etc. The Almighty says of Christ, is the King of kings and the realm of the all-powerful right of Almighty God, which art and wast, set at the fulfillment of that that great day of God Almighty."

The contentions of the National Reformers are based upon wrong interpretations and misapplications of the prophecies, which amount to perversion of the Scriptures. But their theories are pleasing to the ambitious, the bigoted, prejudice, and they find it more congenial to their spirits to forcibly compel their neighbors to conform to their opinion, than to confirm them to the gospel of peace, and use the only sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.
