At first thought it seems strange that people reared in a land of comparative freedom should have no just appreciation of individual liberty; and yet such is certainly the case. The principle is illustrated by the fact, that generally speaking, only those who labor properly appreciate the fruits of toil. The fortune carefully hoarded by the father, by whose industry and self-denial it was accumulated, is frequently squandered by the son, reared in ease and luxury. It is indeed true, as Wendell Phillips has said, "The manna of popular liberty must be gathered each day or it is rotten."
