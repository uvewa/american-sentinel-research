THE Declaration of Independence sets forth this: "That all men are created equal, that they are by their Creator endowed with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these rights governments are instituted among men." The difference between this declaration and the propositions laid down by Mr. Eaton, is as great as the difference between night and day.

GOVERNMENTS are not instituted to define rights, "to decide where my rights end and yours begin." My rights begin where yours begin, and end only where yours end; and no majority, however large, can of right make it otherwise. Governments are instituted, not to create, but to defend rights; to guarantee to the individual the untrammeled exercise of his rights; and when "public sentiment" forbids this, the will of the people becomes as tyrannical as the will of a single man. And it is for this very reason that Constitutions are made—to restrict or hold in check the majority from trampling upon the rights of the minority, no less than to protect the majority against the usurpations of the few, or of one.
