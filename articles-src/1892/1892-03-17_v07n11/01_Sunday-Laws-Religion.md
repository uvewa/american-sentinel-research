ALL that civil law can properly do toward religion and be just, is to respect every form of religion, and favor none; to be neither for nor friendly to any, but simply be silent on the subject, as a matter lying entirely outside of its jurisdiction.

THERE is no parallel whatever between Sunday laws and the laws specifying how many hours shall constitute a day's work. There is not a law in any State which prescribes what particular hours of the day shall constitute a day's work. There is a law that prohibits adult persons from working more hours than are prescribed as a legal day's work. If the legal day is eight to eight hours, there is no law which prevents an adult person from working two days twenty hours each, for the proprietor of the work or be willing.

IN this, as in all other things it may well be said that "a false zeal in religion is always, in some respect or other, mistaken zeal, or is not and according to knowledge—and seeking some false end, or, while proposing to itself a good end, seeking the promotion of it some unauthorized way." This describes National Reform exactly. "Zeal," continues the same writer, "had a seal, which he called zeal for the Lord of Hosts. His error was, not that he too zealous, but that his zeal was really directed to his own advancement. The Jews, in the days of Christ, had a zeal for God, but it was so deluded as to arise with a frenzy to destroy the Son of God and extinguish the Light of the world. There are combinations forms of false zeal now at work; but in all cases they sin not by excess, but by misdirection. Some are planning with zeal to spread none of the corruptions of Christianity, and to carry men away from its great and cardinal truths."

These words were not written of National Reform, but they are just as applicable as though they had been penned with special reference to it.

In an article in *Our Day* for January, 1891, Rev. W. F. Crafts said:—

It is significant that the American Sabbath Union, composed of representatives of six denominations, has adopted "the repeal and prevention of all laws enforcing the observance of Sunday as a religious institution" since that an economic use justifiable by public and other secular reasons. *All are Sunday laws that enforce its religious observance*, but "such," noted in the fact "is wanton insult."

The words, "There are no Sunday laws that enforce its religious observance," which we have italicised, are not in form a denial that there are "laws enforcing Sunday as a religious institution;" but we will not charge Mr. Crafts with making a show of denying a thing, while deliberately not doing so. Though not saying it in so many words, he must be understood from the connection as intending to deny that there are in this country "laws enforcing the observance of Sunday as a religious institution." A denial, however, is one thing; and the proof, quite another. And in this case, the proof in support of Mr. Crafts' denial is not only not forthcoming, but the facts prove exactly the contrary.

To enforce "the observance of Sunday as a religious 'institution,'" can neither more nor less than enforcing the observance of it because it is a religious institution; and further, that the observance required must in some degree be in keeping with the supposed character of the day. That all this is true of the Sunday laws now upon the statute books of the several States is the object of this article.

That the Sunday laws of the older States are derived largely from English statutes, will not be denied; and that the newer States have modeled their Sunday laws after the Sunday laws of the older States is equally true. It follows, then, that to learn the real character of Sunday legislation, we must go to the source whence it is derived. We have at hand, however, only the Connecticut law of 1721, an amendatory statute, 5 D. A. R. 89, decided in 1834, in which the judge said: "The object of the statute is to prevent persons keeping open shop and disregarding the decency of the Lord's Day." In New York in 1811, Judge Kent said of the existing Sunday law by express act, that "the statute for over a century recognized the sanctity of the obligation," and punished its violators. In 1834, another New York judge (Bayning vs. Page, 13 Wend. N. Y. 67), referred to certain conduct on "the first day of the week commonly called Sunday or the Sabbath day." In 1860, we are assured (Campbell vs. International Corp., 4 Bos. N. Y. 295) that the statute of New York "explicitly recognizes the first day of the week as holy time, and thus it has brought us back to the full, enlarged and absolute meaning which we find prevailed in the earliest known laws of Christian States. Even as early as 1802 (2 Abb. N.Y. Ct. 455, N.Y.) we find this significant language: "One who on the first day of the week keeps a store open for business, a tradesman, a mechanic, a laborer or a servant, is presumed to exercise his ordinary calling; and if he works on Sunday, at his ordinary calling, except the works of charity or necessity, he violates the law."

The *People's Reporter's* furnish additional items of testimony; for instance, a dry-goods merchant's conviction was sustained, and the judge declared: "As a day of rest and worship, Sunday has been recognized and enforced from the earliest period." In the same spirit the New York *Tribune* says: "Rightly so—under a law intended to enforce rest from ordinary occupations on Sunday, as a day of 'rest and worship.'"

This brings us to an act of 1781, ch. 45, sec. 1, the decision of the present case, to establish the divine authority of the institution.

"It is set apart by divine command and human legislation as a day of rest." "We have no right to give up this institution. It has come down to us with the most solemn sanction, both of God and man, and if we do not appreciate it, we are at least bound to preserve it."

Concerning two Kentucky statutes it is observed (Moore vs. Hague, 1 Dav., 137) that "some applied exclusively to Sunday or sacred, and the other to holidays as secular;" while in the same case the object of the Sunday law is declared to be "to aid in assisting [in Sunday] against desecration of them."

In turns, one of the newer States, it has been held (Davis vs. Fish, 1 Greene, 40) that Sunday is "sacred, set apart for rest." In North Carolina it is declared (Bickford cases, N. C. [E. 133]) that "all religious and moral duties permit works of necessity and mercy on their sacred days;" and in Georgia (S. Dodge, 10 Woolley) in that State, "as in England, Sunday is a holy day. The code declares likewise in this Lord's day the Federal day of courts and magistrates are to consider it." This last line might be greatly extended, but it is not necessary; the proposition we set out to demonstrate, namely, that no laws enforcing the observance of Sunday as a religious institution—the expression of several of the States themselves being the judges, we have amply shown.

But one question remains to be asked. This asked, have we not laws which require observance of Sunday in keeping with the supposed character of the day of rest? Again let the courts answer. In Georgia it has been held (4 Ga. 509) that the power to legislate in regard to Sunday is a very high prerogative, and is supported by the principle involved in the preservation and duties of the citizen upon the Lord's day," while in Ohio it is said (Wright, Ohio 784) in the case of a man selling drugs, "He is violating a particular portion of the era of rendering the Sabbath."

Bringshoff, author of "Legal Aspects of the First Day of the Week," cites a complaint under English common law in which it was said "the statute, in express terms, provides that every person shall apply himself to the observance of the Lord's Day, and public preaching, attendance, as well as public conduct, was expressly within its contemplation." Upon this, Mr. Bringshoff remarks that "there is no such legal construction authorized which recognize the English or American courts in relation to the Sunday law exclusively as of commerce or trade alone." The fact is stated in a variety of forms in the several State Constitutions. In Pennsylvania's Constitution of 1838 the language is nearly identical. The great, general, and essential principles of liberty established, we declare—

That all power is inherent in the people, and all free governments are founded on their authority, and instituted for their peace, safety, and happiness.

An English case is then cited which is almost parallel in all its attendant facts, whereas the court held that as the sale of property was not the ordinary calling of either party to the case, therefore the case did not fall within the statutes and the sale was valid. In this case the Tennessee judge delivered his opinion—

So far as the court, there is room to show that the work and labor and business to the record was not ordinary calling of either of the parties, but in the case upon the person a private matter. Instead, a case held that a contract entered into to be done on delivery on Sunday, might have been delivered on the theory no secular business done, the plea is not in error to excuse the non delivery.

The next case which appears in one parallel is that of *Berry vs.* the Planters' Bank, brought in 1872, in this it is held that where a contract on Sunday is executed, each party in its equal faith, relief cannot be granted on the plea that the contract was made by one of the parties in exercise of his ordinary calling.

The law may have been recognized and pronounced by our Saviour, by all things the authority of our own commonwealth."

"We are," says the Court, "far from questioning the religious obligations which all Christians are under to separate to religious uses the first day of the week, since the legislative power has exacted the observance of it as such." In Portmonnaie (Wait's case, 1 S. A. R. 11), it is declared that "it is of the utmost importance that they [the people] be permitted of their religious duties at stated intervals, and in Tennessee we have the very statute (4 Yerg. 311): it is correct, as advanced and adopted by the chancellor's counsel, that no worldly labor or business ought to be carried on upon the Sabbath day. It is set apart, last, unassembly, unservance of good morals, and as it appears to me, not in union with the principles of our forefathers." And again; "The object of the law was to protect the observance of the day, which by our law is indebted to the duties of 1 Moses 4:12."

Have we indeed no laws enforcing the observance of Sunday as a religious institution? What answer must honest minds give to the question?
