THE Hon. Senator Edwards said that no one had closed the World's Fair to any one on Sunday, and that in no respect did the people who were strongly opposed to any desire that the World's Fair should not be open, nor should the Fair at Chicago should not follow the example of the Metropolitan Museum and other institutions in making the exhibition more of an aid to the country than the desecration of the Puritan idea of Sunday. The Catholic spirit is a free thing for all; it has no right to discriminate in the passage of such a bill. Every denomination should be allowed to receive some other day than Sunday for their observance from some one else.

I do not think that an observance of the Sabbath consists in sleeping or lounging about for twenty-four hours. Sunday should be a day of rest and intellectual, and that their right as well to come over Coney Island as the World's Fair, for every ticket is taken which can be taken for the day.

Senator Hearst's motion to refer Senator Hoare's resolution to the Select Full Committee of the Fair on a vote of sixteen to thirteen.

The Fair disposed from the Democrats and the House having "charged a vote," and of having been had, to declare the question, that "daily," adjournment "resolves that the Museum be opened and the matter of the day furnish a new forecast of the national religion of this country."

THIS last reports the proceedings of the Legislature, in passing the appropriation bill for the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

"Sunday and religion were discussed in the Senate, and there was one of the most remarkable scenes of the session. The occasion was the bill to have the New York City appropriation served annually a year to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, on condition that this Museum be kept open every day of the week, Sundays included. The bill had passed the Assembly without discussion.

"Senator Hunter moved to strike out the Sunday clause. He said that the bill offered a bribe to the Museum authorities to desecrate the Sabbath by opening its doors on the Lord's Day.

"Senator O'Connor said that milk wagons ran on Sunday, and that it was as good for the patron of the Museum to go and see the pictures as to go with nothing to do to get milk and other things to do.

"This is a bid for money at the expense of our religion," said Senator Robertson. "A man goes to Central Park now without making it worse by passing this bill." People can go to the Park and see the animals, eat sandwiches, drink beer, and so on, if they please, without spending a dime and there is no violation on breaking the Sabbath day."

"The Hon. Senator then makes the principal speech in opposition to the bill. "Why break the Sabbath," he said, "and make the modern idea of seventy thousand dollars for breaking down the American Sabbath?" Degradation, to himself with manly faults. Stood by the old faith. Those who go to the Museum on Sundays, but that those who are not there would be glad to go to the Museum some other day, but hangover who might go as well the following Senate presented.

"The bill passed by a vote of seventeen to eight in the Senate and finally the Assembly the concurrent bill. And the Hon. Senator Edwards."

The following from the Pittsburg *Dispatch* is a splendid comment upon the sincerity of the Government chaplains.

Mr. Hilton, the chief chaplain of the House, has made quite an appeal for the originality of his prayers. Few clergymen are more considerable and intimate in the language with which they hold what is here called an extensive session with the Lord. Only a few are more blessed with alacrity; and claiming to have their inspirations direct from Heaven. Mr. Hilton has often this session bestowed most unflattering compliments upon Congressmen by his criticism of the conduct of the House and also by the amount of good advice he injects in prayer; and many of them have seriously canvassed their intention to protest against his form of prayer. House and Senate, a hypocritical, hollow, and contemptible show of piety. There is no greater burlesque of religion, and the solemnity which should attend public prayer, than these prayers and their surroundings.

I have often listened to the very choicest prayer of the Senate Chaplain when there were but two or three senators present, and once when one of our brewed to lead a mock reverence in the performance. I use the adjective advisedly, for a more self-satisfied, compliant worship could be conceived.

In the House, though, of course, the member has been content with a recitation of some form more evident. The sure and purpose of the entire arrangement is one that should cause the religious element of the country to show how great and ominous this non-compliance with principle, and proceed to business without a prayer. Of course, this element is not expected to discover that both senators and representatives respectfully refrain from every prayer, by engaging in conversation until the prayer is finished, and then they are known to be present. But if they must have prayer, let them send for their own pastors and when they want to be enriched by the chaplain. He is not expected to be paid. He is not paid to offer or compose any moral or offer advice whatever. Their service is simply the part of a privy to this service in the House and Senate.

Therefore Mr. Hilton, because has been known to stand a little scolding or a sort of novelty, a bit of spice, has been considered a factor worth preserving, following upon the liberal congressional method of having of a different clergyman for each purpose. Therefore, Mr. Hilton has been quite informed that if, not said, he would want to satisfy the members of the House. For his appointment for the adulation of his office it would be well for him to confine himself simply to his invocation of Divine Providence to give so much of his favor to all, and then closing to the Lord's Benediction, and representatives, and then let the matter rest.

On the other hand, Mr. Joseph J. Little, of the Twelfth New York district, elected from the unexpected terms of Truman A. Merriman. Sunday in his place a joint resolution. Providing that no copies of the "Session laws" or prayer copies of the chaplains shall be printed in the Congressional Record except on the request. This is an innovation that will hardly obtain while the House chaplain serves his purpose of making the House in his voluminous prayers.

THE real meaning of the general alliance of the churches of this country will end in great carnage, is shown by the late note from the Epis. Ecclesiastical.

It is seldom that the so-called representatives of the different churches will meet at a common "convention." In a few miles before what special legislation can "officially" be planned with what special legislation against Sunday, and this is not surprising that such a picture is presented in Chicago, where the Presbyterians, Methodists, Baptists, Catholics and the different churches are each and every one represented on this day; it is seen that some hundred thousand people will visit the exhibition on that day; it is a reasonable ground for patronage on that day; it is the reason given by the opponents, that to close the Fair on that day would be doing an injustice and wrong along with the churches, the closing of the Fair on Sunday would be no other source upon. If the church organizations and the representatives of the House would be no other source open. If the church organizations were truly Christian in their hearts and not only, let them concentrate their efforts in securing attendance. The cause of the churches has been that of the representatives of the State to close the Fair on that day.

This is nothing in facts, but the bat chaplain establishes an error. To attempt to close the fair on Saturday, or any one day, and then legislate them for the remainder of the week, is not working in the real interests of morality. The church which concentrates its efforts on the closing of the fair, and the stoppage of the liquor traffic on Sunday is doing the same work. The church which cannot have her Church serve him but one seventh of the week—they who would compel a sacred observance for all days of the week so far as concerns the question of temperate living.
