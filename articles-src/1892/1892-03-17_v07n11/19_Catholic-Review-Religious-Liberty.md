THE Catholic Review says: "There is but one United States, and that means there is but one spot on the face of the earth where a man can hold up his head and say, 'I am allowed to practice the religion I think is the right one.' Let us pray that this grand religious liberty will last forever." And that would in effect be to pray that Romanism may never become dominant here.
