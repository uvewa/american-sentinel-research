THE utter lack of any proper sense of the meaning or value of the sacred rights of the individual, is well illustrated by a recent article in the Boston Traveler, by one Charles Eaton, of Memphis, Tennessee. In the outset of his article Mr. Eaton says:—

The supreme law of the land (Article 6, paragraph 2, United States Constitution) is that made by the people, whether in their Federal or State organizations; or, the supreme law may be that which is expressed by the people through the press, the platform, and the pulpit—called public sentiment. This fact is stated in a variety of forms in the several State Constitutions. In Pennsylvania's Constitution of 1838 this language is used: "That the general, great, and essential principles of liberty and free government may be recognized and unalterably established, we declare: . . . That all power is inherent in the people, and all free governments are founded on their authority, and instituted for their peace, safety, and happiness."

THIS paragraph contains a great truth, and a fatal error. The truth is that "the Constitution is the supreme law of the land;" the fallacy, that the will of the people, aside from the Constitution, is supreme; or that it ought to be supreme. That which should be supreme in civil government, and that which political Constitutions should guarantee, is inalienable human rights. But that Mr. Eaton does not at all appreciate these facts is evident from these propositions which he lays down in the course of his article:—

The people, the State, are sovereign in all things whatsoever, as between man and man.

The people and the people alone decide where my rights end and yours begin.

But the people have of right no such powers as those claimed for them by Mr. Eaton. Nothing whatever can justify the majority in meddling with the inalienable rights of the individual. John Stuart Mill never wrote a truer thing than when he said that such—

power itself is illegitimate. The best government has no more title to it than the worst. It is as noxious, or more noxious, when exerted in accordance with public opinion, than when in opposition to it.

The idea that whatever the majority decrees is right is no more true now than it was when the majority demanded the crucifixion of Christ, or when the majority demanded the hanging of witches in Massachusetts, or when, as in our own day, the commune of a Russian village decrees the exiling of innocent men and women to Siberia. It is possible for majority rule to be just as tyrannical and just as wicked as the rule of a single man.
