THE FEBRUARY issue of *The Quarterly Register of Current History* (Detroit, Mich., $1.00 a year), is a model one. Without beating about the bush, it strikes right at the very heart of its subject-matter. From a clear and interesting treatment of international affairs, it proceeds to a series of splendid articles on "Affairs in Europe," "Affairs in Africa," "Affairs in Asia," and, last but not least, "Affairs in America." Under this last heading is included, the presidential discussion, the proceedings of Congress and the Legislatures, the state of trade, finance, and general politics. An elaborate treatise on the latest developments in Canada is an interesting feature of the number.
