In reply to the same query, Rev. Loe M. Wylie---

To reply to the same query, B. C. R. Wylie, of the National Reform Association of the city.

This most convinces the masses of the people of the State of the National Reform Association and not its value at all in the right of the religious law, of such and the law, and political circles.

It must be shown that the Sabbath law can be enforced; it is a Sabbath law can be individual in the force of at least one; the man of public character should be such to take the form of public vire, divine judgment, persecution.

Mr. Wyllie's first, is in effect, the same as the reply on Mr. Crafts, and the Sabbath law should respect the law, and then the civil to the law of God. Did he stop there? No, for he went on to show the impurity; but seeing evidently the impossibility of carrying the argument and the religious, the Sabbath which Mr. Wylie had in his mind thus far the most part question and adroitly introduces another thought entirely, had, now plain to be forced to keep Sunday? This he intimates can be accomplished by showing that

"the Sabbath law is a civil law;" by which he means, that one must be shown that by the civil law they can be required to treat Sunday as though it were the divine rest day.

But it is his fifth that Mr. Wylie plainly implies that he would quicken conscience by civil law. He says: "It must be shown that the Sabbath law can not be evaded with impunity. True he does not directly refer to civil penalties, but as they are inseparable from a "civil bath," they are strongly implied.

It is left to Rev. Henry Ostrom, Mechanicville, of Milwaukee, to detach wholly from the question and appeal wholly to the civil power. His answer in full is:---

"A strong, brave man, in fashion and forces, schools, and homes destroy regard and respect for the Sabbath, and where there is any such sentiment left in us it is rapidly falling into the hands of just such anarchy.

"Short, sharp prosecutions on the AT. stations; therefore, let the organizer thoroughly start this matter. Over the whole vast and important organized country.

"1. Multiply the number of organizers or laborers.

"2. Mainly short selections on the AT. stations.

"3. Introduce a strong hymn, to be sung in a salute at once; and then at least have a specially strong argument. Get a man to be at a special meeting to sing, in any two hymn singers at the World's Fair.

"4. Establish proper working of religious business. Let no most them on their own ground to the AT. many.

"5. Short, sharp prosecutions, church church organizations, will identify the whole system."

"Enforce existing State laws." How much in a course of coming years would quicken the conscience? It might make more people profane regard for Sabbath day it is might, and certainly would, make hypocrites, but no man that it would reach the conscience to be assert that civil law stands on a par with divine law, and "is a discovery of the thoughts and intellect of the heart."

Mr. Ostrom's reply amounts to about this: Increase the number of organizers or convictions in the country; get up an excitement, appeal to feeling, start a hymn, and finally the great multitudes of church going people more alive to their [responsibility]; protest, the thing is done.

But Mr. Ostrom's "4" deserve special reply. It or as we do believe Mr. Crafts and the American Sabbath Union, the big feeling men are now very largely dependent, having their organizations of church and State. Is it himself that Mr. Ostrom means that when he speaks about "on their ground their leaders?" Does he mean that they should be made to observe the seventh day observance? Probably not; he would hardly make such an admission. He means then what he to be understood as implying all those against whom the prosecution are opposed to Sunday laws, and that they hold to their own lawful, hostile attitude because they have been deceived by their leaders. The issue raised upon the claim that the workers are demanding Sunday laws and make and shut Sunday closing of the Fair, in order that they may not be forced in idleness. They well know that millions of any organization, or whose sentiments are a part of; but rather ruthlessly sweep away scores of thousands who do not want the "civil Sabbath," namely, the demands of the "blending" masses, the cry of that force

workingmen, the mean of the weary every-one worked along girl. The advocate of enforced Sunday observance should get together and agree upon their "civilization facts" before they expect everybody to flock to their standard.
