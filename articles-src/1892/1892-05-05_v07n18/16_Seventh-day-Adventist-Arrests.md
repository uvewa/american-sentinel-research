SOME weeks ago we published the fact that five of the leading members of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, at Spring City, Tennessee, had been indicted for Sunday work, and that they were being to be arraigned any time. The following letter which we reprint from the *Herald and Fireside*, the Seventh-day Adventist Church paper, published at Battle Creek, Michigan, explains the situation as it is at present; also the probabilities in this case:

Springfield, Tenn., April 13, 1892.

DEAR BRETHREN: Yours of March 17, was received one day last ago, and you requested that I should let you know all of the particulars in regard to the arrest made here for Sunday labor: three city or county of our neighbors was on the country road on his horse, and knowing what was done, told him if he lived in the Advent community; He replied that he did. The attorney asked, He they

keep up their Sunday work? If answered, Yes. Does it disturb you? He answered, Yes.

Then the attorney responded him to give him the name of five of the leading members, concerning which he did. The State's attorney said he had before the Grand court, Judge Ferguson, said, we are going to put a stop to that Sunday observance. So he for twelve warrants were issued, and a sheriff's batch. But it seems that he has underhandedly not acted on the process, and one has been issued, one, which will be the fourth Summons issued. These are the facts in the case, and the August agents as seen as there are further developments your brother in the cause.
