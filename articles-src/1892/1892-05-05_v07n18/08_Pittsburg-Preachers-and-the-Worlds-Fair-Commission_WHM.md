Fun unlimited impudence the series of resolutions adopted by the United Presbyterian Preachers' meeting of Pittsburg, on April 11th, exceeds any official utterance of the promoters of enforced Sunday closing of the World's Fair, yet made public. This expression of the views of the Pittsburg preachers has long before this received as wide a circulation as they could give it, for the last resolution provides that the series "be sent through the Reform Bureau to the religious press of the country and as far as possible to the secular papers." That any body of intelligent men should be willing to publish to the world such an embodiment of their arrogance as is contained in those resolutions is marvellous. The absurd insolence of the manner of address of these Pittsburg preachers to the business management of the World's Fair, if it comes under their eyes, can only do one of two things—rouse their anger or excite their contempt. The men who hold the business control of the Illinois corporation entitled "The World's Exposition of 1892," are men of practical affairs, well known, and in most instances widely known, for their ability and integrity; were it not so they could not hold such a relation to this great enterprise as they do. These men are possessed of as keen and active a moral sense as the preachers of Pittsburg. The stockholders who have invested their money in the World's Fair have without question full as much confidence in their sound business sense and reliability, and as complete assurance of their honesty and worth, as they would have in that of the preachers who have adopted and sent broadcast these resolutions. In fact it is doubtful if these preachers could have secured the confidence of so many investors who are looking for safe men with whom they may entrust their money for the furtherance of this Exposition in which their credit and financial interests are involved to such large amounts. How absurdly the title "minister"—which being translated is "servant,"—fits men who speak thus as having authority, as men accustomed to say to others, "go," and they go, "come," and they come; and who are filled with such indignation at the suspected possibility that their expressed wishes, as to the management of this World's Fair, in which they do not own a share, may not be followed. At the very expectation of such an event, even, they burst forth into denunciatory rhetoric. Is this the language of servants of God, or rulers of the State and kings of finance? What madness possesses the brains of these preachers? Is it that madness which marks the preliminary attack of the destroyer? and is it the expression of that pride which goes before a fall? The humility and calm-minded simplicity of him who faithfully serves and waits, knowing that the fruition of his labor is in the hand of the Master, is not to be found in these resolutions. The "whereas" with which they open reads thus:—

Whereas, The Columbian Commission, as we are informed, has, for a third time, postponed the decision of the question of Sunday opening, in this case to the very eve of the Fair, with the self-evident purpose, avowed privately by some of the Commissioners, of making it impossible, as buildings must be begun in May, for either friends or foes to express their disapproval of the final decision by withdrawing from the Exhibition: therefore, etc.,

What means such a tone as this? Have they no right to postpone the consideration of this question three times, or as many times as they see fit? And if they have postponed their decision of this matter to the very eve of the Fair with a purpose, and that "self-evident purpose" should be attained, these preachers, if in their right mind, would feel thankful that they and their followers had been saved from disregarding the laws of the land and entering into an unchristian conspiracy to diminish the property rights, and civil privileges of their fellow-citizens.

But the resolutions characterize this postponement as an "attempt to deceive" and a "political evasion of plain and present duty;" a "serious trifling" with the petitions of themselves and others like them; and ask "a reconsideration of the postponement and an immediate and unequivocal decision of the question." This is equivalent to a special session of the World's Fair Commission called by order of the preachers of Pittsburg. The Commissioners will take notice! The resolutions continue, however, that if this call is not obeyed or the "postponement is persisted in" it should be construed as "the forecast of an adverse decision in the form of a cowardly compromise or otherwise," and as an evidence of "lack of moral courage" to such an extent as to necessitate the withdrawal of the patronage of the preachers and their friends from the Fair. Again the "moral cowardice" of the World's Fair management is held up on the gall-poisoned tip of the clerical pen and Congress asked to preserve its morals with a money bribe.

The longest two of the eight resolutions are occupied with the details of a systematic conspiracy, the organization of which is urged upon all general assemblies, general conferences, Christian exhibitors, religious organizations, the religious "Congress," and all connected with it, religious conventions and churches, to the end that they may "solemnly covenant with each other not to aid or abet such a foe of the Sabbath by exhibition or attendance."

To their unmitigated insolence towards the World's Fair management the Pittsburg preachers have added conspiracy.
