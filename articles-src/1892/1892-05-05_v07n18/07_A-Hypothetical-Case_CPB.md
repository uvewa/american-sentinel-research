To make this matter more plain, let us suppose that a member of the Methodist Church wishes to sell intoxicating liquors. He knows that it is contrary to the rules of the Methodist Church; but he is very anxious to engage in the business; and so secures a license under the laws of the State. He then says to the church: The State grants me this privilege and you dare not disfellowship me, for that would be to array the authority of the church against that of the State. The church would very properly say: We can not take our rules of discipline from the State; we have nothing to do with the State, except as individuals to share with other citizens the burdens and benefits incident to civil government. As a church we recognize no authority but the great Head of the Church, Jesus Christ; his law alone is our rule; and as we believe that liquor selling is in violation of that law, we can not fellowship you if you engage in it, even if you have a license from the State.

THIS hypothetical case is exactly parallel to the case of a man who gets a divorce in accordance with the laws of the State, and then marries again in violation of the laws of the church of which he is a member. A church, whether Catholic or Protestant, has a perfect right to enforce its rules by withholding the sacraments; or as we Protestants put it, by withdrawing the hand of fellowship; and this is often done by both Protestants and Catholics for acts, which, according to the civil law, are perfectly proper. Our Country ought to temper its zeal with discretion. Such unreasonable attacks only injure the cause they are designed to aid. Mr. Grant can withdraw from the Catholic Church; but he has no right to insist that the church shall change her rules to suit his convenience. No more has he, or anybody in his behalf, the right to insist that the church shall take her law and practice from the State. A church dominated by the State would be no better than a State controlled by the church. In this country we want neither. It would be well if anti-Roman editors would confine their warfare against the Pope to legitimate protests against papal interference in civil affairs, and not make themselves ridiculous by demanding that the authorities of the church in Rome shall meekly bow to the decision of a Connecticut divorce court.
