A considerable number of petitions are now being presented daily, in both the Senate and the House, "remonstrating against the commitment of the United States Government to a union of religion and the State by the passage of any bill or resolution to close the World's Columbian Exposition on Sunday, or in any other way committing the Government to a course of religious legislation." It is quite time that intelligent and really patriotic citizens, who see the danger in this legislation which is being almost forced upon Congress, should be heard. As they more fully realize the situation they will continue to remonstrate in increasing numbers.
