SIOUX CITY, Iowa, has from the time the present mayor was elected been known as an open violator of the moral, and all effort to suppress the open saloon has been futile. Why? It will be recalled that it was at this point that Rev. McGeorrie made his late target at the liquor saloon, and leads of the liquor element in his endeavor to secure the enforcement of law. In fact the city has long been regarded as the most "rough and rowdy" city of the West. But of late the mayor was elected largely on its pledge, or with the understanding that he would strictly enforce the law.

The result has been thus far that the mayor has been in the chair, nearly every open saloon has been run practically wide open.

Now the Sunday closing of the saloons is what the people wanted, and they have them,---not by a punitive act, by law, with their expostulation, recently stirred and supported, a "civil Sabbath,"---"civil" instead, the avowed object being to enforce for the letter the Sunday law, and for make no admission that it will either be repealed, or as in the business was a form of. Of course every one who is a cause of malice afterthought, but they argue that a visit is "more to the saloon in as far in point,---people" and with this idea in view, Sunday, 1892 of April, was set for the time. The saloons that were taken in brief control. Armed with warrants the sheriff began serving them on the street-cars, then on the news-stands, and next on the cigar-stores, and then everywhere where there was a semblance of a violation of the law. Officers were stationed at every bridge on the street railroad, the avenue patrol cars were stopped, the law served on them was, and it is stated that they the powers and their passengers were during the Court Palace, as assembled at Fourth and Jackson Streets, where most of the arrested were at one time were made. About one hundred arrests are reported. The arrested were in about every instance conducted to one justice court, where, after giving bonds for future appearance, they were turned loose. Many paid their fines for the last day, but most of the cases were carried to the trial courts. Of course, public opinion is largely against the movement, and the papers decorum it is in the strongest terms. The people generally are most affected and aver that the "good work" will continue until the authorities attempt to make a Sabbath-keeping city on the globe." It is their intention, and was openly expressed, to enforce the law against livery stables, stores, factories, newspaper offices, news stands, and every other kind of business conducted on Sunday. "Why," said they, "was not which the expressive Sabbath, and we shall do it." The words, they say, is but only begun, and if we may judge of future efforts by the occurrences of last Sunday. Only and exciting as it was, the fight has but begun and the world will watch closely.
