The gathering of petitions for laws with reference to Sunday with which the last two Congresses have been so incessantly besieged has been credited mainly to the Sabbath Observance Department of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union. It seems that the Union has, until within the last few Sundays, made an object lesson of itself as to the necessity which it claims exists for these laws and their enforcement. It is said that work has been regularly prosecuted upon the Woman's Temple, in Chicago, on Sundays, but, in view of the public comment created, Sunday work has been discontinued. This destroys the force of the example that they might have made of the case; others may now think that they also can work or stop work as they choose without legal compulsion.
