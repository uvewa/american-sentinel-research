A FOREIGN correspondent of the *N. Y. Independent*, writing under date of February 1st, the particulars of a case tried at Lisbon, Portugal, of a Franciscan, Francisco Bradao, now undergoing imprisonment for the crime of refusing to remove his cap to a naked cross carried at a funeral.

Two appeals were taken in the case. The first appeal was from the decision which quashed the sentence on the ground that there was no law in the country to compel a man to worship or to make a citizen to touch the State religion. The other appeal was taken by the prosecution from the decision of the Oporto court, to the Supreme Tribunal at Lisbon, and here the sentence was reversed.

"The action of the Lisbon court was manifestly unjust; for it is a recognized fact that in Portugal, the state religion was sufficiently established, and the man had not been compelled to remove his hat, and refused to remove his cap. On this ground his act or failure to comply with an old custom should not be construed as an act of disrespect.

"So they deliberately ignored the article of the Constitution that provided that no one shall be persecuted on account of his religion."

This action of the Lisbon court is very similar to certain decisions by American courts in Sunday cases. The Lisbon court would of course say that Bradao is not persecuted, but prosecuted, not for his religion, but for his failure to do a certain act. Others. It was thus that Judge Hans in his decision in the King case in Tennessee. The Judge said:---

"The defendant was not indicted nor tried by Constitutions, not in the sense argued by the defendant, and adopted laws, in fact the Sunday law might easily be used; such day Baptist, might set at defiance the prejudices, those who observe it may to be the judge, in the matter of Sunday observance, but not compelled even to observe the first day of the week, in either of its characters; Sunday observance may be compelled upon this ground; and that is, that our laws recognize the answers of duty under such circumstances, not in refusing to conform to Sunday ordinances.

In reply to this it is enough to point out that the Sunday-law advocates simply advise to their advantages with great impunity in that the exercise of the perfect ecclesiastical freedom of Church and State. Sunday observance is essentially a part of that religious freedom that

pertains to all our laws at all. As to the keeping of Sunday as a Sabbath; but that Congress in all respects, largely be it allowed to have the keeping of the sabbath to a private conviction; each person is at liberty of judging his conscience; but only when he disturbs the peace of the community can be a subject.

Can any judicial officer bear the feelings of one who thus suffers.
