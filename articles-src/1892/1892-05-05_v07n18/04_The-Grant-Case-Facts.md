THE facts which constitute the ground of our Boston contemporary's complaint are stated by that paper substantially as follows:

Years ago a Mr. William Grant, of Connecticut, before he was a Catholic, was married to a Roman Catholic woman by a Methodist clergyman. Subsequently Mr. Grant joined the Roman Catholic Church, and still later, under the laws, and in accordance with the laws of Connecticut, he secured a divorce, and afterward was legally married. This divorce the Roman Catholic Church of Bridgeport would not recognize, and Mr. Grant applied for an ecclesiastical divorce, on the ground that a Methodist marriage was not recognized by the Catholic Church. For four years the case dragged along in the courts of the church, when last summer the case was decided by the Hartford diocese against Mr. Grant. The latter appealed to the arch-episcopal tribunal in Boston, which reversed the Hartford decision. The question was then taken to Rome, and the decision is that the first marriage, solemnized by the Methodist minister, was valid.
