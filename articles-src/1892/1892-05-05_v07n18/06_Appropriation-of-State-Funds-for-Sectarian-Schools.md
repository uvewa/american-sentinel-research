It seems that New York is not the only State in which public funds are diverted, directly or indirectly, to the support of the coffers of denominational institutions.

The following facts, taken from a circular issued by the Secretary of the Illinois branch of the American Secular Union, show how public money is divided in the following proportions in Illinois:---

Article VIII., Section 3, of the Constitution of Illinois reads as follows:---

> Neither the General Assembly, nor any county, city, township, school district, or other corporation or body, shall make any appropriation, or pay from any public fund whatever, anything in aid of any church or sectarian purpose, or to help support or sustain any school, academy, seminary, college, university, or other literary or scientific institution, controlled by any church or sectarian denomination whatever; nor shall any grant or donation of land, money, or other personal property ever be made by the State, or any such public corporation, to any church or for any sectarian purpose.

In an act of the legislature which went into effect July 1, 1879, which established and provided for the commitment of dependent girls to one or more industrial schools for dependent girls, for girls which might have been organized under any former act, but further, that "the judges of courts having jurisdiction over dependent girls were to make commitments;" and the managers and care of such dependent girls, under the rules and regulations the commissioners were to be contributed, to other tuition, clothing, medical attention, and care to such girls either tuition, maintenance, or care. It was further provided:---

It received, however, nominally, all the girls committed to it, and transferred them to three institutions, as follows: The "Angel Guardian Orphanage" and "St. Joseph's Orphan Asylum," both Catholic, and the latter conducted by Franciscan Sisters; and "The House of the Good Shepherd" and the "St. Mary's Training School of the industrious being Sisters of the Good Shepherd also a Catholic institution." During 1888 Cook paid to those two institutions $2,014.16, a total of $13,413.57 from June, 1880, to December, 1888; this included the cost of tuition, etc., and clothing for which the money was paid, was religious in its character.

About this time some good Protestants, having noticed how things were going, became interested, because the most talked of the subject came up before the Courts of the State. The case was tried before Judge Tuhill, and upon the evidence a decree was entered as prayed for. The case was then appealed. The decision of the Supreme Court of the State of Illinois was rendered February 3, 1892.

The Supreme Court reversed the decision, holding that so much of the order of the County Court as provided for paying the tuition and the care in paying money to the two Catholic institutions was illegal and void, and ordering the County to repay money paid by the Commissioners to these sectarian institutions. The court declared that donations made to institutions that were all of a religious character were those of said church, and were prohibited by section 3 of article 8, of the Constitution.

In the above illustration, and in the face of the above decision, it would seem that diverting money to sectarian institutions. And the General Assembly or State Legislature, by further legislation if needed, abandons disruption of the Constitution, and in upon definite of the authority of the Supreme

Court, they appropriate the money of the people. The disposition of all state funds to sectarian institutions. Also was made in 1889, and published in the *Illinois Blue Book.*

Some two years ago, the Secular Union took the matter up, and had it brought up in a chancery for trial on the reports of funds taken out by various trusts, their contribution being paid to the Pennsylvania Freedmen's organization.

All opposed to a union of Church and State, all opposed to sectarian appropriations of every description, and specifically all opposed to public money being used for sectarian purposes, in the supposed interests of religion or morals, should be willing to aid the friends in putting a step to such practices.
