THE decision in this case says nothing of the civil status of the marriage at all; it is simply to the effect that according to the faith, rules, and usages of the Roman Catholic Church, Mr. Grant was married to the woman from whom he was divorced by the civil law; and that, as the Catholic Church does not sanction divorce, the woman to whom Mr. Grant was first married is still his wife in the eyes of the Church; and consequently, that he is now living with his second wife, not in holy wedlock, but in adultery; and that so long as he continues in that relation he is not entitled to receive from Catholic priests the sacraments of the Catholic Church. The decision is one that can not be properly assailed on the ground that it is in opposition to the laws of the State. The church can not in such things be governed by State laws, any more than the State can be governed by church laws.
