THE Archbishop of Canterbury, in recently presiding at the opening of the Fine Arts Building in Whitechapel, a district of London mainly inhabited by the poorer classes, placed himself on record as favoring the opening of art galleries and museums to the people on Sundays. Under the circumstances his endorsement of the reform is intended to overcome an influence which the laboring and poorer population of a section in which few of the residents can afford the regular traveling and educational kind. It has yet been generally understood that the great majority of the people for whom benefit it has been intended, are unable, from one reason or another, to attend on any other day. That the privilege thus extended has been largely taken advantage of, the fact the number of daily visitors has been incomparably, and that the attendance on Sunday is greater than that of all the other days of the week together, proves that the Archbishop had reason, the plan worked that the free opening of other institutions besides on that day would be the more noteworthy because he formerly opposed the opening of the South Kensington Museum on Sunday, though even in those days he favored the reform on the ground that the distance of the museum from the districts inhabited by the working people was too great to make it available to them and the cost of railroad fares and the cost of the journey would constitute an obstacle in travel, traffic, and much. The English Primate is so exalted a dignitary of the church that his action in this instance can not fail to be influential.---*Chicago Herald.*

The Archbishop's present attitude is the more noteworthy because he formerly opposed the opening of the South Kensington Museum on Sunday, though even on the ground that the distance of the museum from the districts inhabited by the working people was too great to make it available to them, the cost of the journey would constitute an obstacle in travel, traffic, and much. The English Primate is so exalted a dignitary of the church that his action in this instance can not fail to be influential, assuming the opposition of Col. Elliot F. Shepard and others to the opening of the Exposition during some portion of Sunday, and of reading him to apprehend that everything which can be used to defend Sunday closing of the Fair is available, neglecting the opportunities and duties of providing for the intellectual training among the sanctities and privileges of the rest day.

Mr. Shepard's position has been upheld; but more has been paralleled by the opening of all museums and galleries of art; has been seen to be public on Sunday afternoon; of persons who can visit the museum on other days properly expect, amuse themselves on Sundays, while an orderly crowd of working people may be found carefully

looking the treasures on exhibition there on only the day at which they can upon to that purpose. In view of them and other recognition of the same, not it seems inevitable that when the time comes for finally determining the question as to whether or not the Exposition shall be open during some portion of Sunday; say in the afternoon---the interest and benefit of the great mass of the working people of Chicago and its vicinity will have to be duly considered.---*Washington Post.*
