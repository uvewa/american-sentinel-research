ON the strength of these facts, Our Country says:

How long do the American people mean to stand such high-handed interference with their civil institutions? If the American people do not propose to surrender to the papal church their sovereignty, their honor, and their rights, and undo what their fathers secured through the sacrifices of the Revolution, then something will have to be done, and that speedily.

This is unspeakably foolish under the circumstances. To us it seems that this was a very proper decision. The marriage contract was entered into in good faith, and was for years recognized by both the State and the Church; by Protestants and by Catholics; and how could the authorities at Rome decide that the marriage never was valid? Evidently they could not; but that was the only question before them; and the decision does not, as Our Country insists, "furnish another proof of the Pope's claim of supremacy over the State." It is true that the Pope makes that claim, but there is absolutely nothing in this case to show it.
