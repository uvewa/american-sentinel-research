There are very few broadminded people in Chicago who will not receive with pleasure Director General Palmer's statement that the World's Fair must be opened on Sunday. Of course it must. The World's Fair must be a world's fair, not a parochial enterprise. It is for Presbyterian and Catholic, high church and low church, Jew and Gentile, Mohammedan and fireworshipier, Buddhist and Parsee, orthodox and heterodox, and people without any doxes at all.

We narrow the great work at once when we permit any class in the community, no matter how numerous and respectable, to dictate their system of Sabbath observance to people just as numerous and quite as respectable who differ with them on the God-ordained manner in which the good people should pass "the first day of the week commonly called Sunday." It is not a question of who is right or who is wrong either in the interpretation of the Bible or in one's belief in the purpose of the God behind the Bible; but it is a question as to whether, when there is a difference of opinion among honest men, one side should dominate, control, and annoy the other.

Were it at issue that by holding the Fair open on Sundays the people who favored Sunday closing would be forced to attend the exhibition and thus do violence to their convictions, the Mail would demand Sunday closing. But there is no such necessity. It is open to every visitor to go or not to go, as seems best to him according to his private belief; but it is not open to him to say to another, "You must not go to the Fair to-day, because I do not approve of your going."

Those who think it wrong to open their exhibits or to look at the exhibits of others on Sunday are under no compulsion to commit what they deem sin; but neither are they to be permitted to interfere with him or her who does not think it sin to go to Jackson Park on Sunday.

It is a curious, almost a sad fact that a problem so simple and so self-evident should need serious discussion in these closing watches of the nineteenth century. Still it requires time and teaching to bring home the fact to the egotism of each of us that a man's mind must be a law unto himself. Still there should be one platform on which all could meet—let each visitor to the World's Fair be his own Sunday closer.
