IN the past, Protestants have justly complained of Rome because she refused to recognize the validity of Protestant marriages. Now, Our Country, which, if not truly Protestant, is, at least, intensely anti-Roman Catholic, complains bitterly because the College of the Propaganda at Rome has decided in a certain case that a marriage performed by a Methodist minister was valid.
