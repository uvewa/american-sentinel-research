IN A SKETCH OF THE LAW AND ORDER LEAGUE, by its Secretary, L. Edwin Dudley, he states that more than twelve hundred leagues have been organized in the United States and Canada, and others are being formed almost daily. The first purpose of the League is said to be to battle with the liquor traffic, but it is acknowledged that Sunday closing comes next, and the League prides itself that through its instrumentality "Sunday has been rescued from a great part of the desecration which was universal." This League, extended into an international organization, has for its president C. C. Bonney, of Chicago, who is also president and chief promoter of the World's Religious Congress to be held at the World's Fair. It does not require a prophet to put these things together and foretell what the result is likely to be.
