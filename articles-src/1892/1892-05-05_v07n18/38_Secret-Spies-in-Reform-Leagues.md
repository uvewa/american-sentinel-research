ONE of the worst features of the "Reform" scheme advocated by the Christian Statesman is that it involves the employment of secret spies. Article V. of the Constitution of the so-called "Reform Leagues," which Mr. Crafts has been, and is, organizing wherever he goes, provides that "the Secretary shall appoint an investigating committee of four, known only to himself, the first of whom shall on the first week of every month, the second on the second, and so following, ascertain personally what violations—first, of the civil law, second, of the higher laws of God—are in progress, and report fully in writing to the Secretary, who shall in turn inform the public authorities," etc. A fine blackmailing scheme truly! Its possibilities in that direction are limitless.
