THE crusade against the street cars in Sioux City Iowa, has met with a quietus. Judge Foley has decided that street cars are a necessity within the meaning of the statute. It must be remembered, however, that this crusade was inaugurated by saloon keepers, against whom the liquor laws had been enforced, and who declared that in turn they would see the Sunday laws enforced. When the Law and Order League and the American Sabbath Union undertake the enforcement of Sunday laws against street car lines, as in Toronto, we may expect to see this decision overruled.
