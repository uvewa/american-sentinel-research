RELIGION is a matter of faith, law a matter of reason; religion is between man and his God, law is between man and man; religion is purely spiritual, and belongs to the individual, law is actual and belongs to the community; religion looks to the preservation of man's happiness in the next world, law looks to the protection of his rights in this world.
