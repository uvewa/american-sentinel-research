THERE are very few broadminded people in Chicago who will not receive with pleasure Director General Palmer's statement that the World's Fair must be opened on Sunday. Of course it must. The World's Fair must be a world's fair, and not a puritanical Bible class.

It is for Protestants and Catholics, high churchmen and low church, Jew and Gentile, Mohammedan and Browningite, Buddhist and Parsee, orthodox and heterodox, infidel and agnostic, religious and irreligious.

We narrow the ground at once when we say that the Fair shall not be open. No matter how numerous and respectable, to no class of people has the right to dictate to people just as numerous and quite as respectable who differ with them on the God-ordained manner in which the good people should pass "the first day of the week commonly called Sunday." It is not a question of what is right or who is wrong, either in the interpretation of the Bible or not to held, to the interpretation of the God behind the Bible; but it is a question or not whether, there is any practical point,---is it right or wrong for any one of opinion among favored men, one single civil domination, control, and many others practically wrong.

Were it at issue that by holding the Fair open on Sunday a restriction on Sunday closing would be forced to attend the exhibition and thus to do violence to their convictions, the Mist would demand Sunday closing. But there is no such necessity. It is open to every visitor to go or not to go, on some best form, or nothing to his private belief; but it is not proper for him to do so. Another man's right not to go to the Fair to-day, because it happens to be Sunday, does not affect his right to visit to-morrow, and to look at the exhibits or to look at the exhibits of others on another day, to look on Sunday at what they themselves, of themselves will. Let him accept what they deem sin; but neither he nor any one else has a right to say to or about the one who does not agree, and her or him or her who does not think it sin to go outside their local Park on Sunday.

It is a certain, almost a and fact that a problem on any side of an old question should need serious discussion in these closing years of the nineteenth century. Still it requires time and teaching to bring home the fact to the question of a man to think a small mind must in a law with a subject. That there should be any religion upon the subject is simply wonderful. That the visitor to the World's Fair by his own act disturbs anything.

We do not know how accurate the Chicago accounts of the amount of Congressional Sunday closing as applied to the Exposition, but there is no doubt that in time it would lead most dangerous results.

The sponsors of enforced Sunday closing ought to give this more thought, and then ask themselves whether it is really in the interest of civil order or of a false idea of the advancement of religion or the welfare of the people.
