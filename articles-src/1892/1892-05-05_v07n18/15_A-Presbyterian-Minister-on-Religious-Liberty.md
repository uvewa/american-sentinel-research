The Rochester (N. Y.) Herald, of April 1, prints the following synopsis of a sermon delivered on the previous Sunday, by Rev. Dr. Nelson Millard, Pastor of the First Presbyterian Church of that city:

"Religious Liberty and the Civil Power" was the subject of the morning address and the preacher aptly chose his text from the twenty-first verse of the twenty-second chapter of Matthew: "Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's." In the course of his sermon Dr. Millard said:

"We are living in the enjoyment of many privileges, the possession of which seems as natural and as much a matter of course to us as our use of the sunlight and the air. One of these privileges is the right to private judgment in religion, the right to worship according to the dictates of our own consciences without molestation or violence from others; that right to the average American seems like an axiom; but it is only a little while ago that this right of private judgment in religion was regarded as the very height of absurdity. It was then the universal opinion that governments had not only the right but were under the bounden duty to coerce their subjects into uniformity of belief and worship. The monarch was regarded as not only the temporal but the spiritual head of the State; and through a thousand medieval years both State and Church repudiated the right of private judgment in religion and at once believed in and practiced persecution.

"This seems strange when we remember that Paul in the fourteenth chapter of Romans had laid down with a luminousness like sunlight the doctrine of the right of private judgment. It seems strange, too, when one remembers that the early Church both taught and practiced entire religious toleration. To the immortal honor of the Church of the first three centuries be it said that they neither attempted to persecute nor so much as defend persecution, but repudiated it in the strongest terms. Tertullian, Sanctauction, Hilary of Poitiers, all of them taught the doctrine of entire religious liberty as plainly and as forcibly as it is ever taught to-day. Yet the Church sank back from this high position and became for a thousand years, in connection with the State a persecuting power.

"During an unhappy millennium Church and State in unshallowed alliance shed a vast amount of blood and caused untold physical and mental suffering. The early Christians had been persecuted by the Roman Government, but now a spirit more fierce than that which inflamed the empire raged in the bosom of the Church. It is only in the last 250 years that there has been a gradual emergence from this low condition of persecution up to that condition of religious privilege which we enjoy in this land.

"The first step upward was from persecution to toleration; in this stage of toleration, while the State still has some one established form of worship which it favors and supports, it does not now molest or use violence toward other forms of worship, but allows them to be practiced without persecution. But this is all there is reached in the second stage, namely, toleration.

"But toleration is by no means the highest point. It is indeed common to hear toleration lauded as if it were a princely virtue, almost the acme of perfection in regard to men's religious rights. But it leaves much yet to be reached, for toleration carries the imputation that the immunity from persecution which it confers is a concession granted, not a right recognized. It implies that the State has the right to persecute, but at its pleasure and for such time as it may elect, waives that right. The word toleration in its very self and sense implies superiority and indicates condescension. 'We tolerate,' it has been justly said, 'what we dislike but can not prevent.' No one wants to be 'tolerated;' it's like being patronized. Therefore a yet higher stage before the true ground is reached is this: Liberty, full religious freedom, and equality. Only as without establishing or favoring any religion the State equally and impartially protects them all does it assume the correct attitude.

"Such is the condition of things in this country where the principle of full religious liberty is executed with now and then, however, some illogical and intolerant exceptions. Most of our people are in hearty accordance with it, and are glad that our United States Constitution allows not the slightest union of Church and State. There are, however, some busybodies who either do not or will not understand that our Government is founded upon the absolute divorce of Church and State, and who desire to introduce into the Constitution a religious element, making our Government a distinctively Christian one. This would logically be only an entering wedge for the whole doctrine and evil of the union of Church and State. Far better than this is the Sixteenth Amendment proposed by the present House of Representatives, which calls upon the general Government to require every State to insert in its Constitution the principle of entire divorce of Government from any interference in religious affairs.

"In some of the States their Constitutions are such that Jews and Seventh-day Baptists, who keep Saturday as Sabbath, can be and have been prosecuted for not observing Sunday. This is religious persecution and is unjust.

"Ought legislatures to be provided with chaplains? If they do have them all sects ought to have equal rights and privileges in their appointment; and it is certainly an open question whether such chaplains should not be paid by the churches rather than from the public funds. Our legislatures need praying for bad enough; but I should say, let the churches do the work and pay the workmen.

"In short, total divorce of Church and State is the only true logic and the only course that can produce smooth sailing."
