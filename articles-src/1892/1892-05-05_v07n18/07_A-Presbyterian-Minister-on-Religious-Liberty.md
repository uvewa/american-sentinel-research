The *N. Y. Herald* of April 4, 1892, prints the following synopsis of a remarkable sermon by a Presbyterian minister. Rev. Dr. Nelson Millard, Pastor of the Calvary Presbyterian Church, was his text "Religious Liberty and the Civil Law."

The Sixteenth Amendment was the theme of his address and the preacher aptly chose his text from the words of Matthew's version of the twenty-second chapter of Matthew: "Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's;" and unto God the things that are God's, the urgent words of Dr. Millard and said:---

"We are living in the enjoyment of many privileges, the possession of which we are apt to take as a matter of course, forgetting the price paid for them. Nor is the air of these privileges is the principle of religious liberty, or the right to worship according to the dictates of one's own conscience without suffering or violence from others; that right may seem beyond question or controversy; but it is only a little while ago when it was not; there was a time when religion was regarded as the very height of wickedness and heresy, and those were the opinion that governments had not only the right but the duty, not only to govern the outer life but to coerce their subjects into uniformity of religious belief and worship. It was to control the political, the intellectual, and the spiritual head of the State; and through this the Church regulated the right of private conscience and claimed the right. But since in act practiced recognition, let us call to mind that Paul in the fourteenth chapter of

Rome like sunlight the doctrine of the right of private judgment,---the greatest privilege when one remembers that the early history of the Church of the first three centuries is in itself that they neither attempted to persecute nor to teach so defined persecution, but repudiated it in the strongest terms. Tertullian, Lactantius, and History of Polters, all of them taught the doctrine of entire religious liberty as plainly and as forcibly as it is ever taught to-day. Yet the Church said, rank from this high position and became for a thousand years, in consonance with the State a persecuting power.

"During early many millennium Church councils and popes declared that a large amount of blood and caused untold suffering and misery. The persecution of Christians had been persecuted by the Roman Government, but far more fierce, more fierce than that which inflicted the empire regal in the bosoms of the Church. It is only in the last 350 years that there has been a gradual emergence from this low condition of persecution up to that condition of religious privilege which we now enjoy.

"The first step upward was from persecution to toleration; in this stage of toleration, while the State still has some one religion that is established by law, it protects and supports, it does not now molest or persecute people of other forms of worship, but allows them to be practiced privately. When the second great step is reached in the second stage, namely, liberty.

"But toleration is by no means the highest point. It is indeed common to hear toleration landed as if it were a great virtue, almost the acme of perfection in regard to man's religious rights. But in truth toleration is not to be reached, for toleration carries the implication that the State still has the right to prescribe the religion of its citizens, but for certain reasons is pleased to forbear using that right, and for such as it may elect, waives that right. Its very self and sense implies superiority and intrinsic condescension. "Who are you," it has been justly said, "what do you do, that you are good or anything must be 'tolerated;' it is like being patronized."

"But when we come before the ground is reached it is that. Liberty, civil and religious freedom, and equality. Only without establishing or favoring any religious beliefs equal and impartially protecting and defending all religious and anti-religious beliefs.

"This is the condition of things in this country where the principle of full liberty obtains. Most of our State constitutions, there, however, more illogical and intolerant and exceptional. Most of them are in hearty accordance with it, and are glad to see every State legislature remove, without the slightest motion of Church and State. There are, however, more illogical politicians who either do not or will not discern the difference between Church and State, and who desire to introduce into the laws the distinctive tenets of their own religion. It is to preserve what we have, our Government a distinctively 'Christian' State. That would clearly be an entering wedge for the whole doctrine and evil of the union of Church and State. Far better than this is the Sixteenth Amendment proposed by the

House of Representatives, which calls upon the general Congress to invite every State to insert in its Constitution an amendment that the rights of citizens shall be exempt from any interference or religion whatever.

"'In sence of the State their Constitutions are such that Jews and Seventh-Day Baptist, who keep Saturday as Sabbath, to and have been persecuted for and by observing Sunday. This is religious persecution and it is unjust.

"'Ought legislatures to be provided with chaplains? If they do have them of such ought to have equal rights and privilege in their appointments; and it has an open whether our chaplains should not be paid by the churches and societies. It seems to me that our legislatures need praying for had enough, but let the churches do the praying, and pay the workers.

"'I honestly hold, divorce of Church and State is the only true logic and the only course that can produce results widely."
