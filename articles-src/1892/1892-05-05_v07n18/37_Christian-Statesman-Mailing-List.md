THE Christian Statesman accuses Drs. Stevenson and McAllister of retaining and making an improper use of the mailing list of that paper after it had been sold to the present management. Dr. Stevenson mildly asks "a brief withdrawal of the accusation," but virtually confesses its truth. Upon this the Statesman says:—

It is curious that so soon after the general condemnation of the abstracting of the Voice mailing list, any one should lack commercial sense (not to say moral sense) as to seriously defend such a course as here described. Surely the honored National Reform Association needs to meet and begin anew its reform work in its own official ranks.

This is most cruel! Only think of the National Reform Association having to be instructed in morals by as accomplished a trickster as the present editor of the Christian Statesman! Surely this is the irony of fate!
