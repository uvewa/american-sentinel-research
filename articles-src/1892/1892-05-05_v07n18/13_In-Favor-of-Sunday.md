The Archbishop of Canterbury, in recently presiding at the opening of the Fine Arts Exhibition in Whitechapel, a district of London mainly inhabited by the poorer classes, placed himself on record as favoring the opening of art galleries and museums to the public on Sunday under certain circumstances. The exhibition referred to is intended to exercise an influence in elevating and refining the dense population of a section in which few opportunities are afforded of an improving and educational kind. It is kept open especially on Sunday because the great majority of the people for whose benefit it has been instituted can attend on no other day. That the privilege thus extended is appreciated has been shown by the fact the number of daily visitors has been unexpectedly large, and that the attendance on Sunday is greater than that of all the other days of the week put together. So successfully indeed has the plan worked that the free opening of other institutions of a similar character is under consideration.

The Archbishop's present attitude is the more noteworthy because he formerly opposed the opening of the South Kensington Museum on Sunday, though even in that case he based his objections on the ground that the distance of the museum from the districts inhabited by the working people was too great to make it available for them without an immense and undesirable increase in travel, traffic, and labor. The English primate is so exalted an ecclesiastical authority that his action in this instance can not fail to be influential. It may even have the effect of lessening the opposition of Col. Elliott. If Shepard to the opening of the Columbian Exposition during some portion of Sunday, and of leading him to apprehend that everything which can be used to educate, refine, and elevate men, without neglecting the opportunities and duties of religious observance, has its proper place among the sanctities and privileges of the Sabbath.

The success of the Whitechapel experiment has been paralleled by the opening of the New York Metropolitan Art Museum to the public on Sunday afternoons. It has been found there that the class of persons who can visit the museum on other days very properly absent themselves on Sundays, while an orderly crowd of working people may be found examining the treasures on exhibition there on the ouly day which they can spare for that purpose. In view of these and other precedents of the same sort, it seems inevitable that when the time comes for finally determining the question as to whether or not the Exposition shall be open during some portion of Sunday—say in the afternoon—the interest and benefit of the great mass of the working people of Chicago and its vicinity will have to be duly considered.
