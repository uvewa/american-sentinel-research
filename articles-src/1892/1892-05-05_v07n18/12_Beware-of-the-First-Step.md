COMPULSORY compliance to a church dogma does not and can not make converts to that dogma. Human nature is such that the effect would be the reverse. Conviction does not grow out of compulsory observances. That is a truth many people can not grasp. Even if such were the case, the principle is wrong. Religions are given all the liberty conceivable. They are free to practice and preach any doctrine they please, so long as their practice and preaching are not in conflict with the laws of the land.

The theory of this Government, carried out to the letter, is that all shall have perfect liberty, within the laws, but that no law shall be enacted establishing any religious doctrine or practice. The idea is that religion and government shall be entirely separate—that neither shall encroach upon the rights of the other.

But religions, it seems, will never be satisfied with the liberties they enjoy, but persistently continue to endeavor to encroach upon the province of government with the purpose of securing the reins and guiding the course of governmental affairs—that is, to make the government and church domination one, or, reduced to church mathematics, one and one make one, and that one to be the church. They do not expect to reach that desideratum at one jump, but little by little, so that the people will surrender their liberties in such small lots as to be almost imperceptible, and to call forth but little opposition at each step. They have labored incessantly for and accomplished in many States the first precedent. That is in the enactment of Sunday laws. These enactments, however, have not been secured on the plea of "religious observance," but simply as a physical necessity. But the religious idea, the idea that the laws shall force a religious observance, is at the bottom of it, and the motive of many advocates of Sunday laws is that there shall be a union of Church and State, however slight that union may be, and that a start is everything, and with that start a further and firmer welding together is the next step. A precedent results in wonderful things, either for good or evil. One precedent in violation of law, although the law may be stretched but very little in order to establish it, gives an argument and a starting point for a further stretch of law, for another precedent still further on. A step in a certain direction is not much and a step from that step is not much, and so on to the end. The churches have succeeded in making the first step toward a union of Church and State, by presenting physical grounds for bringing Church and State nearer together, and keeping the real motive for such a step nicely hidden and wrapped up in the cloak of deception. "Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty," and "eternal vigilance" is something Americans must exercise or their liberties will go little by little until with a perfect union of Church and State history will repeat itself on American soil.
