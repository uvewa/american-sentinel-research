## What It Means.

### The Catholic Universe approves.

Rev. Wilbur F. Crafts, the entire editor of the *Christian Statesman*, a Protestant, wielding all within his power to establish lines of common Christian religion, forced observance of religious institutions, and our best wishes to our good friend.

Mr. Crafts quotes this in his paper evidently as a compliment. He is not disturbed; he does not resent it, he only smiles. We understand it, but we ask, Is IT his purpose to be a Protestant, but a true Protestant, as one who professes against the errors, corruptions, and false doctrines of the Papal Church? The answer must be, Yes, as far as the term grew out of the great Reformation movement, started among the Christian princes of Germany at the diet of Spires, grew to a protest against the persistent efforts of the Romanists to stop the further progress of the Reformation, to reestablish the papal hierarchy, and deny to all in freedom of a general council their consciences in religious matters. They declared their allegiance to the Holy Spirit and this "the same rule of all doctrine and life," and this "without anything which could be approved" contrary to God; upon these, the basis of Protestantism, and the persistent, the errors of Protestantism, and the profession of its principles demand a constant action between the two bodies. The adherents to the Papacy, evidently, have an eye on him, approve his "worthy" purposes, and do all earnestly possible consider him a very dutiful grand son. But when has it been that Catholicism can call a professed Protestant "our good friend" and extend to him its "best wishes?" It must mean one of two things, either that Catholicism has changed, or that this is a Protestant only in name. Which is it?

All know that Roman Catholicism has not changed. It still clings to tradition as tenaciously as ever. Its desire for supremacy is as great as ever. It still believes in persecuting and punishing heretics. It still believes in controlling the religion and controlling the consciences of men. Everything is as it seeks to establish the foundation of its religion by civil government, and only when it lacks the power does it fail to assert the sword and press upon the people the ceremonies of its ritual and the prospect of its clergy.

The conclusion is therefore inevitable that it is the Protestant who has changed. The only line of common action which a professed Protestant could establish for himself and Catholics, as Christians, to join in, would be to become Catholic to Catholics, and foreign and destructive to true Protestantism. And such is the result in this case at least. Mr. Crafts has not only indorsed the papal theory of government, but is himself the exponent of it; he uses all his power to establish that which would build up the Papacy; the very, very thing. That theory is the theocratic theory, in which God is declared to be the ruler. But the declaration is a lie; for God is simply not to be the ruler; men do all the legislating, and not what God said; God would not and has not done, but take it upon themselves to say in advance what He would require, what belongs only to him, and make out punishments which He has never said anything about the inflicting. The result is the papal theory of government. It is the pope's theory of government.

The same theory is described in 2 Thessalonians, second chapter, under three terms; "the man of sin," "Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshiped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God."

That papal theory maintains that the "true faith" should be established, protected and enforced by law. Mr. Crafts and the National Reform Association hold the same. They plainly claim the right of the Church to say what men shall believe, and to oblige the State to punish, imprison, and fine all those who refuse to conform to the faith prescribed. They establish the "true faith," and they call upon the State to enforce it, under the same theory. They hold that all forms of religion contrary to these are a pestilence of law to be rigorous enough to shut them up, barring off their religious ceremonies at best. That papal theory denies the right of the Federal and State Constitutions at best. Mr. Crafts upholds certain religious people whose rights, who are even now exercising this right. (See his "Sabbath for Man," page 459, edition 1886.)

That theory justifies persecution. Mr. Crafts holds that in enacting religious laws the will of the majority is always bound to all with the faith and practice of every individual. His "practical" Sunday policy is to "let the inquisitively inclined people alone into certain of their inalienable rights." The papacy teaches that the Church and State should join hands to enforce the law of God as appointed by the Church. So Mr. Crafts, in the *Christian Statesman*, of April, 1892, says, "This Nation or its States should stifle and abolish religious observance securing the fourth commandment, Sunday keeping;" the same also the Passion, etc.

This is sufficient. We need not further extend the line of parallels, but their inherent similarity must be apparent to all. That line of work to which Mr. Crafts is devoting his best energies is not a programme for the making of this country into a vestibule to the Papacy of the Old World. And what manner possesses the minds

would constitute an abridgment of the liberties which he would defend with his life, should the Catholic attempt to make his conformity to the ritual law and the peculiar rites of the Catholic Church, still it would attempt the same abridgment of the liberties of the apostle or the heretic, to some extent, by making him conform to the peculiar observance of the church, to whomever else it may offend.

"If the church, as a whole, has a right to enforce the observance of Sunday, the Catholic Church has the right to ask for the enforced observance of Lent and other of its fast days, say the most hot-headed advocates of enforced Sunday observance would reply, 'that is an absurd comparison; you deny that, you admit that in absolute conformity to Roman Catholic customs, strict observance of Sunday, and your general complaint essentially, is something which, when used against you, you are pleased to call persecution.'

"These facts are commended to the attention of all Christians. They are not written in argumentative vein, but our understanding of facts they are unassailed by no one. They are written from no unfriendly attitude to a church, but one who believes in protecting his liberties by protecting those of others."
