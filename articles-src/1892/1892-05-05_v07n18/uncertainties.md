# Uncertainties - Volume 7, Number 18 (1892-05-05)

## General OCR Quality
The OCR quality of this issue was generally good, with most text clearly readable. A few minor uncertainties are noted below.

## Specific Uncertainties

### Page 1
- Line 9: "Perjuration" appears in the motto - this may be "Persuasion" in the original, but OCR quality makes this uncertain. The standard Jefferson quote uses "Persuasion."
- Line 363: "BORN ST." appears to be an OCR error for "BOND ST."

### Page 4
- Line 201: "billwd" appears to be an OCR error, likely "bill of" or similar

### Page 6
- Line 351: "J-ems Christ" appears to be an OCR error for "Jesus Christ"
- Line 359: "liow-citizens" appears to be an OCR error for "fellow-citizens"
- Line 369: "TREASURY" may be "TREASURER"
- Line 374: "Best-day League" appears where context suggests "Rest-day League"

### Page 8
- Line 527: "Adventist" appears where "Adventists" may have been intended (though singular form is also plausible given context)

## Notes
Most uncertainties in this issue are minor OCR errors that do not affect the substantive content of the articles. The transcription preserves the text as it appears in the OCR, with substantive content intact.
