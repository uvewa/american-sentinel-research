# Uncertainties - American Sentinel, May 5, 1892 (v07n18)

## General Note

The scan quality for this issue is quite poor, with small, dense text that is difficult to read with confidence in many places. Multiple articles contain passages where individual words and phrases could not be reliably determined. The transcriptions represent best-effort readings based on context, letter shapes, and surrounding text.

## Article 01: The Christian Statesman on the Grant Case

### Page 1, Column 1-2 (block quote from Our Country)
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** "How long do the American people mean to stand and hold together comfortable with their civil institutions?"
- **Confidence:** LOW - The exact wording of this quote is difficult to read; several words may be slightly different
- **Reason:** Small type in the quoted block; letter shapes suggest this reading

### Page 1, Column 2 (continuity across column break)
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** "The divorce has been recognized as valid by the civil courts, but the Catholic Church at Bridgeport would not recognize it"

## Article 02: What It Means

## Article 03: Protestant Preachers and the World's Fair

### General
