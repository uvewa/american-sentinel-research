COMPULSORY compliance to a church dogma does not and can not make converts to that church, but it may be well shown that the effect would be to establish compulsory observance. That is a truth rarely questioned; but it is not now the force of the case, the principle is wrong. Second and third will follow, and third will follow a law of the Government, carried at compulsory observance of a law. The law of the Government, carried in the letter, is that all shall have permission to worship God according to the dictates of the conscience. Without any law shall be enacted establishing any religion, or prohibiting the free exercise of religion and government shall be limited to civil law.

For one person to make the government act upon the rights of the others is wrong.

Government was created to protect its citizens with the liberties they enjoy, and therefore it would be the pleasure of any individual; and we appeal to all civil law, universal answer, and appeal to civil law.

In reply to the same query, B. C. R. Wylie, of the National Reform Association.

This most convinces the masses of the people.
