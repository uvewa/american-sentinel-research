Some paragraphs in the last issue of THE SENTINEL narrated the attention which the United States Government gave to the observance of Good Friday. The Christian Statesman has discovered an additional item to be added to those previously noted. It says: "Our Government celebrated Good Friday as a Christian Nation, by paying $25,000 to Italy as a voluntary indemnity to be divided among the families of the lynched Italians of New Orleans." Railroads, and other wicked corporations which carry on their business on Sunday, are accustomed to pay about the same price for a life which the Government has here awarded; perhaps if these corporations would wait until Good Friday to make such payments the Statesman might dub them "Christian corporations."
