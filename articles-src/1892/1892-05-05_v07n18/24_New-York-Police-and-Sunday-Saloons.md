The new broom of the New York police department seems to be devoting its attention almost entirely to sweeping out Sunday saloons. That is an evidence of insincerity to begin with. Sunday laws are themselves a hypocritical cloak, and their enforcement is everywhere made a false show of zeal in the interests of good order in a community. The Sun very truly says:—

Perhaps more liquor saloons than usual were really closed last Sunday, and the number of arrests for the violation of the Sunday-closing law was somewhat greater than the average. If such was the case, the experience of the past has simply been repeated. When Mr. Hewitt was Mayor the law was enforced for several successive Sundays with even more rigor, and under every municipal administration for a long time past there have been comparatively dry Sundays, when the station houses received many bar-keepers who had been caught in dispensing beer and whiskey, or decoyed by detectives into violation of the law. For years past the Grand Jury has spent a large part of its time in investigating these cases, and thousands of indictments have been brought against the accused. Meanwhile the business of Sunday liquor selling and liquor drinking has gone on the same as ever.

The spasmodic efforts to enforce the prohibition occur at intervals which seem to follow a law of periodicity, and the number of dry and of wet Sundays is about the same from year to year.

What a farce it all is! And why is it such a farce?—Because all concerns d take the hypocritical auction to their souls that it is the enforcement of Sunday observance; and there is not a drunkard less for it all; while Satan laughs on.
