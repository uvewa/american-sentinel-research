THE following is an editorial item from the World:—

It is said that in Chicago, while the Sabbatarians are working vigorously to secure the closing of the Exposition on Sundays, the saloon keepers and proprietors of the Sunday pleasure resorts are, from shrewd calculations of interest, hoping that they may succeed.

The view taken of the situation is that if Chicago is entertaining a hundred thousand or more of strangers bent on sight-seeing, and the great attraction for sight-seers is closed on Sunday, the harvest will be reaped by the other attractions. The saloons in Chicago are closed as tightly on Sunday as those of New York or St. Louis, and it is as hard to get in—by the front door. It is believed that if the hundred thousand sight-seekers are excluded from the Exposition a large and profitable side door and "summer-resort" business may be counted on.

We do not know how accurate the Chicago saloon keepers are in their forecast of the results of Sunday closing as applied to the Exposition, but there is no doubt that in some way it would cause a great deal more Sabbath-breaking than it would prevent.

The promoters of enforced Sunday closing ought to give this some thought, and then ask themselves whether it is really in the interest of civil order or of a false idea of the advancement of a religious observance that they are working.
