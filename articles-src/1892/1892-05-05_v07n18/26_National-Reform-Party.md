UNDER "Temperance Notes," the Christian Statesman, of April 16, has this paragraph:—

ANOTHER WAY.—The National Reform Party will call a convention one day earlier than the Prohibition Party's convention, and will put in prohibition and woman suffrage, the admission of which would have united at St. Louis the reform forces of the country, and with an aggressive policy on economic questions will seek union with the Prohibition Party."

So there is such a political party as the "National Reform Party." Let this proposed coalition be made, and there is no question but that not more than one presidential term would intervene before such a party would hold the balance of political power and dictate its own terms. This it would be perfectly ready to do, because it would be entirely conscienceless as to what interests it sacrificed so long as it gained its own ends; it would have no choice as to which political party it sold itself to, so long as it received unqualified pledges that its own policy of religious legislation and paternal rule should be carried out.
