It seems that New York is not the only State in which public funds are diverted from their legitimate channels and into the coffers of denominational institutions. The following facts, taken from a circular letter sent out by C. B. Waite, President of the American Secular Union, show that the evil has attained considerable proportions in Illinois:

Section 3 of Article VIII. of the Constitution of Illinois reads as follows:

"Neither the General Assembly, nor any county, city, town, township, school district, or other corporation, shall ever make any appropriation, or pay from any public fund whatever, anything in aid of any church or sectarian purpose, or to help support or sustain any school, academy, seminary, college, university, or other literary or scientific institution, controlled by any church or sectarian denomination whatever; nor shall any grant or donation of land, money, or other personal property ever be made by the State, or any such public corporation, to any church for any sectarian purpose."

In an act of the Legislature, which went into effect May 28th, 1879, provision was made for incorporating industrial schools for girls. This act provided for the commitment of dependent girls by the county court of any county to any industrial school for girls which might have been organized under that act, and authorizes and requires the county to pay the industrial school for the tuition, maintenance, and care of such dependent girls.

Under this act a school was organized called "The Chicago Industrial School for Girls." Various commitments were made to this institution. But the "Chicago Industrial School for Girls" had no buildings or any means for furnishing the girls either tuition, maintenance, or care. The institution existed only on paper.

It received, however, nominally, all the girls committed, but immediately sent them to two Catholic institutions, the "House of the Good Shepherd," and "St. Joseph's Orphan Asylum." In fact, the Chicago institution was a mere feeder for the other two, seven of the nine directors and incorporators being Sisters of the Good Shepherd.

In the spring and summer of 1886, the county of Cook paid to these two institutions $2,314.34, it being admitted on the face of the bills rendered by the "Chicago Industrial School for Girls" that the tuition, etc., and clothing for which the money was paid, had been furnished entirely by the two Catholic institutions.

About this time some good Protestants, having some regard for the Constitution of the State, must have demurred, because the next billwd the kind which were presented, the county refused to pay. The "Chicago Industrial School for Girls" brought suit. The case was tried before Judge Tuthill, and judgment rendered for the Chicago School. The county took the case to the Supreme Court.

The decision of the Supreme Court of the State will be found at page 540 of the 133th volume of the Illinois Reports.

The Supreme Court revowed the decision, holding that the Constitution had been plainly violated in paying money to the two Catholic institutions; that it was the duty of the State to provide for the dependent girls, and the State had no right to turn them over to sectarian institutions. The court decided also that the fact that the doctrines of a particular church were taught, and that all exercises of a religious character were those of said church, would render the institution sectarian, within the meaning of the Constitution.

In the face of this decision, and in the face of the Constitution, the county is still appropriating money to sectarian institutions. And the Commissioners do not even best about the truth, as they did before the decision was made, but in open and shameless disregard of the Constitution, and in open defiance of the authority of the Supreme Court, they appropriate the money of the people directly to sectarian schools.

The decision was made in 1888, and published in the reports in 1889.

In 1890, the Board of County Commissioners appropriated $40,000; in 1891, $45,000; and in 1892, $45,000.

This sum was distributed as follows:

To the St. Mary's Training School for Boys, at Feslaurville, $13,500; to the Illinois Training School for Boys, at Glenwood, $12,500; to the Chicago Industrial School for Girls, $8,000; and to the Illinois Industrial School for Girls, at Evanston, $12,000.

Of these, the first and the third are well known to be Catholic institutions. The other two, though not under the ostensible control of any Protestant sect, are yet Protestant institutions to all intents and purposes. They have Protestant prayers, Protestant Sabbath schools and Protestant teachings.

Sufficient evidence that they are sectarian institutions of a Protestant character, is found in the fact that their managers consent so readily to the appropriations for the Catholic schools. How is it that there were no complaints and expectations, such as there were in 1886 and 1887 against the misappropriation of the public funds, in violation of the Constitution?—Because they get a share of the public plunder. It is an unholy religious alliance for the purpose of robbing the people and depleting the public treasury in disregard of all the supposed safeguards of the Constitution.

Some two years ago, the Secular Union took the matter up, and had a bill in chancery filed for an injunction to prevent funds being paid to the Feslaurville school. That case is now pending in the Supreme Court of Illinois.

All opposed to a union of Church and State—all opposed to pious frauds of every description, and especially all opposed to open violations of the Constitution, in the supposed interests of religion or of education, are called upon to assist in putting a stop to such practices.
