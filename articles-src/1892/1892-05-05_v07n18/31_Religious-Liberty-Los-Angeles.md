We have been frequently solicited of late to open the columns of the Los Angeles Churchman to the appeals and efforts of the Sunday-law party, going under the name of the "American Sabbath Union."

We wish it distinctly understood, and take this opportunity of saying, that we are of the opinion that the principles, methods, and end sought to be gained by the American Sabbath Union are unchristian, un-American, and illiberal, and we are therefore, not neutral on the question, but decidedly and actively opposed to Sunday laws, or any other religious laws, in the State of California or in the United States.

We do not question the honesty, sincerity, devotion and zeal of those who are now so actively engaged in this Sunday-law campaign, but we believe it to be a "zeal without knowledge," which, should it be permitted to prevail, would work infinite harm both to our country and to the Christian faith. To further emphasize our opinions we print copious extracts from THE AMERICAN SENTINEL on this question, and would advise all persons who are thoughtlessly, or otherwise, taking part in this movement, to pause and consider the other side of the question, as set forth by the National Religious Liberty Association, with offices in various parts of the country, of which THE AMERICAN SENTINEL is the organ. Write to 43 Bond St., New York, for a sample copy of THE AMERICAN SENTINEL.
