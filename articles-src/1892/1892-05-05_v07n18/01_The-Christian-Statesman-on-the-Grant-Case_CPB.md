THE *Christian Statesman* has not yet explained how it can consistently advocate Sunday while denouncing the boycotting Sunday papers. There are a good many people who would like to understand the process of this reasoning.

We are reminded by a recent article in the *Statesman* of the husband who determined to whip his wife. If, on reaching home, he found her in, he would whip her for not being in bed; if he found her in bed, he would whip her for not being up. This is about the attitude of our Boston contemporary toward the Roman Catholic Church.

In the past, Protestants have justly complained of Rome because she refused to recognize the validity of Protestant marriages. Now, *Our Country*, which, if not truly Protestant, is, at least, intensely anti-Italian Catholic, complains bitterly because the College of the Propaganda at Rome has decided that a Protestant marriage performed by a Methodist minister was valid.

The facts which constitute the ground of our Boston contemporary's complaint are stated by that paper substantially as follows:---

Some years ago Mr. William Grant, of Connecticut, married Celia Brosnan. Mrs. Grant was an Irish Catholic woman by a Methodist clergyman. Subsequently to the marriage, Mr. Grant joined the Catholic Church, and still later, under the laws, and in the Courts of Connecticut, he was granted an absolute divorce, and afterward was legally married. The divorce has been recognized as valid by the civil courts, but the Catholic Church at Bridgeport would not recognize it, and Mr. Grant applied for an ecclesiastical divorce, on the ground that a Methodist marriage was not recognized by the Catholic Church. For four years the case dragged along in the courts of the church, when last summer the case was decided by the Hartford diocesan court. The case later was appealed to the arch-episcopal tribunal in Rome, which reversed the Hartford decision. The case has then been taken to Rome, and the decision is that the first marriage, celebrated by the Methodist minister, was valid.

On the strength of these facts, *Our Country* says:---

> How long do the American people mean to stand and hold together comfortable with their civil institutions? If the American people do not present themselves to the papal church their sovereignty, their honor, and their rights, and make whatever follows passage through the northernmost of the Roman State, then something awful will have to be done, and done promptly.

This is unquestionably foolish under the circumstances. To us it seems that this was a very proper decision. The marriage contract was entered into in good faith, and was for years recognized by both the State and the church,---by Protestants and by Catholics; and how could the authorities at Rome hold that the ceremony was not valid? Evidently they could not; but that was the only question before them; and the decision does not, as *Our Country* insists, "furnish another proof of the Pope's claim of supremacy over civil governments." It is true that the Pope makes that claim, but there is absolutely nothing in this case to show it.

The decision in this case says nothing of the civil status of the marriage at all; it is simply to the effect that according to the faith, rules, and usages of the Roman Catholic Church, Mr. Grant was married to the woman from whom he was divorced by the civil law; and that, as the Catholic Church does not sanction divorce, the former Mrs. Grant, or Mrs. Evans, is married still in the eyes of the Church; and consequently, that he is now living with his second wife, not in holy wedlock, but in adultery; and that so long as his Church is concerned, he is not entitled to receive from Catholic priests the sacraments of the Catholic Church. The decision is one that can not be properly assailed on the ground that it is in opposition to the laws of the State. The church can not in such a thing be governed by State laws, any more than the State can be governed by church laws.

To make this matter more plain, let us suppose that a member of the Methodist Church wishes to sell intoxicating liquors. He knows that it is contrary to the laws of the Methodist Church, but he is very anxious to engage in the business; and so secures a license under the laws of the State. Is he thus to defy the church? The church grants him no privilege, and you dare not discipline him, for that would be to array the authority of the church against that of the State. The church would very properly say, We can not take our rule of discipline from the State; we have nothing to do with the State, except as individuals to share with other citizens the burdens and benefits incident to civil government. As a church we recognize no authority but the great Head of the Church, Jesus Christ; his law alone is our rule; and as we believe that liquor selling is in violation of that law, we can not fellowship you in that pursuit, even if you have a license from the State.

This hypothetical case is exactly parallel with the Grant case. A man secures a divorce in accordance with the laws of the State, and then marries again in violation of the laws of the church of which he is a member. A church, whether Catholic or Protestant, has a perfect right to enforce its rules by withholding the sacraments; or as we Protestants say, by withdrawing the hand of fellowship; and no one should complain. As a church, Catholics have a right to discipline their members for acts which, according to the civil law, are perfectly proper. Our *Country* ought to temper its zeal with knowledge.
