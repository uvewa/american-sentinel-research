SOME weeks ago we published the fact that five of the leading members of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, at Springville, Tennessee, had been indicted for Sunday work, and that they were liable to be arrested at any time. The following letter which we reprint from the Review and Herald, the Seventh-day Adventist Church paper, published at Battle Creek, Michigan, explains the situation as it is at present; also the probabilities in the case:

Springville, Tenn., April 13, 1892.

A. O. Tait, Battle Creek, Mich.

DEAR BROTHER: Yours of March 27, was received some time ago, and you requested that I should let you know all of the particulars in regard to the arrests made here for Sunday labor. Since my last writing, other facts have come to light. One of our neighbors was at the county-seat on business, and the State's attorney came in and asked him if he lived in the Advent community. He replied that he did. The attorney asked, "Do they keep up their Sunday work?" He answered, "Yes, and none of the Adventist will deny it."

Then the attorney requested him to give him the names of five of the leading church-members, which he did. The State's attorney said he had heard the circuit judge, Judge Swiggart, say he was going to put a stop to that Sunday desecration.

So the five warrants were issued, and are in the sheriff's hands. But it seems that he has understood that we will not give bonds, and so will wait until court sits, which will be the fourth Monday in May. These are the facts in the case. I will write again as soon as there are further developments.

Your brother in the one faith,

J. MOON.

The place, where the work complained of is done, is in a retired country neighborhood, about two miles from the village of Springville.
