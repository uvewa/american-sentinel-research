The Washtenaw Times, the only daily of Ann Arbor, Mich., has the following in an article on the Sunday closing of the World's Fair:—

"There are some questions of right and wrong which are universally admitted by intelligent beings. That it is wrong to steal is easy of comprehension because it is easy to make a personal application and by that discover that you wish your own property protected. Murder would be wrong because if it was right for you to murder John it would be right for John to murder you. The social crimes can be proved wrong to any one by bringing the application to his own home, which he would be zealous to protect. All those parts of our jurisprudence which relate to the protection of men in their personal and property rights are capable of easy demonstration on the most easy basis, that of selfish interests, for a man can not expect a community to protect him from the encroachments of his neighbors unless he is at the same time compelled to respect the rights of others.

"Right and wrong as applied to government are purely relative terms and have arisen entirely from the relations which men bear to each other in communities.

"The object of all laws should be the protection of the liberties of the individual to which he would be entitled if he were absolutely alone from the encroachment of others when he is associated with them in communities. No liberty should be denied the individual which would be his natural right, unless it encroaches upon the liberties of others. This will not be denied by any intelligent man, nor will any intelligent man deny that the personal liberty of the individual should be curtailed the moment it encroaches upon the liberties of another or a community.

"For this reason no matters of abstract right and wrong should be touched upon by law, further than to guarantee liberty of belief to each and every individual, and further, guarantee him the right to the practice of that belief, so long as it does not interfere with the liberties of others. An abstract right or wrong is one which can not be demonstrated in a material manner, or one which exists entirely in the mind. All religions are such. They are simply beliefs, and as long as there is no absolute material evidence, they must always remain such. There are many millions of intelligent men and women to-day to whom the evidences have been sufficient to prove the truth of the Christian religion. There are also many millions of intelligent men and women to-day to whom the evidences have not been sufficiently strong to induce such a belief. There is no absolute proof of its truth, and its strongest point is faith, which is the best argument which can be produced to show that its proofs are not absolute. The Christian church is itself divided into a number of minor beliefs which conflict with each other on points of vital importance. The follower of each sect believes fully in the interpretation of his particular branch, and yet the proofs are not absolute or there would be no such division.

"The difference between the Protestant and the agnostic is no more marked than the difference between the Protestant and Catholic, and yet while the Protestant would consider it an abridgment of his liberties which he would defend with his life, should the Catholic attempt to make him conform to all the fast days and other peculiar rites of the Catholic Church, still he would attempt the same abridgment of the liberties of the agnostic or the believer in some other faith by making him conform to the peculiar observance of the church, to whose creed he is a subscriber.

"If the church, as a whole, has a right to enforce the observance of Sunday, the Catholic Church has the right to ask for the enforced observance of Lent and other of its fast days, and the most hot-headed advocate of enforced Sunday observance will deny that. But, gentlemen, when you deny that, you admit that in absolute justice you have no right to enforce the strict observance of Sunday, and your only remaining argument is strength, which, when used against you, you are pleased to call persecution.

"These facts are commended to the careful perusal of all. They are not written in an argumentative vein, but are simply statements of facts which can be gainsaid by no one. They are written from the standpoint of a church member, but one who believes in protecting his liberties by protecting those of others."
