The Catholic Universe says:—

Rev. Wilbur F. Crafts, the senior editor of the Christian Statesman, Pittsburg, evidently does all within his power to establish lines of common action in which Catholics and Protestants as Christians and Americans can join. It is a worthy programme, and our best wishes to our good friend in it.

Mr. Crafts quotes this in his paper evidently as a compliment. He may so consider it, but we ask, Is it? He professes to be a Protestant; but a true Protestant is one who protests against the errors, corruptions, and false doctrines of the Papal Church. Such was the origin of the term. The term grew out of the great Reformation of the sixteenth century, when the Christian princes of Germany at the diet of Spices, drew up a protest against the persistent efforts of the Romanists to stop the further progress of the Reformation, re-establish the papal hierarchy, and deny to all the freedom of speech and liberty of conscience in religious matters. They declared their adherence to the holy Scriptures as "the sure rule of all doctrine and life," and this "without anything added thereto." This protest gave the reformers the name of Protestants, and its principles are the very essence of Protestantism.

But Mr. Crafts, with not a few others, is doing his utmost to establish lines of common action between the two bodies. The adherents to the Papacy evidently have an eye on him, approve his "worthy (?) programme," and to all appearances consider him a very dutiful (grand) son. But what does this mean, that Catholicism can call a professed Protestant "our good friend," and extend to him its "best wishes"? It must mean one of two things; either that Catholicism has changed, or that the Protestant has ceased to protest and is a Protestant only in name. Which is it?

All know that Roman Catholicism has not changed. It still clings to tradition as tenaciously as ever. Its desire for supremacy is as great as ever. It still believes in persecuting and punishing heretics, and in dictating the religious belief and controlling the consciences of men. Everywhere it seeks to establish itself in government, and only where it lacks the power does it fail to assert its sway and enforce upon the people the ceremonies of its ritual and the support of its clergy.

The conclusion is therefore inevitable that it is the Protestant who has changed. The only line of common action which a professed Protestant could establish for himself and Catholics, as Christians, to join in, would be one common to Catholicism, and foreign and destructive to true Protestantism. And such is the fact in the case in hand. Mr. Crafts has not only indorsed the papal theory of government, but, as the Catholic Universe says, is doing all in his power to establish that which can be nothing more nor less than this very thing. That theory is the theocratic theory, or one in which God is declared to be the ruler. But the declaration is a lie, for God is simply said to be the ruler, while men do all the legislating, and not only tell what God wants done and what not done, but take it upon themselves to arm themselves with the vengeance which belongs only to him, and mete out punishment to whomever they declare has offended the Most High. This is the papal theory of government. It is simply the putting of man in the place of God, and is well described in 2 Thessalonians, second chapter, where the apostle, speaking of the man of sin, says: "Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshiped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God."

The papal theory maintains that the "true faith" should be established, protected and enforced by law. Mr. Crafts and the National Reform Association hold the same. That theory claims the right of the Church to say what men shall believe, and to dictate to the State what punishment shall be meted out to those who refuse to conform to the faith prescribed. Mr. Crafts and National Reformers advocate the same theory. They hold that all men should be compelled under pains and penalties of law to be religious enough to keep Sunday, the badge of their religion, at least. The papal theory denies the right of the freedom of speech and the press. Mr. Crafts upbraids certain religious people with whom he differs, for exercising this right. (See his "Sabbath for Man," page 262, edition 1885). This theory justifies religious persecution. Mr. Crafts holds that in enacting religious laws, which conflict (as all such laws are bound to do) with the faith and practice of sons, "the only constitutional or sensible policy is to "let the insignificantly small minority . . . suffer the loss" of certain of their inalienable rights.—Ib. The papal theory is that Church and State should join hands to enforce the law of God as interpreted by the Church. So, in the Christian Statesman, of April 2, 1892, Mr. Crafts says: "The Nation and patriotism should strike hands with religion in securing obedience to the fourth commandment," which he interprets as teaching Sunday keeping, as does also the Papacy.

This is sufficient. We need not further extend the list of parallels. The likeness must be apparent to all. That line of work to which Mr. Crafts is devoting his best energies is but a programme for the making in this country of a veritable image to the Papacy of the Old World. And as Paul foresaw the rise of the one, so the Apostle John on the Isle of Patmos foresaw the formation of the other. (Rev. 13: 11-18) Carried down past the time when the Papacy was to receive its deadly wound (the taking of the Pope prisoner by the French army in 1798), he heard certain ones "saying to them that dwell upon the earth, that they should make an image to the beast, which had the wound by the sword, and did live." To him it was future. To us it is a living reality. But no true Protestant can join in any such movement, nor bow the knee to any such image when it is made. Like the German princes they will still protest, and like the loyal captives of Judah before the image which Nebuchadnezzar erected in the plain of Dura, they will not bow down though death stare them in the face. There is still need for the spirit of true Protestantism to be aroused, and that its voice should be heard in the land. The forces of evil are abroad, spying out the liberties of the people; the conflict between truth and error is not yet ended; there are still wolves in sheep's clothing. Loyalty to God and the right only will meet divine approval and win an immortal crown.
