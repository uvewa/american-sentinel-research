A FOREIGN correspondent of the New York Observer gives in that paper of the 14th inst., the particulars of the persecution in Aveiro, Portugal, of Fernando Francisco Bichao, now undergoing imprisonment "for the crime of refusing to remove his cap to a naked cross carried at a funeral two years ago."

Two appeals were taken in the case. The first appeal was to the court at Oporto, which quashed the sentence on the ground that there was no evidence of any intention to insult the State religion. The other appeal was taken by the prosecutors from the decision of the Oporto court, to the Supreme Tribunal at Lisbon, and here the original sentence was affirmed.

The action of the Lisbon court was on the ground that the intent to insult the State religion was sufficiently proved by the fact that the prisoner knowingly refused to remove his cap. On this point the Observer's correspondent remarks: "So they deliberately ignored the article of the Constitution that provides that no one shall be persecuted on account of his religion."

This action of the Lisbon court is very similar to certain decisions by American courts in Sunday cases. The Lisbon court would of course say that Bichao is not persecuted, but prosecuted, not for his religion, but for his insult to the religion of others. It was thus that Judge Hammond held in the case of R. M. King, of Tennessee. The Judge said: --

Sectarian freedom of religious belief is guaranteed by the Constitution, not in the sense argued here, that King as a Seventh-day Adventist, or some other as a Jew, or yet another as a Seventh-day Baptist, might set at defiance the prejudices, if you please, of other sects having control of legislation in the matter of Sunday observances, but only in the sense that he should not himself be disturbed in the practices of his creed. We do not say Sunday observance may be compelled upon this principle, as a religious act, but that the constitutional guaranty of religious freedom does not afford the measure of duty under such circumstances, nor does it any more, it seems to us, protect the citizen in refusing to conform to Sunday ordinances. --

By a sort of factitious advantage, the observers of Sunday have secured the aid of the civil law, and adhere to that advantage with great tenacity, in spite of the clamor for religious freedom, and the progress that has been made in the absolute separation of Church and State. . . . Sunday observance is so essentially a part of that religion that it is impossible to rid our laws of it. . . . As to the non-observer, he can not be allowed his fullest personal freedom in all respects; largely he is allowed to do as he pleases, and generally there is no pursuit of him, in these days, as a mere matter of disciplining his conscience; but only when he defiantly sets up his non-observance by ostentatious display of his disrespect for the feelings or prejudices of others.

Judge Hammond's decision is an exact parallel to that of the Supreme Tribunal at Lisbon. But is such a decision any better in America than in Portugal? And if the Portugal decision violated the constitutional guarantee of religious liberty in that priest ridden country of the Old World, what shall we say of similar decisions by the courts of "free America"?
