RELIGIOUS persecution and bigotry are the worst in the world. They are without consideration or pity.—A. D. Vail, D. D.

"True enough," remarks a country paper, "but that need not trouble the United States of America." No, it need not trouble the United States were it not that, as Judge Hammond puts it, "by a sort of factitious advantage, the observers of Sunday have secured the aid of the civil law, and adhere to that advantage with great tenacity, in spite of the clamor for religious freedom, and in the progress that has been made in the absolute separation of Church and State."

And what is the result of this tenacious adherence to this "sort of factitious advantage," which the Sunday observers have secured by the aid of the civil law? Go for answer to the graves of R. M. King and W. Parker, hounded to death by the minions of an iniquitous Sunday law; inquire of the women and children left to be supported by charity while their natural protectors were suffering imprisonment for the "crime" of differing with their neighbors as to the particular day to be observed as the Sabbath; read the indictments even now hanging over the heads of honest, God-fearing men for daring to assert their God-given rights; and then say no more that the question of religious bigotry and persecution need not trouble the United States of America. True, this probably does not trouble those miserably pinched and pusillanimous souls who feel secure because they are on the popular side; but it will trouble the large hearted lover of liberty, whatever may be his religion.
