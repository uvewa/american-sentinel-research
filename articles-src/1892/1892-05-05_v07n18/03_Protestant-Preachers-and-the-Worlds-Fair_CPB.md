How unlimited impudence the series of resolutions adopted by the United Presbytery (Presbyterian) meeting of Pittsburgh, April 11th, exceeds any silly utterance of the promoters of enforced Sunday closing of the World's Fair, yet held publicly. This expression of the big Pittsburgh Presbyterian preachers has long before we received as a circular, so long as they could give it, for its last resolution provides that the entire "be sent through the country and as far as possible to the newspapers of the country." Every intelligent man should be willing to publish to the world such material evidence of extravagance as is contained in these resolutions in their entirety. The short expression of the manner of address of these Pittsburgh preachers to the local management of the World's Fair, if it come matter their very own, only one of two things,---their anger or excite their contempt. The men who hold the business management of the Exposition, or the officers of the Illinois corporation, that "having more than $10,000,000," and as most instances widely known, for its enterprise and push; doubtless they could not hold such a relation to this great enterprise as they do. These men are possessed of as keen and active a moral sense as the preachers and reformers of the community who have invested their money in the World's Fair to have any question full as much confidence in their own judgment and sense of right, as complete assurance of their honesty and worth, as they have in that of the presumptuous preachers who would patronize those twelve-folds. In fact it is known that these men have already secured the confidence of as many intelligent God-fearing old and young men, whom they may entrust their money for which their credit and financial interests are now involved to such large amounts. How absurdly the title "minister"---which being translated is "servant"---comes, who speak thus as having authority, as men superior to men in rights and dignity, and they are, "Count up and behold the man;" are we filled with such indignation and impatience! Surely an honest instead, wisdom, as to the management of the great enterprise of so vast moment to own a claim, may not be followed. At least such patronizing assumption always they burst forth into denunciatory resolutions. It is the language of sovereigns of God, or rulers of the State and kings of finance. What manner possesses the

brains of these preachers? Is it that last conceit which makes the person think that he is the chief instrument of the destroyer? and it is the expression of that very pride by which Satan fell. The humility and calm-minded simplicity of him who shall finally survive and walk, knowing that the portion of his labor is in the hand of the Master, is not to be found in these resolutions. The "witness" upon which they upon made "good."

Moreover, The Columbian Commission, as we understand, has a law department that may overlook the very eve of the Fair the evil effects of this, and on the other hand the opponents of making it opposition, as being injurious to them in a big way, by withdrawing from the Exhibition there.

What means such a tone as this? Have the right to anticipate or postpone the consideration of this question three times, or so many times as they see fit? And if they have postponed their decision of this matter to the very eve of the Fair is a proper, and that "self-evident" self-respect should be affirmed, these preachers, in their right minds, would feel that faithful to they and their followers had been very freely claiming the laws of this country and entering into an unchristian convention, and the "self-evident" rights and civil privileges of their fellow-citizens.

These "Christian" preachers define their postponement as an "attempt to deceive" against "justice," "a serious trifling" with the rights of a very large class of American citizens; and ask "a reconsideration of the postponement and an immediate and unequivocal decision of the question." This is self-righteous to a great measure, of the World's Fair Commission called by order at the preachers of Pittsburgh. Can anything fill such minds? The troubled brethren continue, however, that if the call can not succeed with the National Commission "it" should be restored as "the original purpose and ultimate direction of a cowardly compromise or otherwise," a congressional committee, "courage" to such an extent as to become "withdraw our patronage and the preachers and their friends from the Fair in that regard." The whole complaining the World's Fair management is held up on the one grand point of the clergy and Congress asked to preserve its natural right. A more presumptuous attempt!

The resolution is not only filled with the involved details of a system, among others it is urged upon all general assemblies, governments, conferences, and upon all religious organizations, the religious "Organize the attendance of delegates from all conventions and churches, to the end that they may accomplish towards one and the other not to sell or shut such a fee of the time by exhibition or attendance."

To their unintelligent insistence towards the World's Fair management on this, big preachers have added conspiracy.
