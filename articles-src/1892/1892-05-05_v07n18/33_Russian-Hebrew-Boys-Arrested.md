SEVERAL Russian Hebrew boys, all under sixteen years of age, were arrested in Central Park, on a recent Sunday, for selling lozenges. They spent the night in cells, and were arraigned in a police court the next day for violation of the Sunday law. Louis Sevatchman, thirteen years old, spoke for the crowd. He said he was the oldest of seven children. He had attended school eight years. The boys were all discharged with a caution not to again offend against the majesty of the law and the sacredness of Sunday.
