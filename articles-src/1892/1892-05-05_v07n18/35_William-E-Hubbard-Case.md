THE dailies of the 27th ult. published the following dispatch:—

Chestertown, Md., April 26.—William E. Hubbard, son of John E. Hubbard, of Tolchester, is in jail here for contempt of court in refusing to testify on Saturday in a case brought by his father against another man. When called to the stand he said:—

"Judge, it is no use to swear me; I will not testify. To-day is my Sabbath day, and although I know the Bible says, 'obey those in authority over you,' Peter says, 'obey God rather than man,' and as this is my Sabbath I refuse to be sworn."

"Well," said the Judge, "I have been on the bench twenty-four years and I have never had a case of this kind, and, however true your quotation of Peter may be, the law says that we shall observe but one day as the Sabbath, and that is the day commonly called Sunday, and sir, you must either testify or go to jail."

The young man still refused, and went to jail. He is a Seventh-day Adventist.

It is very generally claimed in defense of Sunday laws that they do not prevent the keeping of another day by those who wish to do so. But according to this Judge, the law of Maryland "says that we shall observe but one day as the Sabbath, and that is the day commonly called Sunday." It is true that the law of Maryland does not say this in so many words, but that is about what Sunday laws mean whether in Maryland or anywhere else.

The young man did right in adhering to the principle stated in Acts 5:29. The Judge showed himself a fit administrator of an intolerant law.
