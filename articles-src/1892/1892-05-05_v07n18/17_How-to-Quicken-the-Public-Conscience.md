The "Pearl of Days," for April 9, contains answers from several ministers to the question, "What means should be relied upon in the present crisis to quicken the public conscience throughout our country in regard to the proper observance of the Sabbath?"

In reply to this query, Rev. Lee M. Heilman says:--

Conscience in its nature and functions has supreme reference to the great cause of all things, and hence to excite it to adequate sensibility means must be employed which will touch it from the side of that first cause, or God. That monitor must be quickened with facts and truth of divine authority, and of the inborn need of highest welfare. Any agencies that disseminate these strong and self-evident facts, as they meet human want, will awaken conscience. But the "public conscience" is reached by the ordained witness for God and truth, viz., the believer. In a Christian land, a land of churches, this becomes preeminently a duty. Our reliance, then, must be upon the word and Spirit of the God of prayer. The Church has the responsibility, but not the sense of it; the power, but not the motive and grace.

With this answer no reasonable fault can be found; and were not the essential elements mentioned in it entirely lacking, it would be the practically accepted and universal answer, and appeal to civil law would not be made.

In reply to the same query, Rev. R. C. Wylie, of the National Reform Association, says:--

1. We must convince the masses of the people that the Sabbath is of divine appointment and is a permanent institution. There will be no conscience in this matter at all if the idea of divine authority is omitted.

2. It must be made clear that the Sabbath law is binding in social, business, and political circles. It must be shown that the Sabbath has a civil, as well as an individual, a family, and an ecclesiastical side.

3. It must be shown that the Sabbath law can not be violated with impunity. The penalty may be delayed, but it is sure to come. If falls on the individual in the form of premature death; on business in a variety of forms; on the Nation in the form of public vice, divine judgments, national overthrow.

Mr. Wylie's first, is in effect the same as Mr. Heilman's answer. It is that to awaken the conscience appeal must be made to the law of God. Did he stop here his answer would be commendable; but seeing evidently the impossibility of connecting divine authority with Sunday, the Sabbath which Mr. Wylie had in mind, he departs from the real question and adroitly introduces another feature, namely, how can men be forced to keep Sunday? This he intimates can be accomplished by means of the "civil Sabbath," or as he puts it, by showing that "the Sabbath has a civil side;" by which he means, that men must be shown that by the civil law they can be required to treat Sunday as though it were the divinely ordained Sabbath.

But it is in his fifth that Mr. Wylie plainly implies that he would quicken the conscience by civil law. He says: "It must be shown that the Sabbath law can not be violated with impunity." True he does not directly refer to civil penalties, but as they are inseparable from a "civil Sabbath," they are strongly implied.

But it is left to Rev. Henry Ostrum, Methodist, of Milwaukee, to depart wholly from the question and appeal wholly to the civil power. His answer in full is:—

1. Enforce existing State laws. Slighted laws in factories, schools, and homes destroy regard and create anarchy. The Sabbath is in danger of passing into the hands of just such anarchy.

2. Organize. But organization without a body-guard of conviction will be a bird's egg without a nest; therefore, let the organizer thoroughly start the campaign. Church work must not be counted on as an organization in this enterprise. The foe is definitely organized.

3. Greatly increase the number of organizers in the field.

4. Multiply short selections of literature on the subject.

5. Introduce a strong hymn, to be sung to a widely known air, and thus get the thousands singing about the Sabbath. Let this be a specialty in many languages at the World's Fair.

6. The laboring men are hoodwinked by their leaders. Let us meet them on their own ground.

7. And, finally, the great multitude of Church people "reading up" on the subject, and praying the inwrought prayer, will electrify the whole movement.

"Enforce existing State laws." How in the name of common sense could that quicken the conscience? It might make more people profess regard for Sunday, that is, it might, and certainly would, make hypocrites, but to say that it could reach the conscience is to assert that civil law stands on a par with divine law, and "is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart."

Mr. Ostrum's reply amounts to about this: Coerce people by civil law; secure convictions in the courts; get up an excitement; appeal to feeling; excite a frenzy; and finally the great multitude of church people will become alive to their duty, and, presto! the thing is done!

But Mr. Ostrum's "6" deserves special notice. If we are to believe Mr. Crafts and the American Sabbath Union, the laboring men are now very largely demanding the preservation of the "American Sabbath." Is this what Mr. Ostrum means by saying that they "are hoodwinked by their leaders"? Does he mean that they have been deceived into a support of Sunday observance? Probably not; he would hardly make such an admission. He must then wish to be understood as implying that the mass of the laboring men are opposed to Sunday laws, and that they have assumed this hostile attitude because they have been deceived by their leaders. But what then becomes of the gauzy structure reared upon the claim that the workingmen are demanding Sunday laws and Sunday-closing of about everything in order that they may not be forced to labor? It is thus that this Milwaukee preacher ruthlessly sweeps away some of Mr. Crafts' strongest reasons for the "civil Sabbath," namely, the demands of the "toiling masses," the cry of the tired workingmen, the moan of the weary overworked shop girl. The advocates of enforced Sunday observance should get together and agree upon their "indisputable facts" before they expect everybody to flock to their standard.
