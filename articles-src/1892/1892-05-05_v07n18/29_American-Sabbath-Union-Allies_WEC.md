Sioux City, Iowa, has, from the time the prohibitory law went into effect, been a persistent and open violator of the same, and all effort to suppress the open saloon has met with little success. It will be recalled that it was at this point that Rev. Mr. Haddock met his tragic death at the hands of the liquor element in his endeavor to secure the enforcement of the law. In fact, Sioux has long been regarded as the most "rough and ready" city east of the "Rockies." The present mayor was elected largely on the pledge, or with the understanding that he would strictly enforce the prohibitory law, and during the short time he has been in the chair, nearly every open saloon has been closed, and especially on Sundays. In fact, the Sunday closing of the saloons is what the saloon men complain of the most, and as a retaliatory act, they, with their sympathizers, recently met and organized a "Rest-day League," fully officers, the avowed object being to enforce to the letter the Sunday law, and thus make it so obnoxious that it will either be repealed, or, as in the past, become a dead letter. Of course this is clearly a case of malice aforethought, but they argue that what is "sauce for the goose is also sauce for the gander," and with this idea in view, Sunday, the 17th of April, was set for the initial step, and it was taken in dead earnest. Armed with warrants they began serving them on the street cars, then on drug stores, peanut stands, and in fact almost everywhere where there was a semblance of a violation of the law. When the work was fairly under headway, the news spread like wild fire, and it is stated that Sioux City never saw such a crowd, unless it was during the Corn Palace, as assembled at Fourth and Jackson Streets, where most of the arrests of the car men were made. About one hundred arrests are reported. The arrested were in about every instance conducted to one justice court, where after giving bonds for future appearance, they were turned loose. Many paid their fines the following day, but most of the cases were postponed.

Of course, public sentiment is largely against the movement, and the papers denounce it in unmeasured terms, but the prosecutors are not the least affected and aver that the "good work" will go on until Sioux City shall become the "model Sabbath-keeping city on the globe"! It is their intention, and was openly expressed, to enforce the law against livery stables, stores, factories, newspaper offices, news stands, and every other kind of business conducted on Sunday. "Why," they say, "we can 'cinch' the persons who sing in the church choirs for salaries under our law, and we shall do it." The work, they say, is but only begun, and if we may judge of future efforts by the occurrence of last Sunday, lively and exciting times may be expected, which an interested public will watch closely.
