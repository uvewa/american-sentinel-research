WE are reminded by a recent article in Our Country, of the story of the man who determined to whip his wife: If, on reaching home, he found her up, he would whip her for not being in bed; but if he found her in bed, he would whip her for not being up. This is about the attitude of our Boston contemporary toward the Roman Catholic Church.
