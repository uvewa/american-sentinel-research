# According to This Interpretation.

ACCORDING to this interpretation of the Supreme Court decision, the Methodist may practice the precepts of the Baptist sect, but if the Methodist should have control of legislation, they could oblige the Baptist by law to conform to the precepts of the Methodist creed! Or one company of people might be Methodist, another Baptist, another Quakers, and so on, but the dominant denomination having

control of legislation, and should enact laws enforcing Roman Catholic doctrines and precepts, then the Baptist, Methodist, Quakers, etc., would be obliged to conform to the Roman Catholic precepts. Herein is shown clearly how one would be protected in the unfaithful practice of their own religion while yet in their daily life would be in any wise of liberty to disregard the laws made in aid of the religion of the Roman Catholic sect! And such, in fact is the case in the courts; in the finding of religious belief guaranteed by the Constitution of Tennessee. And he is right.

The decision of the Supreme Court, as Rector of the Church of the Holy Trinity, etc., has stated that this Nation has always been a national religion; the first decree, under general government, of governmental appropriation, for a World's Fair, upon the condition that the act shall be paid, at that time and place, to be expected and distinctly, in legislative evidence, of the acceptance of that religion, which the Supreme Court has affirmed to be the national religion.

The Supreme Court has established a religion. Congress has legislated in the interests and in harmony with that established religion.

## UNITED STATES SENATORS.

UNITED STATES senators have learned that it is not wise to be led into the full enactment of the demands of the churches for the requirement of religious legislation, or to legislate further, as it applies to the domain of the churches for the requirement to whether Sunday is the Sabbath, and whether the observance of the Sunday can apply in other cases? Why shall not the same rule apply to Mormonism? Or to those who they can demand religious legislation? And why shall not Jews, and the Seventhday people are aliens when they are asked to rest in accordance with the wishes of their church members; and, of course, in no particular because they themselves have disregarded their mandate. Besides this they would, the disastrous consequences of the first, would force the question of to the country. And as Congressman Morse, of Massachusetts, has declared, allow alone on this Sunday-Sabbath question, both houses of Congress will very grant the demands of the same ones who will certainly besiege them every session with them. For such would only be to acknowledge and more confirm the latest definition of the terms. When will it stop? When will the thing cease to be maintained or be? The truth is that it is now only in its beginning.

These arguments should be laid to heart: these persons should be hold that attention, and this argument must stand upon its arbitrary demand of closeness; it rests upon the recognition of a certain religion and healthy public opinion.
