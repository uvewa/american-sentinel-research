# Followed Inevitably.

The first step taken in the union of Church and State in the Roman Empire, subsequent steps followed, not only easily and patiently, but inevitably. Constantine proclaimed Christianity at the first, just as a whole—"the whole body of Christians." And then he established a particular sect, the "Catholic Church of the Christians" just as easily as he did the first. Just so certainly as the Supreme Court of the United States has established Christianity as the religion of this Nation, of all other religions, just so certainly will, or some other power, have to establish a particular sect of Christianity to the exclusion of all other sects. The Supreme Court itself will have to do it; or somebody, it, somebody will have to decide who is, and who is not, a Protestant.

Madison and other statesmen of his time knew just as certainly as they said they knew, that if Christianity was established as the State religion, there must be a particular sect established, and everybody knew that the particular sect that would establish Christianity in Virginia, Madison wrote:

> Instead of holding forth an asylum to the persecuted, it is itself a signal of persecution. It degrades from the equal rank of citizens all those whose opinions in religion do not bend to those of the legislative authority. Distant as it may be in its present form from the Inquisition, it differs from it only in degree. The one is the first step, the other the last, in the career of intolerance.

Now, to-day, what Madison said of "the Christian religion" in Virginia, Madison himself declared to be the same. What does the reader see in this the United States, which establishes the Christian religion as the national religion, and in the act of Congress which established as an essential part of Christianity the dogma that Sunday is the Sabbath? Just as certainly as, back there, was a signal of persecution, and persecution throughout the State, just so certainly are these a signal of persecution, and persecution through all the Nation. But read and study this whole paper.

Distant as it may be in its present form from the Inquisition, just so certainly there have been the same intolerance, and just as certainly as that edict of Constantine had it in its Papacy, just so certainly have them in their image or likeness to the Papacy—an American pattern, it is true; front, but no better than, the Roman Papacy.
