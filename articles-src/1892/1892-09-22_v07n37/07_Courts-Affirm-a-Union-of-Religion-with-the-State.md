# Courts Affirm a Union of Religion with the State.

American life as expressed by its laws, its business, its customs and its society, gives an organized recognition of the same truth. Among other matters, the Court takes notice of the following: the form of oath universally prevailing, concluding with an appeal to the Almighty; the custom of opening sessions of all deliberative bodies and most conventions with prayer; the prefatory words of all wills, "In the name of God, Amen;" the laws respecting the observance of the Sabbath, with the general cessation of all secular business, and the closing of courts, legislatures, and similar public assemblies on that day; the churches and church organizations which abound in every city, town, and hamlet; the multitude of charitable organizations existing everywhere under Christian auspices; the gigantic missionary associations, with general support, and aiming to establish Christian missions in every quarter of the globe. These, and many other matters which might be noticed, add a volume of unofficial declarations to the mass of organic utterances that this is a Christian Nation. In the face of all these, shall it be believed that a Congress of the United States intended to make it a misdemeanor for a church of this country to contract for the services of a Christian minister residing in another nation?

Suppose the Congress that passed this act declared that, if any Roman Catholic Church in this country, should employ any priest to officiate in such church, such employment would be service as pastor and priest; or any Episcopal Church, any minister or other clergyman; every United States farmer, or any Methodist Church, every minister in its usual circuits; and, in accordance with her Mr. Spurgeon, or any other person of any denomination—that such contract should be adjudged unlawful and void and a violation of an act of Congress; and would have received a notice of approving thought from any person anywhere. Yet this is the very construction involved can not be accepted as correct, for a construction of a statute which would lead to an absurd result, in view of which the legislator used general terms to cover from a special purpose, it is then recognized that the gospel language then employed is too broad; in which event, the courts in every land have been intentionally legislated against. It must be, then, that a specific limitation in the statute, to say that, however broad the language of the act, it is by its terms, and on its face, directed against bringing in laborers from abroad, and therefore can not be within the statute. The Court in its opinion fortifies itself with this opinion.

## COURT OF LAST RESORT HAS DETERMINED.

From this opinion there was no dissent. It stands as the unanimous decision of the highest and final authority. It is the supreme judicial authority of this country declare for an establishment of the national religion.

More than that, it asserts that there has never been a recognition of religion in the State here. It asserts the American Republic was never independent of religion, since before the Declaration of Independence, the First Amendment to the Constitution and the Constitutions of the several State Constitutions, and the Colonial Charters have been a recognition of a national church—the same church—the Protestant-Roman-Episcopal Church, establishments which the churches themselves had used the Government to aggrandize and enrich their State religion.

To the American citizen the Supreme Court of the United States has set before us the last resort. To that is his final resort, beyond which there is no appeal for the Nation, except to his Maker. The Constitution itself defines the nature of the judicial power; and as to the Supreme Court, it says that that court power over the Constitution is supreme. So that the power of the Supreme Court extends to all cases arising under the Constitution and the laws of Congress. It is the sphere of the Supreme Court, thus to interpret the Constitution, and its authority is final as to whether state, or county, or of Legislature, or decrees of courts are in conflict there with Constitution or are consistent
