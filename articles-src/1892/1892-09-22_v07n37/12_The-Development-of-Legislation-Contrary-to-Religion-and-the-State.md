# The Development of Legislation Contrary to Religion and the State.

even more significant than they. Its results are fraught with greater peril, as being the culmination of allied evil, error of evil, and also human, and amid the greater opportunities to know and do the right, the wrong has been deliberately chosen.

An amendment to Mr. Quay's amendment Mr. Gray, of Delaware, offered the provision, "that it was understood by Mr. Quay and Public that—

And it must be declared that all appropriations hereafter made, or pertaining to the Columbian Exposition, are made under the condition that the said Exposition shall not be open to the public on the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday, and if the said exposition shall be opened on Sunday, all of the appropriations herein or provided by said act for said exposition, known as the World's Columbian Exposition upon that condition shall stand in all the various acts created by the act of Congress of April 25, 1890, to aid in said World's Columbian Exposition, shall be paid corporation as shall require the closing of the exposition on the first day of the week.

This was adopted by the Senate, on July 10. It was adopted by the House. It received the signature of the President of the United States, and thus became the law.

This is the first finished enactment of religious law by the Congress of the United States in the history of the Government. Its importance as a historical event can not be overestimated. Its significance as to the future of this country can not for an instant too largely be set before the reader. The centuries have waited to see this day. To-night, all this has had its culmination in the last result. Here and now to begin an investigation, upon the principles of justice and equity, for which this Nation and Government has been known abroad, even as an American principle and heritage. Though the crisis has been precipitated by a religious claim, he would be most fully and gladly recognized. He is about to come to the common people, and every loyal citizen, knowing that his time is not delayed.

## THE DEVELOPMENT OF LEGISLATION CONTRARY TO RELIGION AND THE STATE.

The first attempt to develop a State religion was consistent. The process of that measure would have established a State religion, and would have provided for the education of the young in that religion.

The passage of the National law for the Sunday law for the District of Columbia was necessarily dependent upon such educational constitutional amendment, which would have reversed existing legislation and made the adoption of such adoption technically possible.

No basis upon which to legislate for a revision must therefore be held in abeyance until a basis of moral theology be found, in the supreme law of the land, by which they might be justified. Justice Brewer both found and made this basis, in the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States of the case, on the United States, delivered February 29, 1892. He decided that the national religion was not and never had been separate from the State, in any sense.

No better approach foundation than this could possibly be made. Had the previous attempt succeeded, its validity, its terms, and its form, would have been subject to the interpretation of the Supreme Court. Now however, the necessary basis was received, first hand, from the Supreme Court itself. Whether congressional development

proceeded this fact or not it is nevertheless true that they were waiting, and did wait, for this before they acted. When this decision had been made they acted forthwith, and acted consistently therewith. They succeeded in as it arises for a national religion, and proceeded in this manner and form to develop that religion on legislative lines.

Of the Congressional discussion of the legislative measures in which that was given by its constituting Government appropriations on Sunday observance, the *New York Christian Advocate* says:—

Every citizen upon this subject will agree with a late decision of the United States Supreme Court of the United States defining this Country with a solemn protest that this is a Christian State.

The chaplain, himself, of the Senate, said, in an article in the *New York Independent*:—

During this debate you might have imagined yourself in a convention was, or assembly, other than Congress.

There is much more one might that should be dared to say. It was no imagination. He was making an acknowledged reality. The Supreme Court had established a religion, and both of these last bills had been enacted into its first legislative counsel of that religion in the Senate chamber of the United States.

## THE FIRST ENACTMENT OF THE GENERAL RELIGION.

The first enactment of the General council of the national religion at Washington was a to enforce Sunday observance. The second was passed seven days later, and was much wider in its scope. It was an amendment, which reads:—

That it should be unlawful for any person or persons, or corporations to open or keep open, or cause, ... under a penalty of not exceeding one thousand dollars.

Already the "general council, or senate," of the national religion had broken out on two points of the many which, as representing a religion, is now in need of legislation to control. It has provided against the desecration of Sundays at the Exposition, and worked for its closing. It has been established.

The administration has been laid. There is no higher authority than a decree of Congress, no stronger ground, the decision had been placed, either by the Supreme Court, or by a constitutional amendment,—employed to the revision, criticism and interpretation of the Supreme Court—such legislation upon religion could not have been forecast, the constitutional amendment would have involved a long course of procedure. But the people were waiting, willing or not, without recourse to legislatures or petitions, working directly and authoritative-ly, and without the knowledge of the constitutionality of the legislation being referred to the different congressional committees, and yet not reversed, may be constantly passed at any time. The national Sunday bill for the nation of the Government will come next, and with it, whether framed or conceived, may be offered and passed in their regular order. That was the way planned.

The necessary "logical line of action of the proposed theocracy" is clearly involved in the progress of this matter. It makes no difference whether the origin of these measures, or whether the Government in general, or whether the Supreme Court itself reached these facts or intent, they wore the two facts and part of the inscrutable march of history and history-making.

The decision of the Supreme Court, as Rector of the Church of the Holy Trinity, etc., stated that this has always been a national religion; the first decree, under the general government, of a guarantee of governmental appropriations for a World's Fair, upon the condition that the act shall be paid, at that time and place, to be expected and distinctly, in legislative evidences, of the acceptance of that religion, which the Supreme Court has affirmed to be the national religion.

The Supreme Court has established a religion. Congress has legislated in the interests of religion, and in harmony with the established religion.
