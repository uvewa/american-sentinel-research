## THE BLAIR EDUCATIONAL AMENDMENT.

The first bill, having for its purpose the union of religion and the State, to receive the approval of the congressional committee to which it had been referred, was the joint resolution proposing a constitutional amendment, respecting religion and the public schools, offered in the Senate by Henry W. Blair, then senator from New Hampshire, May 25, 1888, and introduced in succeeding Congresses. The first section of this proposed amendment applied the First Amendment to the Constitution to the individual States, prohibiting them from legislating in respect to religion or interfering with its free exercise. The second section of the proposed amendment, however, contained a clause requiring the principles of the Christian religion to be taught in the public schools by the State. As first presented, this clause read, "In the principles of the Christian religion;" it was afterwards changed to read, "In knowledge of the fundamental and non-sectarian principles of Christianity." This called for the legal establishment of the principles of the Christian religion. It also, by necessary implication, required a belief in the principles of the Christian religion as a necessary qualification of a teacher,—thus affixing a religious test to the position of teacher in the public schools. By this the legal status of the Federal and State governments respecting legislation upon religious questions would have been reversed. A positive prohibition would have been put upon State legislatures, while that which was prohibited to the States would have been assumed by Congress; and the First Amendment to the Constitution, and the clause forbidding the application of any religious test as a qualification for a public trust, would have been done away with. This would have been one way to have established a national religion in the United States. The measure was however finally lost by a very close vote in the Fifty-first Congress.

## THE NATIONAL SUNDAY BILL.

A few days previous to the presentation of this constitutional amendment as to religious education in the United States,—May 21, 1888,—the same senator presented another bill "to secure to the people the enjoyment of the first day of the week, commonly known as the Lord's day, as a day of rest, and to promote its observance as a day of religious worship." This title was afterwards changed to read, "A bill to secure to the people the privileges of rest and of religious worship, free from disturbance by others, on the first day of the week." The six sections of the bill constituted a national Sunday law, complete in all its specifications, forbidding all Sunday labor, and amusements, in territory subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States; the carrying and delivery of mails, inter-state commerce, all military and naval drills in time of peace; and providing that when payment had been made for Sunday services rendered it might be "recovered back" by the person first suing for it.

This measure would naturally follow in logical order the proposed constitutional amendment. That would have forbidden the States to establish religious independently, and by providing for the national teaching of religion, would of course necessitate the defining and establishing of a national religion to be taught. The national Sunday law would then have been a statute under the Constitution as amended. It would have been the first religious law enacted under a national religion. It would have been a consistent means by which to have begun the active enforcement of the tenets of the national religion which the amendment would have incorporated into the Constitution. But the national religion of the United States was not to be so established, nor its enforcement so begun. The bill to create a national Sunday law never was reported from the committee to which it was referred and died with the close of the senatorial career of Mr. Blair.

## SUNDAY BILL FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.

January 6, 1890, Mr. Breckinridge, of Kentucky, introduced into the House of Representatives "A bill to prevent persons from being forced to labor on Sunday." This bill enacted:-

That it shall be unlawful for any person or corporation, or employee of any person or corporation, in the District of Columbia, to perform any secular labor or business, or cause the same to be performed by any person in their employment, on Sunday, except works of necessity or mercy; nor shall it be lawful for any person or corporation to receive pay for labor or services performed or rendered in violation of this act.

Any person or corporation, or employee of any person or corporation, in the District of Columbia, who shall violate the provisions of this act, shall upon conviction thereof, be punished by a fine of not more than one hundred dollars for every such offense: Provided, however, that the provisions of this act shall not be construed to apply to any person or persons who conscientiously believe in and observe any other day of the week than Sunday as a day of rest.

The purpose of this was to commit Congress, in local legislation for the District of Columbia, to the general principles of legislation upon religion and the enactment of law for the enforcement of Sunday observance. Could the passage of this bill have been secured, the way would have been opened for the bill to secure national Sunday observance, as the only difference between the two would have been in the extent of their application. This bill was referred to the House Committee on the District of Columbia, and has never been reported from that committee.

## SUNDAY ICE BILL FOR THE DISTRICT.

The failure to secure a general Sunday law for the District of Columbia led to the presentation of a bill of still more restricted application but precisely the same in principle. April 25, 1892, Mr. McMillan, of Michigan, in the Senate, and Mr. Hemphill, of South Carolina, in the House introduced this bill, by request:-

A bill prohibiting the delivery and sale of ice within the District of Columbia on the Sabbath day, commonly known as Sunday.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled:

That from and after the passage of this act it shall be unlawful to sell or deliver ice in any quantity or quantities, by means of wagons or other vehicles, on the public streets or thoroughfares or at depots or offices within the District of Columbia, on the Sabbath day, commonly known as Sunday.

Sec. 2. That any person or corporation violating the provisions of this act shall be liable to a penalty of not less than twenty-five dollars nor more than fifty dollars for each offense upon conviction in the police court of the District of Columbia.

Sec. 3. That all acts or parts of acts inconsistent with this act be, and the same are hereby, repealed.

This varies from the Sunday bill for the District,—"To prevent persons from being forced to labor,"—in no way except that while the other is an attempt to secure a sweeping Sunday law to include all forms of labor, this specifies but one, but its passage would pave the way for other special enactments, until, at length, the full scope of the general act would be reached. This bill met the approval of the District Committees of both Houses, and was reported to the House and passed. Before passage, the word "prohibiting" in the title was amended to read, "regulating;" and the insertion of the words, "except between the hours of 7 and 9 o'clock antemeridian and 5 and 6 o'clock postmeridian," was made after the expression, "commonly known as Sunday." This was the first instance, in the legislative history of the United States, in which either house of Congress ever intelligently and deliberately legislated upon a religious question. In this case, too, it is to be noticed, and remembered, that the House of Representatives presumes to decide authoritatively, so far as the wording and spirit of the bill can go, that Sunday is "the Sabbath." This bill has not yet been reported to the Senate.

## TO PROHIBIT SUNDAY OPENING OF EXPOSITIONS.

No sooner had the holding of the great Exposition, commemorative of the discovery of America by Columbus, been determined upon, than it was immediately seen that here was an opportunity to further the cause of Sunday observance by congressional legislation. Mr. Morse, a representative from Massachusetts, and Mr. Dawes, a senator from the same State, introduced in the House and the Senate, respectively, the following:—

A bill to prohibit the opening of any exhibition or exposition on Sunday where appropriations of the United States are expended.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled:

That no exhibition or exposition for which appropriation is made by Congress shall be opened on Sunday.

Sec. 2. That any violation of this act shall be punishable by a fine of not less than one hundred dollars nor more than one thousand dollars for every violation of the foregoing act.

This bill was referred to the committees on the World's Fair, of both Senate and House, and strenuously advocated before them; several hearings being granted on the matter by both committees. It was soon seen, however, by the advocates of congressional legislation upon Sunday observance that the terms of this bill were too general, and that it covered so much as to be in danger of failure from that fact. Their demand was therefore reduced to the very least compatible with the attainment of their purpose. It was determined to attain Sunday closing of the World's Fair and the committal of Congress to legislation upon religion by an instruction.

## PROVISO CONDITIONING APPROPRIATIONS ON SUNDAY CLOSING.

The insertion of the appropriation for the World's Fair as a clause in the Sundry Civil Appropriation bill was decided upon. There was a purpose in this,—for, once passed, with whatever provisos might be attached, being incorporated into the bill providing for the running expenses of the Government, it must stand with the entire bill. However, on May 25, in the House of Representatives, Mr. Johnstone, of South Carolina, precipitated the discussion of the Sunday closing question, by offering an amendment to the clause of the Sundry Civil bill, then under consideration, appropriating funds for the Government exhibit, as follows:—

Provided, That no part of the amount hereby appropriated shall be available unless the doors of the Exposition shall be closed on Sunday.

This would have made the Sunday closing of the entire Exposition a condition precedent to the making of an individual exhibit by the general Government. After two days of the most boisterous and excited scenes witnessed during this session of Congress another provision was substituted for this and passed, as follows:—

Provided, that the Government exhibits at the World's Columbian Exposition shall not be opened to the public on Sundays.

This was carried by a vote of 131 to 36. In this the House of Representatives committed itself, a second time, to an acknowledged act of religious legislation, and by a vote of almost four to one.

## THE SENATE CONDITIONS THE ENTIRE APPROPRIATION ON SUNDAY CLOSING.

When, in the Senate, an amendment to the Sundry Civil bill, appropriating five millions of dollars for the World's Fair, was offered, Mr. Quay, of Pennsylvania, moved to insert a Sunday closing provision in language and manner worthy of note; and to be remembered as the real initial step in the general enforcement of religion by the Government of the United States, in pursuance of the decision of the Supreme Court that this is a religious and Christian Nation.

The Congressional Record reads thus:—

Mr. Quay. On page 122, line 13, after the word "act," I move to insert:

And that provision has been made by the proper authority for the closing of the Exposition on the Sabbath day,

The reasons for the amendment I will send to the desk to be read. The secretary will have the kindness to read from the Book of Law I send to the desk, the part enclosed in brackets.

The Vice-President. The part indicated will be read.

The secretary read as follows:—

Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy. Six days shall thou labor, and do all thy work: But the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God; in it thou shall not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manoeuvres, nor thy mailservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates; but in six days the Lord shall heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed it.

The discussion which followed upon this amendment deserves well to rank among the debates in the great religious councils of the fourth century. It was even more significant than they. Its result is fraught with even greater peril, as it marks the culmination of added centuries of error, and also because, that, amid the greater opportunities to know and do the right, the wrong has been deliberately chosen.

As an amendment to Mr. Quay's amendment Mr. Gray, of Delaware, offered the following—it was accepted by Mr. Quay and reads thus:—

And it is hereby declared that all appropriations herein made for, or pertaining to, the World's Columbian Exposition are made under the condition that the said Exposition shall not be open to the public on the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday; and if the said appropriations be accepted by the corporation of the State of Illinois, known as the World's Columbian Exposition upon that condition, it shall be, and it is hereby made, the duty of the World's Columbian Commission, created by the act of Congress of April 25, 1890, to make such rules or modification of the rules of said corporation as shall require the closing of the Exposition on the said first day of the week, commonly called Sunday.

This was adopted by the Senate, on July 14; and by the House, on July 19; and received the signature of the President of the United States on August 5. It is now the law.

This is the first finished enactment of religion by the Congress of the United States in the history of the Government. Its importance as a historical event can not be over-stated. Its significance as to the legislative future of this country can not be put into language too vivid or too intense. The centuries have waited to see this day. The Spirit of all evil has bided his time to this hour. Here and now he begins an onset upon the principles of justice and equity, for which this Nation and Government has heretofore stood, such as humanity has never yet met in all its bitter experiences. He is about to come to the conflict himself, in great wrath, knowing that his time is not long.

## THE DEVELOPMENT OF LEGISLATION UNITING RELIGION AND STATE.

The first attempt to develop a State religion was made through educational channels. It was consistent. The success of that measure would have established a State religion, and would have provided for the education of the young in that religion.

The passage of the National Sunday law and the Sunday law for the District of Columbia was necessarily dependent upon the success of the constitutional amendment, which would have reversed existing constitutional principles, and made their adoption technically possible.

The failure to establish a religion left no basis upon which to legislate for a religion. The enactment of religious statutes must therefore be held in abeyance until a basis should be made, or found, in the supreme law of the land, by which they might be justified. Justice Brewer both found and made this basis, in the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of the Rector of the Church of the Holy Trinity, etc. vs. the United States, delivered February 29, 1892. He decided that the national religion was not only established, but had always existed.

No better apparent foundation than this could possibly be made. Had the previous attempt succeeded, its validity, its terms, and its form, would have been subject to the interpretation of the Supreme Court. Here, however, the necessary dictum issued, first hand, from the Supreme Court itself. Whether congressmen consciously recognized this fact or not it is nevertheless true that they were waiting, and did wait, for this before they acted. When this decision had been made they acted forthwith, and acted consistently therewith. They accepted it as a decree for a national religion, and proceeded in due manner and form to develop that religion on legislative lines.

Of the congressional discussion of the legislative measure in which that was done, by conditioning Government appropriations on Sunday observance, the New York Christian Advocate says:—

Every utterance upon this subject was in harmony with a late decision of the United States Supreme Court whereby it is to be forever regarded as a settled principle that this is a Christian nation.

The chaplain, himself, of the Senate, said, in an article in the New York Independent, in reference to this same occasion:—

During this debate you might have imagined yourself in a general council, or assembly, or synod, or conference.

The chaplain was more right than he dared to say. It was no imagination. He characterized the occasion correctly. The Supreme Court had established a religion, and the chaplain had just witnessed the first legislative council of that religion held in the Senate chamber of the United States.

The first enactment of the General Council of the national religion at Washington was to enforce Sunday observance. The second was passed seven days later, and consisted of a law for the District of Columbia, which reads:—

That it shall not be lawful for any person or persons to curse, swear, or make use of any profane language. . . . under a penalty of not exceeding twenty dollars for each and every offense.

Already the "general council, or assembly, or synod, or conference," has touched two points of the many which, as representing a religion, it is now bound to legislatively consider. It has provided against the desecration of Sunday at the World's Fair, and forbidden profanity in the District of Columbia.

A sufficient foundation has been laid. There is no higher authority than a decree of the Supreme Court. Until such a foundation had been placed, either by the Supreme Court, or by a constitutional amendment,—subjected to the revision, criticism and interpretation of the Supreme Court,—such legislation upon religion could not have been logically had. The constitutional amendment would have involved a long course of procedure. But now the result sought has been gained without recourse to legislatures or people. The fatal work has been done speedily, and without the knowledge of the people. Now, the remaining religious bills referred to the different congressional committees, and not yet reported, may be consistently passed at any time. The national Sunday bill may be re-introduced and adopted. New and more vigorous measures, such as have not yet been framed or conceived, may be offered and passed in their regular course. The way is now fully open.

The necessary logical line of action which must have been taken had been followed in the progress of this matter. It makes no difference whether the originators of these measures, or whether congressmen in general, or whether the Supreme Court itself realized these facts or not, they are none the less facts,—and part of the inexorable march of history and history-making.

The decision of the Supreme Court, as voiced by Justice Brewer, has established a national religion; the first decree, under this establishment, is the conditioning of governmental appropriations, for the World's Fair, upon the assurance that respect shall be paid, at that time and place, to the especial and distinctive sign, or public evidence, of the acceptance of that religion, which the Supreme Court has affirmed to be the national religion.

The Supreme Court has established a religion. Congress has legislated in accordance with that established religion.
