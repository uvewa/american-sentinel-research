# The Change of the Sabbath; Its Relation to Sunday Legislation.

Ten friends of the Sunday Sabbath are in favor of defending both the day and its sacredness, and at the same time Sunday laws and their enforcement. With such a view they are obliged to maintain the sacredness of the day in both respects. Sunday is not the Sabbath, whether the Sabbath legislated upon or not. But the question is, Is it right, and is it safe for government, for such government can call it the Sabbath by the legislation it passes in the enforcement of religious rites, or in the enforcement of any religious observance, or how far should government go?

Many do not are not aware of the origin of the Sunday Sabbath at Washington, or how by what act and means it obtained its civil and legislative standing. If they will study the history of the first day they will learn much of what they do not know. They will learn how this, together with other characteristics and workings of that "mystery of iniquity," came about. From the pen of Dr. Neander, we read:—

From an alleged desire to have "nothing in common with the Jews," the custom of both was cast aside, and a day which had been honored as the day of the sun in the rites of the sun-worshipers, at the same time of their commemoration, as their memorial rites, of the betrayal and crucifixion of Christ, was now substituted in the place of the seventh-day Sabbath, the true Lord's day.

Through the elements the seemingly impossible is culminated in this: then early in the fourth century, by a constitutional enactment, the observance of the Sunday in the place of the Sabbath was given to the world. And thus the church had become so corrupted and so much a part of the State as to be content only to be sealed by worldly power. From the law of Constantine, the first Sunday law, which took place in the fourth century, under the first so-called Christian emperor, as even the best historians, such as Neander, Mosheim, and others, fully acknowledge, the aim of Constantine to make theology a branch of politics—it would not be a stretch for those in the empire to make politics a branch of theology. To learn further of the condition of things at the time of Constantine, it may be observed that unavoidable consequences were a union of religion and the State. (See Neander's "Industrial Development of Europe," chap. 1, "Constantine.")

Such a union of church and State gave an advantage taken by the church bishops to use the civil power, from the standpoint of the religion of the empire, and the first day of the week was the national church weekly rest-day.

It is noted by some if a government has a right to establish a weekly rest-day, why God established a weekly rest-day for the Jewish nation, and incorporated it into the Jewish theocracy, and accordingly, according to his word, which stands for the first and last of the law. Matt. 5:17, 18; Matt. 16:51; 17:22; Acts 3:21; 10:—

Sabbath rest is

Christ's resurrection on this day did not make a Sabbath out of it, neither did his meeting with his disciples and showing himself to them set it apart as such. Furthermore, there is no scripture showing that this day was ever occupied or set apart, finally, or that the resurrection is any honor of the resurrection. All observance of it as such is therefore assumption and without divine authority. The Methodist Theological Compendium correctly states the case when, on page 103 (edition 1861), it says:—

"... nor is there any for keeping holy the first day."

This being the case, Sunday is therefore not the Sabbath; it is not the Lord's day; neither is it a sacred or a holy day. It cannot as a law of force be regarded as such, the testimony of Eusebius, who year 194, should not be forgotten. He says:—

on the Sabbath, these we have transferred to the Lord's day.—*Sabbath Manual, p. 127.*

The change of the Sabbath from the seventh day to the first day was therefore by human acts and human authority. In this it resembles the evil. The seventh day is still the Sabbath of the Lord. Baptism, the only divinely appointed memorial of Christ's death and resurrection (Rom. 6:3-6), Christ's statement that the Sabbath is still the Lord's rest-day, and all the testimony of the Scriptures that they know and worship the true and living God. The seventh day is still the Lord's earth. It is also the sign that they may have that one who sanctified the day is the one who sanctifies them. Ex. 31:13.

But many will not have it this way. The sacredness of the first day they affirm, after it has been clearly proven that there is no divine authority for it. They are strongly attached to it, and when they are then tired they will not change and walk in the truth regarding the Sabbath. They are bound to keep Sunday any way, and as civil force has been invoked, any one say it is not the Sabbath, though we tell it to the whole world from this position.

4. The keeping of the seventh day is a sign between God and his people, as given especially upon the part of those who keep it through sanctification. And that Christ, through God has never pronounced it such; the day of the seventh day as a holy and sacred day, and because you can not find in the Bible any divine authority for it. When the church cannot with the Bible alone, with Bible to convince the people of its sacred character and divine authority of its origin, appeal is made to civil law. The appeal to civil law places Sunday at once under civil pains and penalties. This accounts for its existence of all the Sunday laws from Constantine's time down to the present day. They must be made to keep it; for "the Church," to take the place of the true Sabbath as God has intended, the observance of a day he never set apart, blessed, nor commanded to be kept holy, is not an easy task. Its human origin is manifested in the fact that, wherever human against whom it is sought to rigidly enforce upon those who are conscientiously observing the seventh day, the only weekly Sabbath God ever set apart, sanctified,

and blessed. Sunday laws have as a reference no foundation of God, but are subversive of and antagonistic to it. The attempt made through them to change, and thus the attempt made through them to change, and thus time affirm equally that, they are what Christ honored and sanctified in all his life and teaching, and to the persecuting nature manifested in their enforcement. Ready will you therefore find that when you want to stand when called to answer to this question.
