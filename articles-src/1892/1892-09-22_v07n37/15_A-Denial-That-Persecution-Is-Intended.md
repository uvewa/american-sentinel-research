# A Denial That Persecution Is Intended.

A DENIAL that persecution is intended, or that it will result from the passage of religious laws is in this country, is of a piece with the denial of other ills. The political maxim that "to foretell the disaster is to destroy the illusion," also bears upon it. And this Government having turned to the denial and assumed and carried justification in its practice, will inevitably the that domain and retain that justification. Moreover, those who are claiming for governmental recognition of religious dogmas and religious institutions have shown that they are not now to avail themselves for religious purposes of any and all legislative action, whether State or national.

Without having control of legislation, but only as the churches, to every man's peace, to hold and practice his own religion without molestation. This case now up for the matter was taken by Judge Hammond, of the United States District Court, in the case of R. M. King, indicted and held for trial for Sunday work. The case was brought from Judge Hammond, out of Waller and others.

The Judge said:—

What is there found from saying that in the course of his daily work on Sunday, that this is persecution of any sort. If you choose to say of, the religion of other people—

That is to say, a man may belong to a sect; that sect may have a creed; they may practice according to that creed; and may not be disturbed in such practice; but when it comes to conforming to the laws made in aid of the religion of some other sect, that have control of legislation
