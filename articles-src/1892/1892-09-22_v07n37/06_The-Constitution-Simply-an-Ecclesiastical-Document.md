# The Constitution "Simply" an Ecclesiastical Document.

There is no discourse in these declarations having one meaning; they affirm and reaffirm that this is a religious nation. These are not individual sayings, declarations of private persons; they are organic utterances; they speak the voice of the entire people. While because of a general recognition of this truth the question has seldom been presented to the courts, yet we find that in *Updegraph vs. The Commonwealth,* 11 S. & R. 394 (1824), it was decided that, "Christianity, general Christianity, is and always has been, a part of the common law—not Christianity with an established church, and tithes, and spiritual courts; but Christianity with liberty of conscience to all men."

Faithful to their faith, observed the day of their choice. And not the least significant feature of this persecution is that the persecuted practically no protest has been made against these prosecutions. They have been published broadcast, and special attention has been called to them in order to call the attention of the press everywhere. The subject is not at the moment to progress, but to indifference and approval. Thus by silence, the religio-politic of this country has given assent to persecution for conscience’ sake, and by giving assent,
