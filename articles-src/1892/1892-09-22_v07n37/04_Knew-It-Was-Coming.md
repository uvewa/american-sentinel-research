# Knew It Was Coming.

We knew it was coming. And this is why for years we as continuously and as earnestly protested, and were constantly set against. We know not exactly how nor when; some prefer to call it, of religion and the Government to their side of the contest; we know that it would come; but we know enough about religion itself to be able to recognize it when it should be formed. We have protested against this great evil, and we still protest against it. We protest against the general principle itself, and in choosing Sunday observance. We protest and shall continue to protest against and all the consequences of the principle.

We had the right to protest against the establishment of a national religion; and we have the right to protest against the national religion now that it is established. In short, we have the divine and universal right to protest against every form of religious organization on earth; and when we protest against the establishment of a national religion, we have the same right still; even to the extent of claiming to be, in our own Government itself, in as far as it is ruled by the religious organization.

The one great object of the grand movements of the churches to secure the governmental recognition of religion was to secure a power by which Sunday observance would be enforced throughout the Nation, backed up by national power and authority. They had tried every other means, movement, and disputed their right to use even the power of the nation in this way for this purpose. Now that they have secured it, it would be ridiculous to suppose that they will not proceed to use it just as they always had the right to dissent from their claim of right to a connection of religion with the Government power; and we have still the right to dissent from their claim of right to use the power for this purpose. We had the right to refuse to be yoked with the machinery set up by the churches without the aid of the Government; and we have the same right to refuse to leave it now that it is set up by the churches with the aid of the Government. We stand just where we always stood against the claim of the right of the churches in enforcing their dogmas upon any person whatever. We still deny the man’s right to dissent from those dogmas and ordinances. The Government was wrong in aiding the churches; and men do not become wrong by continuing to dissent and Government in the things wherein they formerly dissented.

enough, in all conscience, we has been through it all, and through all these years. If any one is inclined to think that we will live in a world of quiet; but after all this, with this, the writer only wishes that they had to know what that is all. But in the gallery of the House, when the final vote was taken, they sent up to the Government to their side of the contest, we add, the one word to their exhortation.

In its act of closing the World’s Fair on Sunday, Congress passed the first act of religious legislation. Neither the Supreme Court, will ever stop there. The Supreme Court, will overthrows the Jews, the Seventh-day Baptists, and the Seventh-day Adventists in that Saturday is their only day, that Sunday should be observed. No more can it be expected even by trying to convince those with the aid of the people of the Supreme Court, who are not Christians in the several before, we disagree with them now. We always said before that they should not do it, and we say the same thing still now that they have done it. We refused before to yield to the National Reform claim though it was only urged; before, the National Reform claim had only power to keep Sunday; and if we refused to yield to the churches without power, we deny now their right to use it.

As a Nation we have denied the right of Congress to legislate in behalf of institutions of religion, and we still deny this. We denied this wholly upon principle. Now, because it has been done we deny it upon the same principle, and also because the effect of the first step shows that the first was wrong, and still more wrong are the further steps that have been taken, and further still steps that will yet be taken. As to whether we will obey men or obey God, we can answer only as the apostles answered, that we ought to obey God rather than men.

"Sunday is not the Sabbath. Sunday is not the Lord’s day. Sunday is not in any sense a sacred day." We are not now, nor have we ever been, advocates of the old Sunday observance for its own sake. The question is not whether Sunday is a sacred day or not. We care for no man’s religion, as such. We care only for his religious liberty. We know that every religious day, every religious institution, every religious dogma that finds its way into the statute books, becomes at once an instrument of oppression. Therefore it is that this has always been the con- tention of THE AMERICAN SENTINEL against Sunday legislation. And as Seventh-day Adventists our protest started and maintained solely, standing only, as long would this have been, under these circumstances, a protest. But now Congress has legislated. Congress has taken the very step that THE SENTINEL has always said it would take, and has committed the Government to the program of the churches. We protest against it, not only because it is a principle, but also because it is a fact, because it is law. In this act Congress has committed itself and the Government.

"Sunday is not the Sabbath. Sunday is not the Lord’s day. Sunday is not in any sense a sacred day." We are not now, nor have we ever been, advocates of the old Sunday observance. Whether the Sabbath legislated upon by the Government should, or should not, command its observance for its own religious reasons, we never had the slightest sympathy with the observance of Sunday on any religious basis. We see no authority for it in the authority of the Christians. And of the Lord’s day of the Revelation. And he who will look into the question, may learn that "the changing of the Sabbath" rests wholly upon sacerdotalism in the Catholic Church, and professed Protestants who keep Sunday, are following the institution of the Catholic Church, and that alone, for there is no other authority for Sunday observance whether by church, rulers or governments.
