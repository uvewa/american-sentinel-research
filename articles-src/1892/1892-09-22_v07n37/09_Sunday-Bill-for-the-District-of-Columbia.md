# Sunday Bill for the District of Columbia.

the work, community bears as the Lord's day and not a day of rest to promote the observance as a of religious worship," "A bill to secure to the people the privilege of rest and of religious worship, free from disturbance by others, on the first day of the week." The act section of the bill constituted a national Sunday law, has complied in all its specifications, for holding all Sunday labor, and amusements, in every or labor to the exclusion jurisdiction of the United States; the carrying and delivery of mails, trade, manufacture, commerce, all military and naval drill in time of peace; and providing that when courts rendered it might be "preserved" as conducive to public order.

This measure would naturally follow in the legislation after the educational amendment. That would have forbidden the South to establish religious schools only, and by providing for the national teaching of religion, would establish the defining the defining and establishing of a national religion to be taught; a national Sunday law would then have been a matter to be expected. It would have been the first step toward nation have the courts first enacted a national religion. It would have been a consistent measure by which to have begun the entire legislation. As it was now, the national religion the which the amendment would have established, and would have provided for the national religious of the United States was not to be established, nor to be foreseen to begin. The bill to create a national Sabbath law never was referred from the committee to which it was referred and died with the termination of the senatorial career of Mr. Blair.

## SUNDAY BILL FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.

January 6, 1890, Mr. Breckinridge, of Kentucky, introduced into the House the Breckinridge "A bill to prevent persons from being forced to labor on Sunday." It reads as follows:—

That it shall be unlawful for any person or corporation, in the District of Columbia, to perform any secular labor or business, or to cause or permit the same to be done by any person in their employ or on their behalf on Sunday, except works of necessity or mercy; nor shall it be lawful for any person, corporation, to exercise any of the above callings, occupations, nor engage in any sport or amusement on Sunday, or cause one for labor or services performed or rendered in contravention of this act more than one hundred dollars for every such person or corporation, in the District of Columbia, nothing in this act shall be in construction to apply to any store or establishment, or to other works of daily newspapers on the first day of the week.

The purpose of this was to commit Congress, in local legislation for the District of Columbia, to the general principles of legislation upon religion and the exact observance. Could the passage of this bill have been secured, the way would have been opened for the bill to secure national Sunday observance, as the only limit in the extent of their application, upon Congress, the Senate and the committee on the District of Columbia, and have thus been the entire congressional committee.

## SUNDAY FOR A SECURE SUNDAY.

law for the District of Columbia led to the presentation of a bill of not as strictly specified application but precisely the same in principle. A joint bill, Mr. W. H. H. Miller, of Michigan, in the Senate, and Mr. Hemphill, of South Carolina, in the House introduced this bill, by request—

A bill providing the advance of and of works within the District of Columbia on the Sabbath day, commonly known as Sunday.

*Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled:*

That from and after the passage of this act it shall not be lawful for any person to keep open any place of business or maintain any manufactory in the District of Columbia, on the public streets or thoroughfares of the said District, or in any other manner, on the Sabbath day, commonly known as Sunday, except for necessary purposes, and any person violating this provision shall be punished by a fine of not less than twenty five dollars nor more than five hundred dollars for each and every offense, or by imprisonment not exceeding six months.

Sec. 2. That all acts or parts of acts inconsistent with this act be, and they are hereby, repealed.

This varies from the Sunday bill for the District—"to prevent persons from being forced to labor,"—in no way except that while the other in an attempt to narrow its sweeping Sunday law to include all forms of labor; this specified one only one, this specified passage would pave the way for other special amendments, until, at length, a result was reached. The general, in a result, was reached. This bill met the approved of the District committee of the Senate, and was reported to the House and Congress. It passed the Senate. But "laboring" in the title was amended to "working," and "work" in the insertion of the words, "except between the hours of 4 and 8 o'clock antemeridian, and between 4 o'clock postmeridian," was made after the expression, "commonly known as Sunday." This was the first instance, in the legislative history of the United States in which either house of Congress ever intelligently and deliberately acted upon a religious question. In this case, it is to be noticed, and retained, that the House of Representatives compelled the Senate to decide authoritatively, so far as these bodies are authorized, "That Sunday is 'the Sabbath.'" This bill had not yet been reported by the Senate.
