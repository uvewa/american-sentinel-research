# "Invitations Never Go Backward."

"INVITATIONS never go backward," especially they do not when the combination selects a and most wonderful weapon of persecution has been taken place in this country in the last decade. By this revolution, persecution for conscience sake under the Christian form of Government States of the Union the First Amendment guaranty of liberty of conscience has been practically swept away by the Supreme Court decision of Feb. 29, 1892, and the Government has been made into a religious controversy for the establishment of the act of Congress controlling the Exposition on the Sunday closing of the Columbian Exposition. And the elements of this religious persecution movement determine that these are only the beginnings. What then will be the measure of the evil? Nothing but the continuance of the liberty of conscience hitherto enjoyed by a free people.

That the spirit of bigotry and intolerance, in this closing decade of the nineteenth century, is proven, beyond a doubt by the fact that a united effort by the leaders of a Christian church, and conscientious observers of the seventh day, commanded by the fourth commandment of the Decalogue, have been fined and imprisoned in several different States, at the investigations of members of other churches, and that for no other offense than doing quiet farm work on their own premises, having, according to their faith, observed the day of their choice. And this the least significant features of this persecution is that it has excited practically no protest from the others. The details of many of these cases have been published broadcast, and special attention to them has been invited, to the attention of the press everywhere. The address is set at the doorstep to ignorance but to indifference and approval. Thus by silence, the religious press of this country has given assent to persecution for conscience' sake, and by giving assent,

it has become partaker in the evil deeds of the persecution.

The facts in the most recent of these persecutions are briefly as follows: Near Springville, Henry County, Tenn., there reside a number of Seventh-day Adventists. They are, as are, even their persecutors admit, God-fearing, moral people. They observe the seventh day of the week by rest and worship. On Sunday they ordinarily go quietly about their secular pursuits, choosing on that day to do no other than their ordinary daily kinds of farm labor. For this, "five of these persons have been indicted."

not at the instigation of their immediate neighbors, for the immediate and next bordering church members of adjoining neighborhoods, indicate for maintaining a nuisance by their Sunday work; were tried and convicted, notwithstanding the fact that their immediate neighbors testified that they were not annoyed by it, and said that they were not annoyed by the arrests, and were actually impressed in the community; and, with all things not changed themselves, were worked in this cruel grasp, with common criminals, in the chain gang of the State, as "the criminals and that without protest from the churches or for religious purposes at all."
