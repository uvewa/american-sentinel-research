The friends of the Sunday Sabbath are fast becoming the friends of Sunday laws and their enforcement. With such we are compelled to join issue, for they are wrong in both respects. Sunday is not the Sabbath of the Bible; and Sabbath laws, whether the Sabbath legislated upon be true or false, are out of place in a civil government, for such governments can of right have nothing whatever to do with the enforcement of religious rites, or in determining what are one's duties to God or how he should perform them.

Many are not aware of the origin of the Sunday Sabbath, or how or by what means it came to take the place of the seventh-day Sabbath—the Sabbath of the Bible. But if they will study the history of the first four centuries of the Christian era, they will learn how this, together with other errors and corruptions, came in by the workings of that "mystery of iniquity," and that "man of sin" feretold by Paul. From an alleged desire to have "nothing in common with the Jews," the Bible Sabbath was cast aside, and a day which had come to be regarded as a church festival in honor of the resurrection, as others were, likewise, of the betrayal and crucifixion, was afterward allowed to take the place of the seventh-day Sabbath, the only weekly Sabbath God ever made or gave to man.

Although the elements which finally culminated in this were early at work, even in Paul's day, the substitution, or the putting of the Sunday in the place of the Bible Sabbath, did not take place until the Church had become so corrupted and so lost to the simplicity of the gospel as to ally itself to worldly power. This alliance took place in the fourth century, under the reign of Constantine. This is attested by the best historians, such as Neander, Schaff, Draper, etc. Draper says: "It was the aim of Constantine to make theology a branch of politics; it was the hope of every bishop in the empire to make politics a branch of theology." And speaking further of the condition of things under the reign of Constantine, he says: "The unavoidable consequences were a union between the Church and State." See his "Intellectual Development of Europe," chapters 9 and 10.

Under Constantine, Christianity, through an advantage taken by the church bishops of his edict of Milan, was recognized as the religion of the empire, and the first day of the week was made the national weekly rest-day.

It is asked by some if a government has no right to establish a weekly rest-day, why God established a weekly rest-day for the Jewish nation, and incorporated it into their national law. The answer is easy. The Jewish nation was a theocracy. God was its primary ruler and lawgiver; and consequently his law, of which the Sabbath commandment is a part, was the fundamental law or constitution of the nation. He gave them their laws, ordained their manner of worship, and chose their leaders, their prophets, their priests, and their kings. This was a theocracy—a religious government, a government by God. No such government now exists, and has not since the diadem was removed from the head of its last and rebellious king, and the kingdom thrice overturned. Ezek. 21: 25–27. All governments upon earth now are simply civil governments. In these people elect or crown their own rulers, and make their own laws. Although they may meddle with religious matters, they have no right to. It is not their business. This is why all Sunday legislation is out of place in civil government. It is the business of such governments to protect men from violence or real disturbance in keeping Sunday if they wish to keep it, but not to compel others to keep it just because their neighbors do, or because some or even the great majority may think it is the Sabbath.

The testimony of what are called "the fathers" is sometimes referred to in support of the Sunday Sabbath. Tertullian, Justin Martyr, Barnabas, Ignatius, and others, are quoted; but by none of these is it shown that the day was at first observed as "the Sabbath," but rather as "a solemn festival of the resurrection," which they had instituted themselves.

Says Sir William Domville:—

Centuries of the Christian era passed away before the Sunday was observed as a Sabbath. History does not furnish us with a single proof or indication that it was at any time so observed previous to the Sabbatical edict of Constantine, in A. D. 321.—*Examination of the Six Tests*, p. 291.

"Chambers' Encyclopedia" says:—

By none of the fathers before the fourth century is it identified with the Sabbath, nor is the duty of observing it grounded by them either on the fourth commandment or on the precept of Jesus or his apostles.—*Article "Sabbath."*

Bishop Jeremy Taylor thus testifies:—

The primitive Christians did all manner of work upon the Lord's day [Sunday], even in the times of persecution, when they are the strictest observers of all the divine commandments; but in this they knew there were none.—*Doctor Didelisation, part 1, book 2, chap. 2, sec. 59.*

As scriptural authority for the Sunday Sabbath, Acts 20: 7, and John 20: 19, 26, are adduced as proof. From these it is claimed that the disciples met on the first day of the week to worship, that Christ met and worshiped with them, and that the day thenceforth was the Christian Sabbath. From Acts 2: 46, it will be seen that the disciples and early Christians at one time met every day to worship, but this does not prove that all days are Sabbaths. Meeting on a day for worship does not make a Sabbath out of it, else the day on the evening of which prayer-meetings are usually held would be a Sabbath.

But there is no proof that the disciples met on the evening of the day of the resurrection to worship. They had a common abode (Acts 1: 13), and were partaking of their evening meal (Mark 16:14) when Christ appeared to them. John says that on the evening of this day "when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the midst." John 20: 19. Neither did Jesus meet with them to worship, but to show himself to them, that they might be witnesses of his resurrection on "the third day" after his betrayal and crucifixion, according to his word, which was the first day of the week. Matt. 16: 21; 17: 22, 23; Acts 2: 32; 10: 39–41.

Christ's resurrection on this day did not make a Sabbath out of it, neither did his meeting with his disciples and showing himself to them set it apart as such. Furthermore, there is no scripture showing that this day was ever divinely set apart in honor of the resurrection. All observance of it as such is therefore gratuitous and without divine authority. The Methodist Theological Compendium correctly states the case when, on page 103 (edition 1865), it says:—

It is true, there is no positive command for infant baptism, . . . nor is there any for keeping holy the first day of the week.

This being the case, Sunday is therefore not the Sabbath; it is not the Lord's day; neither is it a sacred or a holy day. In explanation of how it came to be regarded as such, the testimony of Eusebius, who wrote his history of Christianity in the year 324, should not be forgotten. He says:—

And all things whatsoever that it was the duty to do on the Sabbath, these we have transferred to the Lord's day, as more honorable than the Jewish Sabbath.—*Sabbath Manual*, p. 127.

The change of the Sabbath from the seventh day to the first day was therefore by human and not divine authority. In the substitution lies the evil. The seventh day is still the Sabbath of the Lord. Baptism is the only divinely appointed memorial of Christ's burial and resurrection (Rom. 6: 3, 4; Col. 2: 12; 1 Peter 3: 21), and the Sabbath is still the Lord's rest-day, and the sign between Him and his people that they know and worship the true and living God, who created the heavens and the earth. It is also the sign that they may know that the one who sanctified the day is the one who sanctifies them. Ex. 31: 13, 17; Ezek. 20: 12.

But many will not have it this way. They will cling to the human institution after it has been clearly proved that there is no divine authority for it. They are so wedded to custom and the way their fathers trod they will not change and walk in the light, shine it never so brightly. They are bound to keep Sunday anyway. And they can not endure to have any one say it is not the Sabbath, though God in all his Word has nowhere said it is. The keeping of the seventh day is an offense to them; and laboring on Sunday, especially upon the part of those who keep the seventh day, they regard as sinful, though God has never pronounced it such. And because of a general and growing disregard for the day as a holy and a sacred day, and because they can not find in the Scriptures proof for the institution with which to convince the people of its sacredness and urge upon them its observance, appeal is made to civil law. The State is asked to enforce its observance under civil pains and penalties. This accounts for the existence of all the Sunday laws from Constantine's time down to the present day. They have been asked for by "the Church," to take the place of a law God never gave, and to enforce the observance of a day he never set apart, blessed, nor commanded to be kept holy. And the inherent wickedness of these laws is manifested in the fact that, wherever they are operative, about the only ones against whom it is sought to rigidly enforce them are those who conscientiously observe the seventh day, the only weekly Sabbath day God ever set apart, sanctified, and blessed. Sunday laws have a direct reference to the fourth commandment, and are subversive of and antagonistic to it. Their unchristian character is shown in the attempt made through them to change, and thus strike against, that law which Christ honored and magnified in all his life and teachings, and in the persecuting nature manifested in their enforcement. Reader, on which side of the controversy do you want to stand when called to answer in the Judgment of God?
