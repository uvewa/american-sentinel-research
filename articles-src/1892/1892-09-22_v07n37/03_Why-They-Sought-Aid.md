# Why They Sought Aid.

The method by which it has been attempted to secure a union of religion and the Government has been the same as of old. One thought-for-end has been the Sunday observance, and one only. There has been those who desired its consummation, or by those who opposed. This is one of the oldest, organised effort was to secure the establishment of a national religion. Institution with such language as should declare a governmental acceptance of the idea held by those who desire the United States to be a Christian Nation, and clothed with a shadow of success.

The method has been that the churches' present agitation to secure congressional legislation upon religious affairs. A Sunday day, bills to that end were introduced in both houses of Congress at almost every Congress. The first positive step in the line of actual congressional legislation upon this question, however, was to come from the judiciary, raised by the churches. The adverse opinion of Judge Hammond, of the United States District Court for the Western District of Tennessee, and of R. M. King, convicted on indictment for Sunday labor, foreshadowed the judicial status on this question. Feb. 29, 1892, the supreme judicial authority, the United States Supreme Court, delivered the opinion of the Court in the matter of the Rector, etc., of the Church of the Holy Trinity, etc., and the opinion was that

the observance of Sunday is requiring the observance of the Catholic Church, for there is no day that is recognized by the Catholic Church. It was therefore perfectly fitting that in the cited speech that was made in favor of the Sunday bill in the Senate (the speech of Senator Hawley of Connecticut), the cited place in the speech should be given to the harvest of Catholic archbishop upon the subject. But the authority of the Catholic Church is no authority at all; it is only usurpation and fraud, and the Sunday sacredness is a falsehood. Therefore it is that the Congress of the United States, in legislating in behalf of Sunday observance, has not legislated for the Government of the United States, and the Nation, but to a papal falsehood. And we refuse to recognize it as valid any more than to us either true or right.

The seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord, and Sunday is not the Sabbath. The seventh day is the Lord’s day, and Sunday is not. The seventh day is the sacred day, and the only sacred day, and Sunday is not at all a sacred day. For it is written:

> Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work; but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God; in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates; for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day; wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day, and hallowed it. Ex. 20:8-11.

> And God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it; because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made. Gen. 2:3.

This is the position and the protest of THE AMERICAN SENTINEL, now and always.
