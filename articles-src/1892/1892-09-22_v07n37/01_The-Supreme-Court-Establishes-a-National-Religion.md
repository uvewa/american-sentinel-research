# The Supreme Court Establishes a National Religion.

THE AMERICAN SENTINEL is in the fifth year of its publication. From the first and foremost that ever it has been telling the people in this that the Government, though forbidden by the Constitution, there would be established a national religion; and that there would be national Sunday legislation at the demand of the churches.

All of this is now done in the United States Supreme Court decision of February 29, 1892, declaring this to be a "Christian Nation," and by Congress, in the act closing the World’s Fair on Sunday.\*

In these two governmental actions there are things wrapped up, and already sweeping development, all that THE SENTINEL has been telling, and waiting, and watching against, these seven years. In its establishing Christianity as the national religion, the United States is doing just what was done in the Roman Empire in the fourth century; and the result will be the same now as it was then, namely, persecution for conscience’ sake.

At the beginning of the fourth century there was in the Roman Empire, even as there is now in the United States, a powerful ecclesiastical organization, the leaders and managers of which were "only anxious to secure the government as a kind of scavenger for themselves."—*Faulkner’s Ecclesiastical History, book 8, chap. 1.* While "it was the hope of every bishop in the empire to make a political branch of theology," the aim of Constantine to make theology a branch of politics. In its intrigues therefore with Constantine, they succeeded in fastening to him their influence and power in theology for his in politics.

\*The significance of this decision and of these two events forms the subject of this special issue of THE AMERICAN SENTINEL.

As one of the very first fruits of this intrigue, Constantine was established in the rulership of one half of the Roman Empire, jointly with Licinius. He then issued the Edict of Milan, reversing the persecuting edicts of Diocletian, and declaring "liberty and full freedom to the Christians to observe their own mode of worship;" granting "likewise to the Christians and to all, the free choice to follow that mode of worship which they may wish;" "that each may have the right to select and to worship whatsoever divinity he pleases;" and commanding that the churches and the church property which had been confiscated under Diocletian, should be restored to "the whole body of Christians" and to each "conventicle respectively."—*Id., book 10, chap. 5.*

This was all just and proper enough, and innocent enough, in itself and on its face; and of that there can be no question at all. But behind it there lay the ecclesiastical organization, ambitious to secure government as a kind of scavengership for itself, and that religio-political intrigue which had been entered into to feed and satisfy the ambition. This ecclesiastical organization likewise claimed to be the legitimate and truly representative "body" of Christianity in the world—it was the Catholic Church. And no sooner had the Edict of Milan been issued, and the restoration of property to the Christians, than it was seized upon and made an issue by which to secure the imperial recognition and the legal establishment of the Catholic Church.

The rule had long before been established that all who did not agree with the bishops of the Catholic Church were not merely heretics, but not Christians at all—it was now claimed by the Catholic Church that therefore non-Catholics were not entitled to any benefit from the edict restoring property to the Christians. In other words, the Catholic Church disputed the right of any others than Catholics to receive property or money under the Edict of Milan, by disputing their right to the title of Christians. And by this issue the Catholic Church forced an imperial decision as to who were Christians. Using the edict of freedom and restoration, and the property involved in this, only to force a conclusion that this decision would be in favor of the Catholic Church; and accordingly, Constantine’s edict to this purpose contained these words:—

> It is our will that when thou shalt receive this letter, if any of these things belonging to the Christians in the several cities or other places, are now possessed either by citizens or by any others, that they be immediately restored to their churches.

But this did not settle the controversy. It only widened it among those claiming to be the Catholic Church. Therefore the emperor was called upon to decide which was the Catholic Church, and the Catholic faith. Later Constantine addressed a letter to those contending, moving more favors upon what he now called "the legitimate and most holy Catholic religion." And no sooner was it decided what "the legitimate and most holy Catholic religion" was, than the civil power was definitely placed at the disposal of this church, with positive injunctions to conform to this power in compelling conformity to the new imperial religion. And persecution was begun at length.

Now was this long in coming. It all occurred in less than four years. The Edict of Milan was issued in the month of March, A.D. 313. Before that month expired, the decision was forced that the imperial favors were for the Catholic Church only. In the autumn of the same year, 313, the first council and its decision which was the Catholic Church. In the summer of 314 at the second council its
