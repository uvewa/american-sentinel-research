# Colonial Charters Establish a Union of Religion and the State.

In this case an English church sent forth a tract to serve a religious body in a municipality. In this, the civil law of the colony was invoked, and it was held that the law had been violated. The case was appealed to the United States Supreme Court.

In this matter the general of decision would seem to have been simple enough. Questions pertaining to religion, or the ecclesiastical tenants of religious bodies, are not within the sphere of congressional legislation. They are not within the province of civil courts. They are excluded by the language, spirit and intent, of the First Amendment to the Constitution.

Legislation by Congress including such matters, and decisions by the Courts in accord, would have been the correct course. But this very Justice Brewer did not take. He look it for granted that Congress may properly legislate as to ministerial and missionary labor, and argued for a restricted interpretation in this case, admitting this class of laborers. Following this division of law,—

There is no dispute as to the class of persons to any legislation, State or Nation, because there is a single voice making this affirmation. In the commission of 1606 to Sir Walter Raleigh in 1584 was from—"Elizabeth, by the grace of God, King and Queen of England, Virginia, France and Ireland," authorizing him to exact statutes for the government of the proposed colony. This the first charter of settlement of any part of what is now the United States was found in the Church of England. The first actual settlement under this was in 1607, in 1606, after seating the application of certain persons "to deduce a colony," a charter was granted, the first condition after the accepting of said Desires for the Furtherance of so noble a work, which may, by the providence of Almighty God, hereafter tend to the glory of his Divine Majesty, in propagating of Christian religion to such people, as yet live in darkness and miserable Ignorance of the true Knowledge and worship of God, and may in time bring the Infidels and Savages living in those parts to human Civility, and to a settled and quiet Government.

A sufficient import may be taken from the substance of charters of that colony. From the same documents the Court then quotes that "the established church," "the national church," in language more or less emphatic is the establishment of the Christian religion. A marked and effective instance was the settlement made by the Pilgrims in the *Mayflower* 1620, their compact commencing with "In the name of God, Amen." "having undertaken for the glory and Honor of our King and Country, A Voyage to plant the first colony in the Northern parts of Virginia. Do by these Presents, solemnly and mutually in the Presence of God and one another, covenant and combine ourselves together into a civil Body Politick, for our better Ordering and Preservation, and Furtherance of the Ends aforesaid."

The fundamental orders of Connecticut, under which a provisional Government was instituted in 1638-39, commence with this declaration: "Forasmuch as it hath pleased the Almighty God by the wise disposition of his divine providence so to Order and dispose of things that we the Inhabitants and Residents of Windsor, Hartford, and Wethersfield are now cohabiting and dwelling in and upon the River of Connectecotte and the lands thereunto adjoining; and well knowing where a people are gathered together the word of God requires that to maintain the peace and union of such people there should be an orderly and decent Government established according to God, to order and dispose of the affairs of the people at all seasons as occasion shall require; doe therefore associate and conjoine ourselves to be as one Publike State or Commonwelth; and doe, for ourselves and our successors, and such as shall be adjoyned to us at any time hereafter, enter into combination and confederation together, to maintain and preserve the liberty and purity of the gospel of our Lord Jesus, which we now profess, as also the discipline of the churches, which according to the truth of the said gospel, is now practised amongst us."

Then to the series of petitions granted by William Penn the Court refers as "reciting" in the language:—"Whereas" or People can best be read in connection with their own religious profession and worship,—and as the example of the Province of West New Jersey—then the Court recites the fundamental law of that province, that "no men, nor number of men upon earth, hath power, or authority to rule over men’s consciences in religious matters;" and then, further, Father’s Light and Spirit, and the Rhode Island Charter of Charles II, which declares complete "liberty in religious concernments," and said, and provides and confirms the same to the inhabitants of the Colony.

Then it is said that the recognition is universal in human affairs in these words: "There is a universal language pervading them all, having one meaning; they affirm and reaffirm that this is a religious nation." From which comes the inevitable result already presented to the courts, yet we find that in *Updegraph vs. The Commonwealth,* 11 S. & R. 394 (1824), it was decided that, "Christianity, general Christianity, is and always has been, a part of the common law of Pennsylvania."

Then—

> "Chambers’ Encyclopædia" says— "Christianity is a part of the common law of England," and is so identified with the Sabbath, see is the subject of statutes in most if not all of the States, especially the Christian Sabbath.

> —Bible "Sabbath"

> *Bishop Jeremy Taylor* thus testifies:

> The primitive Christians did all manner of work upon the Lord’s day in the holy places of divine worship, even in the very times of persecution, when they are the strictest observers of all the divine commandments: they knew no rule but the Scriptures, and the Scriptures said to them "not a rest of a day;" or *1 Cor. 6:12.*

There is sufficient authority for the Sunday Sabbath, Acts 20:7, and John 20:19, 26, and 1 Cor. 16:2, and Rev. 1:10. It is claimed that the disciples met on the first day of the week, and that Christ met and worshiped with them, and that the apostles themselves, in the Christian churches, recognized the same day. From Acts 2:1, it will be seen that the adherent and early Christians at Jerusalem worshiped at the Temple; but this does not prove that all days are Sabbaths and every day a rest day, any more than to make a Sabbath out of it, also the day after is the test of the fact that all weeks are usually held would be a Sabbath.

But there is no proof that the disciples met on the evening of the day of the resurrection to worship. They had no common abode (Acts 1:13), and were partaking of their evening meal when at the place where Christ appeared to them. John says that at the evening of this day "when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the midst, and saith unto them, peace be unto you." John 20:19. Neither did Jesus meet with them to worship, but to show himself to them, that they might be witnesses of his resurrection: "the third day" after his betrayal
