# What Is Rightful Authority?

THE AMERICAN SENTINEL believes in civil government. It firmly holds that every civil government is of God, and exists for the good of mankind, and is to be obeyed in its civil relations and requirements; for there is in its purposes, government, for there is in its purposes, a sure foundation, for there is a guarantee in government of men, that the State has no right to invade. That foundation is, by a revelation, a truth, a revelation from God, regulating the conduct of men in their social and civil relations, and working upon the consciences of men and binds them to the right. This is the true foundation of human government—the exercise of authority over the domain of civil government, on the grounds of this rightful authority of its own. This is the true charter for the domain of civil government.

But no man can surrender his conscience to the keeping of another man or body of men for the purposes of "society" or "social order." Conscience is the most sacred of all things. Conscience is the voice of God speaking loyalty to his God. Governments have in the past laid claim to the domain of conscience; the sequel is the history of persecution and all its attendant evils, and the facts are inseparable from the history. There is no power that has any jurisdiction whatever in religious things to compel a man. Efforts have been made, and they would not carry it in so far as faith is concerned, for no man is to be shorn of it without abandoning their own position by attempting to control the operations of the human will—and it is at once herein lending religious colors to governmental claims. And such claims were not regarded as sacred there would be no martyrs' history in the world. It is not physical rest but religion that is at the bottom of Sunday laws. It is therefore a matter of conscience, purely, and it is for this reason that we oppose any and all Sunday legislation.

God's word is, "Thou shalt not go with a multitude to do evil." Every man must act on his own responsibility, and show, before God, his personal convictions. A quiet confidence, of conscience, a quiet sense of conscience, of a quiet assurance with which the majorities and minorities were held had nothing to do, because rights are just as sacred, and should not be less regarded on account of a multitude. The State properly protects all men alike in the observance of their day; and it surely properly does the same whether they rest or not. If they rest, they apply to all people and to all denominations alike; and when men use law for religious purposes and stopping on Sunday work it is not civil rest—such laws are accessory to the spirit of intolerance, and to the work of persecution. Christian rest and the true Sabbath rest is the property of the inquirer after truth, the patient and by the Christian.
