# Legislative Developments Uniting Religion and the State.

Judging from this unanimous decision it becomes a question, what religious enactment by Congress, what religious decree by civil courts, could be unconstitutional?

The original amendment would have been one way to have no religious establishment and no union of church and State. The measure was however finally lost by a very close vote in Congress.

A few days previous to the presentation of this constitutional amendment to religious education in the United States, May 21, 1888, the same senator presented another bill "to secure to the
