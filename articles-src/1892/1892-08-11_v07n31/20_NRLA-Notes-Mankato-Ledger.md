THE Mankato Ledger says of the passage of the Sunday closing proviso: "It will be a fine victory for the ultra wing of the church people. Their success in this direction will only embolden them to take more active steps toward the enactment of religious legislation having for its object the recognition of Sunday and an enforced attendance by every person of a suitable age, upon Sunday worship. This to be sure is antagonistic to the principles of the Declaration of Independence, and a direct contradiction of the claim that Church and State are independent of each other in the United States. It remains to be seen if the church people who comprise only a fifth of the sixty-five millions of people that make up the population of this Nation, can control and dictate a certain line of policy to the other four-fifths of the population."

That they are already thinking of following up the advantage gained is shown by the words of Rev. J. D. Sand, of Pittsburg, who says of the action of Congress in the World's Fair matter that it "suggests to the Christian's mind that if this may be done so may other needful measures. The Church is gaining power continually and its voice will be heard in the future much oftener than in the past."
