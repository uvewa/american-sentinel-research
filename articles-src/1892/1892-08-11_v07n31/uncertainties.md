## Overall Assessment

This issue's scan quality is lower than ideal. Many articles have passages where individual words are uncertain. A higher-resolution scan would be beneficial for a more accurate transcription. The articles dealing with the World's Fair Sunday closing debate are the most substantive content. The postmaster's letter in article 03 is a notable primary source document.
