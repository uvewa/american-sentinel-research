The United States has claimed to be an example to the world of the success of free institutions. The fundamental theory of the Declaration of Independence and of the Constitution of the United States is the acknowledgment of the natural rights of all mankind. To secure to the citizens the full enjoyment of these natural rights this Government was instituted.

To have succeeded in securing the practical application of this, the only true theory of civil government, and to have placed every citizen in the possession of his absolute rights and have protected them, in that enjoyment, would not have required a greater internal revolution, within the thirteen colonies, than the outward revolution which freed them from the burden of English rule.

The Puritans had felt the heavy hand of religious intolerance placed upon themselves, and had escaped from it. But this did not teach them the first principles of civil in religious matters,—no, not even tolerance. The colonies had felt the weight of civil oppression, and had rebelled. From their experience they learned the correct theory of human rights; they expressed this theory in a governmental formula, but they did not apply it.

To govern their own spirits and deal righteously among themselves is a greater and a more difficult thing for the people of a nation than to take the cities of their enemies. Where a people do not deal justly and equally, each man with his neighbor, civil conditions of internal dissension must come more dangerous than foreign war. Those who fight for justice and equity, and those who go about to do injustice and iniquity can not in all these ways together have peace. If the constitutional theory of a government upholds civil equity, and civil and religious freedom unalloyed, and the government in its statutes and judicial practice is false to its principles, either it will utterly fall, or revolution must purge it.

The general Government of the United States was established upon the principle that all men are born free. The individual colonies had previously and decidedly differed, and in statutes established the difference. This direct antagonism between the social custom of negro slavery and the civil laws upholding it in certain of the States, and the expressed principle of the possession of inalienable rights for all men equally, continued to be more and more of a dissatisfying element in the social system and body politic of this Nation, until the Proclamation of Emancipation was made, and the thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth amendments to the Constitution were adopted.

The first century of national existence had demonstrated that governmental error adopted in block and fire. But painfully with it had sunken another error, as fundamental and even more deeply intertwined in human prejudice, and appealing with greater audacity to the popular mind for support. That was the fallacy of the support of religion and the enforcement of religious forms and doctrines by the civil law. This found its expression in legislative decrees maintaining previously existing laws, drawn from old English statutes enacted under Charles and Stuart rule, for the enforcement of Sunday observance, the punishment of blasphemy, etc., the public maintenance of chaplains for the army, legislative assemblies, and other institutions; the exemption of church property from taxation, and other less prominent legislation respecting religion. Even so:—

That the Constitution had distinctly forbidden to the general Government. The different States, however, were not prohibited from legislating in respect to religion, yet they inserted clauses in their respective bills of rights which mirrored, in almost every case, the spirit of the restriction put upon Congress. At the same time the States permitted the same the taxpayer to stake in this regard between their bills of rights and their statute and municipal law which some of the States had previously permitted to exist between the assertion of the right of all mankind to freedom and national equality before the law, and the legalization of the enslavement of the colored race.

The theory of the Government of the United States was placed upon the equitable principle of equality before the law for all men. The practice of a portion of the States was based upon the assumption that a part of their population had no civil rights which the remainder was bound to respect. This conflict between the constitutional theory and the practice of a portion of the States could not exist in a continuity. In this case revolution and result.
