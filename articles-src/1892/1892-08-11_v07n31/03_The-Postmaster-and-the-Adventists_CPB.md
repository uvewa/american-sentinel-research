A GENTLEMAN in Kansas having read in THE SENTINEL the account of the persecution of Adventists in Henry Co., Tenn., found himself unable to believe that such things possible in the United States in the latter part of the nineteenth century, and, that he might know of a surety concerning the facts, he wrote to the postmaster at Springville, Tenn., asking if the things which he had read were true. The postmaster's letter has been sent to us, and here it is verbatim, without correction of any kind. The only omission being the exception of the omission of the names of the parties to whom the postmaster refers in his answer:

Mr. ------: the yours of the 7th I Recvd I think you will make Out or understand It I will not answer fore I never tell storys that is not So I do not know your Religion or Politics In fact I don't very much whearther the skie is clear or clowdy their has been three Seventh Day adventists tryed hear in our Cort hear for working on Sunday one man paid his fine fur a ariest violasion of the law the Sunday law it is on the Statute Books ther is a man hear for a ariest violation of the law fur Clotyns a pease or signal and he must Com Clar by a Cort trial ther is a man hear that has bin tryed one conviction he is now under an apeal to the Supram Cort in Nashville Tenn he was Charged of workin on Sunday he was Clear of the furst Charge Carrying on Bussiness I do not have any Sympithe with them they all Live within 5 miles of this post oface and he that was Charged with workin on Sunday don't live over one and 3 quorters from this oface it is every Demoralizen to the young of this Cuntrey and the old one too for these advint Senty day adventist they pretend to keep Saturday which they Call their Sunday or Sabath and they are noing better than the Devals about that for them thar Come Sunday they Dont feel oblige too work that they have begun fourt days work on Sunday when they no better than it the Rite thing to do I no them and have bin trying hard to lecessen thare influance and keep the young from them they ware all methodist one in times past at that time got in them there about 17 wives and one man hear now ther is about 35 now ther is 1 Lickin Church house her that was bilt in 83 Octuber But thare is no other church of the Same faith in this Counthy to Bee faund I have bin working against them fur these 3 or 5 years ago fur working on Sunday they had one Case Before the Supream Cort of the State and the Judgement of the Lower Cort was a firmed and they ware defeted In a nother Case that was went to the Supreme Cort in July that they was walking oaver town of Springville after a man Skoald to them and the Destries of other Corts all 2 gainst the law and the destries of other Corts and the destries of some other Earths and the Cort that they will not Com hear any more and wee will Run wee are fighting them as you no rite or Rong and wee will keep thease faroos on Sunday Just Shut as Sunday Boys and wee Can Bee masters of our oun houses and want the Cuntrey to observe the laws of his Cuntry and I think it is rite and need it and Church the Cuntrey in every good and moaly and Church Be made better for it is the Rulen against the law not to observe Sunday the Rest of so maby Cannot tolent it Before I hav enny more to tell you more in the futer it is on the other Side Rite Soon from

This letter confirms all that has been said in THE SENTINEL concerning the Springville persecution. The persecution is directed entirely against the Adventists, and it will be noticed that the postmaster speaks very freely and frankly concerning their faith. Their church, he says, has a very "demoralizen" influence in the community. The sense in which it is "demoralizen" will be explained by the following dialogue between a Methodist and an Adventist in that neighborhood shortly before the recent persecution was inaugurated:---

*Methodist*: "You people are doing a great deal of harm."

*Adventist*: "In what way?"

*Methodist*: "Why, it is not for your church to have regular meetings on Saturday that I object, for that is only your own affair; but it is for your meetings working members from our church we would have no sort of objection to your worship; and if you would close up, all would be well."

*Adventist*: "That's just what we're going to do---keep on preaching the truth."

The "great deal of harm," and the "demoralizing" influences amount to teaching things contrary to the doctrines of the Methodist, Baptist and Presbyterian churches, and principally in denying that Sunday is the Sabbath.

The postmaster at Springville has confessed himself a persecutor. The minister of the Adventist church in his neighborhood, Eld. Stem, of the Springville, Tenn., S.D.A., has spent a number of weeks at the place holding tent meetings, and now with twenty-seven male members of the Adventist church there. The number of female members is somewhat larger. It is the most prosperous church in the neighborhood; and the only one having regular weekly preaching. This fact makes it a thorn in the side of members of other denominations. The persecution is designed to weaken it and turn its tide toward the other churches.

The statement that he is anxious the Adventists in their biggest day's work is nonsense of the first magnitude, as has been previously stated in THE SENTINEL. Such pretense of solicitude for citizens is possibly by a mail annoyance. Only the postmaster knows of that matter; and if the Springville neighborhood on Sunday. The postmaster demonstrates that they know precisely just how this is, for some of his most intelligent neighbors are members of the church and some of the Adventists live in the village. They are well liked, and the postmaster knows of their work can only be in the form of an eye upon their movements and of ears on them at work.
