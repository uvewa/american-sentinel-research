THE Christian Union says of the proposed congressional appropriation for the World's Fair:—

It remains to be seen, however, whether the Fair Managers will accept the condition that goes with it. This condition consists of a proviso, introduced in the Senate, amusingly enough, by Senator Quay, of Pennsylvania, ordering that the Fair shall be absolutely closed on Sunday. The proviso of Senator Peffer, of Kansas, that no intoxicating liquor should be sold within the Fair grounds, was defeated in the Senate. It may fairly be considered a matter of doubt whether it is the province of Congress to determine anything more than the economic expediency of such an appropriation. But if provisos are to be made, Senator Peffer's seems to us wiser and more conducive to good morals than Senator Quay's. For, as the Christian Union has all along contended, the effect of the absolute closing of the Fair on Sunday would be to swell the attendance upon, and profits of, the beer saloons, theaters, and vicious resorts of the city; while, with the machinery stopped and the commercial features and incidental attractions of the Fair closed, the grounds and art galleries might be open, even at a cheap price, with positive benefit to Sunday visitors.

This would be a compromise which the advocates of Sunday closing by act of Congress, have again and again declared they would not accept, and, on the other hand, it would not meet the principle involved, namely, that of entire non-intervention in a religious matter.

Whether he shall show his exhibit or not on Sunday should be a matter of choice with each exhibitor, as it would be any other day of the week. And with those who attend, whether they do or not should be a matter of personal choice, and, properly, no legislation of any kind could interfere. The only positive authority having jurisdiction would be the corporation representing the stockholders and owners.
