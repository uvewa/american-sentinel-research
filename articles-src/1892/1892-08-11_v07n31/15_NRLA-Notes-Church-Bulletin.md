THE Church Bulletin, of South Chicago, has in its issues of June 24 and July 1, a very accurate statement of the facts connected with the arrest and imprisonment of Seventh-day Adventists in Tennessee, together with a sound exposition of the principles involved, and an earnest plea for civil equity, pure and undefiled.
