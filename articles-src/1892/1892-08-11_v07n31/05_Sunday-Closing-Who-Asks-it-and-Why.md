There is very much more to this question of Sunday closing of the World's Fair than most people are aware. Who are making the demands for the closing of the Fair on Sunday? Why do they make these demands? It is the churches, and the foundation reason is because Sunday is an institution of the Church. If it would do violence to their convictions to attend on Sunday, can't they stay away? Or, do they ask a law, fearing that they will be unable to resist the temptation of open gates? Do they need closed gates so they can keep a Sabbath? Why not ask for a law compelling them to stay away on Sunday, and leave others to exercise their freedom? The Jew, Seventh-day Baptist, and Seventh-day Adventist, observe the seventh day of the week; why not close the gates on the seventh day? The Mohammedan keeps Friday; why not close the gates on Friday? Which is the true Sabbath, any way? Who will tell us?

Only a small portion of the people of this Nation keep a Sabbath. Do the Christian people of this land of liberty, desire to resort to force to compel others to do as they do? Do they think these will attend church service if the gates are closed? Do they not know that closed gates mean more patronage to the saloon, more liquor drank, more debauchery, more crime? Do they not know that, if Congress shall take action in the matter, it will be an unwarranted assumption of power, and class legislation? And do not they know that such action of Congress, would be but the beginning of a union of religion and the State that would never be checked till almost every institution of the Church would be incorporated into law, and enforced by the civil power? Are they ready to assume all the consequences of such legislation? Are they?
