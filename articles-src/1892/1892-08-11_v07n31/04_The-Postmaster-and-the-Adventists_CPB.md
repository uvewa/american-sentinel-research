A Gentleman in Kansas having read in The Sentinel the account of the persecution of Adventists in Henry Co., Tenn., found himself unable to believe such things possible in the United States in the latter part of the nineteenth century; and, that he might know of a surety concerning the facts, he wrote to the postmaster at Springville, Tenn., asking if the things which he had read were true. The postmaster's letter has been sent to us, and here it is verbatim, without even a letter added to it, or taken from it, with the exception of the omission of the name of the gentleman to whom the letter was written:—

This letter confirms all that has been said in The Sentinel concerning the Springville persecutions. The writer of the letter is one of the worst enemies of the Adventists, yet it will be noticed that he has no evil thing to say of them except concerning their faith. Their church, he says, has a very demoralizing influence in the community. The sense in which it is "demoralizing" will be explained by the following dialogue between a Methodist and an Adventist in that neighborhood shortly before the recent persecution was inaugurated:—

**Methodist.**—"You people are doing a great deal of harm in this country."

**Adventist.**—"Why, how is that? We are quiet, inoffensive people."

**Methodist.**—"Yes, but were it not for your church we would have regular meetings here at Springville, and all the young people who now go to your meetings would be working members of the Methodist church."

**Adventist.**—"Well, show us our error and we will all be Methodists."

**Methodist.**—"That's just what we're going to do; we're going to prosecute every one of you."

The "great deal of harm," and the "demoralizing" influence consist in teaching things contrary to the doctrines of the Methodist, Baptist and Presbyterian churches, and principally in denying that Sunday is the Sabbath.

The postmaster at Springville has considerably underestimated the membership of the Adventist church in his neighborhood. One of the editors of THE SENTINEL has spent a number of weeks at Springville and is personally acquainted with twenty-seven male members of the Adventist church there. The number of female members is somewhat larger. It is the most prosperous church in the neighborhood; and the only one having regular weekly services. This fact makes it a thorn in the side of members of other churches. The persecution is designed to weaken it and turn the tide toward the other churches.

The statement made in the letter that Adventists do their biggest day's work on Sunday is absolutely false. As has been previously stated in THE SENTINEL, they avoid on Sunday all work that could possibly be a real annoyance. Only the more quiet kinds of farm work are done in the Springville neighborhood on Sunday. The postmaster there may not know personally just how this is, for none of his immediate neighbors are members of that church and none of the Adventists live in the village. They are all farmers and the postmaster knows of their work only as he hears of it or else goes out of his way to see them at work.
