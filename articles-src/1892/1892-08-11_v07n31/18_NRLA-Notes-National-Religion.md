It has not been heretofore understood that this country had a national religion, but instantly, upon the legislation by Congress which shows that to be a fact, there are found those who not only realize it but do not hesitate to say so, in so many words. The Christian Standard says: "And, indeed, that which is precious in our national heritage centers in our national religion." That religion is the religion of which Sunday observance is the distinguishing mark, and that mark all its followers must receive. A careful study of the tenth chapter of Revelation is of much value in this connection.
