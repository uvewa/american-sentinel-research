THIS legislative ignominy has been brought upon the Nation,—and those of its citizens who know what has been done, and they are not few, stand abashed before the world, with arms reversed and the colors of civil liberty trailing in the dust. Care will be taken that from this humiliation they shall know no release, neither as it is thrust upon them in this form nor as it will be in other shapes. The Statesman says:—

The victory is won but the war is not over. The World's Fair management threaten to secure a reversal, next winter or before, of the Sabbath closing action just taken by both Houses of Congress. We must therefore keep up the agitation and education which will make such a reverse impossible.

Several generals in our great war were dismissed because they did not know how to follow up a victory. Let not the friends of the Sabbath neglect to follow up our great victory by local attacks on Sunday toil and traffic and turmoil. This is the very time to attack Sunday saloons and suppress Sunday ball games and Sunday excursions, and to urge those engaged in Sunday traffic to move for their own emancipation.

Yes, in this emancipated country to use the tyranny of misapplied civil law to "urge," Christian men and patriotic citizens "to move for their own emancipation." And this is "the greatest moral victory since emancipation."
