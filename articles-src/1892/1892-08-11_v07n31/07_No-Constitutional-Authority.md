HON. W. C. GATES, of Alabama, in criticising the "rider," or "proviso" attached to the World's Fair appropriation bill to enforce still all. "Bill," Mr. President, Congress has no power which it can exercise in the States of the Union. Suppose that the money is voted in the direction of the World's Columbian Fair Association or Commission, and after it has been distributed and so disbursed, would the United States have any right to enforce? None whatever. It absolutely has no power to enforce either of the conditions proposed. This is the hottest summer I have ever experienced. The United States vs. Dewitt; 9 Wallace Reports, in a ruling by Chief Justice Chase, established authority for this proposed legislation of Congress. As was said by Chief Justice Chase, in that case: it is a police regulation, is without logical or satisfactory scope; it is a violation of the essentially all State authority, as is the State of Maryland, of China, and wherever we have proposed since then.

It can have no constitutional operation."
