THE *Christian Statesman* and the *Union Signal* have denied that the brewers and saloon-keepers of Chicago are in favor of Sunday closing of the Fair, but it is authenticated by the brewers and the saloonists themselves and by the testimony of those who have taken pains to learn their views. The following matter is from the Chicago *Herald*:---

At the mass meeting that settled the attitude of the combined saloon interests on the subject of Sunday closing of the World's Fair, said it. B. Smalley, a saloon-keeper, to a reporter at the National Hotel: "The brewers and saloon men are in favor of closing the Fair on Sunday. We'll lose very little by having the Fair closed on that day, and if necessary they would put up another half million dollars to see that the gates were closed. If the Fair is open to all the people, if detached from inspection of any kind, the people will want to stay home in their bar rooms, that will not be closed Sundays, and the beer gardens will thrive as never before;" also, advocates the proposition from the same selfish standpoint. He argues, that if the Fair is open on Sunday the working people would not remain in the rum shops, but would, after spending their money in the saloons of the World's Fair and its vicinity, go home; but that, on the other hand, if the gates were kept closed, the people would remain in their home neighborhood, and the home saloon-keeper would be the man to reap the profit. As stated on a former occasion in almost any way that was convenient. If the Fair is open on Sunday, the saloonists would say let the Government keep in money; if the gates are closed they would say nothing. The Fair is essentially a place of no small saloon attractions to a permanent and illiterate spirit of license in a great and an illiterate community and freedom.

The promise of any appropriation on condition of Sunday closing is simply a recognition of the Church demand. The Managers of the Exposition, offered by the religious element, is merely a concession to the Church factions of the United States. The closing of the Fair is in a measure enforced observance of a particular religious tenet. The Congress of the United States is certainly in a very peculiar position in the matter.
