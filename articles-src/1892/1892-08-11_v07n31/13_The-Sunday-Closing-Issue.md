THE Senate, on July 14, and the House, on July 19, both by decisive majorities, and on Aug. 5, received the signature of the President of the United States.

And it is hereby decreed that all appropriations herein made for or pertaining to the World's Columbian Exposition are made under the conditions that the said Exposition shall not be opened on Sunday, and if the said appropriations be accepted, the said Exposition shall not be opened on Sundays, and if the said appropriations to the World's Columbian Exposition upon grounds to be established it shall be so ordered, in other words, in full, and the appropriation created by the act of Congress of April 25, 1890, as therein provided, shall not be paid by the United States unless the gates of the exposition, commencing on the said first day of the week, commencing on Sunday.

This is now the law.

The Congress of the United States, both Houses, has legislated upon religion. By the quickest inflection of the country, men of broad education, trained intelligence, and the calm and decided and patriotic action of the statesmen the ability of the forty-four States of the Union, have, by a large majority, adopted a measure respecting the establishment of religion.

THERE even seem to be a solemn trust, to suppose the Constitution of the United States, have been threatened, cajoled, ridiculed, into thus proving false to that trust and the shameful acknowledgment is hailed by the *Christian Statesmen* as "the greatest modern victory since emancipation." The truth is that as emancipation gave freedom from physical enslavement to eight millions of blacks so this marks the beginning of the governmental enforcement of the consciences of sixty-five millions of all colors and races now resident in the United States, and the millions yet to come. Instead of the two things---emancipation of the slave race and the passage of religious legislation by Congress---being parallel measures for comparison, they represent opposites. The first echoed the constitutional principle of the natural freedom and equality of all men and was indeed civil liberty; but the last contravenes the Constitution and natural justice, and establishes civil inequity and religious despotism. The first movement rescued the Constitution its only inconsistency and did away with the shame of the Nation; the last is an irremediable blot upon the proceedings of the national Legislature, and puts disgrace upon a free people.

This legislative ingenuity has been brought upon the Nation,---and those of its citizens who know what has been done, and they are not few, stand shocked before the world, with arms reversed and the colors of civil liberty trailing in the dust. Care will be taken that from this humiliation they shall know yet release; neither as it is thrust upon them in the form now or as it will in other shapes.

The *Statesmen* says:---

The victory was but the war is not over. The bill should be followed up by such other legislation as may be needed to make it effective, and the just petitions from both houses of Congress. We must not stop until the Sabbath closing of the Fair is secured.

Several generals in our great war were dismissed because of a lack of willingness to follow up a victory. Let not the friends of the Sabbath neglect or fail to profit by their example. This is no time to rest. Let every Sabbath and religious paper urge very close to attack Sunday misers and suppress every violation of the Sunday law and to establish their own emancipation.

Now in this connection, what can we do to counter the tyranny of misapplied civil law and to "urge," "Christian men and patriotic citizens to work for their fair emancipation." And this is "the greatest modern victory since emancipation."

This is the threat which this arrogant minority identified by the *Statesmen* here as "three score thousand preachers and a hundred religious papers and the religious forces of the country are against the Exposition." And of these "three score thousand" preachers, the great majority is not among these at all. Of the religious forces of the country which assert their divine right of dissent from their own religious folly and political error.

To reduce the half million would be to expect the impossible, if we were speaking of the people of the United States. In that case not only would the churches lose the authority of the action being partisan also; because of its discernible religious character.

The more than two thirds vote of both Houses of Congress was not because two thirds of the members believed the required legislation just. Not because such observation does not represent American sentiment. Not because of a desire to increase the financial income of the Fair by proposals to compel closing the gate on the best day for a collection of the arts of the Sabbath. Practically, as well as legally, practically everyone of the members of both houses voted, according to his conscience. But even to condemn rather than committed it.

Here is again heard the voice of the *Statesmen*, which when the "Statesmen" before raised to cry,---Boycott, and let loose the dogs of war, if Congress or Commissions shall fail to accede to our wishes. We shall rule or we shall ruin.---The Publishing preachers are also intent on that.

It is heard to-day at Hummelsted, and Dauphin, at Corydon of Alabama, and in the Anarchist halls where Mort, and Berkman, and De Throns, and Herr Roshold Goldman are accustomed to give tongue like the wolves of society that they are.

It is the Chicago Directory has but authority rightfully in this matter, and this both Congress, and Commission, and Statesmen all well know. But if this Directory should dare to exercise its rightful and lawful authority! But if,---and what then?

If a Chicago Directory should certainly present a case a fully as the refusal of the constitutional separation, the national Commission, representing the United States, which would be thus humiliated, would own such interference, as it has the power to do, in its automatic morning, to whom around July. October, it is bossing on Sabbath closing the fair be opened, which at may be as well to million to offer that the vote for the Sabbath closing of the fair shall be taken as but an offer to a great and general make; may be promptly and strongly made; and will show to the world what this movement means, to demonstrate the power of the religious forces, of the opening of the World's Fair grounds on that day was in the interest of those who attend.

This is a new theory of the prerogative of Congress and the committees of the opposition. It means that when Congress takes an appropriation, saddled with the religious character or distinctive preconditions, it is not only "folly" and "madness" which protests against it. Not only is the unconstitutionality of such legislation beyond its acceptance, but a committee, appointed by Congress, may vote this refusal and compel its acceptance with severe views and all. Certainly under such a theory it would be a terrible thing to fall under governmental favor. And so it is, and will be from this time on,---for the precedent has taken sides in the Great Controversy, and it has taken the wrong side.

THE August *Arena* devotes the second installment of Mr. Monk's Brief for the Defendant in the Historical Discussion of Jesus vs. Breckinridge. Whatever may be said of the authorities' central use of the writings, no one can fail to be impressed with the ingenuity and point of Mr. Monk's argument. He had advocated in behalf of Lord Bacon and Mr. Morse the theory of a most excellent and of the parties it is at the most interesting reading. "However, we may not yet fail to the satisfaction as to what we shall answer objections, to any one interested in the discussion. In the near future public discussions of the subjects, meetings, and public activities. And private correspondence with scholars and friends both this country and in all parts of Europe, have continued uninterrupted, and recent numbers and papers in the August *Arena* are especially interesting to students of this subject. Among them, Geo. Fred. Williams, M. G., the Hon. G. V. N. Lothrop, formerly U.S. Minister to Russia; Prof. J. A. Livingston, Josiah H. Clarke, M. D.; L. J. Lachbrook, Prof. S. P. Langley, Morley, de Hartington, Gardner E. E. Russell, and the editor of the *Arena*, B. O. Flower. Students are interested in a brilliant symposium on "Is the age of the Modern Christian. Is it the occasion whether the world in America to know the Churches in
