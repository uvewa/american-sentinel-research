THIS is the threat which this arrogant minority described by the Statesmen here as "three score thousand preachers and a thousand religious papers" holds out to Chicago, the World's Fair management, and the calm minded and patriotic intelligence of the country which may assert its divine right of dissent from their fatal religious folly and political error:—

To refuse the half million would be to cancel the Government exhibit and so black ball the Government. Chicago can not afford to give the "bluff" to the United States. In that case not only would Christians boycott the Fair because of Sunday opening, but patriots also, because of its discourtesy to the Government.

If the Management are wise they will discover in the more than two-thirds vote of both Houses of Congress against Sunday opening, that Chicago is not the United States, and in the matter of Sabbath observance does not represent American sentiment; and they will not further endanger the financial success of the Fair by proposals to override the wholesome laws and customs of our country, but will promptly accept the people's verdict as to the Sabbath.

Financially, as well as morally, it is a blunder to give three score thousand preachers and a thousand religious papers so many causes to condemn rather than commend the Columbian Exhibition.

Here is again heard the voice of the "Pittsburg preachers" which has been before raised to cry,—Boycott, and let loose the dogs of war, if Congress or Commission shall fail to accede to our demand. We shall rule or we shall ruin.—The Pittsburg preachers are not alone in that cry. It is heard to-day at Homestead, at Duquesne, at Coeur d'Alene, and in the Anarchist halls where Most, and Berkman, and Mrs. Parsons, and Emma Goldman are accustomed to give tongue like the wolves of society that they are.
