WHAT does the senator mean by "the religious sentiment" of the people and of the country that the World's Fair management must respect? and what is the senator's idea? What is the religious sentiment? That's the question. So far as we can see, the religious sentiment in favor of Sunday closing that has been heard in the corridors of Congress has sprung from two hundred religions from about two million religionists probably, if not altogether from the so-called evangelical churches. Assuming that these petitions represent the entire body of their several churches there will then stand the Baptists and Lutherans, Protestant Episcopalians, Lutherans and Universalists who have either not declared themselves at all on this question, or as have spoken in favor of open Sundays. These amount, according to the census of 1890, to as follows:

Roman Catholics 6,257,871
Protestant Episcopalians 532,054
Lutherans 1,231,072

This is nearly half of the 31,757,681 total communicants of all religious bodies in America. If these be added to the nearly half of communicants of other churches who are not communicant members of churches and the larger proportion of actual churches who do not favor closed Sunday. It will be seen that the Senator Colquitt has spoken loosely in speaking of the sentiment of the people of this country. "The religious sentiment of the country" is not, so far as it expresses itself, in favor of closing the Fair on Sunday.

But let us grant that the Union Signal and the *Christian Statesman* are right, and Senator Colquitt to say that 50,000,000 of the people are in favor of closed Sunday, does anything less than the population amount to the keeping of the remaining millions of 15,000,000? That is not democracy, and were republican. This majority rule is republican. "Change Forces on Prayer."
