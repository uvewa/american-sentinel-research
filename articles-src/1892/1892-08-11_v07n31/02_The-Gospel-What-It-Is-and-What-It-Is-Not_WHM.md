# The Gospel: What It Is, and What It Is Not; As Opposed to the Mystery.

"And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto Me in heaven and in earth. Go ye, therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost; teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world." Matt. 28:18-20.

That which they were to teach all nations is spoken of by Mark as "the gospel;" and so the commission includes preaching the gospel to every creature. He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; he that believeth not shall be damned. But where in Luke, the Saviour at the beginning carries the instruction back to the city of Jerusalem, until "ye be endued with power from on high." Luke 24:49. Then in Acts 1:5-8:—

"For John truly baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence. . . . Ye shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you; and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth."

All these verses are essential for us to know the full form of the commission which the Lord gave his disciples at that time. They were to go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature; and teach, and baptize, etc.; but they were not to go until they were endued with power from on high. It would have been useless for them to go until that time, because the gospel is until the power of God unto salvation, and the preaching of the gospel is the preaching of the power of God unto salvation in every one that believeth. For it was so far from thinking to preach the power of God when they themselves were not acquainted, that power, and were not endowed with that power, would have been to not preach the gospel. Because it would not have been the gospel, because the gospel is the power of God,—that is what the Lord himself had called it,—the power of God unto salvation. And so to preach that gospel, I say again, is to preach the power of God. It is not the preaching of that gospel, which is not the preaching of the power of God. It is not the preaching of the gospel of God at all, it is not the preaching of the gospel of Christ. It is not for me to preach the gospel of Christ, for he is the power of God, the wisdom of God. And it is not the preaching of the gospel of Christ. Let me go by myself; it may be preaching another gospel; but it is not the preaching of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Therefore he would not have them go at all, to say anything about this, to attempt to preach it, until they were so clad with the power of that gospel itself, the power of God, the power from on high. Then when they should preach that power, the Holy Ghost coming upon them—then in that day they should have things in Jerusalem, in Judea, in Samaria, and unto the uttermost parts of the earth.

Now when Paul came to Corinth, beginning with the 17th verse, is Paul's record of the preaching of the gospel; and what he was called to preach: "For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect." Then was Paul; the preaching of the gospel was the preaching of the cross of Christ. Next verse:— "For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God." Then the preaching of the gospel is the preaching of the cross of Christ, and the preaching of the cross of Christ is the power of God; for Christ is the power of God, as he is also the wisdom of God. So I read on:—

"For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent. Where is the wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the disputer of this world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world? For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe. For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom; but we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumbling-block, and unto the Greeks foolishness."

The Greeks sought after wisdom, and the Lord sent them that which they called foolishness. The Jews required a sign, and the Lord gave them a crucified Saviour, which turned out only into a stumbling-block. The Lord sent no sign to the Greeks, and God gave it; but they would not receive it; they stumbled at the stumbling-stone. The Jews required a sign, and God gave no sign, because he would not do it because it came not just as they wanted; and the Greeks sought after wisdom, after wisdom, and got no good of it. "Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men."

Now, "We preach Christ crucified." There they are then as we said before, Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God. "For what is weak and foolish in man is stronger than man" and is greater, because the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than man, therefore they were not to preach weakness; they were not to preach weakness; even the power of God was counted by men foolishness.

But even if they had lost, even to preach the weakness of God, it would be stronger than anything that men can do or know. Then the thing for men to do is to accept the foolishness, so to speak, and not try to make it wisdom; to accept it; for even though it be counted the weakness of God, it is stronger than anything man can hold of, or create anything.

Then they sought after wisdom, and the Lord sent them Wisdom; he sent them Christ, the wisdom of God. He sent them the same, wisdom, the cross of Christ; but they counted it foolishness. Yet they, though they did, they should have accepted it; for the foolishness of God is wiser than men; so anything they would or could know otherwise. Then when God sends a message, no difference how to men it was, we are to accept it. When God sends a message, we are to accept it in trust; when we count it weakness, for it is stronger than we. When God sends a message from God, it will not turn anybody. Even though it be counted foolishness, that has nothing to do with it; for the foolishness of God is foolishness on God's part, but man calls it foolishness. But even at worst, if it came from God, then why not accept it because it is more than anything that is or anything ever got hold of, or ever could.

Then I say again, what takes man; I say, no difference how men view it, or what we think of it, is to accept it, and accept of it; and then they will find out it is not the weakness of God, it is not foolish at all; it is the power of God; it is wisdom; because the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.

So many men are after the fact, not many men after wisdom and knowledge; God chose the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things that are mighty.

So with the weak things of the world to confound those that are mighty, and the foolish things of the world that have the power of God; and that will confound the wise. Then what the foolish and confounded the things of the world. "And the base things of the world and things which are despised hath God chosen, yea, and things which are not, to bring to naught things that are, that no flesh should glory in His presence."

"For I determined not to know anything among you save Jesus Christ, and him crucified." That is all any one can know. "I determined not to know anything among you save Jesus Christ and him crucified. That is the Christ there, not just Him, in that gospel; that is all there is of God. "And I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling. And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit, and of power of God." "That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of God."

"Not in the wisdom of men." The wisdom of men will fail. Any faith that rests in the wisdom of men will fail. Every faith will fail but that which rests on the power of God. Now, when the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and rests upon that, and in that, then a faith that rests in the weakness of God will be an argument that is stronger than anything. But let us do better than that. Let us accept the power and the wisdom from the power, and not for the form from the nominal. Practically and truly from the theoretical. The power of demonstrations and the power of rhetorical demonstrations are two different things. Those that are brought those who are not by the preaching of a theory but who are not by the preaching of something.
