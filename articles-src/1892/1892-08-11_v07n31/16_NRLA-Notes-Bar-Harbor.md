It seems that the president of the American Sabbath Union is summering in Bar Harbor. A special dispatch to the World says: "The non-observance of Sunday at Bar Harbor shocks Mr. Shepard, and it is rumored that he is going to bring the old neglected Blue Laws to the front again, and have things closed up on the Lord's day. An excursion of over fifteen hundred people was in town to-day (Sunday) from all along the Maine Central Railway, and it hurt Mr. Shepard's feelings to see them."
