It is the Chicago Directory that has authority rightfully in this matter, and this both Congress, and Commission, and Statesman all well know. But if this Directory should dare to exercise its rightful and lawful authority! But if,—and what then?

If the Chicago Directory should seriously propose such a folly as the refusal of the conditioned appropriation, the national Commission, representing the United States, which would be thus insulted, would veto such madness, as it has the power to do, at its autumn meeting, on whose second day, October 6, a hearing on Sabbath closing has been appointed, which it may be well to utilize in order that the rule for the Sabbath closing of the gates, which Congress has required its Commission to make, may be promptly and strongly made; and also, if possible, a further veto, that logically follows, of the opening of the World's Fair grounds in advance of the Fair for Sunday picnics.

This is a new theory of the prerogative of Congress and the committees of its appointment. It seems when Congress makes an appropriation, saddled with whatever obnoxious or destructive provisions, it is not only "folly" and "madness" for the unfortunate recipient to refuse its acceptance, but a committee, appointed by Congress, may veto this refusal and compel its acceptance, provisos and all. Certainly under such a theory it would be a terrible thing to fall under governmental favor. And so it is, and will be from this time on,—for the Government has taken sides in the Great Controversy, and it has taken the wrong side.
