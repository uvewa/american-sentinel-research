THERE is very much more to this question of Sunday closing of the World's Fair than appears on the surface. Who are making the demands for the closing of the Fair on Sunday? Why do they make this demand? Is it the churches, and the foundation reason the desire to have Sunday observed as a rest day, a Sabbath, an institution of the Church. If it would do no harm but good for people to work on Sunday, can't they stay away? Or, so they ask, having found that they can't stay away from the Fair on Sunday, what shall they do? Do they send their gazes or their thoughts that way? Is there any civil law compelling them to stay away on other days? Where then is their religious freedom? The Jew, Seventh-day Baptist, and Seventh-day Adventist, all observe the seventh day of the week; why not close the gates on the seventh day? Do the Methodists keep their doors shut on Friday? Do the Immersionists keep Friday? why not close the Fair on Friday? Where is that to end, some will say? Who will tell us? Only a small portion of the people of this Nation keep or Sabbath. Do the Christian people of this land of liberty demand the closing of the World's Fair? Why do they? Do they think those Sabbathless people would be better with the Fair closed? Do they not know that closed gates mean more patronage to the saloons, more liquor drunk, more debauchery, more crime? Do they not know that, if Congress shall take action in the matter, that it will be an unwarrantable assumption of power, and class legislation? And if not, who will tell what closing the World's Fair would be but the beginning of a union of Church and State that would end in having to be churched till almost every institution. The church would be incorporated into law, and enforced by the civil power! Then they read to enforce all the tenets and practices of such institutions. Are they "a Prologue to an Entire Drama?"

that there are theaters open in Chicago. I had not supposed when they were not but I did not suppose that any court of legal censure, whatever might be said, I think, to permit of doubt of the kind. But in Maine, in populous cities, I have no doubt amusements are indulged in, not perhaps to the same extent; but amusements are so docile permissible on Sunday according to the customs of the Senator's own State.

However, there is another view of this matter. Mr. President, that is to be its international exhibition. We opened it as a mere show. It is to be a great national event. As a national event. I say an event that is to be far more than national. The Columbian Exposition is an international event. It is to be the celebration of an event which has concerned the welfare and the destinies of mankind more than any other which has occurred within the history of our race since the resurrection of the Lord or the Sabbath---the discovery of this vast continent, now inhabited by perhaps a larger amount of free people, than all the other continents---and we are inviting men from all sections and every government. In the Chicago the representatives, I was about to say, of every civilized government, there will be representatives of the Exposition of those of uncivilization in the islands of the sea, and the Indians, the continental nations of the earth as one spot celebrating the grand event in the earth's latter history.

I maintain that therefore the law that each man shall be allowed to pursue his own views of duty, being compelled to be kept in the same condition, there was no proper law applied to this subject. In reserve for the Sunday of the Sabbath, it is not meant to allow it to be turned for a purpose. I have sufficient regard for the Sunday institution and its sacred character, and my right to impose my opinion upon my fellow citizens compels me to say to you shall on this day leave me undisturbed, and leave Christian men undisturbed; that you shall leave the sanctuary undisturbed; and leave whatever men must honestly be together for devotion, or I may any movement on that day they shall be undisturbed. What more can be asked? If I could be satisfied with any portion of the power of the Almighty perhaps I might go to them, but I no longer preyed, but hoped; and I had nothing to say. I merely desired events according to the law of the land.

Let that occasion be national, international; let it be regarded upon this continent insisted upon later in winter; but if it shall be continued the question of how it shall be done, it is the business of the people of this country.

I have been told, and I have no doubt it is true, that many of the Christian citizens of Chicago urged that this proposition and got no satisfaction from them. The fourth day is not the holy day. There are a few others who say that it should not be a holy one. There are many who think the Legislature has no right to dictate who think that this opportunity afforded to the laborer, to the toiler today, and his wife and his children, ought not to be stopped.

But I am told that there is another side to this matter and it is not about the good people. I understand that all the saloon keepers in Chicago are in favor of closing this institution on the Sabbath day. I can understand why it should be so. The multitudes that will go to Chicago at that time, instead of going to the Fair, and witnessing the Exhibition, being there alone, strangers, will go about the saloons and places of that sort on Sunday. I understand that there is a perfect agreement on that point, and the Fair on the Sabbath.

I have one thing to say in conclusion. There are gentlemen who talk about the American Sabbath. Mr. President, I have no sympathy with the foreign sentiment; American sentiment is not of the nature foreign; I do believe that American sentiment and the subsequent challenge to the influence of broader views of individual rights. New England and at one time actually required a very close observance of the Sabbath---a Puritanical observance---but it was for Sabbath inspectors, not of God, but of church, and it is a remarkable fact that that community in New England---I speak of the northern portion of the Union, where more liberal views are indulged, the tendency of the people was as complete and as perfect.

I want to say that it has always been remarkable that in New England where the liberty of the individual was most regarded, the government was most liberal, and where the most complete abolitionist ideas were to enter certain recognized, actually, personal liberty was better protected than in New England. The change has taken place and we cannot resist it. We may talk about it, we may disagree with it; there is some truth in it, and it deserves reverence, but it is for me to reverse the Sabbath, and it is not for me to impose upon another that obligation.

F. W. HOWE.
