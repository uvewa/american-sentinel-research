THE propriety of Sunday bicycle riding has become a matter for the decision of the courts in Connecticut. The following special dispatch appears in the New York Sun from Bridgeport, Conn.:—

"At Fairfield to-day a case came before Justice John L. Morehouse, which not only interests thousands of wheelmen in Connecticut, but also will be watched closely by those who are in favor of enforcing the old Blue Laws. On complaint of Grand Juror J. D. Toomey, a young crockery merchant of this city, who resides in Fairfield, was arrested charged with several offenses, one of them being 'that on July 17, the same day being the Sabbath and the Lord's day, the said Osborne did indulge in the vain sport and recreation of riding a certain vehicle known as a bicycle, greatly to the disturbance of the peace, and contrary to the statute in such cases made and provided.'"

"Osborne was riding from his store to his home when arrested.

"Stratford residents are also interested in the suit, as the good and quiet old town has recently been invaded by a horse railway, over which cars are run on the Sabbath, greatly to the annoyance and disturbance of the remnants of previous generations. Thousands of Bridgeport working men and their families patronize the line every Sunday, and wander for hours on the broad streets, which are shaded by magnificent elms. The Stratford authorities have succumbed to the influence brought to bear, until all the ice cream saloons, cigar stores, and drug stores have been closed on the Lord's day.

"Yesterday one of the old-time residents, whose wife was seriously ill, tried unsuccessfully to induce a druggist to open his doors in order that a necessary dose of medicine might be obtained. As the applicant for drugs had been one of the foremost in compelling the druggist to take a rest on the Sabbath, he was allowed to take one of the horrid horse cars to this city."
