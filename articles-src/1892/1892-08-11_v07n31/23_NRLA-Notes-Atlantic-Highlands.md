THE little State of New Jersey seems anxious to make for itself a reputation in the strict enforcement of Sunday laws. A dispatch from Atlantic Highlands says:—

"Most of the people here are greatly incensed over an attempt to enforce the old Blue Laws of New Jersey. Last Saturday all the ice cream saloons, restaurants, news stands, barber shops, fruit stands, and cigar stores were ordered to close on Sunday. Even the butchers and fish dealers were requested not to open Sabbath morning, or to deliver goods ordered the day before.

"On Sunday most of the small dealers were closed, not a cigar sold to strangers. But one ice cream dealer adopted the New York liquor dealers' practice, and kept his back door open.

"All the drug stores were open, but sold no cigars, and scarcely any soda water. The news dealers were permitted to deliver papers to customers, but not to sell on the streets.

"There are fifteen thousand people here, and this law does not please them.

"Another ordinance passed by the mayor and commissioners is that no Sunday bathing be allowed after 9 A. M. Last Sunday all but one of the bathing establishments were closed, and the hundreds who went down to this one place could not be accommodated. Many walked a mile and over along the beach to Neversink Park, where they could bathe, but had no bath houses to disrobe in."
