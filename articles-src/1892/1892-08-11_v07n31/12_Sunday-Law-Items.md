THE *Machinist Ledger* says of the passage of the Sunday closing provision: "It will be a fine victory for the blue law element. Its practical success in this direction will only embolden them to take an active interest in securing the enactment of more stringent given legislation having for its object the reception of Sunday and an enforced attendance by every person of a suitable age, upon Sunday worship in some church or other. The thing is a direct contradiction of the principle of the Declaration of Independence, and a direct contradiction of the claim that Church and State are separate and distinct in the United States. It remains to be seen if the church people have the power for what they have no right---if the people of that make up the population of this Nation to control the worship of the minority, to the other four fifths of the population.

That they are already thinking of following up the advantages gained is shown by the words of J. B. Seal of Financier, who says of the action of Congress in the World's Fair matter that it should be "followed up" by "such legislation as may be done in many other needful measures. The Church's getting power over conscience and its voice will be heard in the future much oftener than in the past."

The property of Sunday bicycle riding has been causing no small degree of discussion in Connecticut. The following special dispatch appears in the New York *Sun* from Bridgeport, Conn.:---

"At Fairfield to-day a case came before Justice John J. MacKenzie, who is not only justice of the peace, but a considerable dealer in bicycles. The maker of the complaint made his from a single member of a church not identified. He had been warned by the old Blue Laws. On complaint of Grand Juror S. Sherwood Wakeman, a resident of this city, who resides in Fairfield, was arrested charged with several offences, one of them riding a bicycle on Sunday. The complaint also charged: "that on July 17, the same day being the Sabbath or the Lord's day, the said [Charles did] indulge in the exercise of the body, by riding upon a vehicle known as a bicycle, greatly to the disturbance of others who were observing the same day." The case was made and provided.

Cases of a similar nature from this site to him so is where arrested.

Stratford residents also are interested in the wheelmen, as the good and quiet old town has recently been turned to a horse race history, over whose course are run on the Sabbath, greatly to the annoyance and disturbance of the community among Congregationalists. Thousands of Bridgeport working men and their families patronize the fine river every Sunday, and travel miles along the beautiful country roads, shaded by magnificent elms. The Stratford authorities are determined that no sound of hilarity shall be hear, until all the ice cream saloons, cigar stores, and the soda water fountains are shut up.

Yesterday one of the old time residents, whose ancestors came from England, was approached by a druggist to open his doors in order that a newspaper who is as an established enterprise. When the applicant for drugs had been one of the foremost in agitating the blue law craze, and for the sake of the faith, he was allowed to take one of the herbal home remedies.

The *Christian Union* says of the proposed congressional appropriation for the World's Fair:---

It remains to be seen, however, whether the Fair should be opened on Sunday. The proposition is not a new one. This condition consists of a proviso, introduced by Senator Quay, Senator Hiscock, of Pennsylvania, ordering closing the Fair shall be observed within the Fair ground. The provision of money should be sold within the Fair grounds, was defeated in the Senate today. The Fair grounds were a

matter of doubt whether it is the provision of Congress to determine practically anything more than the condition of its provision to be made. Simply further service is needed in an opinion. The Senate has given us more than Senator Quay's. For, as the *Christian Union* has said, whether it is the right of Congress to close the Fair, "it is more than doubtful; but the famous and incidental attractions of the Fair in the interest of art, science and industry represent their advantages at a cheap price with positive benefits to Sun-day visitors."

This would be a strangely strong concession that Sunday closing by act of Congress, have again come face to face with a situation of its importance. On the other hand, it would not meet the principle of a religious matter.

Whether he shall show his exhibit or not on that day should be a matter of choice with each exhibitor. It would be just the right of him that he and those who attend, whether they do so and should not be a matter of forced attendance. His property, no legislation of any kind could interfere would be the corporation representing the stock interest.

THE little State of New Jersey seems anxious to have a monopoly of the prosecution for violation of Sunday laws. A dispatch from Atlantic City says:---

Most of the people here are greatly incensed over an attempt on the part of certain zealots in New Jersey. Last Saturday all the ice cream stands, all the restaurants, news stands, barber shops, bath houses, and cigar stores were ordered to close on Sunday. The butchers and fish dealers were also requested not to open Saturday morning, or to let the goods obtained the day before.

On Sunday most of the small dealers shut up, as a sign of state and its advantages. But one too resist the mandates of the law. The resort of the enterprise, and kept his back door open.

This, however, was met on the border of severity and necessity, and scarcely any soda water. The barns dances were permitted by deference to the custom.

Those who offended displeased people, and their lines do not please them.

This *Washington Post*, reprinted by the mayor and his successor his businessmen to that no Sunday bathing be allowed after 1 o'clock. Last Sunday he let one of his fish bathing establishments were closed, and this landowners and bathers were in this case disposed to be submitting. Mostly visitors and residents drove out by the roads to Riverside Park, where they enjoyed unchecked all the pleasures of bathing.

This Washington Post State (called "Entered Blue Laws," has the following:---

"The history of the pen of the blue bill literature in material to Congress is quite long---it is a genuine chapter of blue legislation.

"Another old law, with hoary and aged wilfulness is that barring Sunday labor for the working people. The penalty provided is imprisonment without fine.

"There is another law making it a penal offence to play cards, dice, or any game whatever. This law can be overturned in a most alarming moment. Sunday school, prayer meeting, the singing class---all these violate this law directly. You know for well that any of these forms of entertainment."

"The old Blue Law bars in reference to this district are of a singular character, and are especially appropriate. One of them prescribes the use of no gas or electric lights on Sunday nights, no street cars on Sunday night, and all saloons shall keep their stores open. For the first offense the penalty provides a fine, in heavy fines and the closing. One cannot condemn the law lightly in this light of it, nor condemn Mr. Hussey's, 'I believe in enforcing all the laws,' without a smile. The fair enforcement of our obsolete Sunday legislation, including the blue law themselves would ruffle Congress and they would become a dead letter."

Yet, notwithstanding, Congress hastens to pass new Sunday laws---for the District.
