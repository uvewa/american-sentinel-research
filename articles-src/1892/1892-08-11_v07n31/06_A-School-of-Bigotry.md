UNDER heads in leading articles on the subject of closing the Fair, the *Sabbath Recorder* (organ of the Seventh-day Baptists of the City of New York):---

"We earnestly hope that the church members will not be deceived by the Sunday-rest-for-working-men excuse, believing that Saturday is the day on which the Creator rested, and He declared that the seventh day should be the Sabbath, the churches that day religiously keep the Sabbath."

In the exercise of this claim the churches claim their right to enforce religious observance upon men by law, and in default of payment, have been more or less the result of secular legislation, and arrest those unable to pay their fines, and confiscate their property. This assumption that men must usually pay their fines or be imprisoned, is another species of religious persecution by the churches. "Let them choose their consciences by compulsion."

At first the judicial but unjust oppressive laws against Sabbath observers are enacted, and a law which simply limits certain business operations on the first day of the week to the disadvantage of all.

"The seventh day is the Sabbath," they say, "and we must observe it; we must rest, and our employees must rest; and therefore we must not work and get wages, to five days in the week; which compels us to keep two Sabbaths or lose one day's wages." In some localities the provisions of our law being as it is, the Sunday savings or labor laws are plainly unjust to the Sabbath keeper; and we need, then, to consider their case, and advise, when to call it, in this particular, our constitutional right of religious liberty, violated.

The Churchman does not much directly concern itself with matters involving the Sabbath, yet a convention of the Protestant Episcopal Church of America. "And when the church takes hold of affairs outside her own affairs, it is well to do so in a very business-like and modern way in framing its conclusions."

"But," it says, "this is very well. And we should claim that it is never well. And for our church to endorse, through its national deliberation, a claim that has no foundation in the Scriptures, and to call upon the State to enforce that which the Word of God does not require, is to place the church in a false position. The Churchman is right in saying that the church should not invoke State legislation upon what is purely a religious question, and to claim exemption from competition with which he is now struggling. What about the 'seventh-day religionists' who have committed that act as a duty which they believe they owe to God and which they believe they owe to God rather than man. It is in itself a sin, they believe, to observe the first day of the week in that manner. Their position is one of conscientious objection." While it is in compliance with formal, judicial secularism only. "Whether there be such scrupulous individuals as religious objectors, the fact that there are the occurrences mentioned, and in future will be added to, demands the repeal of laws which caused them. And, at least in Illinois without a blanks," that is, the exemption clause.

Observe the gracious admission that a man who conscientiously rests on Saturday, work on Saturday might be open to the man who labors on Sunday to work out the sentence; still it would be only so far as it does not work at all.

The Churchman does not much directly concern itself with matters involving the Churchman. If one of these "seventh-day religionists" should happen to live in the neighborhood of some Baptist church in the State of Georgia, and should be arrested as a criminal, and confined in the chain gang under the penalty of bloody stripes and finding seized it on the
