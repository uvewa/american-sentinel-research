THE Mid-Continent Magazine, for June, contains an article on "Religious Liberty," in respect to which the magazine says editorially—

"In the days of our fathers there existed only one opinion as to religious liberty, but civilized human nature finally rebelled against compulsion in religion, as well as other matters, and to day we enjoy much greater freedom from the tyranny of the Church—thanks largely to societies, such as the National Religious Liberty Association, the secretary of which, Mr. A. O. Tait, has treated us to a very able article on the subject in this issue."
