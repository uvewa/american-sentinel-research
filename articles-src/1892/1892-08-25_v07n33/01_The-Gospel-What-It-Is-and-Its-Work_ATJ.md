# The Gospel: What It Is, and Its Work As Opposed to the Mystery of Iniquity.

THE greatest thing in this world is Christianity. The greatest offering ever made to mankind is the offering hereby here offered to inherit eternal life. The greatest grade to be had here is the inheritance of the hereafter. But the world that is to come belongs to the Son of God. To submit with him it is necessary to accept salvation through him, and receive his righteousness. Righteousness is godliness. In godliness there is, therefore, gain.

Godliness is profitable. It is all-profitable. It is a sure defense for this life and it bears within it the certain promise of the life that is to be. Is this then godliness? This certainly has great gain, is the stitch to the whole of Paul's argument. Peter enumerates, that by diligence are to be added one to the other—faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience, godliness; and to this great attainment the apostle only adds brotherly kindness and charity. This surely is much.

Is at all the gain of godliness, however, there is a counterfeit godliness, which so closely matches up to it, and all its fruits, are spiritual,—certainly so far as their outward earthly realization is concerned. The profit of godliness is all in spiritual growth and in the instructions promised to the faithful, which is not of this world, but is to be laid up where moth and rust do not corrupt, and where no thief has entrance. The injunction is, "lay not up treasures on earth"—then godliness and its fruits are not concerns, of the earthly, surely. They are not gold and silver bullion or sovereign coin, for the time to come when their accumulation metals will corrode in the rich man's safety vaults, and so multiply, or even, of his many millions will suffice to buy him a cooling draught in that great day of the wrath of the Lord. In that day, Job tells us, there is no hope for the hypocrite however great his earthly gain. He has sold his soul, then.

What shall it profit a man, if he lose his soul? Can a man bargain well who for his soul for a money price? How many souls are for ransom for five millions of silver of half dollars. To whom is this bribe due? To God, or to Satan? Or to the municipality of Chicago? Or to the Directors and stockholders of the World's Fair corporation? Are the stockholders of the World's Fair paid two and a half million dollars or so, to-day, and is this the kind of gain which is the result of godliness? Does godliness in coin, "recognize" returns and titles? Do the godly promise to the godly such reward as this for right action? Is the gain of this money-bought godliness to be the saving of the souls of the stockholders who receive the money also, or is it to redound to the eternal advantage of those from whom the money proceeds, or do the stockholders hold in their hands the eternal weal or woe of the millions who may attend the World's Fair, and is this in purchase of these stockholders the salvation of those many millions? If this be so, it was not God, or Christ, but if it was it God, it was a Satan, who once offered the world and all its possessions and the souls of men,—the only firm a Congress price was ever offered for such a commodity.

This idea of coercion consists, gas in a premium upon doing right, means to raise many peculiar questions. It is presented with much fervor in an editorial article of the *Mail and Express*, of August 1, under the title, "The Sabbath Triumphant," in which it is said of the act of Congress closing the World's Fair on Sunday, as having a premium of $5,000,000 on doing right.

> It proves in a converse way that "godliness hath great gain." This appropriation would not have been made except for the Christian generosity of the people who have demanded the observance of the Sabbath to the World's Fair people, for they labored first in many national and county religious bodies throughout the country to form public sentiment in favor of making the grant; and necessarily all of these resolutions taught, directly or in General itself. No class of people are actually interested as the Christians are to make the Fair a success.

At the head of the editorial column, in which is the article containing this paragraph, there stands a text of scripture, taken from the fourth chapter of the *Gospel of Luke*, the classic sentence.

> And He came to Nazareth, where He had been brought up; and He entered, as His custom was, into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and stood up for to read.

It is not intended to emphasize the inconsistency of the editorial utterances which follow, with the customs and teachings of Christ, who is, as is above set out, the hope of godliness. If that was its extent, it could not have been more aptly chosen. The one was the act of Him who was himself the mystery of godliness. We inquire, was that day which he had himself set apart the sign of the mystery of godliness while the other is an exhibition of the legal, legislative essence of that other day which is the seal of the mystery of iniquity.

That day upon which the text says Jesus of Nazareth entered into the synagogue is the Sabbath. And this is so vital, the editorial paragraph so strangely and inconsistently exact, the question,—

Were the things about which Jesus there taught as diverse? They were. These days are as sundered as the mystery of iniquity and the mystery of godliness, for they are the standards around which gather the legions of darkness and the hosts of light for that its great contest. But that was in which Jesus taught upon this Sabbath day in the synagogue, at Nazareth! He read from the prophet—

> anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the broken hearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised, to preach the acceptable year of the Lord.

And he said to them that that day the scripture which he had read to them was fulfilled in their presence. But is there a connection between those things in the teaching of which Jesus there read his commission, and the gospel of grace and of grace of which the Sunday, legislatively triumphant, is the sign mascot? There is. This one brings the gospel to the poor, that the other, the whole system of which, this hypocritically godly. This one conquers by its worldly power with the grace and the earth, legislation and Congress. The one sets at liberty the oppressed; the other by the law of their God and strives to bind in further binds more than this any time. There is this diversity. Happy is he who may see it. This is the perfect fulfillment of scriptures. In these days these scriptures were never in their time. In these days these scriptures are fulfilled in our ears.

The mystery of God is the preaching. The mystery of godliness. That mystery of godliness was revealed, "above all that is called God, or that is worshipped, so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God." This was the mystery of iniquity to be revealed. The mystery of God was revealed; the mystery of iniquity was to be revealed.

The mystery of iniquity was revealed. That mystery of iniquity rose up and hid the mystery of God which had been revealed. That mystery of iniquity was the Papacy in all the workings; and the beginning of its working was when there had its initial word; it was working then. He began its working by exalting.

Now. With this the apostle meets, preaching the mystery of God, they come forth on the other mystery coming.

The gospel is the revelation of the mystery of God. In this the mystery—that is, it stood before the world, professing Christianity; it was in fact, and in the representative of God to the world; it was "godliness." Its rising up was to hide the world professing to be the mystery of God. America was nation so that no one is Christianity, whatever there was no Christianity whatever in it at all. God resolved it to be "the mystery of iniquity." "Mystery Babylon the great, the mother of harlots and abominations of the earth." And this was not only hiding the mystery of God from ages and from generations.

Blessed be God! it was not to hide the mystery of God from all ages and generations. When the mystery of iniquity had run its course, and the mystery again the veil would be broken off, and it was revealed anew again from heaven.

For I read: "I saw another angel come down from heaven, having great power." "And he cried mightily, . . . . and with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen."

> The everlasting gospel! to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people, saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come; and worship him that made heaven and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of water.

This everlasting gospel is the mystery of God which was to be preached to all nations; and that mystery, a "Christian is in, the hope of glory." And that is the preaching, the revelation of the mystery in the glorious threefold message which extends to all the world, and at the very time to this time when the gospel, the mystery of God, is preached to all nations, it is a power, a majesty, and a glory such as this world has never yet seen in the time of the apostles, if it does not even surpass that gospel. The near time of its mystery of iniquity being broken off, the mystery of God preached to all nations, all the world in all its glory; for I read that "in the days of the voice of the seventh angel . . . the mystery of God should be finished." Rev. 10:7.

But then comes the second message, Babylon is fallen, is fallen.

> And there followed another angel saying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen. . . . And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, with a loud voice, If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand, the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation.

> Here is the patience of the saints; here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus." Rev. 14:8-12.

Now this is to continue. There goes forth the angel with the everlasting gospel to preach. That everlasting gospel is to be preached in all the world, and then in the preaching of Christ in men, the hope of glory—then wherever there is the preaching of God, this gospel is rejected, and there falling away settles in of that— "Babylon is fallen, is fallen." Then out of this falling away comes that against which the third angel warns.

Now, what brought the mystery of iniquity?—"The falling away from the mystery of God, for a Paul." "That day shall not come except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition, who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God," etc. Now what is the mystery of iniquity in its heart, the last? "The falling away."

When the mystery of iniquity has God announcing an angel flying in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel, the mystery of God, to preach to all the world, its reaction. Then the gospel is preached; and it is rejected, and out of that falling away there comes that which is not yet the mystery of iniquity, the image of the beast, the image of the Papacy in Protestant garments.

As out of that first falling away there came to its own the mystery of iniquity, so out of the second falling away there comes the image of the mystery of iniquity, the image of the beast. Just as certain as the preaching of the first gospel was the apostle was the preaching of this mystery of God, the same in its time, the same power of God, the same mystery of God, the same glory just as certainly the second preaching results in the preaching of the same mystery of God, the same power of God, and the same wisdom of God, the same Christ in men, the hope of glory, the hope of glory. There are certainly as out of the first falling away from the mystery of God comes the mystery of iniquity; out of the mystery of iniquity, the beast, the Papacy; so from the second preaching of the same mystery comes the image of the mystery, the image of the beast, the image of the Papacy. And these things are alike from beginning to end. For note, let us turn now to this—the threefold message—threefold, as opposed to the mystery of iniquity, the beast and his image. This threefold message then goes to all the world. This is the mystery of God to all the world. This little leaflet from which I am now reading is a part of it—the revelation of the mystery of God.

For I read: "I saw another angel come down from heaven, having great power; and the earth was lightened with his glory. And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen." This is the same message as before; is it not? It is expanded, it is enlarged. In the first message they say they cleansed the temple from its sacrilegious defilements—that is, the Reformers, the Protestants, found this word; the second angel's message and the voice heard Jesus said: Come out of her my people.

This message has been begun; it has been going on for some years—the mystery of God.

This message was repeated, and is being repeated to-day. We now tell about the romance—

The fall: "Babylon is fallen," and out of the mystery of iniquity, the beast, and out of the mystery of iniquity, the image; and the essence of this very message is the warning that is the real issue of to-day.

At the beginning of this was in 1844. In these days the mystery of God—of iniquity was to be broken off, and the mystery of God was to be preached again in all its glory in the world. But Ezekiel tells what was to come. Death and Destruction said, "We have heard the fame thereof." Even that time of death is past, and the mystery of God is to be preached in the presence of the Lord, and soon. In the glory thereof.

Therefore, now is the time when that everlasting, threefold, the mystery of God, to be preached in all its fullness, which brings Christ in men in all its fullness to all men. And as the Sabbath of the Lord, in the fullness of its observed in the faithful-
