Notwithstanding the fact that Congress has undertaken to champion the counterfeit Sabbath, thus committing the Government to a course of religious legislation, the question of the Sunday closing of the World's Fair is not yet fully settled. Of course, it is entirely unlikely that Congress will undo what it went so far out of its way to do; nevertheless the action of the Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners in National convention at St. Louis, on the 8th inst., is significant. That body adopted a resolution in regard to the Fair, demanding of Congress the repeal of the clause, of the act recently passed, closing the Fair on Sunday, also calling upon the World's Columbian Exposition directory, of Chicago, to use all means in its power to keep the Exposition open, thereby keeping faith with the people from whom they have solicited and received subscriptions, and calling upon all labor unions of the craft to use every honorable means in their power to compel their representatives in Congress to vote for the opening of the World's Columbian Exposition.

This action shows that the agitation concerning the closing of the Fair, is not at an end, and the more the question is agitated the more clearly will thinking people see that Sunday is without a vestige of title to be called the Sabbath. Of course with thousands this will make not one whit of difference, but there are people who hate and despise frauds, and the Sunday institution will lose vastly more in the estimation of honest men than it can possibly gain in governmental patronage.

government may foster the counterfeit and declare it genuine but it can never make it so. It is a fraud and it can never be anything else.
