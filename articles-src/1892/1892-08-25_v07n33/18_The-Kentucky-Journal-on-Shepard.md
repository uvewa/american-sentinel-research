THE Kentucky Journal expresses itself thus incisively upon the late utterances of the Mail and Express on the passage of the bill closing the World's Fair on Sundays:—

"Col. Elliot F. Son-in-Law Shepard, of the New York Mail and Express, is sending out marked copies of his paper telling the story in scare headlines that the Sabbath will be sacred, and in his editure, als that the Sabbath is triumphant for the World's Fair will be 'closed on the Lord's day, commonly called Sunday.' But the Lord's day is not Sunday, but the Sabbath, commonly called Saturday, as Shepard, who heads his columns every day with a verse of scripture ought to know.

"But Mr. Shepard is harmless, and the only reason for noticing his fusillade, is to ask whether, because he advocated the closing of the World's Fair on Sunday, he was thereby given the right to become a stalwart liar! The information is desired for the reason that in the edition in which thanks are scattered for the congressional saving of the Sabbath Col. Shepard with the energy of a cheerful liar asserts that Kolb, the Third Partyite has been elected Governor of Alabama, over Jones, Democrat, by thirty thousand majority. And then he goes ahead quoting scripture, remarking that in godliness there is great gain, and there is, no doubt, for hypocrites of the Shepard stamp, great temporal gain."
