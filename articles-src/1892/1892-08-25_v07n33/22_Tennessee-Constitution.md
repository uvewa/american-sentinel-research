THE press of Tennessee is demanding a new constitution for the State. No doubt the present constitution is deficient in some respects; it certainly is if it means what the courts of the State hold that it does. The constitution says that "no human authority can in any case whatever interfere with the rights of conscience;" but the courts demand that men educate their consciences by the laws of Tennessee. And the authorities claim that under the laws of the State, Sabbath keepers imprisoned for Sunday work may be compelled to work on the Sabbath; also that any Sabbath keeper is liable to be warned out to work on the road on the Sabbath and mulcted if he refuses to go. That is the sort of equality that exists under the present constitution of Tennessee as interpreted by the courts. But it is not along these lines that the papers of the State are demanding a revision of the constitution.
