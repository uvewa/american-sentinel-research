# NATIONAL RELIGIOUS LIBERTY ASSOCIATION.

THE Netherlander's Christian *Advocate* believes that to increase the income for religious purposes, Sunday observance in foreign countries is sufficient. The *Advocate* of Holland is one of the leading European capitals. Berlin has some compulsory day of rest; for her laws are especially rigid in this respect; and all shops, except restaurants and chemists and groceries, between certain hours must be closed, and all other stores, even to repair, repair restaurants and clubs, between the old custom of selling before 1 o'clock on Sunday, and then again after 6 o'clock on Sunday afternoon. We do not hear of Americans agitation for a European Sunday.

A SPECIAL telegram in the *Pittsburg Dispatch*, under the date of July 16, says:

The congressional conference who remained here while Congress was considering the World's Fair Sunday closing bill said that the churches were not reprinting their political forces than for that. For some time they have been at rest while some from here late last evening, and they expect to see no rest until they are given every desire. Services are attended church this morning. All religious services this morning were of a patriotic character.

Matthew-Saint Quay and the Pittsburg preachers have evidently determined to communize their political and religious forces.

WHERE there is religious interference it can not be expected to go any other direction than that the religious majority wishes. It uses a double instrument, ecclesiastical and civil. It is always well as to fo rum. *The Interior, of Chicago,* in its issue of the same date, speaking of the Pilgrim fathers, says:

> We notice that "New England is becoming pagan;" in the recent arrest of two young men in the town of Duxbury, for playing ball on Sunday. William F. Davis was imprisoned a few years ago in jail for selling ice cream on Sunday. The modern Adventists are not half so liberal as their predecessors." "But such fanaticism is the natural fruit of the Puritanism brought to this country by the Pilgrims." Where is free speech which you boast?

If the *Interior* could really see the "paganism" of the descendants of "the Pilgrims," he would not attribute it to the Pilgrims.

READING that which relates to editorial lives in reference to Sunday fishing:

This agitation in this State on Sunday is not going to stop.

That law ought to be repealed. It is wholly out of keeping with the spirit of the age, and represents that part of the population which most needs fresh air and exercise on Sunday. Such a law concerns itself with holy days except to assure to every one who wants rest on Sunday the right to take it. Beyond that point the State which has a law in this country has no business to prescribe how the leisure hours of any man shall be spent, so long as the public peace is not disturbed.

Now the State has by law secured to every citizen the right to rest on Sunday. The people should comply with our system and theory of government, and let each man be free to spend Sunday according to his own notion, so long as the public peace is preserved.

The advocates thus state its determined purposes.

WHILE it is true that Americans and opponents have won. They will increase and multiply. It is only a question of time, when the communities will see and our neighborhoods conform them as are about us; if these things are so, why do we fear? Why do they not, why will they not be expected to accept?

That when the churches shall have been so patently and notoriously corrupt, in their profession of a reformed a religious law, and exalts the result to the throne of divine authority?

IF asked of one our New Yorker who has been brought suddenly and forcibly to the fact that

the writer of this note that a man working on Sunday where he could be seen and heard only by persons who went there to see and hear him, would not be as guilty as though the work were done in the most public manner. The "nuisance" consists only in the fact that the work is done by those who dissent from the dogma that Sunday is a sacred day. So far as we are aware, this law has never been enforced against those who profess to observe the seventh day. It was invoked a number of years ago against a barber; but the Supreme Court held that barbering on Sunday, though frankly, was not a nuisance, and so not indictable. But why put, if quiet farm work is a nuisance, and is indictable? Simply because by so doing the barber was not emphasizing his dissent from the dogma of Sunday sacredness. He was working on Sunday, not because of a lack in his sacred character, but simply for worldly gain; hence, according to the Court of Tennessee, the annoyance, reasoning, caused by his works did not amount to a nuisance. A wonderful thing and a horrible are committed in the land.
