# A Protest Presented.

WE find the result of these strict Sunday laws all over our land, and especially in Tennessee, where many Adventists, who keep the seventh day, according to the fourth commandment, have been arrested, prosecuted and fined because they have been working on Saturday, remained because they do not protect their sons and daughters from rack and tyranny brutality; it a schoolboy does it, how.

Trusting that you will consider this matter and introduce this enclosed petition for signatures together and present it with reasonable demands,

LOUIS ELLISON.

United States Senate,
Washington, July 16, 1892.

Mr. Louis Ellison:—I have presented the protest enclosed against legislation by Chicago on the same World's Fair in Chicago upon the Sabbath day and have no use and have taken the same signs beginning that Congress ought not to legislate in that direction.

In the circumstances it will present the protest to-day to the United States Senate.

PHILLETE SAWYER.
