NOW that the churches and the saloons have united in the support of the Sunday institution, as they have done in securing the Sunday closing of the World's Fair, we may expect to see its sacredness(?), such as it is, increased at a tremendous pace. Of course Sunday has only such sacredness as man has given it, but what it lacks in quality its friends have always endeavored to make up in quantity, and now re-enforced by the Chicago saloon keepers they ought to be able to whitewash the ancient pagan holiday more effectively than ever.
