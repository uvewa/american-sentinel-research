# The Trial by Battle.

IT is the first impulse of the natural man, when he feels aggrieved, whether in fact or by mere misapprehension, to resort to personal combat. In the earlier ages of the world, and to some extent even now, the so-called civilized codes, acknowledged and practiced in different forms as an accepted judicial procedure, known as in 1817 Lord Ellenborough declared that "the general of the law is that there shall be a trial by battle in which the defeated debtor may purge himself within some of the exceptions." In 1818 the law was abolished. But neither the theory nor the practice of trial by battle seems to have been done away with. Its records of violence is now increasing and it is approaching magnitude of a civil war. Of Homestead have taken the issue in its midst, as a evil of rights from labor, its unorganized fellow workmen. The mines of Coeur d'Alene have put their case to the same test, as against the same opponents. The railroad switchmen of Buffalo have left their switches and are burning cars by the hundreds, the military must be called out to protect their lives; strikesmen who wish to work. The science of the coal miners of Tennessee for revenue has proposed itself in another form, as a conflict against the lessee system. It is still the same, in throwing hundreds of men out of their employment, and preying upon the conduct of the fellow men found to be the machinery with which they work. But beyond this is the grave fact that thousands of men are in armed rebellion against the authority of the State. The State is for the time being in a

state of anarchy.

It is well to be fair, and statesmanlike, political and social, economistic and banking, and capitalism, and direct and grossly uncorporal corporations, to ask themselves why those men have risen against the social state and system of civilization as administered by the industrial interests to which they have been a part. It would be well for labor agitation, and master economic, in the watchfulness of. And to analyze why they are in insurrection against the State, destroying the property upon the use of which they depend, themselves, citizens, are dependents, and threatening the peace of society. Is there any sufficient civil, social, or economic reason for this? And there is not. From that point of view no sufficient cause can be affirmed. But it can be shown—leaving all theoretical and political relations, it is in mutual, moral responsibilities which have been ignored, until now this reign of terror is developing. It is the natural and necessary result of mutual error and mutual wrong. Both parties are at fault.

The established code of society is not at fault. The practice of government is not at fault. The body is only more or less sufferent. There is no strategy of attempt. The origin of the whole matter is in the hearts of men. Both parties not only denies, but are determined to do to others as they would not be done by. The world, the financial world, the commercial world, the social world, the religious world, all are dominated at this time by that unrighteous spirit. Capital uses relentlessly the silent power of its investment tyranny to accomplish selfish ends. Labor is more than ready to appeal to brute force and violence to reach its own conclusions.

The Church, whom duty it should be to teach these members of the same body, which are extinguishing each other to their own destruction, that they should

do each as they would be done by, is itself committed to the same unrighteous methods, and it by this not only disqualified from giving effective advice and counsel, but has even become an evil example. The Church makes use of the just laws to attain its purposes. It does not hesitate to use moral compulsion to obtain legal action to effect injustice and to obtain the enactment of more unjust statutes; and when these have failed it does not hesitate to use the illegal and unchristian to state to use the illegal and unchristian boycott to further its purposes. It does not hesitate to influence Congress by fraudulent and repeated petitions, and so attempts to intimidate the representatives of the people. Its accredited mouth pieces, upon the platform and the pulpit, do not hesitate to suggest the same resort to violence as that adopted by the Amalgamated Association and the Switchmen's Union, if their claims are not granted. All in all are at fault. The origin of this is in the hearts of men. The remedy is in the gospel, pure and undefiled, nothing less.
