A SPECIAL telegram to the Pittsburg Dispatch, from PIRKSHITANDRY, Pa., says:—

The congressional conferees who remained here over Sunday did not waste any time to-day. The different delegations wanted this recess more for repairing their political fences than for rest. The Indiana candidate, conferees and other friends left for home late last evening, and they expect to return tomorrow with renewed strength. The Westmoreland, Jefferson and Armstrong County followers attended church this morning. The afternoon passed very quietly in discussing the situation and forming plans for the coming week's campaign.

Matthew Saint Quay and the Pittsburg preachers have evidently determined to consecrate Sunday to politics in Pennsylvania.
