[The Daily Northwestern, of Oshkosh, Wisconsin, publishes a letter from a citizen of Wisconsin to a senator from that State and the senator's reply.—both of which show an understanding and appreciation of the utter impropriety of the legislative course taken by Congress upon religion at the World's Fair such as should be brought home to the comprehension of every citizen and every legislator in this country.]

A protest against legislation by Congress closing the World's Fair on Sunday, was numerously signed in Racine and forwarded to Senator Sawyer with the following letter to which Senator Sawyer responded in the subjoined reply:—

Racine, Wis., July 13, 1892.

Hon. Fhilitus Sawyer—Dear Sir: We hold, with our fathers, the founders of our great Republic, this truth to be self-evident, that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness; that to secure these rights governments are instituted among men deriving their just power from the consent of the governed. In regard to the closing of the World's Fair on Sunday, I believe it will do more harm than good. Its success entirely depends on the honest and wise management of the institution, just as the progress of our land depends upon the honor and dignity we maintain or show to our fundamental principles. Our Nation is composed of most all kinds of nationalities and denominations. This our fathers considered, and actuated by their personal experience, and, in the light of the history of religious intolerance, provided such measures for individual liberty of conscience, and built our Republic upon such a broad foundation, where all nationalities and denominations are secured equal and exact justice, of whatever persuasion, political and religious.

The World's Fair, you will admit, is under the same obligation to the population of the world as our Government to the people, as it is not a Fair for any one nation or sect, but for the interest of the world, with the intention to ennoble the visitor, enlarge his intelligence, for educating and developing the people for a higher culture. When the Fair be given to such ends, I believe that less iniquity and immorality will be practiced by keeping it open, as it will keep the masses on the ground. My assertion is indicated by the fact that the Chicago liquor dealers want it closed.

Why not leave the authority in the hands of the directors, in whom it is trusted? The appropriation of $5,000,000, as you understand, belongs to the people, and not to any certain class of men, whether Christians or liberals. And you also know that our national as well as every State constitution favors none, but protects all. Moreover, anyone who for conscience sake can not visit the Fair on Sunday, can, of course, stay away, and unmolested worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience.

The Blue Laws of Connecticut and Massachusetts ought not to be executed in our advanced age. The Israelite's, the Adventist's, the Seventh-day Baptist's and liberal's right and liberty ought to be respected. We find the result of these strict Sunday laws all over our land, and especially in Tennessee, where many Adventists, who keep the Sabbath according to the fourth commandment, have been arrested, persecuted and fined because they have been working on Sunday. What a responsibility to our Federal Government because they do not protect their sons and daughters from such tyranny or brutality of a subordinate State in the Union. It bodes no good for our land.

Trusting that you will consider this matter and introduce the enclosed petition in the United States Senate, and defend its reasonable demands,

I am, very respectfully yours,
LOUIS ELHOLM.

United States Senate,
Washington, July 15, 1892.

LOUIS ELHOLM—Dear Sir: Yours with the protest enclosed against legislation by Congress to close the World's Fair at Chicago upon the Sabbath day received. I fully agree with you and those signing the protest that Congress ought not to legislate in this direction. I will present the protest to-day to the United States Senate.
Yours truly,
PHILETUS SAWYER.
