IN New Braunfels, Texas, they are having a brisk agitation of the Sunday law question. The New Braunfels Herald takes the proper position in opposition to Sunday laws, that it is not a proper nature for the exercise of civil authority, and at the same time denies that there is any authority from God for abstaining from labor on Sunday. Continuing, the Herald says:—

If there was such an authority it would be a matter of religion, and would come under the province of the pulpit, and not the legal forum.

This is a free country, or at least ought to be, so far as religion is concerned, and no man or set of men have any right to dictate to me how or when I shall worship God, or whether I shall worship God or devil, for it is none of their business.

The founders of our Government very wisely separated Church and State, and provided that all persons should be protected in the right to worship God in his or her own way, and a Sunday law is in direct violation of this fundamental principle, and is a direct attempt to coerce men in their religious opinions, and for this reason ought to be denounced by all lovers of liberty.

But the Sunday laws exist. The coercion has begun. Why has this not been found out before?
