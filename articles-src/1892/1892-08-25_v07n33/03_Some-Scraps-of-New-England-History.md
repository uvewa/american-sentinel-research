# Some Scraps of New England History.

OF all the parts, which so far, the Puritans, and afterwards the Pilgrims, played, as they were nicknamed, "the Anabaptists," are probably most familiar, at the heart of the offense of Roger Williams was that he was a Baptist; and long after Roger Williams' banishment, that spirit was not at rest. Preached a notable sermon before he retired, to entitled "Rejection," had told the governor and the ruler that "Anabaptists and dippers must be looked at by the godly leaders of this Commonwealth," and the president of Harvard College had that "such a rough and turbulent people were not likely to be handled over tenderly." According to the general rule of the Colony of Massachusetts, in 1644:

> It is ordered and agreed, that if any person or persons within this jurisdiction, shall either openly con- demn or oppose the baptizing of infants . . . or shall purposely depart the congregation at the administration of the ordinance . . . after due time and means of convincing, every such person . . . shall be sentenced to banishment.

The next year, however, a strong petition was presented to the Court, and that was because of the offenses that had been "taken through by the godly in England," that many of the elders entreated that the law might continue still in force; and the law remained, but the representative of the Colony who went to England in 1646 explained to parliament that "the true law was a newer law, but were a matter to set willing the rigor of it upon any."

But the reason, whereby whatever was discovered, was because the Baptists would have it . . . to bear with conscience . . . to be considered . . . in pursuance of "the tricks of Satan and the same year, a Baptist by the name of Painter, for refusing to let his child be

sprinkled," was brought before the court, where he declared that baptize to be "antichristian." He was sentenced to be whipped, with the house without offending.

And now, in 1651, three Baptist ministers came from the Providence plantations. John Clarke, and Obadiah Holmes, and John Crandall, went from the Providence plantations to Lynn, Mass. as an acknowledged Baptist. They arrived on Saturday, and the next day they got together in his private house. While Mr. Clarke was preaching, two constables entered the house with a warrant to arrest certain obnoxious persons being strangers. They were arrested in the name of the Commonwealth, carried at once to the tavern, and were notified that they must attend the services at the parish church in the afternoon. They refused, but were taken thither by force; after the meeting being closed, Mr. Clarke, being an aged clergyman obtained relief for the objecting people from the services; his constable told them that was nothing to him.

The three men were taken to Boston, tried in the courts, and sentenced. Clarke asked permission to speak. His request was refused. Thereupon Clarke would not speak about what he had just done; his judgment was read; it told why he had put on his hat, saying that his garments had been burned and his garment according to the visible order of the meeting house of the congregation; no further, and the three were shut up for some time. They were then taken to the meeting place where they must sit for some time. They were taken to Boston and put in prison. July 31 they were before the court, Clarke was fined twenty pounds, Holmes thirty, and Crandall, five. Clarke and Crandall were soon released. At the beginning of the trial of Holmes, Holmes was told by the court to state the law under which they were being tried, which Holmes attempted to do. The court said Endicott broke in, "You have denied our infant Baptism, and you have been brought into our jurisdiction. You go up and down, and have seduced and led the people; several of our members have been taken that go week, but you can not come here, so willingly and plead innocence."

He was then sent away from the court to prison, for a time. And wrote a letter from the bar, I respect myself in these bonds. And if I may be made to suffer for the name of Jesus Christ; wherefore God give me strength," etc.

A citizen then came before the court and offered to pay the fine. One of the judges then struck the citizen and called (sic) him) struck me before the judgment seat! Mr. Holmes was severely whipped. God gave the strength this was the thing for him.

The Baptiste were ready to defend their doctrine as well as they were tried and their sufferings of the Puritan State against the Baptists. Clarke, as soon as they were led out and proposed to debate the whole matter with any champion on the side of the colony.
