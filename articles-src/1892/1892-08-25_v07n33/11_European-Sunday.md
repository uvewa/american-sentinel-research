THE NORTHWESTERN CHRISTIAN ADVOCATE contains this note in reference to the progress of the movement for Sunday observance in foreign countries:—

"The European Sunday is in decided disfavor at the leading European capital. Berlin has now its compulsory day of rest. The new law suspends all employment and closes all places of business, except restaurants and cafes, between ten o'clock Saturday night and two o'clock Sunday morning, and after two o'clock on Sunday afternoon. We commend this to American agitators for a European Sabbath."
