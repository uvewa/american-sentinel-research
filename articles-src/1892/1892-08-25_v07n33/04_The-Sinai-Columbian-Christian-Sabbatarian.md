# The Sinai-Columbian Christian Sabbatarian.

SOME months ago, when the issue of Sunday closing was in December, 1891, the *Christian Statesman* had occasion to say in reference to the national duty of Sabbath observance:

> We learn that when this same good Being had finished a certain great work that he had undertaken, he looked upon what he had done, saw the works which he had made—"And God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it, because that in it he had rested from all his work which he had created and made."

Now if we are to teach the children of men in all this broad land and abroad to keep the Sabbath in recognition of the hand of a great Creator upon one day in seven, as would appear, the strikingly spectacular presents itself in a question of divine order, whether we are to follow the American Exposition or the Sabbath: Was there a Sinai-Columbian Sabbath? Did the Creator of the universe establish a Columbian Sabbath?

Well, scarcely. And there are several reasons against such a pretension. Its hideous and ridiculousness, but disregarding the more grotesque features, we notice the false claim that "from that day [the seventh of the original creation] to this, all so-called Christian nations have observed and kept a Christian Sabbath, namely, Sunday." No. There has never been a "Christian nation," since a "Christian Sabbath," and since the "Christian Sabbath." Adam was not the father of a Christian nation. Adam and Moses did not make a Christian nation from Egypt to Sinai. Yet the Bible gives no command or authority for any Sabbath except to Adam in the Decalogue. Hence the only authority in any sense for the word of which was not the "Christian Sabbath" of "Christian nations"—the Sabbath was the behest of the Lord thy God.

Therefore, every claim which can properly claim the name "Christian" must have been established by Christianity itself, and the warrant for it found in the New Testament. This was not said of Sunday observance. No text can be given as authority and command for it. It is not admissible to say that it was taught by Christ, for Christ kept the seventh-day Sabbath of the fourth commandment, in worship of images, and auricular confession, against the very practice of which Protestantism has protested. But the name "Sabbath" and the "day of authority" Sabbatarian came to this from the old original; and the name is neither "Jewish," nor "Christian," nor any other religious nomenclature or profession, but was made for man—not by man, nor by any human authority but established by the omnipotent Creator; and can never properly be applied to any merely human institution.

No one agrees that there was never a more ludicrous, ridiculous, or impertinent thing done in the name of religion, than which volunteers to assert that any civil legislation intended to compel all persons to observe any day as a day of rest is practice not taught in the Bible. None is "a practical Christian Nation," and much less the unholy improperly condition called a Christian Sabbath.

And now we propose to have a grand celebration. From some of the grandest events of the Old and the New Testament to have a grand celebration, to one of the grandest events in the modern world; is this a desirable thing in so far as it is consistent with the commands of God. And for what is there that is unchristian in it? If free from all profaneness, in—abiding element in the human heart for which the Almighty has wisely made provision, can it not properly be its decision or consent?

But it is supposed there was only one way of taking the alternative. And we must all face this actual fact—whether it pleased the advocates of "Christian" this or that, or not, in reference to Sunday closing door please note: that the observance of Sunday is not "Sabbatarian," since it has practically yielded to the term "Sabbath," it becomes a wholly religious question and its advocates must prominently the really "moral and religious" character of the institution." Perhaps the Bible's mind of the do with the question," as it conveniently has been supposed to have done so. In the last summarizing of the whole matter, we quote the *Washington Post* statement that:

> The press of Tennessee is demanding a new constitution for the State. No doubt the present constitution is deficient in many respects; certainly it is if it be true that under it the Legislature is not at liberty to repeal the Sunday law of 1803. It is an atrocious law. The constitution of the State says that "no human authority can in any case whatever interfere with the rights of conscience." Seventh-day Adventists and other people who do not believe in Sunday observance should be at liberty to make their consciences the law of the Tennessee and. And religious toleration did not suffer under the laws of the State, a Saturday man can be compelled to work on the Sabbath on the road or in any other capacity on Saturday, and be compelled to work on the road on the Sunday that follows his Sabbath Saturday. That is born of tyranny of that characterized the blue laws of New England. The present constitution of Tennessee has resisted all attempts of the Legislature to repeal some along these lines that the people of the State think it is time they had a constitution demanding a revision of the entire Constitution.
