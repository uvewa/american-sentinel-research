THE WOMAN'S VOICE, of Boston, has this commendation of the action of a Massachusetts's Law and Order League in the enforcement of Sunday laws at Nantasket beach. It is noticeable that it is the Sunday desecration which is the objective point of attack, while the riotousness seems but secondary:—

"The promptness with which the Law and Order League have taken steps to prevent the Sabbath breaking which is causing much disturbance at Nantasket beach, is to be highly commended. The superintendent of the Old Colony railroad is also evidently a man of right principles, as he stopped the running of Sunday trains to Nantasket, in order to assist the citizens in maintaining order. The acts have been so riotous of late that there has been danger to life and limb; and even those who have no regard for the sanctity of the Sabbath, from a Christian standpoint, are shocked at the scenes which have occurred at Nantasket on the Sabbath this year."
