THE Supreme Court of the State of New Jersey, has determined that a fine of one dollar only can be levied upon proprietors of open Sunday amusements in that State and the report therefore is that, on Sunday, Aug. 14, at Atlantic City, contrary to the usual custom and the city ordinances, several carousels, toboggan and scenic railways, and other places of amusement were opened to day, taking advantage of the recent decision of the State Supreme Court that a fine of one dollar only could be imposed upon places of amusement for remaining open on Sunday.

The police authorities made no attempt to close the places, but took the names of the proprietors.
