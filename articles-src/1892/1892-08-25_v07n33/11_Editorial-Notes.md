# Editorial Notes.

IN these States of the Union there is an organized resistance to State and municipal authority. The combined organizations which in themselves would amount to an open revolt against present industrial conditions and relations. This resort to violence and armed rebellion is not because of a lack of the necessities of life. Its primary purpose is revolutionary.

It would be well for statesmen, and political and social, economistic, and banking, and capitalism, and direct and gross uncorporal corporations, to ask themselves why those men have risen against the social state and system of civilization as administered by the industrial interests to which they have been a part. It would be well for labor agitation, and master economic, and the workingmen of. And to analyze why they are in insurrection against the State, destroying the property upon the use of which they depend, themselves, citizens, are dependents, and threatening the peace of society. Is there any sufficient civil, social, or economic reason for this? And there is not.

The established code of society is not at fault. The practice of government is not at fault. The body is only more or less sufferent. There is no strategy of attempt. The origin of the whole matter is in the hearts of men. Both parties not only denies, but are determined to do to others as they would not be done by. The world, the financial world, the commercial world, the social world, the religious world, all are dominated at this time by that unrighteous spirit. Capital uses relentlessly the silent power of its investment tyranny to accomplish selfish ends. Labor is more than ready to appeal to brute force and violence to reach its own conclusions.

Now that the churches and the saloon and the pulpit and the theater, and the institutions, so they have taken to each other, we may expect to see in increasingly, such a way as to expect to see it in earnestfully, such measures as may produce that. The observance of course Sunday has only such sanction as law can give. It has always been purely compulsory but friends have always endeavored to make it as otherwise.

---

Now the churches, still keeping the forms of godliness, though the power thereof has been denied by the Chicago saloon keepers they are now working together to make the annual joyous holiday more effectively than ever.

Let there be united action of the better element in both the Republican and Democratic parties. You settle this question by an agreement among yourselves, that the Government, as you understand, belongs to the people, and you will then be able to defeat all efforts of Christians or Atheists or Infidels. And you will see that every State constitution leaves men, but every State constitution leaves some, not satisfied at all. Moreover, anyone who at this time stands up for Sunday rest, and says, "I am a Sunday, can, of course, stay away, and have the same right not to be molested in the dictates of his own conscience."

The Blue River Convention of a Church ought not to be so excited in our expectation. The Methodists, the Adventist's, the Seventh-day Baptist's and Protestants are in the field.

A PAPER from Tennessee, a lawyer recently said to a reporter of the Chicago *Tribune*, that there is nothing in the law of Tennessee to say how a man shall not name Shurdey, "accepts that he shall refrain from work, such as he follows during the week, and shall not make a nuisance of himself." The use of the term "nuisance" in this connection is misleading. Private Sunday work is a nuisance only by a legal fiction. Under decisions of the Supreme Court of Tennessee it is not necessary to show that any one is actually annoyed by the work done but as in the Attorney General of Tennessee's opinion expressed it,

> the writer of this note that a man working on Sunday where he could be seen and heard only by persons who went there to see and hear him, would not be as guilty as though the work were done in the most public manner. The "nuisance" consists only in the fact that the work is done by those who dissent from the dogma that Sunday is a sacred day. So far as we are aware, this law has never been enforced against those who profess to observe the seventh day. It was invoked a number of years ago against a barber; but the Supreme Court held that barbering on Sunday, though frankly, was not a nuisance, and so not indictable. But why put, if quiet farm work is a nuisance, and is indictable? Simply because by so doing the barber was not emphasizing his dissent from the dogma of Sunday sacredness. He was working on Sunday, not because of a lack in his sacred character, but simply for worldly gain; hence, according to the Court of Tennessee, the annoyance, reasoning, caused by his works did not amount to a nuisance. A wonderful thing and a horrible are committed in the land.
