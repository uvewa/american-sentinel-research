# Uncertainties Log - Volume 7, Number 33 (August 25, 1892)

## OCR Quality Notes

The OCR transcription from Mistral was generally of high quality. Below are the specific uncertainties and corrections made:

### Page 1
- Line 23: "Boob St." - uncertain if this is "Bond St." Given the masthead consistently shows "43 Bond St." in other issues, transcribed as "Bond St."
- Line 68-76: Text flows across page break - joined as continuous paragraph

### Page 2
- Line 76: "anninted" - appears to be OCR error for "anointed"
- Line 78: "imprisms" - appears to be OCR error for "imprisons"

### Page 3
- No significant uncertainties

### Page 4
- Line 191: "th-conmemorate" - hyphenation artifact, transcribed as "to commemorate" (context suggests OCR error, reading as "th-" instead of "to ")

### Page 5
- No significant uncertainties

### Page 6
- Line 302: "PIRKSHITANDRY" - likely OCR error for location name, preserved as written in source

### Page 7

- Line 421: "URGAN SMINE" - likely OCR error for "URIAH SMITH"
- Line 427: "M. BORANACHER" - possibly "M. BORONACHER" or similar, preserved as written
