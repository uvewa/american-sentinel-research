# Sunday-Law News.

IN New Braunfels, Texas, they are having a brisk agitation of the Sunday law question. The New Braunfels *Herald* takes the proper position in opposition to Sunday laws, that it is not a proper sphere for the exercise of civil authority; and at the same time denies that there is any authority from God for abstaining from labor on Sunday, commending the *Herald* says:

> This is a free country, and at least ought to be, as far as the exercise of individual liberty, provided it does not encroach upon the rights of others. It is a matter of religion, and would come under the pervading principle of the separation of Church and State. I shall worship God, or whether I shall worship Him at all, or whether I go to church on Sunday, or Monday, or Saturday, or any other day. I approved Church and State, and provided that all men should be treated as the equals of other men, and find in his or her own way, and a Sunday law is in violation of those principles. And an attempt to carry religion into politics, or politics into religion, and for that reason ought to be demolished of old.

But the Sunday laws exist. The contition has begun. Why has this not been found out before?

The Supreme Court of the State of New Jersey, has determined that a fine of one dollar only can be levied upon proprietors of open Sunday amusements in that State. In a dozen or more resorts on Sunday, Aug. 14, at Atlantic City, contrary to suggestions of the county prosecutor that saloon amusement, toboggan and several railways, and other acts of arrangement to the fair, taking advantage of the recent decision of the State Supreme Court that a fine of one dollar only could be imposed upon places of amusement for remaining open on Sunday, were running at full blast. In many places no effort was made to close any of the places, but took the names of the proprietors.

The *Kentucky Journal* expresses itself thus in quoting from the utterances of the *Mail and Express* upon the subject of Sunday closing of the World's Fair on Sundays:

> Col. Elliot F. Sho- in-Law Shepard, of the *New York Mail and Express*, runs two full pages in his paper telling the story in scare headlines that he and his associates have engineered, and to point out with undue satisfaction to the public that the Sabbath is triumphant for the World's Fair, — which is what the New York *Sunday Mercury* calls it, and so it is. What Shepard calls the Sabbath, commonly called Saturday is recognized, but was broken in order by this act of Congress. What day Col. Shepard keeps.

> But Mr. Shepard is butterless, and the only reason he urged the closing of the World's Fair on Sunday, he advocated the closing of the World's Fair on Sunday, is was because given the right in law to rest on that day. And then the *Mail and Express* reason that to the editor in which the thanks are contained for the congressional action of the letter, his asserts that Kolb, the Third Partyite has been nominated for the Governor of Alabama at the last general, by thirty thousand majority. And then he goes about getting another resolution protesting that a premium of $5,000,000 was put on godliness, and for hypocrities of the Shepard sheep, great temperance.

THE WOMAN'S Voice, of Boston, has this remarkable obituary of the action of a Massachusetts Law and Order League in the enforcement of Sunday laws: The Woman's Voice is amused by the Sunday Association which is the objective of the enforcement.

> For companies with which the Law and Order League have taken steps to prevent the Sabbath breaking at the resort of Nantucket, the latest experiment of the Old Colony railroad is also on Sunday excursions, and not the least experiment the running of Sunday trains to Nantucket, as their trains and steamers are crowded, and every trip is attended with some degree of danger, there is been danger to life and limb; and even those who condemn excursions have felt a relief at the announcement that certain trains and boats, and excursions which have occurred at Nantucket on the Sabbath are condemned.

> Government may foster the outside; fact doesn't grant it religion but it can never make it so. It is a fraud and it can never do it.

and that public acquiescence in its reflection has not appealed to repeal the law. The Greenville Tenn. *Sun* gives the opinion of Lawyer Hornsby, a prominent law by affirming the conviction of a prominent New York gentleman who was arrested a year ago for doing some work at his place in the country, and the fact of this decision will be to rescind Sunday fishing laws that may be in amend and punishment anywhere within the confines of the Empire State. Around New York, in the Hudson River, in Long Island Sound, and in the adjoining portions of Long Island, off-shore fishing on Sunday has long been considered as practically a dead letter, but the law it has not been violated continuously so that any body is a nuisance), arrests have been entirely under Section 265 of the Penal Code, which Judge Cohen's General Term decisions states was only intended to prevent shooting, hunting, fishing, horse racing, gaming or other public sports, or shows any person disturbing the peace of the day are prohibited.

In New Braunfels, Texas, they are having a brisk agitation of the Sunday law question.
