# Call for a Council of Religions.

A CORRESPONDENT of the Washington *Post* has raised a most interesting question in Congress, and the country may profit by its timely suggestion.

The recent monsoon phase of the irrepressible American political character, which would achieve the great problems of this country, is never more conspicuous than when Congress gets possession of a plum like the five hundred and seventy worthy appropriation bill, but in fresh air, the wisdom of the political will-of-the-wisp is something more important; as is now being, participated in showing a lamentable lack of preparation for a just and comprehensive finding in a priori and apriori reasoning, if it is such, as to the proper relation of the government to the religious convictions of the people, without seriously exciting a spirit which several million, of the people of this Republic who are well-educated from his personality.

The simple act of providing for a world's fair within the borders of our jurisdiction, thanking God and giving adequate entertainment to the world, has for political or financial reasons to that infatuation, immediately taken the most violent theological controversy that has been witnessed in a generation. If men had always paid to public opinion and knowledge, and philosophy, the attention it deserved, it is at least possible that "the sun do move," like a dogma, would have been exploded before Columbus; also even that Columbus would never have made the attack. Let us agree, then, that it is and always has been a great mistake to deny the divine right of the party loses in this free and glorious country. Only yesterday it was Copernicus; it is now Huxley and Spencer and Sabbatharianism; the contemporary of the Moses and Elijah and Jesus and Paul and the Queen of England. There certainly ought to be some manner of settling all of these issues as the questions of the ages;—and it is not the place of Congress; should people be compelled to do any partaking thing on the Lord's day—we will not say, resting.

If I was not one of those 10,000,000 inclined to the orthodox observance of Sunday, perhaps I might more clearly grasp its importance in this way, even with a backing of 5,000,000 others, to be in a position to even appreciate the religious opinions of the other 53,000,000 inhabitants of the United States, who perhaps have no religion, or some of whom in that unhappy remainder must feel a pleasant effect upon my nerves. Nobody is any longer quite sure of this, and the Secretary, the religious newspapers, and all their preachers employed, who never a very efficacious means of communication, by agitation, amendments and

hounding a man out of any particular denomination because he has been branded heretic, have failed to do anything that's worth observing for the observance of Sunday all the way from New York to San Francisco, and would be moreover to attempt an impossibility, for only God can give his grace to render a spiritual service, and that is the kind of service required by the law of the Sabbath. On the other hand, for Congress or any other human power to take a subordinate work from the divine by attempting to promise by professing to recommend by it, would be to chafe its change that is as old as the wicked power described in the twenty-first of the seven heads of Daniel. The history teaches that the only proper course for Congress, and for all other human powers is to let the whole question rest in the conscience of the people, settling the question of Sabbath observance alone, and leaving every man perfectly free to do any service as you see fit to give, being individually, personally accountable to God.

Would it not be practicable to hold in this connection a general council of religious denominations not in Congress—in that event, to decide a religious controversy, and the country would have the benefit of the advice. Why not have a body representing every phase of thought in this country, if that were possible, before which the claims of the religious contending forces, of the reading public, to fact, of every class of the people could be submitted, and the discussion could be made public? Its discussion should include such questions as these: How far does the Constitution of the United States protect the rights of the citizen in matters of conscience? Was the first Sunday legislation a part of the divine economy of the Sabbath? Why should American citizens of the nineteenth century be compelled by Congress to rest on a day which has nothing better to recommend it in terms of an adherence to practices 300 years old? Are the political rights of the citizens of the United States properly safeguarded when we have Government interfere in matters of conscience; as with the question of the amount of the man of means drinking ice water on Sunday morning, and the poor man who must drink from the public fountain?

Why would not the Parliament of Religions furnish an opportunity to make good nationally the Post's correspondent? Those suggestions are timely and should be carefully considered, wisely acted upon to legislatively settle this forever for the whole world, and Congress accordingly.
