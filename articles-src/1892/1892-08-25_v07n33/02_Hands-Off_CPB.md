# Hands Off!

IN discussing the action of the Senate on the question of closing the World's Fair on Sunday the *Nebraska State Journal* says:

> Senator Manderson offered an amendment that the Fair be closed on Sundays. It was stated then, as it has been since, that it would also require the Fair be closed on Sunday, leaving it optional with the Directory whether it should close on any other day of the week, including Sunday, if they so desired. There appears to be no reason why a fair and straightforward provision of this character could not have been presented. It would not also forbid them listening to a choir and an organ on Sunday. In fact it would have permitted the Exposition management to make as good use of the compass on that day than in admitting a beautiful program at the main building, and there is an infinite variety, and opened on Sunday where its educational value is almost exclusively and its diversion value the least.

The amendment offered by Senator Manderson admits that Sunday closing, so far as labor is concerned, is not a question of physical rest, but of compulsory observance; it is rather foolish and childish to attempt to cover up the real animus of the whole movement with any such subterfuge.

The amendment offered by Senator Manderson was no more notable than was the original proposition to close the World's Fair. If it is a matter over which Congress has jurisdiction, and a question upon which legislation should be enacted, there is no use in stopping with half way measures. If it is right for Congress to require that the Fair shall be closed because of the claims that Sunday is the Sabbath, why, if that were true, and if it were a matter which Congress had jurisdiction over, all must recognize, that holy observance is not enjoined merely to enable its beneficiaries, the great body would have no right to make the exception. If Congress had laid down the law of the Sabbath and forbade all work, there would have been little from that law. The law of the Sabbath being religious requires rest on a holy day to keep it holy. Nor was we left to doubt as it to what rest means, for it says, it means to "turn away thy foot from the Sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on my holy day;" and to "call the Sabbath a delight, and the holy of the Lord, honorable;" and to "honor him, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine own words" upon the Sabbath. See Isa. 58. But of course if they were to go the Fair on Sunday it would be foolishling that their own pleasure, and if the world in a violation of the true law of the Sabbath, if that law applies to Sunday, is equivalent to a violation of the fourth commandment. That commandment is the only divine basis upon which any weekly rest day can rightfully claim exemption from physical toil. It requires spiritual rest and it is obligatory only by those who are spiritual. Congress has no jurisdiction whatever in the matter and can never properly supply any jurisdiction. For Congress or any other human power to attempt to enforce the divine law of God is to blaspheme.

But God requires no man to keep Sunday as the Sabbath. That day is not the Sabbath. It never will be the Sabbath any more than the Fourth of July can be Christmas; and for Congress to require its observance as such is the height of absurdity; yes, it is worse than all that; evidently, it is a wickedly blasphemous attempt to find upon the world a fraud in the name of God and to use the name of the Lord. Congress and every other human power should take hands off the Sabbath observance alone.
