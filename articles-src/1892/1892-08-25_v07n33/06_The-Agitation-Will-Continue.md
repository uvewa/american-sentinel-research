# The Agitation Will Continue.

NOTWITHSTANDING the fact that Congress has closed the World's Fair on the national Sabbath, thus committing the Government of the United States to legislation on the question of the Sunday closing of the World's Fair is not yet disposed of. Far from it, it is entirely unlikely that Congress will insist on what it sent to run all the way to do nevertheless the action of the Representatives of Carpenters and Joiners in National convention at St. Louis, adopted a resolution in regard to the Fair, petitioned of Congress the repeal of the Sunday closing and asking that in case of the Fair on Sunday, also calling upon the trade union of Boston, mass meetings of Chicago, to use all means in its power to keep the Exposition open on Sunday. By bad faith with the people from whom they have collected enforced missionary offerings and calling upon all labor unions of the country to use every honorable means in their power to compel their representatives in Congress' vote for the opening of the World's Columbian Exposition.

This action shows that the agitation concerning the closing of the Fair, is not at an end, and the more the question is agitated the more difficult it will be to people one that Sunday is without a verdict. The advocates of a compulsory Sunday course with thousands this will make not one whit of difference, but many a graver one who hate and despise frauds, and the busting institution will pass under a more in the estimation of honest men than it is now possibly gain as governmental patron-

subjects to an unlawful, unjust assemblage. They have gained the State power to protect others, they may yet find it grievous to be protected.

No greater travesty ever was enacted in all the world than these scenes of violence which purport to be for the betterment of the laboring man, and really are not but the barter of one set of hired guns against another, and not the seeking, but loss of them, loss of money, physical injury, to whom—The thought is startling. But it is literally true that he who takes the sword shall perish by the sword.

But the labor world is not alone in its insurrection; in its evil in force and violence. The religious world is doing the same thing. As our readers know, our history a thing at it seems, it is nevertheless they quote the Master as saying, "My kingdom is of this world, and my servants do my work." And we come, according to this reading of the Master's, and they may reorganize the contest of man on every possible line of civil, political and aggrandize, and far beyond that, encroaching its beyond, and is public meetings urging that their purpose of reforming the world by which, requires the bullet and the bayonet. While the religious world prates of the divine worship and mutual protection the laboring class will never have in the name of Christ, who brought peace on earth and good will to men, these great religious organizations turn his gospel of men into a gospel of force, by which to put a man into life—ill to all who dissent. O, the brotherhood of man. Where is the voice that will sound the truth so loud that it will ring the ear of every nation?
