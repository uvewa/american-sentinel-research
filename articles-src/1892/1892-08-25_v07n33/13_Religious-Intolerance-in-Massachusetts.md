WHERE there is religious intolerance it can not be invariably depended upon to strike just where the religious majority wishes. It uses a double edged sword that is sometimes dangerous to friends as well as to foes. The Interior, of Chicago, is troubled about this evidence of paganism in Massachusetts:—

The best evidence that "New England is becoming pagan" is the recent arrest of two young men, at Everett, Mass. They were singing hymns in the public square on Sunday. It will be remembered that William F. Davis was imprisoned a few years ago for preaching the gospel on Boston Common. The modern Athenians are not half so liberal as their pagan namesakes which deemed Mary Hill none too distinguished a pulpit for the Apostle Paul. Shades of the Pilgrims! Where is free speech which you championed so bravely?

If the Interior could really see the "paganism" of New England it would not invoke the shades of the Pilgrims.
