With the introduction, "The infidel scheme fails,—saloon keepers in Chicago favor closing the World's Fair on Sunday," the Mail and Express thus chronicles openly the alliance of the saloon-keepers and liquor element with the American Sabbath Union, and its coadjutors, to close the World's Fair on Sunday:—

The efforts on the part of the officers of the infidel society known as the American Secular Union, to enlist the aid of the saloon-keepers in the proposed mass-meeting to oppose the Sunday closing of the World's Fair, has failed. Nine-tenths of the saloon-men said they were heartily in sympathy with the movement to close the Fair on Sunday.

It is worthy of consideration, such an alliance as this. It must be a powerful motive which can bring about a coalition between elements supposed to be so antagonistic, and lead them to make common cause in the support of a movement bearing the name of a moral reform. Have the saloon-keepers repented of the evil of their ways? Have they realized the monstrous iniquity of their calling, and some to a tardy realization of the fact that they have really no tenable civil right to continue the manufacture and sale of brain-crazing and body-destroying poisons,—to the destruction of myriads of their fellows, bringing the sufferings of poverty and the pangs of heart-breaking sorrow upon helpless women and little children? Have they made open confession, and signified their intention of withdrawing forever from the business of supplying patients for the insane asylums; inmates for the workhouses, jails, and penitentiaries; subjects for the morgue and the dissecting-table; occupants for the nameless graves of the potter's field; and candidates for the eternal death which is the fate of drunkards and others who "shall not inherit the kingdom of God"? If they have repented, their repentance will be followed by works, and they will cease the manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquors, not only on Sunday and during the World's Fair, but on all days and for all time. They have expressed no such purpose. They have not even agreed to close their saloons, and distilleries, and breweries, on the Sundays upon which they join with their religious co-workers in asking that the Fair shall be closed. On the contrary, they look forward to the increased sales and larger business which they will do on those days if they and the Sabbath Union succeed in closing the Fair gates one day in the week. It is, then, from motives of personal gain, and not to accomplish a moral reform, that the liquor interest is willing to associate itself with its supposed natural enemy, the Church and its kindred organizations, to secure the closing of the World's Fair on Sunday. They have no intention of even trying to serve both God and Mammon, but only Mammon.

If this is their purpose, what is the motive of those who are willing to ally themselves with them to the accomplishment of a common end? Can one party to an alliance enter into it with the intent of doing good that evil may come, and the other of doing evil that good may come, and an unmixed blessing to humanity be the result? Nine-tenths of the saloonmen are heartily in sympathy with the Sunday closing of the Fair, that those against whom the gates are closed may find their open doors; while those religionists who accept this aid in legal Sunday closing of the Fair are thus acquiescing in the turning of the crowds from their closed gates into the saloonist's open doors.

Here is a party amalgamation. Those things which have no affinity for each other will not amalgamate. There is, then, an affinity between these two. Where is it? "How can two walk together, except they be agreed?"

They are agreed, in that they neither of them serve the God of righteousness, but they both, the one through gross and palpable means, and the other through allegiance to subtle deception, minister to the same Mystery of Iniquity and serve the same ends in the final conflict between the forces of good and evil.
