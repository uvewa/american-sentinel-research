# "Sabbath" and "Sunday."

THE Newark Methodist Ministers' Secretary sent to this Pacific Methodist Episcopal Church, Newark, N. J., Monday, January the seventh, and a list thereon was taken from the relation of that, Wheatlet, the detective employed by the Newark Law and Order League to aid in the enforcement of the Jersey Sunday laws, on the subject, "The Law and the Liquor Traffic." As the duty of the Law and Order League was running itself to be the willing and efficient auxiliaries, ready to use the blade of the law at the behest of the Church, but the fact has not been publicly acknowledged before.

In this country the words Sabbath and Sunday are frequently used interchangeably as synonymous terms, now note, both referring to one and the same day. It is well known, however, that almost every speaker and writer who uses these words interchangeably that has reference to the word Sabbath, is found in either the Old or the New Testament. It was not always the last, when a specific day is designated by the word Sabbath; and we can show to us that at the times when they wrote—some of them nearly years after the resurrection of Christ—the Sabbath preceded the first day. Matt. (l1) says, "In the end of the Sabbath as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week." Luke says, on the evening following the burial, prepared spices and ointments and rested the Sabbath day according to the commandment. But on the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came to the sepulchre bringing the spices which they had prepared." Luke 23:56; 24:1.

It should be remembered also, that the first day of the week is comparable of every sixteenth century word. No writer on the subject in any language previous to the sixteenth century who so uses the word, and but few can be found at the present time, in any language but the English, who so use the word.

The official records of the Government of Great Britain when reporting the transactions of business done on the seventh day of the week, have, ever, said that year the words ever the words *dies Sabbati*, the Sabbath day, to express the date of the transactions; and the House of Parliament continues the use of the same words. The statute law of every Colony and State Government makes the word Sabbath applicable only to the seventh day of the week, and when the word for the violation of only in this sense, there serves to be something wrong and very ambiguous and even contradictory when the word Sabbath is used for Sunday; especially is this so when used by certain speakers and writers of our day.

In any study of the languages of Southern Europe, or Western Asia, we shall find, even at the present day—far more in the past, that the word Sabbath, or its equivalent in their languages, means only the seventh, or last day of the week, and not the first day. This is the usage, whether the alphabet is printed in France, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Greece, Turkey, Arabia, Mexico, South America, and every other country for we find that they invariably give, as the first definition of the equivalent of the English Sabbath: "The seventh or last day of the week."

The theologian who comes to us from the eastern Hemisphere, will be astonished to hear the word Sabbath used for the first day of the week, when, with them it always means the seventh day.
