THE Times, of Oakland, California, announces that the Society of Christian Endeavor, of that city, has entered upon a campaign for the manufacture of public opinion in favor of closing the World's Fair on Sunday. "They will," says the *Times*, "try to compel the observance of their Sabbath at an Exposition to which the whole world is invited, in spite of the fact that this Sabbath is recognized only by a minority of the world's inhabitants and religions."
