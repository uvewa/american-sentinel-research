It is announced that the matter of the Sunday opening of the Metropolitan Museum, in this city, has not been finally settled, "although," as the Christian Union remarks, "the experiment of the last eight months has proved a success, and the public is as interested in the subject as before." The same paper thus explains the difficulty: "There is no money with which to keep the Museum open on that day and the two evenings a week. The city has been asked to assume the entire charge of the expenses of the Museum and then open it free every day, but it has no power to do so. Resort, therefore, must be had to the Legislature, or the Sunday opening be stopped. The cost for this extra day is about $12,000; the class of people who come then is a very quiet and orderly one, so that no damage is done by them to the collections. Until the meeting of the Trustees in February, when the matter will be settled in one way or another, the Museum will continue open as usual."
