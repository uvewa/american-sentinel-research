# Sunday in Our Large Cities.

WHAT the American Sabbath Union and their allies are planning to bring every body indoors on Sundays, or else compel them to go to church, seems, more liberal, and devoting means to obtain the children, men and women, and the sickly, pitched, and pale children, to get a breath of fresh air and exercise. Their plans are practicable we do not pretend to say; but they do show the utter heartlessness of those who would deprive the tired workers of their weekly outing during the summer months.

In an article in the Christian Union of January 23, Lillian W. Betts says:—

"It is unnecessary to speak of the press now that can open to the people of the tenement-house regions on Sundays. The thousands of people who crowd the steamboat excursion boats and trains are a proof of how Sunday is passed by those who have from twenty five cents to a dollar to spend to get away from the stifling surroundings of the tenement-house regions on Sundays. And all this can and should be changed. Let the Christian philanthropist purchase boats or barges, and send them or trains to take New York people, say up the Sound and the Hudson River, on Sunday. Let the boats leave the dock about nine o'clock in the morning and return at nine o'clock at night, care being taken that the tickets are distributed to the entire family. Each family might take its own lunch; but it would be infinitely preferable to provide food on the barge that could be sold at low rates by the family in groups, or by groups of friends. With the 'Anderson Cooker' it would be a perfectly possible thing to prepare rich dinners and serve them hot. It would also be quite possible to control places at springs where milk or snack read could be had.

Now, and take the people in the early morning to these places, bringing them back at night. There should be a shelter for the babies, swings for the little children, ball-scraping, quoit games, and with the opportunity for good music and the companionship of men and women who are living the spirit of Christ. The effort should be, not to get the individual alone, but to get the entire family together.

"These excursions should always be changed for except where there is positive knowledge that even the contribution of the family of the family will not justify such an expense; in this case it should be a free-will offering. Anything to get these overworked, wan-faced women and children where they can breathe pure air make it possible for them to become acquainted, so that the mothers may know what the children play with, and learn the mothers of the children; that the children may see the children under conditions that at home, if it shows to no other family life, to give family life to those who really do not know the meaning of God, when the people do not know what the meanest of lives live, is so, entailed, to downtrodden are their lives with the mere effort to gain food and shelter and a covered place for their bodies. Let it be made possible to groups of families, and not to be made of groups of families, to get together; in the city on Sunday and we if the effort to get them to go to church as soon as we gain the window should, when they have learned the pleasure of working to do a thing together, of being together for the common good.

"The pity of the lives in these regions is that they are so individualized, that they hold as little relation to each other except as they belong to the same; and often when they belong to the same trade union, and this does not include the women and children; it is nearly impossible to unite any larger sum of desperate politics into the same number of sentences.

even agreed to close their saloons and distilleries, and breweries, on the Sundays upon which they join with their religious co-workers in asking that the Fair shall be closed. In this country, they find favor toward to the question smaller and larger business which they will on those days if they and the Sabbath Union succeed in closing the Fair gates on those days to work. It is, then, from motives of personal gain, and not to advocate a moral reform, that the liquor interest is willing to manifest itself with its supposed national enemy, the Church, and its kindred organizations, to secure the closing of the World's Fair on Sunday. They have no interests of even trying to serve both God and Mammon, but only Mammon.

If this is their purpose, what is the motive of those who are willing to ally themselves with them in the accomplishment of a common end? With one party to it an alliance into evil to win the interest of doing good that evil may come, and the other of doing evil that good may come, there is an unmixed blessing to humanity be the result? Nine-tenths of the saloon-keepers are honestly in sympathy with the Sunday closing of the Fair, that again the gates against whom the gates are closed may not sell their open doors; while those moralists award the moral in legal Sunday closing of the Fair are thus acquiescing in the turning of the current which, when the gates into the saloon's open doors.

Here is a petty anti-Sunday-saloon-keepers, whose liquor have to suffice for such will not amalgamate. There is then, a family affinity between these two. When is it shown that "how can two walk together, except they be agreed?"

They are agreed, is it that they neither of them show whether they appear to be that both the, the one through gross and palpable manner, and the other through desire, appearance to awhile deception, mistake to the character of liquidity and misery are serve the same side in the final conflict between the forces of good and evil.
