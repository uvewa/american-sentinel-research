# Christ's Kingdom.

THE matter of the kingship of Christ is that of that immortal and all the teaching one of the last addresses of teaching time one of the last considerations in the Bible. The service of teachers are due solitary to the community that exists upon this subject in the minds of many who are otherwise well-informed Scripture teach, concerning Christ's kingdom, are such, and can not be heard. National Reformers. They may earnestly pray, "Thy kingdom come," but they know that it can not ever come through human instrumentality, hence they patiently wait for the fulfillment of "the promise of God unto the fathers." And to this agree also the Scriptures.

We learn from a comparison of 2 Sam. 7:14, and parallel texts, with Heb. 1 that God promised this truth to Abraham and to his seed. Gal. 3:16 plainly declares that this one seed was Christ. Says the apostle, "Now to Abraham and to his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ." Gal. 3:16.

These facts taken together clearly show it positive that this world is promised to Christ. But it has not yet been given to him in its as plainly taught.

At the time these words were spoken to David the children of Israel had been in their land long enough and "the Lord had given him [them] rest round about from all his enemies." 2 Sam. 7:1; and yet the Lord revealed the promise at that time also, that he would establish the kingdom "forever before thee." 2 Sam. 7:16. How David regarded this is shown by his prayer in which he says:—

> And what is my house, that thou hast brought me hitherto? And this was yet a small thing in thy sight, O Lord God; but thou hast spoken also of thy servant's house for a great while to come.

"Yea thou hast confirmed to thyself thy people Israel to be a people unto thee forever."

This promise to David, like the promise to Abraham, was a promise to Christ (they were in fact the same promise), as we learn from Luke 1:31-33: "And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name Jesus. He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest; and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David: And he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end." This forever cuts and settles the claim of those men who profess a vicegerent of Christ, for Christ can not yet come in the sense contemplated in the promise, and until he does come the power of that throne can not be exercised. Christ himself tells us when he will assume that throne. He says:—

> When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory: and before him shall be gathered all nations; and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats; and he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left. Then shall the King say to those on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. Matt. 25:31-34.

The kingdom prepared from the foundation of the world, is the dominion given to Adam and by him lost through sin, the dominion promised to Abraham and his seed, which the apostle declares is Christ, and renewed from time to time from Abraham to the annunciation. That kingdom, as all men know, has not yet been given to Christ, and until the time comes the promise will be fulfilled, not by political methods and legislation, to rule by divine right, not by human organization, with high sounding and lofty titles, . . . but as by the father, whose the promise is; and his alone is the power to give the kingdom.

But what has become of the throne and kingdom of David? It is an inquiry that naturally arises at this point. The Scripture answers this question also. After the death of Solomon ten tribes revolted from his son Rehoboam. The history is thus recorded in 1 Kings 12:16-20:—

And when all Israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them, the people answered the king saying, What portion have we in David? neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: to your tents O Israel; now see to thine own house David. So Israel departed unto their tents. But as for the children of Israel which dwelt in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them. Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was over the tribute; and all Israel stoned him with stones, that he died. Therefore king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem. So Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day. And it came to pass, when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was come again, that they sent and called him unto the congregation, and made him king over all Israel: there was none that followed the house of David, but the tribe of Judah only.

The ten tribes made Jeroboam king and he ruled over Israel, but Rehoboam reigned over Judah. From this time the kingdom remained entire, but the two divisions existed with varying fortunes, until 721 B.C., when Israel became subject to Assyria, and Judah continued an independent kingdom until 588 B.C., when it became subject to Babylon and was ever after simply a province of some foreign power. And this was in exact accord with the word of the Lord by Ezekiel. Near the close of the reign of Zedekiah the Lord sent to him this word:—

And thou, profane wicked prince of Israel, whose day is come when iniquity shall have an end, Thus saith the Lord; Remove the diadem, and take off the crown: this shall not be the same: exalt him that is low, and abase him that is high. I will overturn, overturn, overturn it; and it shall be no more, until he come whose right it is; and I will give it him. Eze. 21:25-27.

God would endure their wickedness no longer. The people had compelled the Lord that he and not reign over them 1 Sam. 8:5-7, and demanded a king; but their kings had only led them into sin, and now the Lord declared that the kingdom should be no more until he came whose right it is, he to whom the promise was made, and he would give it to him. That this is Christ we have already seen. No believer in the Scriptures will deny this. All that then remains is to ascertain when this promise, of giving his kingdom to Christ, is to be fulfilled.

Can it be fulfilled by a spiritual reign or dominion, for the promise was, "The Lord shall give unto him the throne of his father David?" David ruled over, not a spiritual, but a literal kingdom; it follows that his throne is a literal and not a spiritual throne. And, according to the prophecy the power which that throne represents is to be no more "till he come whose right it is." This forever cuts the claim of those men who profess a vicegerent of Christ, for Christ can not yet come in the sense contemplated in the promise, and until he does come the power of that throne can not be exercised. Christ himself tells us when he will assume that throne. He says:—

> When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory: and before him shall be gathered all nations; and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats; and he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left. Then shall the King say to those on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. Matt. 25:31-34.

The kingdom prepared from the foundation of the world, is the dominion given to Adam and by him lost through sin, the dominion promised to Abraham and his seed, which the apostle declares is Christ, and renewed from time to time from Abraham to the annunciation. That kingdom, as all men know, has not yet been given to Christ, and until the time comes the promise will be fulfilled, not by political methods and legislation, to rule by divine right, not by human organization, with high sounding and lofty titles, . . . but as by the father, whose the promise is; and his alone is the power to give the kingdom.

This promise is referred to again in connection with his kingdom (Luke 22:29, 30), and is again received and noted. After that, David had been king for a day the Lord proposed in his heart to build a house for the Lord of hosts, a temple; but a messenger was forbidden to build it. He was, however, told that his son should build the house; and this promise was made to him: "Moreover I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in a place of their own, and move no more; neither shall the children of wickedness, afflict them any more." 2 Sam. 7:10.

At the time these words were spoken to David the children of Israel had been in their land long enough; and "the Lord had given him [them] rest round about from all his enemies." 2 Sam. 7:1; and yet the Lord revealed the promise at that time also, that he would establish the kingdom "forever before thee." 2 Sam. 7:16.
