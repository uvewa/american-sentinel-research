The word "commonwealth" signifies, strictly, common good or happiness, and is applied, for that reason, to a State, or body politic. As a governmental title, it was first employed in England during the protectorate of Oliver Cromwell, and his son Richard, and was so retained until the restoration of Charles II. in 1660. It was adopted on the death of Charles I. 1649, as signifying that the government was from that time to be administered in behalf of the common good of the people, and as adverse to a monarchial form of government, which was thought to be more in the interest of the ruler, than for the public good.

The primary purpose of human government is to secure to the people their natural rights,—"life liberty, and the pursuit of happiness"—for the common good. If, therefore, any government should grant a certain portion of its citizens advantages which it denied to another portion of equally loyal citizens, simply because they were greatly in the minority, it could not be truthfully said that such a government was administered for the common good, or happiness of the people. Happiness is an agreeable state of feeling which arises from the reception, or expectation of some supposed good. Social organizations are effected in almost every community as a means of happiness. The State does not interfere with them so long as their members are loyal to the government, and do not by their local organization endanger the rights or privileges of others. Religious organizations stand on the same footing, so far as their relation to the State is concerned. All who wish to pursue happiness through that particular method, have a perfect right to do so without molestation from the government of which they are citizens. They have, moreover, the right under the government to transact their own affairs, which societies of every other shade possess. By denying this to any class of loyal citizens in a government, happiness is refused them, the privation of which is oppression.

Had man, like the brute, no moral sense, he would have no human responsibility, here nor hereafter, and therefore, no necessity for rights peculiarly his own. But in view of his nature, and the necessity for moral development, he has rights which must be exercised according to the dictates of his own moral sense. This can not be otherwise, since man has a personal accountability to the Author of his being, which no one else can in any way assume. Since, then, each one is responsible to God alone for the use of these powers, it follows that no one else can properly interfere in the exercise of them, neither can they be regulated by legislative enactments.

The reason for this is obvious. Human rights entail moral obligations which are absolute, the neglect of which is sin, and only he on whom the duty devolves can determine what action must be taken under the circumstances. This follows from the fact that strictly moral claims can only be validly acknowledged in the realm of conscience. They can not, therefore, properly become subject to human enactments. For instance: It may be the absolute duty of one who is able, to assist a poor neighbor. Not to do so may be a sin, because the neglect is prompted by sordid meanness and heartlessness. But for all that, no human law can reach such a case and compel a performance of duty, which springs alone from an enlightened and active conscience.

There are, however, duties of a negative character, the performance of which may be enforced by law. It is a duty every one owes his neighbor, not to injure his reputation person or property. Should this breach of duty occur, the law may interfere, and punish the offender, because the very province of human government is to protect its subjects against injury from one another. The extract which follows from Macaulay's writings sets this matter forth very clearly:

An orange-woman stops up the pavement with her wheelbarrow; and a policeman takes her into custody. A miser who has amassed a million suffers an old friend and benefactor to die in a workhouse, and can not be questioned before any tribunal for his baseness and ingratitude. Is this because legislators think the orange-woman's conduct worse than the miser's? Not at all. It is because the stopping up of the pathway is one of the evils against which it is the business of the public authorities to protect society, and heartlessness is not one of those evils. It would be the height of folly to say that the miser ought, indeed, to be punished, but that he ought to be punished less severely than the orange-woman.

It is therefore plain that governments can not deal with sin as such, though some have maintained the contrary. Their ground of opinion has been ably stated by Charles Spencer M. Philips in his work on Jurisprudence, page 274, and is as follows:

They lay down the principle that the world is God's world, and that all who inhabit it are bound by God's laws, and from this they infer that human justice ought, so far as human fallibility will allow, to be a precise counterpart of God's justice. They do not advert to the obvious possibility that there may be some of God's laws which it is not his will to communicate to human administration, and which human beings would, therefore, be guilty of a sin by attempting to enforce.—Quoted in Bible in Public Schools, page 202.

The law of ten commandments is defined as "the will of God, as the supreme moral Ruler concerning the character and conduct of all responsible beings; the rule of action as obligatory on the conscience or moral nature." From this it will be seen at once, that the foregoing method of reasoning would make the civil ruler the minister of God's will over the conscience of every citizen under his jurisdiction, and arm him with the authority of Heaven, with which to enforce his decrees. As the agent, or vicegerent of God, to resist him would be to resist God. Moreover, in that case there would be no necessity for human legislation; for, having God's law as a standard of civil government, to revise that or add to it in the least, would be an impeachment of the wisdom which gave it; to say nothing of the complete folly of an attempt to administer the same penalty for the violation of petty civil laws, which is demanded by the law of Jehovah. The only logical way to conduct the affairs of such a concern, would be to proclaim the "divine right of kings," and then let the incumbent of official power announce all his decrees as the voice of God.
