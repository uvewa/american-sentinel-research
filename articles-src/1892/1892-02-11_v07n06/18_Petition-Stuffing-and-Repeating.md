REV. DAVID ANDERSON, a correspondent of the *United Presbyterian* (Dec. 31, 1891), calls the "omnibus petition" in question because it asks for too many things, and also, as he puts it, because "there may be a question as to the multiple of personage on petitions." He explains his meaning as follows:—

In a congregation, A may vote and petition as a member of the congregation, again in the Sabbath school; then in the Christian Endeavor or Young People; then in the missionary society; then in the several conventions of these, or larger assembly, etc.

This is an honest confession, and would doubtless benefit the soul of him who made it, had he not immediately nullified it by adding this defense of petition "stuffing" and "repeating":—

While this appears objectionable on its face, yet, when we consider these petitions are not personal, but organizational, A has the right of being represented in proportion to his or her working powers in each of these, as these organizations may be affected by the action petitioned for.

The defense is entirely worthy of the whole "civil Sunday" cause. The advice of its leaders in the matter of petitions is substantially the same as that which a dying miser is said to have given his son: "John, get money! Get it honestly if you can; but get money!"
