THAT there is no end to the division and sectionalism which may arise on religious questions when they are once fairly inducted into politics, is shown by this paragraph from the *Northwestern Christian Advocate*:—

We hold that our national houses of legislation will see the point and decline to assail God's day even by implication. It has been stated that "there is more danger in the House than in the Senate, because it is so largely democratic." We do not share that belief. The South as a part of the Republic is truer to the Sabbath than is the North. Party leaders in the South have not been twisted out of loyalty to some correct American traditions, by supposed proper regard for the "ideas of foreigners," and demagogic concessions to large bodies of voters. As between the two geographical sections we look for such sturdy support from Southern members that Northern democrats will be less willing to vote for a bill that permits the desecration of the Sabbath at the World's Fair.

An analysis of this paragraph shows a remarkable multiplicity of sectionalism, division, and partisanship, in religion, accepted by this writer as a matter of course. A division between the Senate and the House; a division on party lines, between Democrats and Republicans; a sectional division between the South and the North; antagonism between native and foreign elements; political animosity between the minority and the majority, in "demagogic concessions to large bodies of voters," and closing with an appeal to the "geographical" sympathies of the Southern members to help close the World's Fair on Sunday. It would be impossible to condense any larger sum of dangerous politics into the same number of sentences.
