Rev. J. P. Mills, the Chicago Secretary of the American Sabbath Union, writing to the Christian Statesman under date of Oct. 10, 1891, attempts to answer the charge of neglect made by Rev. W. F. Crafts in the matter of petitions against the opening of the World's Fair on Sunday. He insists that the small number of petitions sent in was not due to his neglect in the matter of mailing necessary papers, before a certain date. Mr. Mills's defense and explanation seems to us valid, and he is undoubtedly correct when he says; the "failure to petition must be traced, therefore to some other cause. Mr. Crafts says in a recent article that many of the societies he has organized have not petitioned; he says, 'not more than one-half.' To my certain knowledge not one in twenty-five of them sent in their petitions; not more than six came, though he twice notified me that about four per week should reach us. Mrs. Bateham's recent letter in the Statesman also indicates that there has been a wonderful failure to send in petitions. Where lies the difficulty?"

This failure is perfectly natural. People generally, even religious people, have not regard enough for Sunday, nor faith enough in any efforts that may be made to close the exhibition, nor a sufficiently strong desire to have it closed, to be enthusiastic about the petitions. People believe what they have been taught, that "there is no Sabbath under the gospel," and hence they can not regard Sunday as sacred.—Sabbath Outlook.
