THE Union Signal says that "the United States consul in Sierra Leone, in a private letter to a friend in this country, recently wrote:—

I am not a missionary, nor the son of one, but I judge the present by the past. The Christian nations of the earth must set a better example than flooding this country with rum and gin, and landing it on the Sabbath day at the wharf within fifty yards of the church. I stood on the wharf last Sabbath and saw steamers come into the harbor from Germany and England, and they commenced to land rum and gin. There were over one hundred men employed all day and the customs officers had to be on duty. The native kings are petitioning the government to stop the liquor traffic. It is ruining their people. One king says if they continue, it will cause him to leave his country and go where the white man's rum can't reach his people."

This illustrates the folly of calling nations Christian. The heathen, both at home and in foreign lands, should be taught that that only is Christian that is Christlike.
