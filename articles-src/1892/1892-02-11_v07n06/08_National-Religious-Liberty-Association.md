# National Religious Liberty Association.

## DECLARATION OF PRINCIPLES.

We believe in the religion of the Bible, and in the civil government as ordained by heaven, each one supreme in its own sphere.

We believe it is the right of every citizen to be protected by the government in his religious belief.

We protest against any union of the civil government and religion.

We believe it is the right of any citizen or class of citizens to use any means or methods not in themselves wrong, to influence the hearts of men so that they may conform to a standard of morality not inconsistent with our moral obligation to God. It is not our duty to use force to compel any man to act contrary to his convictions of religious liberty, to resort to intimidation.

We believe that the interests of Church and State are best promoted when each remains free of the entanglement of the other.

We believe in the universal right of religious belief and practice.

Religious newspapers are permitted to use hidden their particularism to read the secular papers have been discussed the matter. In fact the Catholics are barred are opposed to nomination in religion, and a political contest over the question is at hand, to the horror of Congressional paragraphs.—
