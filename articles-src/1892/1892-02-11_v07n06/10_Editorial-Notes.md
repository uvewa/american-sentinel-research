# Editorial Notes.

THE *Mail and Express* notes the fact that work has been begun in the interior of the new Second Congregational Church, at Rockford, Illinois, on Sunday, and says it has caused quite a stir in religious circles.

---

"MONTHLY DOCUMENT," No. 11, of the American Sabbath Union asks the question, "How shall we obey the fourth commandment in a way acceptable to God?" From the standpoint of the organization that asks the question, we must say frankly that we do not know.

---

THE *Catholic Review* does not like the proposed amendment to the national Constitution because it contains more than a general principle. It is not strange that Catholics object to this measure since it is undoubtedly designed to shut off some of the public pay which that church has been feeding on for some years.

---

The *Denver News* very pertinently says, "That man is not fit to make laws for a nation, pure in his soul and character, that he is faithful in his friendship only by an act of Congress is a noteworthy of condemnation."

. . . Law is only useful to restrain the lawless inclinators to use that of persons to become an active agent in the actual creation of character."

REV. DAVID ADVENTISM, a correspondent of the *United Presbyterian*, Jan. 15, calls the "omnibus petition" in Congress "a petition for omnibus closing thing, and also, as he put it, because "there may be a question as to the multiple of 'personals on petition.' He explains his meaning as follows:—

In a congregation, a man's wife and petition a number of the congregation, again in the Sabbath school, then in the Christian Endeavor or Young People; then in the missionary society; then in the several of societies of those at larger churches.

This is an honest confession, and this is calculated the honest the soul of him who made it, had he not immediately nullified it by adding the defense of petition "stuffing" and "repeating."

With this upon expectations on its face, yet, when we consider these petitions are not personal, but organized. A has a right of beings represented in proportion to his her voting power in each of those, as those organizations may be affected by the action petitioned for.

This defense is entirely worthy of the whole "civil Sunday" cause. The artifice of its leaders in the matter of petition is substantially the same as that which a dying miner is said to have given his son: "John, get money! Get it honestly if you can; but get money!"

THE *Times*, of Oakland, California, announces that the Society of Christian Endeavor, of that city, has entered upon a campaign for the manufacture of public opinion in favor of closing the World's Fair on Sunday. "They will," says the *Times*, "endeavor to create a sentiment for their Sabbath at an Exposition to which the whole world is invited, in spite of the fact that this Sabbath is recognized only by a minority of the world's inhabitants as a Sabbath."

In Washington, D. C., Sunday evening, January 31, Rev. Dr. Corey, of the Metropolitan Methodist Episcopal Church, preached a sermon on "Pilate the Man of Expediency," in the course of which he is reported by the *Post* to have said:—

There are many willing to commit sins against honor, more that know the very measure of right or wrong, while they are more unscrupulous in regard to methods to an endeavor by the law of society, but which have no moral character! How many men are willing to avoid breaking the law by an outward semblance, but willingly on Sunday, will allow themselves to be governed by the forward scenes, but not by and be silent on church on Sunday?

Whether this was an intended or not, it is a confession that Sunday observing, at least, is, as foolishly, only by "the law of society." It would be interesting to know whether the eloquent divine knows that such laws are justifiable from the standpoint of civil justice.

There that is no end to the division and sectarianism which arises, while no religious politicians quite so easily when they are once fairly divided into politics, is shown by this paragraph from the *Northwestern Christian Advocate*:—

We find that our national houses of legislation will use the point and destine to maid their day by going into the Sunday question; and the bill is more danger in the House than in the Senate, because it is so largely Democratic. We do not share that belief. The South as a part of the political point is true to the Sabbath than the North. Sabbath traditions in the South are best described, out of loyalty to some concert American traditions, neither be northern or southern, are to "close up squares," and demagogic concessions to large bodies of foreign-born citizens.

As between the two sides from which at times we look such sturdy support from Southern members that the Sabbath character has been willing to vote for a bill that permits the desecration of the Sabbath at the World's Fair.

An analysis of this paragraph shows a condition of things on the part of religious politicians for which it is difficult to find a parallel in the subject of division, and partisanship, in religion, secured by this writer as a matter of course.

A division between the Senate and the House, a division or party lines, between Democrats and Republicans, a sectionalism between the South and the North. And a division between native and foreign born to be promoted, and promoted nationally between the aristocracy and the majority, is "demagogic concessions to large bodies of voters" and closing with an appeal to the "geography" and "organization of the Southern members" to help close the World's Fair on Sunday.

It would be impossible to condense any larger sum of desperate politics into the same number of sentences.

The *China Signal* says that the United States consul in Sierra Leone, has a private letter to a friend in this country, in which he says:—

I am not a missionary, nor the case of one, but I can not help being satisfied that the nearest solution of the truth of the earth must act a better example that the missionaries are doing for the progress and development of Africa than any other institution outside of the church. It stood on the what had faithfully been sent to on Africa's condition the church of Germany and England, and they commenced to work. It started the most the man who was best fitted for it. The native who goes there to the merchants and the like, or who comes to the colonies, or to the coast, those native people pick up too quickly the evil habits of what they are brought into; they also turn him to serve his own country and go then wherever they please. But from that character of all missions this is the universal testimony of all.

This illustrates the folly of calling nations Christian. The churches, the lodges, and hons and in foreign lands, kindred to all things had said only in a Christian is regard to the Christians.

True Sunday laws have and always were to be religious in origin, says the British Sabbath system, as set forth by Blackstone or any other British authority or the history of the British Sabbath system, and Religion," Those "profanations of the Lord's day" is claimed with such things as being "lewd," meaning "as saying," with the ordnances of the church," "non-conformity to the worship of church," "wholly speaking the word of the worship," "witchcraft," "conjuration," "sorcery," "enchantment," each and all of which was purely ecclesiastical and falsely pretending an extraordinarily commission from Heaven. Not obstructing, as an ecclesiastical offense cognizable by the spiritual court, and such confusion of civil and ecclesiastical ideas and punishment was regarded as an offense against God and even and Government. This is the company with which Sunday laws belong. The penalty for violating the old English Sunday law was to fall into disuse after a while. Then the penalty was that "for the first offense the fine to half one dollar should be not over five shillings.
