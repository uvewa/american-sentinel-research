While the American Sabbath Union and their allies are planning to keep every body indoors on Sunday, or else compel them to go to church, some, more liberal, are devising means to enable the toiling, tired men and women, and the sickly, pinched, and pale children, to get a breath of fresh air once a week. That these plans are practicable we do not pretend to say; but they do show the utter heartlessness of those who would deprive the tired workers of their weekly outing during the summer season.

In an article in the Christian Union of January 23, Lillian W. Betts says:—

"It is unnecessary to speak of the pleasures that are open to the people of the tenement-house regions on Sunday. The thousands of people who crowd the excursion boats and trains are a proof of how Sunday is passed by those who have from twenty-five cents to a dollar to spend to get away from the stifling surroundings of the tenement-house regions on Sunday, and all this can and should be changed. Let the Christian philanthropists purchase barges or boats, and send them on trips about New York Harbor, up the Sound and the Hudson River, on Sunday. Let the boats leave the dock about nine o'clock in the morning and return at nine o'clock at night, care being taken that the tickets are distributed to the entire family. Each family might take its own lunch; but it would be infinitely better to provide a dinner on the barge that could be sold and eaten by the family in groups, or by groups of friends. With the "Atkinson Cooker" it would be a perfectly possible thing to prepare such dinners and serve them hot. It would also be quite possible to control islands or groves within easy reach of New York, and take the people in the early morning to these places, bringing them back at night. There should be a shelter for the babies, swings for the little children, baby-carriages, quiet games, and with this the opportunity for good music and the companionship of men and women who are living the spirit of Christ. The effort should be, not to get the individual alone, but to get the entire family together.

"These excursions should always be charged for except where there is positive knowledge that even the combined income of the family will not justify such an expense; in that case it should be a free-will offering. Anything to get these families together under conditions that make it possible for them to become acquainted, so that the mothers may know the children their children play with, and the mothers of the children; that the fathers may see the children under conditions that they never can see them in when at home. It would do more to revive family life, to give family life to these people, than sermons preached on the love of God, when the people do not know what the sensation of love is, so crushed, so downtrodden are their lives with the mere effort to gain food and shelter and a covering for their bodies. Let the experiment be made of taking groups of families away, beginning early in the spring, and see if the effort to get them to go to church would be as great when the winter comes, when once they have learned the pleasure of working to do a thing together, of being together for the common good.

"The pity of the lives in these regions is that they are so individualized, that they hold so little relation to each other except in the mere matter of 'treating,' or where they belong to the same trade union, and this does not include the women and children. It is somewhat startling to hear that there are women living in these regions who do not know where their husbands work; they do know what at, but not where, and some actually will have daughters at work only fifteen years old and not know where they are working; and yet these women would be called good wives and good mothers, as goodness is understood there, which means an effort to keep clean and sober.

"It is possible now to secure change and recreation for these people with the expenditure of very little money by the philanthropists. . . . Jew and Gentile could enjoy the Sunday together, and would gather, as has been proven where the experiment has been made, about a piano or organ and sing hymns for an hour at a time with positive enjoyment. . . .

"Think what it would be, on a bright, clear, sunshiny Sunday in winter, to take a group of boys out of our tenement-house streets, where they spend the whole day peiting each other and passers-by with slush, to where the snow would be white and clean, as it would be in either of the parks, and let them live the whole day out-of-doors, calling them in to a dinner, simple but hearty and well cooked, for which every one of them could pay at least five cents, and then take them home at night! There are young men enough, men in our city colleges and the Seminary, and others, who would be glad to spend a Sunday in this way, or a part of one."
