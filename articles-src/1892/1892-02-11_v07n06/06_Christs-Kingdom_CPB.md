The subject of the kingship of Christ is one of the most interesting and at the same time one of the least understood of any in the Bible. The errors of National Reform are due entirely to the confusion that exists upon this subject in the minds of the people. Those who know what the Scriptures teach, concerning Christ's kingdom, are not, and can not become, National Reformers. They may earnestly pray, "Thy kingdom come," but they know that it can never come through human instrumentality, hence they patiently wait for the fulfillment of "the promise made of God unto the fathers." And to this promise the reader's attention is invited.

We learn from a comparison of Gen. 17:1-8, and parallel texts, with Rom. 4:13 that God promised this world to Abraham and to his seed. Gal. 3:16 plainly declares that this seed was Christ. Says the apostle: "Now to Abraham and to his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ." These texts taken together make it positive that this world is promised to Christ. But that it has not yet been given to him is just as plainly taught.

The promise made to Abraham and to his seed was renewed from time to time to Abraham's descendants. To Isaac God said: "Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee; for unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all these countries, and I will perform the oath which I sware unto Abraham thy father." Gen. 26:3. Likewise to Jacob the Lord said: "I am the Lord God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac; the land whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed." Gen. 28:13.

This promise is referred to again in connection with the Exodus (Ex. 6:4-8), and is again renewed unto David. After David had been king for a long time he purposed in his heart to build a house for the Lord, namely, a temple, or sanctuary; but he was forbidden to build it. He was, however, told that his son should build the house, and this promise was made to him: "Moreover I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in a place of their own, and move no more; neither shall the children of wickedness, afflict them any more, as beforetime." 2 Sam. 7:10.

At the time these words were spoken to David the children of Israel had been in Canaan four hundred years, and "the Lord had given him [them] rest round about from all his [their] enemies" (2 Sam. 7:1), and yet the Lord treated the promise as unfulfilled, and at this time identified David with it by this assurance: "And thine house and thy kingdom shall be established forever before thee." 2 Sam. 7:16. How David regarded this is shown by verse 18 and 24: "Who am I Lord God? and what is my house, that thou hast brought me hitherto? And this was yet a small thing in thy sight, O Lord God; but thou hast spoken also of thy servant's house for a great while to come." "For thou hast confirmed to thyself thy people Israel to be a people unto thee forever."

This promise to David, like the promise to Abraham, was a promise to Christ (they were in fact the same promise), as we learn from Luke 1:31-33: "And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name Jesus. He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest; and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David. And he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end." This explains how the house of David was to be established forever, his line was to end in Christ, who will finally take the kingdom and rule over it "forever, even forever and ever."

But what then has become of the throne and kingdom of David? is an inquiry that naturally arises at this point. The Scriptures answer this question also. After the death of Solomon ten tribes revolted against his son Rehoboam. The history is thus recorded in 1 Kings 12:16-20:—

So when all Israel saw that the king heartened not unto them, the people answered the king saying, What portion have we in David? neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse; to your tents, O Israel, now see to thine own house, David. So Israel departed unto their tents. But as for the children of Israel which dwelt in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them. . . . So Israel rebelled against the house of David until this day. And it came to pass that when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was come again, that they sent and called him unto the congregation, and made him king over all Israel: there was none that followed the house of David but the tribe of Judah only.

The ten tribes made Jeroboam king and he ruled over Israel, but Rehoboam reigned in Jerusalem. The kingdom was never again united, but the two divisions existed with varying fortunes, until 721 B. C., when Israel became subject to Assyria. Judah continued an independent kingdom until 588 B. C., when it became subject to Babylon and was ever after simply a province of some foreign power. And this was in exact accord with the word of the Lord by Ezekiel. Near the last of the reign of Zedekiah the Lord sent to him this word:—

And thou, profane wicked prince of Israel, whose day is come when iniquity shall have an end. Thus saith the Lord God; remove the diadem and take off the crown, this shall not be the same: exalt him that is low, and abase him that is high. I will overturn, overturn, overturn it: and it shall be no more, until he come whose right it is; and I will give it him. Ezek. 21:25-27.

God would endure their wickedness no longer. The people had rejected the Lord that he should not reign over them (1 Sam. 8:7), and demanded a king; but their kings had only led them into sin; and now the Lord declared that the kingdom should be no more until he come whose right it is, he to whom the promise was made, and he would give it to him. That this is Christ we have already seen. No believer in the Scriptures will deny this. All then that remains is to ascertain when this promise, of giving the kingdom to Christ, is to be fulfilled. It could not be fulfilled by a spiritual reign or dominion, for the promise was, "The Lord shall give unto him the throne of his father David." David ruled over, not a spiritual but a literal kingdom; it follows that his throne is a literal and not a spiritual throne. And, according to the prophecy the power which that throne represents is to be no more "till he come whose right it is." This forever cuts off the claim of those who rule professedly as vicegerents of Christ, for Christ has not yet come in the sense contemplated in the promise; and until he does come the power of that throne can not be exercised. Christ himself tells us when he will take that throne. He says:—

When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory: and before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divided; his sheep from the goats: and he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left. Then shall the King say to those on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. Matt. 25:31-34.

The kingdom prepared from the foundation of the world, is the dominion given to Adam and by him lost through sin,—the dominion promised to Abraham and to his seed, which the apostle declares is Christ, and renewed from time to time from Abraham till the annunciation. That kingdom, as all men know, has not yet been given to Christ; and when the time comes the promise will be fulfilled, not by political action, not by men assuming to rule by divine right, not by human organizations, with high sounding and highly religious names, but by God the father, whose the promise is; and his alone is the power to fulfill it.
