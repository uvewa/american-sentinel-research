# Morality and Civil Government.

THE SENTINEL has been criticized in the past for the statement that morality is a matter that does not come properly within the scope of civil government. Nevertheless the statement is literally true, as can be easily demonstrated. Morality, as defined by Webster, is, "The relation of conformity or non-conformity to the true moral standard or rule, . . . the conformity of an act of the divine law." The true moral standard is the law of God—the ten commandments. The keeping of the commandments is morality; the breaking of any one of them is immorality. The keeping of the ten commandments is righteousness; the breaking of any one of them is sin.

This true moral standard takes cognizance of the thoughts and intents of the heart. To hate is murder, to covet is idolatry, to think impurely towards a woman is adultery; and these things are immoral. Morality or immorality lies in the heart; it pertains to the thoughts and intents of the heart; and with it the State can have nothing at all to do. The civil government has nothing to do with hatred, nor with covetousness, nor with impure thinking; yet all these things are immoral. A man may hate his neighbor all his life; he may covet everything on earth; he may think impurely of every woman that he sees; he may keep this up all his days, and the State will not touch him, nor has it any right to touch him. It would be difficult to conceive of a more immoral person than such a man would be, yet the State can not punish him. And this demonstrates one proposition: that with immorality the State can have nothing at all to do. Only let his moral hatred lead him to attempt to do any injury to his neighbor, and the State will punish him. Only let his covetousness lead him by force to take what is not his, in an attempt to steal, and the State will punish him. Only let his impure mind lead him to an attempt whether by any means and the State will punish him. Yet, bear in mind, the State does not punish him even then for his immorality, but for his incivility. The State punishes no man because he is immoral, but because he is uncivil. It does not punish his immorality; it is not punished because his immorality is moral iniquity. This distinction is shown in the very terms by which we designate State or national government. It is called civil government, to govern men's *civil* conduct, their conduct as it relates one to another.

The government of God is the only moral government. God is the only moral Governor. The law of God is the only moral law. To God alone pertains the government of morality, which is the transgression of the moral law. Governments of men are *civil* governments, not moral. Governors of men are *civil* governors, not moral. The laws of States and nations are *civil* laws, not moral. To the authorities of civil government it pertains to punish incivility, not immorality. This again is demonstrated, that with morality civil governments never can of right have anything to do.

On the other hand, as God is the only moral Governor, so is he the only moral government; as his law is the only moral law, and as it pertains to him alone to punish immorality, it pertains to him alone to define the terms of morality pertaining to him alone. Morality is conformity to the law of God; it is obedience to God. But obedience to God must spring from the heart in sincerity and truth. This it must do, or it is not obedience to him; for as was proved by the word of God, the law of God takes cognizance of the thoughts and intents of the heart. But "all have sinned and come short of the glory of God." By transgression all men have made themselves immoral. "Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified [accounted righteous or made moral] in his sight." Rom. 3:20. As all men by transgression of the law of God, made themselves immoral, therefore no man can, by obedience to the law, become moral; because it is that very law which declares him to be immoral. The demands, therefore, of the moral law, must be satisfied, before he can ever be accepted as obedient by the law or the Author of the law. The demands of the moral law can never be satisfied by the individual himself, and this is just what every person has justified by transgression. Therefore it is certain that men can never become moral by their own efforts.

From this it is equally certain that if ever man shall be made moral, it must be by the Author and Source of all morality. And this is just the provision which God has made. For "the righteousness [morality] of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets; even the righteousness [the morality] of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe; for there is no difference: for all have sinned [made themselves immoral] and come short of the glory of God." Rom. 3:21-23. It is by the morality of Christ alone that men can be made moral. It is only through the morality [righteousness] of God, which is imputed to us for Christ's sake, and we receive it by faith in him who is both the Author and Finisher of faith. Then by the Spirit of God the moral law is written in the heart and in the mind, manifesting the soul-cleansing, soul-saving, sanctifying truth. And thus alone, can men ever attain to morality; and that morality is the morality of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ, and there is no other in this world. Therefore, no morality springs from God, and is planted in the heart by the Spirit of God, through faith in the Son of God. It is demonstrated by proofs of Holy Writ, that civil government can never be a promoter of morality.

The Church, the sole promoter of God's truth, through what instrumentality does she work to promote morality in the world? What body has she made the conservator of morality in the world? The Church or the civil power?—"The Church" and the Church alone. It is the "pillar and ground of the truth." It was to the Church that he said, "Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature;" and "lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world." It is by the Church, through the preaching of Jesus Christ, that the gospel is "made known to all nations for the obedience of faith." There is no morality without the faith; there is no morality but the morality of faith. Therefore it is proved that to the Church and not to the State is committed the conservation of morality in the world. This at once settles the question as to whether the State shall teach morality. The State can not teach morality. It has not the credentials for it. The Spirit of God and the gospel of grace are both essential to the teaching of morality, and neither of them is committed to the State, but both to the Church.

But, though this work be committed to the Church, even then there is not committed to the Church the prerogative either to reward morality or to punish immorality. She beseeches, she entreats, she persuades men to be reconciled to God. She instructs them in the principles and the practice of morality. It is hers by moral suasion to lead the soul to the all-sufficient purity and discipline of her membership. But hers it is not either to reward morality or to punish immorality. This pertains to God alone, because whether it be morality or immorality, it springs from the secret counsels of the heart; and as God alone knows the heart, his alone it is to determine either the merit or the guilt involved in any question of morals.

By this it is demonstrated that to no man, to no assembly or organization of men, does there belong any right whatever to punish immorality in any way. Whoever attempts it, usurps the prerogative of God. The Inquisition is the inevitable logic of the claim of any man or set of men to punish immorality. Because, to punish immorality, it is necessary to know to get at the thoughts and intents of the heart. The Papacy asserting the right to compel men to be moral, and to punish them for immorality, had the cruel consistency to carry this evil principle to its logical consequence. In carrying out this principle every effort was made to get at the secrets of men's hearts; and it was found that the diligent application of torture wrung from men, in many cases, a full confession of the most secret counsels of their hearts. Hence the Inquisition was established as the means best adopted to secure the desired end. So long as men grant the proposition that morality is within the province of civil government to enforce morality, it is to very little purpose that they condemn the Inquisition, for that tribunal is only the logical result of the proposition.

By all these evidences it is established the plain, common-sense principle that to civil government pertains only civil affairs and them itself implies—what is civil. The province of civil government is civil, and not moral. Its function is to preserve order, and not to coerce; and its aim is to protect its in earned safety in guarding them against all incivility. Morality belongs to God; civility, belongs to the State. "Render therefore unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's."
