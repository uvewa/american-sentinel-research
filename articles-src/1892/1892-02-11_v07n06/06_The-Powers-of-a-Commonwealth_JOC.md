# The Powers of a Commonwealth.

THE word "commonwealth" signifies literally, common good or happiness, of a community. For that reason, to date, or for body politic. As a governmental title, it was first applied to the English government, in the protectorate of Oliver Cromwell, and his son Richard, and was so remained until the restoration of Charles II. In 1650, it was adopted on the death of Charles I, on an act signifying that the government was from that time to be administered in behalf of the common good for all classes, and so advance to a monarchial form of government. And this gives the true idea of what a government should be, administered more in the interest of the ruler, than for the public good.

The primary purpose of human government is to secure to the people their natural rights,—"life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness"—for the common good. If, unfortunately, any government grants a certain portion of its citizens advantages which it is unable to extend to all classes, equally all citizens, simply because they were greatly in the minority, it could not be truthfully said that such a government as administered for the common good, or happiness of the people. Happiness is an agreeable state of feeling which arises from the consciousness of time and others supposed good. Social organizations are effected in almost every community as a matter of happiness. The State does not interfere with them so long as their purposes are legal to the government, and do not by their local organization endanger the rights or privileges of others. Religious organizations stand on the same footing, so as far as that relation to the government is concerned. All who wish to pursue happiness through that particular method, that is, have a perfect right to an individual realization from the government of which they are citizens. They have, moreover, the right that the government to transact their own affairs, which carries with it the right of every class to a good denying this to any class of legal citizens in a government. To legislate a reform upon them, the privation of which is oppressive.

The law, like the brute, no moral sense, we would have no human responsibility, bore not homeside, and therefore no necessity for rights peculiarly his own. But in case if its nature has endowed him with a faculty for moral development, he has rights adapted to his nature, and becomes the dictator of his own moral sense, the highest that can be observed, since man has a personal accountability to the Author of his being, which no one else in one way whatever can share. Since, each one is required to abide alone for the use of those powers, it follows that no man can use or interfere to his exercise in the exercise of them, neither can they be regulated by legislation or otherwise.

The reason for this is obvious. Human rights the small moral obligations which are absolute, the neglect of which is sin, and only he to whom the duty devolves can say whether what action must be taken under the circumstances. These duties flow from the fact that strictly moral claims are only valid acknowledged in the higher realm of conscience. They can not, therefore, properly become subject to human enactments. For instance, it can not be the absolute duty of one who is able, to assist a poor neighbor. Not do is no duty to be so far, because the neglect is prompted by benevolence and moral heartlessness, but for all that, no human law can reach such a case and compel a performance of duty, which springs alone from an enlightened and active conscience.

There are, however, duties of a negative character, the performance of which may be enforced by law: as, "Thou shalt not covet," or move his neighbor, not to injure Church, Newark, N. J., Monday, January the seventh, or last day of the week, and his reputation person or property. Should this breach of duty occur, the law may interfere, and punish the offender, because in the very province of human government to protect his subjects against all injuries from one another. The extract which follows from Macaulay's writings sets this matter forth very clearly:—

> An assessor wraps up the warmest of his warehouse: and a policeman takes her into the protection; a gentleman passes on an old friend and benefactor to die in a workhouse, and not in his or punished before any

bound for his baseness and ingratitude. Is this because bigotry thinks the better cause does serve more than the others'? Not at all. It is because the stopping of up the purse or mind of the scale against which it is the business of the public authorities to protect society; and inasmuch does not of those evils. It would to the height of folly to say that the same good, indeed, to be punished, that he ought to be punished for those that cause ravages worse.

It is therefore plain that governments do not deal with sin as such, through some have maintained the contrary. This ground of punition has been ably stated by Charles Spencer M. Phillips in his work on *Jurisprudence*, page 23), and is as far laid down.

They lay down the principle that the world is God's world, and that all who inhabit are bound by God's laws, and from this they infer that human rights, to far as human tribunals are concerned. They a free possession of individual liberty. But do not advert to the obvious possibility that their rule might be, and actually is, in some respects, too broad to communicate to human administration, and as a test for the mere purpose of convenience, set a sin by attempting to enforce.—*Quoted in Bible in Public Schools*, page 73.

The law of ten commandments is defined "the will of God, as the supreme moral Ruler concerning the character and conduct of all responsible beings; the rule of accountability, or the obligation on the conscience of moral nature." From this it will be seen at once, that this from the principle method of thus reading would make the civil ruler the judge of "the character and the conduct" of every citizen under his jurisdiction. Then are, with the authority of religion, with which therefore his conduct, in his seed, which the apostle, or vigorously of God, to rule all this world will be raised God. Moreover, in that case there would be no excuse for human legislation, for excluding God's law as a standard of civil government. To exclude it on the ground that such laws would, would be an impeachment of the wisdom which gave it; so by setting morality the compiler of all yet attempt to adjudicate for setting the same penalty for the violation of God's civil laws, which is demanded by the law of Jehovah. The only logical way to punish the affair of right in espousing would be to proclaim the "divine right of kings" for the priest or political authority to official power announce all his decrees as the voice of God.
