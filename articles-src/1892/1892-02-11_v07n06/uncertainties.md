# Uncertainties Log - Volume 7, Number 6 (1892-02-11)

## OCR Quality Notes

The OCR quality of this issue was generally good. Most text was clear and readable.

## Specific Uncertainties

### Page 4, Column 2, Article "Sunday in Our Large Cities"
- **Transcribed as:** "peiting"
- **Context:** "where they spend the whole day peiting each other and passers-by with slush"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM - likely should be "pelting" but OCR shows "peiting"
- **Reason:** This appears to be an OCR error, but transcribed as shown

### Page 5, Column 2, Article "The Powers of a Commonwealth"
- **Author attribution:** "J. O. CORLISS"
- **Confidence:** HIGH - initials clearly shown at end of article
- **Note:** This author is not in the known authors list provided

## Author Notes

- J. O. CORLISS (JOC) appears as an author in this issue but was not listed in the known authors reference list. The initials are clear at the end of the article "The Powers of a Commonwealth."

## Advertisements and Non-Article Content

The following pages contained primarily advertisements and were not transcribed as articles:
- Pages 6-7: Book advertisements, subscription information, health foods
- Page 8: Editorial notes section, subscription information

## General Notes

- All page headers reading "THE AMERICAN SENTINEL" were omitted
- Page numbers were omitted
- Image references (img-0.jpeg, img-1.jpeg) were omitted
- The National Religious Liberty Association "Declaration of Principles" box on page 6 appeared to have repetitive text (lines 227-230 repeat the same statement four times), which seems to be an OCR artifact
