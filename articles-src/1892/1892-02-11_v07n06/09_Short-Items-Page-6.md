# Short Items.

IT is understood that the matter of the Sunday opening of the Metropolitan Museum, in this city, has not been finally settled. It is stated that the result of an eight months' experience at the museum has proved a success, and the public is interested in the subject as before. The same paper tries to explain the difficulty. The directors of the Museum authorized the Museum open on that day and the two following Sundays—but it has been asked to assume the entire charge of the expenses of the Museum on that day if thus I owe every day, but it has no power to do so. Robert, therefore, must be had to the Legislature, or the Sunday opening be stopped. This comes a case of the entire charges on the class of people who come them it is a very quiet thing to do to have and of the Museum done by them to the collections. Until the meeting of the Trustees in February, when the matter will be settled in one way or another, the Museum will continue open on Sundays.

IF P. Stoner writes from Russia, as quoted by the *Signs of the Times*: "There is a new Sunday feeling in this church, and six of them are in prison, and two are in exile.

This illustrates how much regard Russia has for persons in cases of religion."

Sunday evening performances at the theatre are something new, as the managers of the city against the Sunday night feature of the entertainment. The Christian Endeavor Society also published a vehement protest against it.

"Hours before the time came for opening the doors a crowd extending two blocks filled the street and."

still after the close of the regular services in the churches by that time it was impossible to get within 200 feet of the hall entrance.

It certainly seems a little strange that these popular and larger religious exertions by a majority of the people; a very of this part of the country, and a grand occasion, before an audience of between 4,000 and 5,000, which demanded more to come.

At the Des Moines Sabbath Union Convention it was noted that the report "Civil Sabbath," despite. The name acknowledgement was virtually stated at the Washington Convention of the National Reform Association held in December, 1890, where it was voted to drop the use of the term "Civil Sabbath." Under the present management of the National Reform movement, the Union campaigns throwing off the disguise of the older management are becoming more and more sinister, the preterly garb of the ecclesiastic.

"Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Ohio, that it shall be a misdemeanor for any street in the City of Chicago in the year of our Lord, 1893, to said and they are hereby suspended for keeping the gates of the Fair on the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday; said first day being a day of rest, of the law of God, the rights of man, and the proclaimed law of the Nation:

The bill has met with more than general disapproval, and is called by some of those papers a "blunder of legislation," and quoting from the first National Reform Convention in 1882, says: "The measure appears to reflect very little of the credit of the press." says. the bill as it passed is religious legislation pure and simple at the expense of Republican party. It will be said to the best interest of public morality and religion that at any time to give this Nation a United States Manning
