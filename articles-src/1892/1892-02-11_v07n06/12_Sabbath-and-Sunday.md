IN this country the words Sabbath and Sunday are frequently used as synonymous terms, both referring to one and the same day. It is well known, however, by almost every speaker and writer who uses these words interchangeably that whenever the word Sabbath is found in either the Old or the New Testament it never means the first day of the week, but always the last, when a specific day is meant. The writers of the New Testament show us that at the times when they wrote—some of them many years after the resurrection of Christ—the Sabbath preceded the first day. Matt. (28:1) says, "In the end of the Sabbath as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week." Luke says, "And they returned and prepared spices and ointments and rested the Sabbath day according to the commandment. But on the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came to the sepulchre bringing the spices which they had prepared." Luke 23:56; 24:1.

The application of the word Sabbath to the first day of the week is of comparatively recent date. No writer can be found in any language previous to the sixteenth century who so uses the word, and but few can be found at the present time, in any language but the English, who so use it.

The official records of the Parliament of Great Britain when reporting the transaction of business done on the seventh day of the week, have ever, until the year 1865, used the words dies Sabbath, the Sabbath day, to express the date of the transaction; and the House of Lords still continues the use of the same words. When the highest authority in the British Government makes the word Sabbath applicable only to the seventh day of the week, and when the word of God uses it only in this sense, there seems to be something wrong and very ambiguous and even contradictory when the word Sabbath is used to mean Sunday as is so often done by certain speakers and writers of our times.

If we study any of the languages of Southern Europe, or Western Asia, we shall find, even at the present day as well as in the past, that the word Sabbath, or its cognate in those languages, means only the seventh, or last day of the week, and never the first day. If we take any dictionary printed in France, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Greece, Turkey, Arabia, Mexico, South America, and many other countries, we find that they invariably give, as the first definition of the equivalent of our word Sabbath, "The seventh or last day of the week."

The foreigners who come to us from these countries deem it very strange indeed to hear the word Sabbath used for the first day of the week, when with them it always means the seventh day. Members of the Roman Catholic Church, who have ever claimed that Sunday was but a festival established by the church, like dozens of other festival days, refrain from calling Sunday the Sabbath, because they have always claimed that the Sabbath was only a Jewish institution, and should not be observed by Christians.

There are also many thousands of people in our country who observe the seventh day of the week as the Sabbath, and in accordance with Bible language and the usage of all former historians, as well as many of those people who speak a foreign language, always call this day the Sabbath, and much confusion must exist when both the seventh and the first days of the week are called by this name.

When the older writers speak of people of other countries observing the Sabbath, it is very difficult for some to understand which day of the week is meant, and most people little think that those spoken of observe the seventh day; and many instances of misrepresentations have occurred by translating such words by Sunday or Lord's day. So long as the word Sunday, or its cognate in other languages, has been in use, so long has it meant only the first day of the week. So long as the word Sabbath, or its cognate, has been used, it has ever meant the seventh day of the week, except during the last three hundred years, when used by some English speaking people to mean the first day. It is a great mistake, and a great wrong, to so confound the meaning of the Sabbath. When the word of God always uses the word Sabbath to mean the seventh day of the week, it is not only a wrong but a great sin, to teach children or adults that it means Sunday. It is robbing God of that which belongs to him. "My holy day," are his oft-repeated words, and these are never used by him to mean Sunday.—C. D. Potter, M. D., in Sabbath Outlook.
