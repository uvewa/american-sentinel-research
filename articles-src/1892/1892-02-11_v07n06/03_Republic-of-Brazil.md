The Republic of Brazil, continues, it is stated, in its policy of withdrawing support from the priests of the Roman Catholic Church. When a priest dies or vacates his pastorate, his successor can not succeed to his benefit from the State treasury, but must depend entirely upon the support of the members of his congregation, the same as all Protestant churches are supported. "The Church" protested at first, but was told that any attempt at retaliation would result in the entire withdrawal of State aid at once and forever. The priests seem now to have accepted the situation, and Brazil has practically no Church question to trouble her.
