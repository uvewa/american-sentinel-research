THE Newark Methodist Ministers' Society met in St. Paul's Methodist Episcopal Church, Newark, N. J., Monday, January 4, and listened to an address from Colonel Wishart, the detective employed by the Newark Law and Order League to aid in the enforcement of the Jersey Sunday laws, on the subject, "The Law and Order League the Ally of the Church." It has long been seen that the Law and Order League was fitting itself to be the willing and efficient swordsman, ready to use the blade of the law at the behest of the Church, but the fact has not been publicly acknowledged before.
