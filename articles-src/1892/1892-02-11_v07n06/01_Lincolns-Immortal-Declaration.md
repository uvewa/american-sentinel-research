LINCOLN'S immortal declaration expresses the American idea of government, "A government of the people, by the people, and for the people." That is, the people compose the government. It is a government in which the people act. In this government the people govern themselves. They do this by their own authority, by their own will, by their own power of government exerted upon themselves by themselves; and they do it for themselves, for their own good.
