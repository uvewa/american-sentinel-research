# "Where Lies the Difficulty?"

REV. J. P. Mills, the Chicago Secretary of the American Sabbath Schools, writing to the *Christian Statesman* under date of January 12, in the matter of petitions complains of neglect made by Rev. W. F. Crafts in the matter of petitions against the opening of the World's Fair on Sunday. He insists that the small number of petitions sent in was not due to his neglect in the matter of mailing necessary papers, before a certain date. Mr. Mills' defense of his explanation seems to us valid, and his is a well-taken point. A single instance of "failure to petition must be traced, therefore to some other cause. Mr. Crafts says in a recent article that the society of the societies he has organized have not petitioned; he says, "not more than one-fourth." To my certain knowledge not one in twenty-five of them sent in their petitions; not more than ten cases, though he wrote and stated me that four per year should reach him.

Mr. Bradnack's recent letter in the *Statesman* also indicates that there has been mismanagement somewhere in this. Where lies the difficulty?

This failure is perfectly natural. People generally, even religious people, have but little regard for Sunday, nor for faith enough in any effort of that may be made to close the exhibition, nor a sufficiently strong faith in the exhibition on a sufficiently strong feeling about the petition. People believe what they have been taught, that "there is no Sabbath under the gospel," and "Sunday they need not regard as Sunday as sacred"—*Sabbath Recorder.*
