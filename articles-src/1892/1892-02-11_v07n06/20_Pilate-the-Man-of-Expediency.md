IN Washington, D. C., Sunday evening, January 31, Rev. Dr. Corey, of the Metroropolitan Methodist Episcopal Church, preached a sermon on "Pilate the Man of Expediency," in the course of which he is reported by the *Post* to have said:—

How many are willing to commit sins against nature, sins that touch the very marrow of right or wrong, while they are more scrupulous in regard to things which are forbidden by the laws of society, but which have no moral character? How many will indulge in iniquitous selfishness, but will not shave on Sunday; will allow themselves to be governed by the fiercest avarice, but will not ride to church on Sunday?

Whether this was so intended or not, it is a confession that Sunday shaving, travel, etc., is forbidden only by "the laws of society." It would be interesting to know whether or not the Doctor thinks that such laws are justifiable from the standpoint of civil justice.
