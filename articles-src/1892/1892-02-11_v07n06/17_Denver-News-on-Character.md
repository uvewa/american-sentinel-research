THE Denver News very pertinently says: "The man who is made honest in business, pure in his social relations and faithful in his friendships only by an act of Congress is unworthy of consideration. Law is only useful to restrain the lawless tendencies in our natures. It can never become an active agent in the actual creation of character."
