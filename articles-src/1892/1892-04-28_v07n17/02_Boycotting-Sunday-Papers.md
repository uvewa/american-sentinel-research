THE Christian Statesman is in favor of boycotting all papers publishing Sunday editions. Why does it not boycott railroads running Sunday trains? It not only fails to do this, but it actually advertises Sunday trains. Possibly there is money, or at least, transportation, in it. Would the Statesman advertise Sunday papers on the same terms?
