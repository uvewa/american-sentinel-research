REV. DR. PARKHURST, pastor of the Madison Square Presbyterian Church, in this city, has gained an unenviable notoriety, recently, by certain sensational methods which he has adopted "for the suppression of vice."

—o—

DR. PARKHURST is President of the Society for the Suppression of Crime, and doubtless acted in good faith in all that he did, using the best judgment that he had as to methods. He was, however, certainly unfortunate in his choice of methods, and has probably succeeded in doing more harm than good.

—o—

It is very doubtful if a minister of the gospel has any duty in the direction of personally undertaking the enforcement of the civil law. His sole work should be that of ambassador and teacher. For that work he has a commission, and the divine promise of Christ's spiritual presence; but when the minister of the gospel becomes a detective and enters dens of vice, and drinks beer with lewd women, he not only does that for which he has no commission, but he goes where he has no promise of Christ's presence and blessing. To say the least that can be said, and say anything, Dr. Parkhurst committed a fearful blunder in going where he did and as he did. Thousands of young men will take license from this minister's example and become acquainted with depths of vice, of which, otherwise, they might never have known, even by the hearing of the ear.

—o—

THERE are in this city thousands of depraved women, and still more thousands of evil men. Many of the women are in a sense driven to the life they lead. If Dr. Parkhurst and his wealthy congregation want to suppress vice they can do it no more effectively than by undertaking patient and systematic missionary work among the fallen of both sexes. Had Dr. Parkhurst gone where he did, not as a detective to obtain evidence to secure conviction in the civil courts, but as a minister of Christ, gone to labor, even as the Master did, for the fallen, gone in proper company, conducting himself properly, he might have accomplished some good, but as it is nothing but evil can come of it.
