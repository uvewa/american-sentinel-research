# The Sunday Propaganda in Allegheny.

THE public schools of Pennsylvania are being utilized in the South-side Sunday propaganda, under the auspices of the Law and Order League. "This question is in this movement," says the *Pittsburg Leader*, "is the principal of the Fifth Ward school, Allegheny. The *Leader* tells the following story:—

Recently the principal in question, John L. Smith, happened to notice a boy on the street selling newspapers, and wanted to search a premium from the office. He thereupon proceeded to ferret out the boys in the school who are selling Sunday papers, and report them to Mr. John L. Smith. On receiving the kind of indignation on the part of the parents in the Fourth Ward school. Mr. Smith has refused actual scholars for refusing to comply with his edict, as well as for refusing to give the names of their customers. Many of the patrons regard such an arbitrary step in the enforcement of his personal views, been going through the several classes and asking the boys what papers they sold. He had found to make the promise and was practically forced to do so, before being allowed to resume his seat. Every effort has been made to stir up considerable indignation on the part of the parents, and now the matter promises to rival the Allegheny Bible question, which created so much to those ships in the matter. Several of the parents of children attending the Fourth Ward school emphatically that "learned from Mrs. Maggie McConnell, of No. 69 South Canal street, Allegheny, that Principal Smith on Friday last suspended her children, two boys and a girl, attending the school, for not having obtained the required promise to discontinue selling newspapers on the Sabbath day and the Sunday papers. Mrs. McConnell, in her statement, said:

'Last week my boys came home from school and told me Mr. Smith wanted to know all about the papers they sold on Sunday. They did not want to tell the principal for us that for what they sold on Sundays, what papers they sold, and to whom they sold them. When I inquired of them for what was none of the principal's business what they did on Sunday, they refused to answer Mr. Smith. Later this week, going, as I am informed by my boys, through the several classes and asking the boys what papers they sold on Sundays, Mr. Smith asked my boy for several days lecturing the scholars about selling Sunday papers. Those who had promised their children to sell on Sunday were not deemed Christian, or else submit to having them not educated at all. The principal went to an extent that the scholars who do sell papers are afraid that the principal is watching them when not selling papers at all. While he has not suspended our boys, I understand that two boys have been suspended for not promising to stop selling papers on Sunday.'

The reporter then said that Mrs. Cook, the mother of one of the boys who was suspended, was in question who is attending the school. She was asked what she knew in the matter. The mother of one of the boys who was suspended, questioning the occurrence of the suspension of her boy from the school, said: 'The teacher told me that Mr. Smith, the principal, had delivered his lectures against the selling of Sunday papers and had tried to get from them the names of their customers and them in promise to that they would stop. My boy refused to give the information required by Mr. Smith to call and see him after school. The next morning as the boy was on his way to school he was stopped by Mr. Smith, who took him into the school in the morning to tell Mr. Smith he had not any Sunday papers to sell that day. The boy was brought home again with a note from the principal. My son went to school in the morning, and Mr. Smith told him that if he did not bring the required promise he would be sent home. The result was he brought a note from the principal saying that he was suspended.'

I went with my boy to Mr. Smith the next day. I waited at Mr. Smith's door and waited there until the noon hour, when Mr. Smith came out. My boy was present. I told Mr. Smith that my boy had been suspended, he told me to was afraid to tell Mr. Smith he had been selling papers. He said it was not the papers only he was after, it was the Sunday newspapers that he was looking after. I told him such interference was outside the jurisdiction of the school master, and that I did not propose having my boy hounded in the fashion stated. Mr. Smith finally gave him a note to his teacher, and he was allowed to resume his studies.'

I understand Mr. Smith still continues his tirade against the sale of Sunday papers in his school.

The reporter then wended his way to the school, and after waiting for a considerable time, was received by Mr. Smith, who acknowledged that the school had an interest in the matter, but declined to make known what paper the article represented. He declined to be interviewed, and said: 'I have nothing to say on the subject of selling Sunday papers.' The circumstance occurred this way, he said, 'a contest to obtain a certain premium, offered by a newspaper, for the scholars to do. It was this purely a business educational idea. A parent of one of the scholars became indignant that his boy should earn or enjoy a profit of three-fifths of a cent on each copy and came to me to give a general order against the selling of Sunday papers. The remedy which I used on the first of Sunday papers was to ask the scholars if they sold papers, how many sold Sunday papers.' That is the record and is official. It is the same position entirely in the eye of the law of this land and the laws of the State of Pennsylvania, on the subject of selling Sunday papers, and asked those engaged in selling papers to give it up.'

Well, did you not condemn this abominable interference with Sunday selling by announcing that those who sold Sunday papers would be punished?

'I did, and strange to say in the matter is that there are not over ten boys in the entire school who sell Sunday papers.'

Have there been any suspensions?

'I am not aware that there are. I am corresponding on the subject, and there is so much curiosity in introducing such questions to the school room that it is ridiculous.'

Sunday laws, we are told, are purely civil. It is thought that the civil end is all that is needed in the recognition and enforcement of this particular institution. The Sunday propaganda going on in Allegheny is very significant of the position and purpose of its promoters. The State can of course teach its own children anything it chooses. But to teach that it may soon come to this, that Jews, Adventists, and all dissenters from the majority may be compelled either to submit their children to state religion in whatever school the State may direct, exclusive, or else submit to having them not educated at all.
