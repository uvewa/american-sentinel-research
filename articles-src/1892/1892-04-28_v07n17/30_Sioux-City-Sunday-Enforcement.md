SIOUX CITY, Iowa, has a Sunday Enforcement League, which is doing remarkable service in the Sabbath Union cause. Not even under the personal supervision of Mr. Crafts himself, in Pittsburg, is as zealous and effective work done for the protection and preservation of Sunday by law—that is, if the enforcement of Sunday laws will do that. This new Sunday League has closed all places of business, and even some restaurants; has stopped all street-car traffic, and does not allow suburban trains to run. Wholesale arrests are made of all who attempt to run street cars or carry on any secular business on Sunday. The League asserts that it will compel the stoppage of all labor and business on Sunday in Sioux City. There is said to be much excitement and trouble is feared. The penalty for Sunday labor in Iowa is five dollars fine and imprisonment until it is paid. This League, which is doing a work that must be the envy of Mr. Crafts, is not however directly of his organizing; it is composed of saloon men driven out of business by the prohibitory law. They declare they "will enforce all laws alike and give people a taste of real enforcement." If in doing this Satan is divided against himself, this is a very unwise move on his part. But is he?
