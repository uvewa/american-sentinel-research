## THE "MEDICAL MISSIONARY."

This little monthly ought to be in the hands of every person interested in missionary work at home or abroad. The Medical Missionary is the organ of the International Health and Temperance Association, and every month contains articles of live interest which do not appear in any other publication. Each number is illustrated.

The subscription price is 25 cents a year; the sum barely covers cost of paper and printing. The subscription price may be sent in postage stamps, postal note, or postal order, as is most convenient.

Address, GOOD HEALTH PUB. CO.,
