THE Lutherans of Illinois are agitating for the repeal of the compulsory school law of that State. At a recent meeting held in Chicago, Rev. August Schueseler said:—

We are assembled here to again inaugurate a political movement. The so-called "school question" was not settled at the last session of the Legislature. The obnoxious compulsory education law, you can well say, has been a dead letter. Only two cases of prosecution of Lutherans, under the law, have occurred since the last campaign, and the men who acted in those cases were forced to stop their work, not through the exertions of the school committee of the Lutheran Church, but by party action. The party lash was used and this party lash made the law a dead letter. But the obnoxious law still remains intact, and it can again be used to harass a large class of true and loyal citizens of the State whenever party policy ceases to interfere.

We Lutherans would most assuredly deceive a great many good people if we were to rest now and be satisfied with our political action because the law has been a dead letter since our last campaign. Therefore, we must again enter the political arena. There are different motives for setting political movements on foot. We have only one motive. I repeat it with emphasis, only one motive have we Lutherans for organizing our large forces; and the motive is not a mercenary one. We again inaugurate a political movement in order to rid the statute book of Illinois of that law which is working to the detriment of our free Christian houses, free Christian schools, and free Christian churches. We Lutherans will not be quieted down or doubt from political agitation until the law is repealed. We deplore this unfortunate political struggle. Prior to 1889 no political meetings were held in our school-houses. The Lutherans as individuals took active part in politics, but the church never. We, in our congregational or business meetings, never meddled with political questions. When, however, our religious liberties and private rights are endangered by a law, then we must make exceptions to our usages and take a lively part in politics.

Thus it is that religious questions, and questions of religious rights—questions affecting the individual conscience—are more and more finding their way into politics in this country.
