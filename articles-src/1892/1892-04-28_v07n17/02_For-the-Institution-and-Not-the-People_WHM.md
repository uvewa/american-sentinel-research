# For the Institution and Not the People.

THAT the demand for the Sunday closing of the World's Fair is the demand for Sunday closing and Sunday legislation in general, springs from a determination to perpetuate a religious institution and enforce it upon the people "quietly or otherwise," the following from leaflet No. 7 of the Sabbath Observance Department, of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union:—

That the Sabbath might be protected and honored, and not desecrated, the following resolution was adopted:

It is for the protection and honoring of the Sabbath—not of the people; the demand that protection be given is made, and not for the people.

Likewise the first topic suggested by the same for prayer and praise during the week (April 4-10) by the same organization is: "For the Sabbath."

In the past the Lord has usually poured out his Spirit upon the people rather than upon ordinances; but in this case it seems that it is the "divine ordinance," especially the "Christian Sabbath," that needs the blessing. There is one day in the week that is the Lord's, but the Bible plainly says that that was Saturday, the seventh day, and Sunday laws expect to reveal the first day, and hold for the Lord a post so long held upon that and those that also. See?

W. H. M.
