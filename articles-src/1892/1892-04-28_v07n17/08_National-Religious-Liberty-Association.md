# National Religious Liberty Association.

DECLARATION OF PRINCIPLES.

We believe in the religion of the Bible; and in the right of every man to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience, or not to worship, without interference or molestation from any human authority or power whatsoever; and in the civil and political equality of all citizens without regard to their religious belief.

-----

A. F. BALLENGER, . . . . . . . . . . . PRESIDENT.

The law of the State of New York has been amended to permit fishing on Sunday in Jamestown.

-----

It is stated that a merchant of Frankfort, the county seat of a Kansas county entirely without a saloon, was recently arrested and fined for displaying an advertisement with a quotation from Scripture.

-----

A PROHIBITION was passed in the Lower House of the Legislature of Massachusetts favoring the closing of the World's Fair on Sunday, but the Senate has refused to concur.

-----

SAM SMALL demands that the World's Fair be closed on Sunday, and Incoherently predicts that it will wind up in bankruptcy. The *Colorado Graphic* thinks, that he ought to know that when prayer and two results are not favorably allied.

-----

That National Methodist Protestant Conference, recently in session, adopted unanimous resolutions against the opening of the World's Fair on Sunday, and against the failure of Congress to enact Sunday laws for the District of Columbia.

-----

IOWA Legislators struck out the Sunday closing proviso from its World's Fair appropriation bill. The *Christian Statesman* attributes this action to the influence of Adventists! What does it attribute it to a revival of common sense.

-----

THE New York Legislature has passed a bill appropriating several thousand dollars a year to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, in order that it may open to the public free to regulate each Sunday and to give the citizens time to visit the Museum on working days.

-----

IT seems that the Young People's Society of Christian Endeavor is an anti-secret association, the duty of which is to promote the cause of Christianity and civic righteousness, has very wisely decided that to attempt to interfere with the World's Fair Exposition on either civil, or religious ground would not be justifiable, therefore, be directed to petitioning against it.

-----

THIS statement of the number of petitions received by the World's Fair Commissioners asking that the Fair be closed on Sundays is as follows in detail: 2, California; 21, Delaware; 3, District of Columbia; 1, Georgia; 7, Indiana; 155, Kansas; 8, Maine;

1, Maryland; 13, Michigan; 68, Mississippi; 12, Missouri; 1, Montana; 9, Nebraska; 3, New Hampshire; 3, New Jersey; 2, New York; Columbus, 14, Florida; 51, Illinois; 198, Iowa; 257, Kansas; 97, Maine; 48, Michigan; 12, Minnesota; 4, Missouri; 51, Nebraska; 3, New Jersey; 130, New Mexico; 3, North Carolina; 8, North Dakota; 9, Oregon; 20, Pennsylvania; 480, Rhode Island; 3, South Dakota; 47, Texas; 5, Utah; 44, West Virginia; 7, Wyoming; 5, New York.

All, whatever it represents, these petitions have not borne much responsibility in that most of them are responses to circulars. But the significant thing about them is there are so few of those that are of political bodies, which, although they will make a very great outcry over the matter, they represent very few separate signitures. The number of some may be found elsewhere in this issue.

-----

THE Czar of Russia has issued an ukase prohibiting foreigners from editing in his dominions, and also the buying or selling of Williamson tracts, and real estate within those limits, without first the financial religion of the orthodox Church. Such action as this has led the State Department at Washington to take up the whole question as to the status of American citizens who may be naturalized Jews in the United States.

-----

THE news of the city of Washington have issued a circular asking that the churches support them is a demand for the stopping of street cars on a Sunday. In response to this Dr. A. W. Pitzer, of the Central Presbyterian Church, preached on a Sunday evening service, at which the ex-men were present. He says "as a question in which every one had a part." Dr. Pitzer preached a very earnest sermon on "Sunday rest for every man," and at church it did not appear why the ex-men could rest one if they wanted to without the aid of Dr. Pitzer, the Church, or any one else, still some of them seemed exceedingly grateful with what was said. The different motives and forces are legion which would be interesting to the student of government as well as for their enactment and enforcement.

-----

LEWIS LEIGH, who is doing remarkable service in the persecution of Seventh-day observers, secured the suspension of Mr. Curtis himself, in Pittsburg, from the sale of a newspaper on Sunday, and fined him three dollars. It is useless to say that if the enforcement of Sunday laws will do that. The crusade against the sale of Sunday papers is a war of the capitalist against the poor; it will not stop all street-car traffic; and does not allow suburban trains to carry people to the country on this day; while an attempt to run street cars or carry on any regular suburban business on Sunday would meet with the same sort of opposition as Lewis Leigh's business on Sunday in Steel City. There is said to be a State law against street cars on Sunday, which has been held up to this, and which even the laws cannot overrule imprisonment until its paid. This League, which is doing most of its work in Allegheny County. Mr. Curtis, is not however directly of his organization but certain persons were zealous for Sunday, its agents, have assurance that they "will enforce all laws alike and give people a taste of good government." The whole thing is a most one-sided attempt and is a very unwise step. But it is law!

THAT Lutherans of Illinois are agitating for the right to have their parochial school teaching done in German was brought out as a prominent topic at a recent meeting held in Chicago, Rev. August Engward, presiding.

We are assembled here to again inaugurate a movement looking to the welfare of the youth of our Church. To do this we must make use of the parochial school. The State legislature can not establish a compulsory education law, yet can place restrictions on us of any kind. In the matter of prosecutions of Lutherans, under the law, have an entirely different case from that of the Catholics, against whose schools the main issue was directed, not through the exercises of the school committees or the Catholics. With us the principle is the thing. We go to our public school the same as to her a dead letter. But the obnoxious law still remained on the statute books, a menace to a very large class of true and loyal citizens of the State and citizens of the Government and country. And now we must organize our forces so as to grant many good people if we were to rest now and leave the question in its present shape. A question that still demands our attention is the question of the use of a foreign language in our schools. Therefore, we must again enter the political arena. There are 700 Lutheran congregations in this State, and they can be a powerful army to place in such movements on foot. We have only one resolve: only one desire: to maintain and control our schools in accordance with the dictates of our conscience. In saying this we make the exercise is not a momentary one. We again inaugurate a work and we announce that "the dearest interests of our free Christian homes, free Christian churches and free Christian schools" are attacked. The Lutherans will not be pushed down or stayed, political agitation if the law is repealed. From this point of view of the facts and figures. Up to 1890 no political meetings were held in our churches, and whatever political meetings have been held since, except in two instances, have been in our congregational or business meetings, never in our churches. The whole thing is an unjust aspersion. In order to maintain our schools we must be surprised by a law; then we must make exceptions and make up for these, the various disadvantages that is in that religious questions, and questions of religion rights—questions affecting the individual conscience—are more and more finding their way into politics in this country.
