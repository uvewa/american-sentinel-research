It seems that the Young People's Society of Christian Endeavor has appointed an international committee, the duty of which is to promote the Sunday closing of the World's Fair. The committee has very wisely decided that to attempt to boycott would be injudicious; the efforts of the society will, therefore, be directed to petitioning and the issuing of manifestos.
