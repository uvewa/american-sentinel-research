The public schools of Pennsylvania are being utilized in the Sunday-Sabbath propaganda, under the auspices of the Law and Order League. "The pioneer in this movement," says the Pittsburg Leader, "is the principal of the Fifth Ward school, Allegheny. The Leader tells the whole story thus:—

Recently the principal in question, John L. Smith, took occasion during a late examination to lecture against the wickedness of selling Sunday newspapers, and wanted to exact a promise from the scholars engaged in the business that they would discontinue it. There are some fifty boys in the school who are selling Sunday papers, and to say that the action of the principal has raised a howl of indignation on the part of the parents, is expressing it mildly. The story as it reached the Leader was that the principal had suspended several scholars for refusing to comply with his request. An investigation of the matter developed the fact that while the principal had not taken such an arbitrary step in the enforcement of his unreasonable order, he has, according to his own admission, been going through the several classrooms of the school and exacting promises from the scholars to give up the business. One boy refused to make the promise and was practically suspended, until his mother interfered, and had her son restored to his studies. The matter has stirred up considerable indignation on the part of the parents and taxpayers in general, who propose to take steps in the matter. Several of the parents of the boys attending the school were seen in reference to the matter, but the story told by all was substantially that learned from Mrs. Maggie McCarroll, of Grant Alley. Her husband is a conductor on the Fort Wayne road. They have three children, two boys and a girl, attending the school. The boys, Solomon, aged thirteen years, and Andrew, aged ten years, each have a newspaper route and sell the Sunday papers. Mrs. McCarroll, in relating the circumstance, said:

"Last week my boys came home from school and told their father that the principal of the school had wanted them to stop selling papers. We told the boys to tell the principal for us that for what they did out of school we were responsible, and that as long as their father allowed them to sell papers, it was none of the principal's business what they did out of school hours. The principal has kept up this work, going, as I am informed by my boys, from the fifth grade to the highest, trying to exact this promise. He has devoted a certain time each day for several days lecturing the scholars about the wickedness of selling on Sunday. He has gone even so far as to say that parents who would allow their children to sell on Sunday were not decent. This matter has been kept up by Mr. Smith to such an extent that the scholars who do sell papers are made to feel very uncomfortable, and certainly something should be done to have a stop put to it. While he has not suspended our boys, I understand he did suspend Mrs. Conklin's son for refusing to make the promise."

The reporter then called on Mrs. Conklin. She has one son, Samuel, sixteen years of age, the boy in question who is attending the school. She was averse to saying anything on the matter, but finally substantiated Mrs. McCarroll's statement. In explaining the occurrence of the suspension of her son, she said: "While the boy was not suspended, it was practically the same thing. After Mr. Smith had delivered his lecture against the selling of papers on Sunday, he asked the boys who were selling them to hold up their hands. He then asked them to promise that they would stop it. My boy refused to make the promise, and he was informed by Mr. Smith to call and see him after school. The boy didn't do it, but came home and reported the occurrence to me; I told him when he went to school in the morning to tell Mr. Smith he had our permission to sell, and that we did not consider it the business of the principal to interfere in the matter. My son went to school in the morning, but was refused admission to his class by the teacher until he brought a note from the principal, she claiming that that was her orders from the principal. He then went to the hall outside Mr. Smith's door and waited there until the noon hour, when he came home without reporting to Mr. Smith. When I asked why he didn't do as I told him, he told me he was afraid to tell Mr. Smith that. I then went myself with the boy to the school and saw Mr. Smith. He commenced by lecturing me regarding allowing my son to break the Sabbath, when I cut the matter short and told him such interference was outside the jurisdiction of a public school teacher, and demanded that my son be allowed to go to his class without any such promise. Mr. Smith finally gave him a note to his teacher, and he has since attended the school. But I understand Mr. Smith still continues his tirade against the boys' selling Sunday papers."

The reporter then wended his way to the school. Mr. Smith was encountered at the doorway. When made acquainted with the reportorial visit he inquired what paper the scribe represented. He finally introduced himself. He stated that he had not suspended any scholars, nor did he intend to. "The circumstance occurred this wise," he said. "One day in grade six, I put a sum on the black board for the scholars to do. It was this purely accidental circumstance without any forethought of mine: A newstey has fifty customers, and receives a profit of three-fifths of a cent on each paper: what does he profit on this entire sale? A little girl put up her hand, and remarked: 'Does he sell Sunday papers?' The remark caused me to think it would be a good idea to speak against the sale of Sunday papers, and I did. I asked the scholars if it was wrong to sell papers on Sunday, and was answered by them all that it was. Both by the law of God and the laws of the State. I then lectured them against the willfulness of breaking a law of this kind and its consequences, and asked those engaged in selling papers to give it up."

"Well, did you not continue this admonition through the various classes, and continue it for several succeeding days?" was asked.

"Yes, I did, and strange to say in the entire school all those engaged in the business admitted they were doing wrong, and promised to quit it with but one exception."

"Do you not think you are overstepping your authority in introducing such questions in the school?"

"No, I do not. I feel that the public school, being an institution of the State, it is the duty of the teachers not only to instruct them in the rediments of an education, but to make the scholars law-abiding and honorable citizens. Where there is a State law regarding Sabbath observance, I consider it my duty to so instruct the scholars under my charge in the full observance of these laws."

Sunday laws, we are told, are purely civil. But it seems a little strange that civil law is made the occasion and justification for the giving of religious instruction in the public schools. This occurrence in Allegheny is very significant of the possibilities wrapped up in Sunday laws. The State can of course teach its own laws, and the reason for them; it follows that it may soon come to this, that Jews, Seventh-day Baptists, and Seventh-day Adventists may be compelled either to take their children out of the public schools, or else submit to having them taught that Sunday is the Sabbath.
