In the first century of the Christian era Christianity was able from a very small beginning to push its conquests against the prejudices of Judaism and Paganism into all the known world, gathering into its membership thousands of converts from the religious bodies of that day, and from the world, not by the aid of civil law—not by the sword and fagot—but opposed by them, and in spite of them. Christ had said to his followers: "They shall lay their hands on you, and persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues, and into prisons, being brought before kings and rulers for my name's sake. . . . And ye shall be betrayed both by parents and brethren, and kinsfolks and friends; and some of you shall they cause to be put to death."

In fulfillment of this prediction the apostles and early Christians were often imprisoned, suffered the loss of their property, and many of them of life itself.

The conflict of the ages has been between Christ and the devil; and although the Son of God declares, concerning his followers: "The devil shall cast some of you into prison," in no instance is it recorded that Christ ever did, or ever proposed to cast into prison by the agency of civil laws, or any other human agency, the followers of the devil, much less that his own professed followers should fine and imprison each other on account of differences in faith and practice.

No true religious usage needs any stronger support than the authority of God. When human civil law is framed to enforce religious tenets by civil penalties it is at once a confession of the weakness of the doctrine in the interests of which it is enacted, and an indication of its Satanic origin.

What dire change has come over the Christianity of the nineteenth century, rendering the methods of Christ and his apostles in carrying the gospel of so little effect, and making it expedient to appeal for aid to civil law that everywhere so used, has entiralled the followers of Christ? What, unless the Christian Church has fallen and corrupted her ways before God so that she is about to take the place of the Pharisees and Saducses who put Christ and the apostles to death, and the mother of harlots whose robes are stained with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus.

These modern would-be reformers are very zealous, thinking that they are doing noble service for the cause of God and humanity. So did Saul, the agent of the Pharisee sect, when, by the authority of the church clothed with civil law, he baled "men and women to prison," because they believed in Jesus. Christ was "despised and rejected of men;" his followers were accounted "as the filth of the world, and the offscouring of all things;" the sect of Christians was "everywhere spoken against;" and the apostles and brethren were accused as being men that had "turned the world upside down;" and yet they were the true people of God, although persecuted even unto death.

Modern popular religionists are falling into a like error, and it would be very unsafe to so frame civil law as to make it possible for them to punish dissenters in whose persons it may prove at last they have persecuted Jesus. If they have got the Bible and the Holy Spirit on their side as an everlasting help and defense they do not need the aid of civil law; but if they have not such a defense, for humanity's sake let not freemen entrust them with civil power.
