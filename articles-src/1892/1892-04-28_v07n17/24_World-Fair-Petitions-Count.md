THE statement of the number of petitions received by the World's Fair Commissioners asking that the gates be closed on Sundays is as follows: Alabama, 8; California, 22; Delaware, 3; District of Columbia, 9; Georgia, 7; Indiana, 184; Kansas, 59; Louisiana, 2; Maryland, 13; Michigan, 86; Mississippi, 8; Montana, 3; New Hampshire, 11; Arkansas, 10; Colorado, 14; Florida, 24; Illinois, 296; Iowa, 257; Kentucky, 23; Maine, 13; Massachusetts, 160; Minnesota, 47; Missouri, 56; Nebraska, 21; New Jersey, 169; New Mexico, 1; North Carolina, 8; North Dakota, 6; Oregon, 30; Pennsylvania, 440; Rhode Island, 7; South Dakota, 17; Texas, 8; Virginia, 14; West Virginia, 7; Wyoming, 3; New York, 244; Oklahoma, 1; Ohio, 221; South Carolina, 5; Tennessee, 21; Vermont, 13; Washington, 17; Wisconsin, 122; Miscellaneous, 17. The number of individual signatures has not been stated. The probability is that most of them are "representative" petitions of churches and other religious bodies, which, although they will make a very large count in the aggregate, show but comparatively few separate signatures. The number of separate petitions, as given, is 2,745.
