# Editorial Notes.

THE AMERICAN SENTINEL ought to have a large circulation in Pennsylvania for a year to come. The Sunday law of that State is now being discussed by everybody. "That's right," said the *Sentinel*, come to it, and find its way into thousands of homes in the Keystone State immediately.

-----

"CAPT. H. H. PRATT," says the *Culver, in Review*, "has not yet been dismissed from the Army, although the President must be aware of the unjustifiable and malicious attack that officer made on the Catholic Church." Very remarkable, is it not? Does the *Review* really think that Captain Pratt could be, or that he ought to be, dismissed for his reflections on the Catholic Church?

-----

*And* have *Expresses* occasionally contain a good thing, and here is one of them:—

The police represent the law; the ministers the gospel. They should prevent the criminal, the ministers should convert the criminal. We dare them about and make them go in the way that is convenient. That is the extent of religious government.

If Mr. Shepard and his fellows would only remember this, and act upon it, and let the police and the ministers each stay on his own side of the line: or, if one of them must do the other's work, let the officers of the law go into their sphere, the State would be no worse than it is now; it would be no more prevalent; but the Church would be every whence the gainer, and more and more souls would be converted to Christ. One trouble in these days is that the ministers are in a sense becoming policemen, and they want the police to, in their stead, take side in the ministry. The really desirable thing would be to have more and less for policemen, and for ministers who know the power of God to change the heart.

THE County remarks that "the demand for opening the World's Fair on Sunday is confined chiefly to a portion of the population of Chicago, and even there probably a minority. There is hardly a State in the Union where the great majority of the people do not favor the closing of the place on the day of rest." All this may be true, but it, like so many things happened, to say positively that it is so is something not really understood. The *American*, not to tell

any impatience, of those who demand Sunday closing is phenomenal. What right has even a majority, no matter how large, to say to the corporation organized under the laws of the State of Illinois, known as "The World's Exposition of Registers thereof and Society's men," to say they must close the Fair on Sunday? They have not the same right to dictate to the Fair corporation that they have to require individuals to observe Sunday, for that is just it over all.

-----

THE Board of Aldermen, of New York, adopted a resolution citing the city department to deal with any resident who disputes upon this fact—a Catholic paper says: "That action should become general, so that the day of redemption should not everywhere be marked by a cessation of business." The next thing then would be a law prohibiting labor or business on that day. And why not? There would be the same justification for it that there is for and Sunday restrictions.

-----

THE Christian *Statesman* complains that the Academy of Music, in Brooklyn, was recently rented to Colonel Ingersoll for a Sunday evening lecture, and said that "among those present in all him and the proprietors of the Academy in breaking the Sabbath, was Mayor Boody, said to be a Presbyterian, and District Attorney Reeves." THE SENTINEL has not the slightest sympathy with Ingersoll's views, but must it like to it all? freedom of speech also is to be sacrificed to the Sunday Movement.

-----

THAT recent Pittsburg Sunday Convention, adopted this among other resolutions:—

Resolved, That we denounce the publishing and sale of Sunday newspapers as an infraction of the law of this commandment, and that we urge our emphatic protest against the buying and reading of Sunday newspapers as a sin against God, and creative of the sacredness of the Sabbath, and an injury to the home and society and to that we are not to sell refuse to buy and read Sunday newspapers. If no one read them, no sensible person on any day of the pages that matter would be printed.

Why did they not go one step farther and beyond also every one who works beyond the Sunday paper? That is a next step, and not a long one either.

In his preface to his revised edition of "Captivity for Man," Rev. W. F. Crafts says:—

As Columbus and other explorers of his period were constrained to set up a cross in each new land they discovered, as anticipation of conquering it for some Christian kingdom, so every Lord's day has been set up in every land of our world so a monument of its undisputed occupancy for its divine Lord.

This is a perfect description of the way things would work, like the Sabbath offering, everywhere in the so-called Christian world, at the coming ship of Christ. Every week, for forty-eight hours, this free, costly, glitter, the Sabbath's day and

night, moves around our revolving world in token of its claim by its Lord. As one sun-kissed land after another sends a messenger every week to all his fellows to do him honor that he was a great discoverer and remind him that his lord would have him crowned in his country.

Controversy has led some of us who believe that the Lord's day is also the Christian Sabbath, to slight the former title, because some who use it alone repudiate the other. Both are true. "Lord of the Sabbath," and "separate the day from the creature. But to every Christian the Sabbath is in the more regarded from, the sign in which we are already enlisted.

All this gives the greater leader in the movement for the "civil Sabbath," "the Lord's Day," the "Christian Sabbath," the "Weekly Independence Day," and so on of nomenclature.

"One of the best corrections of will theology, both in actual strong-hold of believers," things, says the *Wolverine Citizen*, "is in a thorough searching of the theory. It will teach men that their theories are all astray, that history contradicts their theories and their dangerous assumptions." In the main this is true, but there are exceptions to it. There is nothing which history points so black as it does so-called National Reforms, and yet its votaries are unable to read its lesson aright. The history of Rome, both ancient and Papal, is but a repetition of what had before happened unto Israel; but he was being writing, of National Reformers, truth would have compelled him to testify that the blindness was total, and from a human standpoint, hopeless. The Lord will not stop their eyes, and correct their vision of their error. It may be that they have sinned beyond the day.

In a "romantic" which seems to be the Christian Temperance Unions have been sending to the Commissioners of the World's Columbian Exposition, praying that the gates of the Exposition be closed on Sundays, the following words occur: "And that it is how they know to religion." This shows that it is religion, Sunday or the Sabbath, even which they are concerned, and that they want the Commissioners to help drive people into religion by closing the gates of the World's Fair on the Sunday. And the Christian Temperance women pray also for a "civil Sabbath" plea and the great "to compel Sabbath observance to let the work of the workingman."

A BILL has been introduced in the Legislature of Kentucky to prohibit the playing of base-ball on Sunday.
