At the hearing, lately held before the House Committee on the World's Fair, this proviso was offered for insertion in the bill to further appropriate five millions of dollars to assist in defraying the expense of preparation for the World's Fair at Chicago:—

Provided, however, That no part of the sum appropriated by this section shall be paid until the corporation organized under the laws of the State of Illinois, known as "The World's Exposition of Eighteen Hundred and Ninety-two," and said World's Columbian Commission, shall stipulate in writing that the said Exposition shall not be opened to the public on Sundays.

It has been claimed by those who offer the proviso that it was drawn by Justice Strong, retired Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States; and Elliott F. Shepard said, in his printed brief, that Justice Strong had declared that "the proposed clause would not be obnoxious to the national Constitution;" and, as thus it was certain that it had passed under his supervision at least, the impression was conveyed that it had met with his approval. If this is so it is certainly probable that the superficial, legal requirements of the case will certainly be met in the clause and the statement of the legal status of the matter found in it will be accurate. It is well then to look at the proviso and find what that is. It is found in the unreserved acknowledgment of the full authority of the "Corporation organized under the laws of the State of Illinois" over the Exposition as a business and financial matter. This is further shown by the fact that the proviso requires that the corporation and its advisory commission shall stipulate in writing their compliance with a certain condition precedent. This in itself shows that in the mind of the writer of the clause Congress had no authority over the corporation to require compliance, otherwise it would not be necessary that the corporation should enter into any written contract binding itself to the performance of this particular act. It is acknowledged then by this proviso that the World's Fair is a business enterprise, the control of which is vested in a stock company under the laws of the State of Illinois. Nowhere in this clause nor in the bill itself does the United States assume to be a stockholder or business partner in this corporation. If it were possible for the Government to hold such a position as that it would become subject to the laws under which the corporation is organized and would have the voice in the management represented by its shares of stock and no more. But this money represents no stock; it represents no voice in the management; it is solely a governmental appropriation for aid, with certain provisions made for its possible repayment. And then the addition of a proviso is proposed which makes that repayment less probable, and reduces also the probability of the shareholders' making good their own investments. Is it then a business proposition? It certainly is not. The proviso acknowledges that Congress has no authority. Why then should it inject an unbusinesslike proposition into an appropriation, for the sake of throwing its influence, and the power of the money of the people toward the accomplishment of that which will render it unlikely that it will ever receive back the money of the people again? It is not a business proposition. Some other element enters into it. Is the sphere of that other element the Congress of the United States as a civil legislative body has no jurisdiction. It having been acknowledged in the wording of the proviso that the local management has full control of the affairs of the Exposition, this is an attempt to assume a business control by indirect means, outside of legislative authority, and use that control to compel a sacrifice on the part of shareholders and taxpayers to secure—what?—The observance of a religious tenet.

This proviso proposes that Congress, in passing it, shall indirectly legislate to close the World's Fair on Sunday. Is that a sound legal proposition? It is not. The regulation of Sunday closing, or Sunday selling, as the law stands, is a matter of the law of the place where the business is transacted. The United States does not own the World's Fair site, and it cannot, consequently exercise any municipal control over the World's Fair in general. The question of the special restrictions and regulations to be placed upon the exhibitors of this Exposition belongs solely with the local management, under the municipal and State laws of the city of Chicago and the State of Illinois. With the law of the place in this matter the Congress of the United States cannot tamper, to add to it, in any manner, or to undertake the enforcement of it in any degree. There is a State law upon this subject. To that is the sole recourse. There is the place to find whether the people of Illinois will uphold the State in enforcing that statute during the continuance of the World's Fair.

But here is a State law which is obsolete. This proviso offers a congressional bonus of five millions of dollars, conditioned on the resurrection and enforcement of that statute. Is it a proper thing for any congressional committee to enter into an inquiry as to whether a certain statute of any State is enforced, or to be enforced in the contingency of the holding of a World's Fair within its limits, and then recommend Congress to promise that State money if it will enforce that statute? Is it commensurate with the dignity of the World's Fair Committee of the House of Representatives to present such a proposition as that? Ought Congress to accept with equanimity a proposition that it bribe Illinois to enforce its own statutes? In what spirit ought Illinois to take such a suggestion? Such questions as those are pertinent. But if it is not a bribe is it a purchase? It would be a peculiar thing, certainly, for an economical Congress to expend five millions of dollars to buy the control of twenty-six Sundays in the city of Chicago, only in order to hold them entirely unproductive. That would surely be something entirely unique in the way of congressional appropriations.

As a business proposition solely this proposed proviso has no standing; as a purely legal and legislative proposition it is unsound. It is a religious proposition; and as such the Congress of the United States cannot enact it.
