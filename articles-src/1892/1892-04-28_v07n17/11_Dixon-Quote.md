It is a matter of comparatively small importance whether the World's Fair be open or closed on Sunday; that might well be left to the Commissioners to decide, but it is of paramount and vital importance that there should be no legislation at all upon such a subject—that the Constitution be not violated, oaths of office not broken, a dangerous precedent not established.—Mrs. Susan Bullitt Dixon.
