# Who Gave It His Best?

WHETHER a religion or a religious institution be true or false does not affect the propriety of legislation upon it on the part of civil government; for that is not in its destination, whether the religion it concerns be true or false, is a matter between its God and lawful domain of civil government. But the demand for such legislation very largely rests upon the claim that Sunday derives from the religious institution that the Bible has made it a day of rest, and in fact the demand for it is quite generally made on that ground. Inasmuch as it is shown, in consequence of an agitation upon the subject, that this claim is false, and usually to uphold the wrong and put down the right.

Thus, in connection with the efforts to secure the closing of the World's Fair on Sunday observance the question is raised as to who gave the day its best? Admitting that there is a difference of opinion and practice among believers in the Bible, all, whether Sabbatarians, Saturday, the seventh day, and others, this first day. Which is the true one, may be for the individual to decide for himself.

The Bible allows all people to seek this question, and its plain, unequivocal answer is that the seventh day is the Sabbath. If all were willing to abide the controversy would soon cease, for the Bible says, "He rested on the seventh day." But all are not ready to yield even to so plain a declaration as this—hence the varying methods of reasoning and interpretation resorted to in order to transfer the Sabbath observance to the first day of the week.—Which day shall we observe to-day the seventh day or the first? To settle this we must go to the Bible. In doing so, however, we must bear in mind that the whole Bible says, first, that God blessed, set apart, and "rested on the seventh day;" secondly, that all the "first day" texts simply say it was a day that came after the Sabbath. Not one of them even hints that the first day of the week was or is to be a Sabbath, or was anything but a common, ordinary secular day. In view of these plain facts and lack of facts, what becomes of the claim that the Bible authorizes "first day" observance? Though this text is submitted, "Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together" (Heb. 10:25), it does not say anything about any day; and it is a very long jump from that to first day sacredness, to say the least.

Those who say the Bible allows us to keep one day in seven, but no particular day, are hardly consistent in demanding that it shall be a particular day or are those who hold to a more firm and definite understanding of the commandment.

The determination of some who hold to this one-day-in-seven and no-day-in-particular theory, to cling to the "first day Sabbath" at all hazards whether they know it to be right or wrong, is well foreshadowed in the following from an editorial in the *Christian Statesman*, of Feb. 27, 1892:—

If there are still those who question whether the first day should be observed as a "Sabbath" or a "Lord's day," or only as a civil rest day, we say, let them settle that among themselves as best they can; but do not raise this as a question at issue in connection with the observance of the day, as has led to much contention. The Lord's day is a test of the first magnitude. Let this point be put at rest. Let all who honor the Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments unite.

A reader will at once notice how the editor of the *Statesman* seeks to evade a discussion of the Sabbath. He is conscious that in establishing himself behind an established custom, rather than in fortifying himself in the Word of God which he professes to preach to all others, it takes more than a line or two to tell what ought to do "Saturday-keepers," of which he is one. These are men who would not only like to have the burden of proof rests also enforced upon the observers of the seventh day. How he releases himself from the responsibility of proving anything is by asserting that "the Lord's day Sabbath" (by which he means Sunday) has the consensus of opinion of Christendom. He is partly in law with him on this question. But the fact that by the "Lord's day Sabbath" the editor of the *Statesman* means that the civil law shall protect what he calls the Sabbath by the majority of professed Christians and not upon a "thus saith the Lord" is the strong point; it is sufficient; for how much proof of the incorrectness of their position is given by the word of God, and how much proof of its truth also is given to those who are really willing to go to the test? If he who rests his Sabbath case here says to those who rest it also upon the word of God, on everything else, or be compelled to accept it? In other words, religious legislation, and enforce the word. In point of truth there is no escape from this alternative. American Indians, Catholics far outnumber Protestants in this country; a majority of the professed Christians generally practiced and dogmas received are those. For the thousand years during which the Papal Sunday Sabbath has been going on, and in every instance error has triumphed by the same method; yet we are sorry to say that so far as our national legislators are concerned, it will very successfully accomplish its standing it. Truth has always been on the side of the minority of its friends. In the time of Noah, both faith and history tell us that a majority, even an overwhelming majority, is no test of truth. The same thing could be found in Sodom and its surrounding plain. The drift of all truth has been from majority to destruction. And the fact that one denomination, more than another, asserts itself by asserting that it has established this particular contention, is now among the true proof that it is not the Sabbath of the Bible, or otherwise. And the fact that all the others in observance all are unwilling to rest is upon the Bible. Not upon its own merits, is still further evidence that it can not stand so. If it could do so as to interest the scholars and other students, it would stand upon its own merits.

Sunday laws, we are told, are purely civil. It is thought that the civil end is all that is needed in the recognition and enforcement of this particular institution. The Sunday propaganda going on in Allegheny is very significant of the position and purpose of its promoters. The State can of course teach its own children anything it chooses. But to teach that it may soon come to this, that Jews, Adventists, and all dissenters from the majority, may be compelled either to submit their children to state religion in whatever school the State may direct, exclusive, or else submit to having them not educated at all.
