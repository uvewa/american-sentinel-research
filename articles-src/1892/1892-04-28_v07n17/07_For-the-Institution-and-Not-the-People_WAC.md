THAT the demand for the Sunday closing of the World's Fair, like the demand for Sunday closing and Sunday legislation in general, springs from a determination to perpetuate a religious institution and enforce it upon the people "gently or otherwise," the following from leaflet No. 42 of the Sabbath Observance Department of the Women's Christian Temperance Union clearly shows:—

That the Sabbath might be protected and honored, it was unanimously decided that we must stand as a unit for closed gates.

It is for the protection and honoring of "the Sabbath," then, the demand for closed gates is made, and not for the protection and security of the people.

Likewise the first topic suggested by the World's Sabbath Observance Union for prayers and praise during the week (April 5-12) last appointed, as a "week of prayer for the Sabbath," was,—

A large outpouring of the Holy Spirit on divine ordinances, especially on the Lord's day.

In the past the Lord has usually poured out his Spirit upon the people rather than upon ordinances; but in this case it seems that it is the "divine ordinances," especially Sunday, that seem to be in need of a blessing. There is one day in the week which the sacred word says God blessed, but that was Saturday, the seventh day, and not Sunday. The advocates of Sunday laws expect to corral the first day, and hold it for the Lord to pour out his Spirit upon that and bless that also. From the earliest days of the worshipers of the sun down to the mingling of heathen ordinances with Christian rites and ceremonies, and even until now it seems to have gone without a blessing. Without a divine command for its observance or a divine blessing for its sanctification, why should it be thought strange that those who still persist in observing it should demand law for its protection, and still be praying for a "large outpouring of the Holy Spirit upon it?" But for all this it is the people and not the institution that need the Holy Spirit. If they had sufficient of this, divine ordinances (those set apart by God) would not suffer, for "when he, the Spirit of truth is come," said Christ, "he will guide you into all truth."
