# Shall Congress Adopt This Proviso?

IN the last existing leaflet being sent forth, this proviso was offered for insertion in the Appropriation Bill, for expending its millions of dollars to assist in defraying the cost of the World's Columbian Exposition, or World's Fair at Chicago:—

> *Provided*, That as part of the sum appropriated by this section shall be paid until in evidence that the Exposition will not be opened on Sundays; that the Government exhibit shall not be on view to the public, or any building, exhibit, machinery, or operation on the grounds of the Exposition open to the public on Sundays. Nor shall the Exposition be opened to the public on Sundays during the six months it is to be open.

It has been claimed by those who favor this proviso that it was but in accord with the true national sentiment, and that its adoption would be authorized by the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States, and Elliott F. Shepard and the National Reform Association and Justice Strong had declared that "this is a Christian Nation," and that "Christianity is a part of the law of the land" and part of our national Constitution;" and, as such, the observance of Sunday, having received its authorization by the decision of Congress, can be enforced under her supervision at last, the importance to the public would be fully apparent. If this is so it is evidently a question which the proper tribunals of the country will have to decide; and it is to be hoped the merits of the case will certainly be not in the claim that enough people said that they wanted to close the gates on Sundays, to decide the status of this matter whether it is civil or religious. But this is certain, it will not assume the acknowledged status of a civil institution, nor be a religious one. It should then be settled by the inherent acknowledged right of every citizen of this country, and particularly by every citizen of this State of Chicago, who were subject to its political and financial master. This is further assured by the fact that the corporation receiving the appropriation and its advisory committee, with a certain very special condition to comply with a decision of the House Committee. In this connection the mind of the writer of the clause Congress had no authority nor any right to claim of it should exercise, otherwise it would be necessary that the corporate should receive the necessary treatment due to itself to the performance of this particular act of this corporate body. The one proviso that the World's Fair is a business and not the sacred precinct of religion, is a stock company under the laws of the State of Illinois. Neither its corporation

More remarkable still, one of these laws prescribed the death penalty for labor on Sunday. The reasons given were: "We are more apt to find the truths of God in His commandments than to the church;" and because the infidels "thereby proved to give believers and devotion of Christians." They also said, "if New and Egypt Christians be in fact compelled to attend these games on Sunday?" All of course no one was compelled to go to the games; this referred entirely to those who kept Sunday. Now if they say the workers of the Fair or the managers of the Fair will be for the keepers of the churches of the Fair, it is identical with the argument used by the early Fathers. Can any Congress force any person to work on Sunday if the Fair is open?

Soon after this, they got laws enforcing the first day of the week.—Neander's *Church History*, at last, as all the Sabbath question is, the State can not at this time pass any reason why if they offer not even a civil ground on which to rest, Congress should not proceed to the enforcement of legislation?

The object for which the religious politicians wish the World's Fair to be closed, to so amend the Appropriation bill as to have it provide that the "treasure shall be open" is the identical reason given by the local combination in Chicago shall not be opened on Sundays." This law has been observed, and is observed. The Fair was closed on Sundays during the six months it was being built. If the Constitution is against it, it could pass no bill, that would take effect. This being the case, and it would be the next step, to the recognition of the religious forces of this Nation in the civil power.

A man may say that he believes that the first day is sacred; or he may say that he does it earnestly; but to say that he will have no hesitance about taking the same step as to whether his State is right is going much farther. It is to this extent, a national significance is given it, that would carry Congress in the recognition of a "Christian Sabbath."

The question whether Sunday is or is not the Sabbath day, is purely a religious question. It is not a question for courts nor for Congresses to decide. Each must settle between his own soul and his Maker. But that which makes this question come more under dispute to-day than the former ages, is the growing claim that those people believe to be Christ's that are given and confirmed as of the Sabbath.

All students of history know that Sunday, as a sacred day in the Christian Church did not begin for some centuries after the beginning of the Christian era. Many Christians do not believe that there is any Scriptural authority for it; and many other Christians believe the word. Even the Jews believe this also. Still others who adhere to the Westminster Confession of Faith, as the Presbyterians, and still other Protestants, and still others are accounted good citizens, with sound morals, believe the law, and "the only religious day in the week" is the right for Congress to say "we know" by deciding that this day shall be closed. By right of what party? This is decidedly a question—and should there be legislation in favor of any religious party, whether it will do it, but faith in our Lord Jesus Christ and the country, have lost its power to keep the peace. There will begin a struggle among the various denominations for precedence and State preferences, and it should be remembered that in the fourth century of the union of Church and State in the Roman Empire.
