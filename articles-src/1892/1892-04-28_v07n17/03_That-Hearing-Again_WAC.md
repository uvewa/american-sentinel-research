# That Hearing Again.

AT the recent hearing before the House Committee on the World's Columbian Exposition, the question of Sunday closing, one gentleman, Dr. Pitzer, insisted that there was nothing religious about it—it was not in any sense religious. Every effort in that direction on the part of the Committees was to recognize, that the claim was not made in a religious question. The religious and political organizations and the Committees were appealed to, and they were exhorted to so reflect their religious duty in the matter in view of both present honors and future rewards.

Were these three gentlemen who spoke in favor of Sunday closing? With what they represent was an exception. What exceptions were evidences. When they objected to that hearing? They represent the Methodist Episcopal, Conferences, and confederated Presbyterian, and the American Sabbath Union, which they said represented the combined Christian sentiment of the country. If the question were purely civic, having no religious bearings, why were these gentlemen so seriously interested in it?

Supposing the proposition had been to close the World's Fair on Wednesday, would any of these gentlemen have appeared before the Committee? Had it not been for the religious duty of the thing, would they have felt themselves so impelled as to have before the Committee their convictions and the convictions of their millions of Christians? Scarcely. In fact its religious character is so clearly manifest that it is beyond the power of denial.

Not to rest upon these disputed passages, the time—the fourth commandment and all—at or after that, when Christians became mixed with civil power, they rested first by church and civil command from labor and recreation on Sunday, and in some cases gave to the Lord's day.

But the editor of the *Statesman* and an advocate of the "Sabbath for Man" had thought he had proved his point by the texts referred to; he would, has been willing to have rested his cause there; but, conscious of his inability to establish the claim upon scriptural grounds, he bethought him a "not to rest it upon these disputed passages," but rather, not to some other features of a Scriptural, but to "the first observance of the early church." He abandoned the Scriptures as being insufficient, and fell back upon a purely human character which he ascribes to the first centuries of Christianity—a character that is as false as his equally false and abandoned Scripture passages if he thinks to succeed by its means.

Dwight's Theology, Vol. IV., page 463, duly containing all of the editor of the *Statesman's* attempts to prove from the Scriptures and the apostolic Church, Dwight says:—

That the ancient Sunday is not the Sabbath, and was not by the primitive Christians called by this name.

How, then, we ask, can the editor of the *Statesman* call Sunday the Sabbath? The editor of the *Statesman* is in consultation with the issues of his paper last referred to, has the following statements:—

"The Jewish (not Christ's) Sabbath has been transferred to the first day;" "The ancient Sabbath should be transferred to the Lord's day."

This is plain enough. "The holy Sabbath of God has been given by the covenant of the Christian people," said the translator, and this "Sabbath for Man," is the Sabbath of the Lord. In this way, the change made, is not to be found in Christ, or the apostles, nor the change made, nor the covenant of the Christian people.

How then, we ask, can the editor of the *Statesman* call it the Sabbath? The editor of the *Statesman* is in a consultation with the issues of his paper last referred to, has the following statements.

This proves then that Congress, for one reason, is asked to practically legislate to close the World's Fair on Sunday. Is that a sound legal precedent? It is not. The regulation of Sunday closing, or Sunday selling, as the law makes it, is a matter of the law of the place, where the business is situated. Certainly the law of Illinois covers the World's Fair site, and it cannot, in advance of the special conditions, and regulations to be placed upon the site, history of this Exposition belongs only with the local management, under the municipal and State laws of the city of Chicago and the State laws of Illinois. With the law of the place in this matter the Congress of the United States cannot interfere, in, add to, or in any manner, amend. It has no jurisdiction over such matters there. There is a State law upon this subject, and its courts and its police force is the place to find whether the people are violating any law in keeping their gates, that law starting the continuance of the day.

But here is a State law which is observed. It represents a comprehensive system of five millions of dollars, consolidated on the assessment and tax adjustment of that statute. It is a proper thing for any corporation, controlled by the statute of any State is enforced, or to be reasonably required in the management of a World's Fair within its limits, and Congress cannot add to the requirements of a State money if it will enforce that statute? Is it consistent with the recommendation of the World's Fair Committee of this House of Representatives to present such a proposition to the State?

and open it on Sundays. The civil basis of the question, if it has any, would be misunderstood. No one will deny the right of a State to regulate business and commerce within its borders. The people of a State can rest as well physically on Wednesday as on Sunday. The closing of the Fair on Sunday, would accommodate the rest of those on the side of S. W. Sunday day would not. What would be the difference? Every one of these strenuous gentlemen instead of being at Washington in support of the measure, would be there to emphatically oppose it. What words would this change of Sunday bring? "They do not believe that Wednesday is a sacred day, but what would be the hope of Christianity? They do believe this of Sunday, and they are working to this to get a national recognition of it as such. Shall Congress make such a recognition, or allow it as merely one of economical appreciation. That would surely amount to something entirely unique in the history of congressional appropriations.

The question of the closing or the opening of the World's Fair, on Sunday, is not constructed by itself, is comparatively a small question. There have been other expositions before this, some of them closed, and some of them closed on Sunday, and yet the world revolves, and this planetary system moves on its course perfectly undisarranged. It is only when this question is considered in connection with a principle and a precedent to be established by it, that it is seen to be of colossal importance.

The very Constitutions of the various States, including the Constitution of the United States, all in their letters, and in that hearing, are pledges of the fact that they cherish this national tradition of Sunday sacredness as precedent to national Sunday laws, and wish to extend these as a precedent for putting "all religious laws and usages on an undeniable legal basis in the fundamental law" of the land. H. H. George, plainly told an audience in the World's Fair interest, the other day before it a polity society in Washington; speaking of the closing of the World's Fair on Sunday, and what a compulsion. Speaking of the closing of the World's Fair and the enacting of a Sunday laws to follow, he said: "We will then have a better vantage point from which to push our efforts. Those who are now opposing them, and opposing our work, will be invited to leave this country, bag and baggage, and go to some wild country" and "we will then close up on Sunday at all, and stay there till they tell us—that they are willing, thrust them into jail as honorable gentlemen."

The fact that this is demanded in Congress that it is not a question in any way either of a civil nature, or a mere question for the first time in the history of the world, does it come up? In no other age has the period, when a republic was being developed, in which the world's power was to build up and hold the human mind bent of feeble reason or more than a thousand years. How did it all come about? This whole political system was built upon little precedents, not one of which, considered alone, would be considered a very great thing, but the closing of the World's Fair on Sunday.

In fact, the very first step in the direction of this dangerous program, is the making and enforcing of Sunday laws. After giving an account of three different Sunday laws, each following the other, and each a little more strict the particular construction, Neander says, "In this way the connected series of laws which totally prohibited every Saturday first day; the

Colonel Shepard said that there were fifty-five millions of Christians who would not attend the Fair on Sunday, and that they did not want the Fair open on Sunday. Now if this be true, that these fifty-five millions would not attend the Fair on Sunday, all those people will stay away, whether the Fair is open on Sunday or not; and that it would never open its gates on Sunday to an empty Fair would certainly be a testimonial to the regard of the people for Sunday and their observance of it, a thousand-fold more than the mere closing that from a congressional compulsion would leave that any one will have so much respect for. Such a result would be worth more as a national law as a sort of moral necessity.

It is a matter of comparatively small moment whether the World's Fair is open or closed on Sunday; that which makes it is of a paramount and vital importance, and that is that enough should be realized all upon such a subject—that the Constitution be not violated, either in letter or broken, a dangerous precedent not established.
