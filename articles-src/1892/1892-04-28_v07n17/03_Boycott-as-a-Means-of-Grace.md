IN answer to the question, "How can the Sunday paper be suppressed?" Rev. J. S. McKee said in the Pittsburg Sunday Convention:—

By the Christian people of this community combining together in the resolve not to advertise in or purchase a copy of a paper publishing a Sunday edition.

That is, by boycott. Has this diabolical thing become "a means of grace"?
