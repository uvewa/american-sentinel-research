CONTINUED evidence appears in the public prints, from day to day, that religion in this country is fast becoming political. The latest is contained in a special dispatch from New Orleans, which says: "The political situation in this city and State grows each day more complicated. . . . In several of the south-western portions of the State prayers will be offered on Sunday next for deliverance from Republican rule." So it seems that they have a Democratic religion in Southern Louisiana, while Elliott F. Shepard and the Mail and Express profess a Republican religion. The practical difficulties in the way of a political religion will soon be exemplified among its exponents themselves.
