REV. LUTHER T. TOWNSEND, a prominent Methodist minister, created a decided sensation recently in that communion by charges of wire-pulling, bribery, and general chicanery in the management of the denomination. April 4, Professor Townsend spoke for two hours before the Methodist ministers of Boston, giving facts, reading letters, etc., in support of his charges.

—o—

ACCORDING to the New York Sun's Boston correspondent,—

One writer spoke of having seen money passed to buy votes to send a person to the General Conference. Another knew of mercenary barterings to secure soft seats for members of a church or district ring. Almost all the letters had to do with "combines" between the elders, and providing for them the easiest and most honorable offices in the ecclesiastical government. Others had noted the improper struggle for episcopacies. All had some bit of proof to put on record, and all professed themselves willing to come forward and testify to these things in order to purge the Church."

It would seem that the "Church" needs purging. Nor is this state of affairs confined to the Methodist Church in the North. The Tennessee Methodist, in its issue of March 31, has an article on the Presiding Eldership, in which this statement is made:—

A time limit ought to be put to the Presiding Eldership. Everything in the history of the office and the men who fill it sustains this statement. . . . The mind of the church would be greatly eased if they knew that the office would not become the sinecure of fossils. They have an abhorrence of a professional Presiding Elder. They soon come to the conclusion that the man loves power, and uses his influence to perpetuate it. . . . The longer some men stay in the office, if natural born tricksters and politicians, the greater hardship they work upon those who fill places under them, in order to maintain their places in the cabinet. Lust for power hurled angels from heaven. It may send some, not angels, elsewhere.

—o—

SIMILAR things were said some months ago in a Western conference, we do not now recall positively which one. All this goes to show that human nature is about the same inside the Church that it is outside of it, and that whether in the Church or out of it it lusts for power just the same. It does not prove that the churches are wholly corrupt, nor does it prove that Christianity does not make men honest and unselfish; but it does prove that a profession of Christianity does not make men honest, and that the powerful and popular churches, which are so much concerned for the morals of our city, State, and general governments, have more than enough to do to purge themselves of debasing political methods without spending so much time in fruitless endeavors to secure complimentary votes and meaningless resolutions that "we are a Christian people," that "this is a Christian Nation," and that the "American Sabbath must be preserved." The Church has fallen upon evil times, and about the worst feature of the whole business is, that leaders in the Church are looking to about everything but the power of the gospel to purify both the Church and the world.
