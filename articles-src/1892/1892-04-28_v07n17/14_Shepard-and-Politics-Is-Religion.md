THE Executive Committee of the Republican County Committee, of New York City, has stated in a resolution that Elliott F. Shepard has no authority to speak for the Republicans of the county on religious questions. So practically has the Colonel applied his theory that "politics is religion" that it has called out some interesting correspondence on the subject. This is what Senator Sherman writes to the editor of the Sunday Democrat:—

Senate Chamber, Washington, April 12, 1885.
DR. MICHAEL WALSH—Dear Sir: Yours of the 11th is received. I have read the extracts you refer to from Colonel Shepard's paper, and have no hesitation in saying that he does not represent the feeling of Republicans, but only his own. I think that no Republican desires to interfere in any way in a man's religious convictions, nor should this question enter in any respect into the domain of party politics.

Colonel Shepard's theory that politics is religion does not seem to meet with full favor from the political party to which he belongs. He will have to change his aphorism a little and make it read, "Politics is the religion profitable to the Republican Party." The change will not alter the meaning of the phrase much, if it ever had any, but will make it more capable of a definite application, under otherwise doubtful conditions.
