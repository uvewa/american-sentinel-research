Whether a religion or a religious institution be true or false does not effect the propriety of legislation upon it on the part of civil government; for all such legislation, whether the religion it concerns be true or false, is without the jurisdiction and lawful domain of civil government. But the demand for such legislation very naturally raises the question whether the religion or the religious institution thus sought to be enforced is genuine or not; in fact the demand for it is quite generally made, as the history of such legislation shows, in consequence of an agitation upon this question already in existence, and usually to uphold the wrong and put down the right.

Thus, in connection with the efforts to secure legislation for the enforcement of Sunday observance the question is raised as to which day is the Sabbath. Upon this there is a difference of opinion and practice even among believers in the Bible, some observing Saturday, the seventh day, and others Sunday, the first day. Which is the true Bible Sabbath is a matter of controversy.

Were the Bible allowed to speak upon this question, and its plain, unequivocal utterance to stand for just what it says, the controversy would soon cease, for that says, "The seventh day is the Sabbath." But all are not ready to yield even to so plain a statement. Various and conflicting methods of reasoning and interpretation are resorted to in order to make the divine answer to the question,—Which day is the Sabbath?—of no force, or to fit at will. It will be observed, however, that those who claim that the Sabbath commandment enjoins simply the observance of one day in seven, but no particular day, are as tenacious that the day observed shall be a particular day as are those who hold to a more fixed and definite application of the commandment.

The determination of some who hold to this one-day-in-seven and no-day-in-particular theory, to cling to the Sunday Sabbath at all hazards whether they know it to be right or wrong, is well foreshadowed in the following from an editorial in the Christian Statesman, of Feb. 27, 1892:—

The Saturday-keepers should be required to establish their Genesis claims before they are allowed to battle with us in the gospels. Before they debate "the change of day," let them show what day of our modern week corresponds to the original Sabbath of God and man, not to keep which, they say, is as bad as theft or murder. The Lord's day Sabbath has the contested seat. The burden of proof is on them. Let this never be forgotten.

The reader will notice how the editor of the Statesman seeks to evade a defense of the Sabbath he observes, and to intrench himself behind an established custom, rather than to fortify himself with the word of God which he professes to believe. Though he observes a day as truly as do the "Saturday-keepers," of which he speaks, he would have his readers believe that the burden of proof rests altogether upon the observers of the seventh day. How he relieves himself from the responsibility of proving anything is by asserting that "the Lord's day Sabbath [by which he means Sunday] has the contested seat." Evidently possession is nine points in law with him on this question.

By Sunday's having the contested seat the editor of the Statesman means that this day has come to be regarded as the Sabbath by the majority of professed Christians, though how and when he does not here pretend to say; it is sufficient for his purpose that it is so regarded. But how much proof of its genuineness and rightful title to the seat is there in this? He who rests his Sabbath case here adopts a principle which he must repudiate in everything else, or be compelled to accept of the worst religions that have ever cursed the world. In point of numbers of adherents the heathen form of worship has the contested seat. Of professed Christians Catholics far outnumber Protestants. As to the number of communicants and customs generally practiced and dogmas established their form of worship has the contested seat. For six thousand years the conflict between truth and error has been going on, and in every instance error has sought to gain "the contested seat," and we are sorry to say that so far as numbers are concerned it has almost invariably succeeded in obtaining it. Truth has been on the side of the few. Of all the inhabitants of the antediluvian world at the time of the flood, Noah and his family only were found righteous. Not ten righteous persons could be found in Sodom and Gomorrah. The broad road has been the road to destruction. And the fact that the Sunday Sabbath is seeking to defend itself by asserting that it has established itself with the masses is strong presumptive proof that it is not the Sabbath of the Bible. And the further fact that those who observe it are unwilling to undertake to prove its claim as such from the Bible, is still further evidence that it has surreptitiously obtained its seat.

True, Sunday has the contested seat of the Sabbath so far as numbers are concerned. But how did it get it? Who gave it this seat? Did God put it there, or is it an interloper and squatter? These are fair questions, and unless those who contend for it as the Sabbath can "prove up," and show a clear title of the day to the claim, its right and title to the seat may well be challenged. The burden of proof here rests upon the one who makes the claim. To establish Sunday as the Bible Sabbath the editor of the Statesman, as a professed Protestant, must prove from the Bible that it is the Sabbath. That he is unwilling to rest his case upon the Bible, the following from advanced sheets of his enlarged "Sabbath for Man," printed in the Statesman of April 9, 1892, will show:—

It is not true that the name "Sabbath" was never applied to the Lord's day by early Christians. The New Testament words translated on "the first day of the week," mean literally, "the first of the Sabbaths," as of a new series. After 13:42 literally means "the between Sabbath," as of a Sabbath between the Saturday Sabbaths.

Not to rest upon these disputed passages, the literature of the early church recognizes the Decalogue—the fourth commandant and all—as in full force, while condemning Saturday observance, and applies to the Lord's day its rules of worship and rest, and in some cases gives to the Lord's day, the very name "Sabbath."

If the editor of the Statesman and author of the "Sabbath for Man" had thought he had proved his point by the texts referred to he would have been willing to have rested his case there; but, conscious of his inability to maintain the claim upon scriptural grounds, he thought best "not to rest upon these disputed passages," but go rather, not to some other passages of Scripture, but to "the literature of the early church." In this he abandoned the Scriptures as being insufficient to prove the Sabbatical name and character which he ascribes to the first day of the week. A man does not usually abandon disputed passages if he thinks he has the strong side of the argument in the dispute. Dwight's Theology, Vol. IV, page 401, flatly contradicts all the editor of the Statesman attempts to prove from the Scriptures and the apostolic Church. Dwight says:—

The Christian Sabbath [Sunday] is not in the Scripture, and was not by the primitive Church called the Sabbath.

How then, we ask again, did Sunday get the contested seat? The editor of the Statesman, in the proof sheets printed in the issue of his paper last referred to, has answered this himself. He says:—

Augustine (fifth century) writes: "The holy doctors of the church enjoined that all the glory of the Jewish Sabbath should be transferred to the Lord's day."

And Alcuin at the close of the eighth century (786 A. D.), no doubt sums up the thought of the church when he says: "The observance of the former Sabbath has been transferred very frily to the Lord's day by the custom and consent of the Christian people."

This is plain enough. The "holy doctors of the church," "by the custom and consent of the Christian people," made the transfer, and put Sunday in the seat of the Sabbath of the Lord. In this way, and not by any command of God, Christ, or the apostles, was the change made, and Sunday given its seat.
