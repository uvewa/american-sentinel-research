THE Czar of Russia has issued an ukase prohibiting foreigners from selling in his dominions, outside the limits of Volhynia, or even of acquiring real estate within these limits, without first embracing the religion of the orthodox Greek Church. Such action as this has led the State Department at Washington to inquire of the Russian Government as to the status of American citizens who may be sojourning, or for the time being, resident, in Russia, and are not members of the Greek Church.
