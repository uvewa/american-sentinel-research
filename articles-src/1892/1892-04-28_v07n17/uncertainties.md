# Uncertainties Log - v07n17 (1892-04-28)

## Page 1
- **Line 104:** "W. A. COLCORD" attribution after article ending - appears as signature, added to author field

## Page 3
- **Line 128:** "W. R. M." attribution after article ending - uncertain who this author is (not in known authors list)

## Page 4
- **Line 167:** "transferred very frily" - OCR reading unclear, may be "freely" or "fairly"
- **Line 171:** "W. A. COLCORD" attribution after article ending

## Page 7
- **Advertisement text contains pricing notation "$2,800" which seems inconsistent with context (line 394) - may be OCR error for word count

## General Notes
- Multiple OCR instances of incorrect address information in NRLA section (line 289-293) - "43 BORD ST." should likely be "43 BOND ST.", similar issues with other addresses
- Line 267: Author signature appears as "A. SMITH" - this author not in known authors list for this publication year
- Several advertisements (pages 7-8) contain pricing and formatting that may have OCR errors but were transcribed as-is since they are not substantive article content
