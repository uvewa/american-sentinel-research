A COMMITTEE, appointed for that purpose, has waited upon the business men of Keyport, New Jersey, and secured their signatures to an agreement to close their shops and stores on Sunday. The Enterprise says:—

Many of those who have signed the agreement are, as a matter of course, persons who have never kept their places of business open on Sundays, but the committee determined to get the signatures of every one in order to make the movement thorough.

This statement demolishes completely the assertion that if one keeps open all must. It has not been so in the past as evidenced by the fact that some have kept open, others have not.
