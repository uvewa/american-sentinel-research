## Two Republics.

ONE of the most remarkable books of the past few months is entitled "Two Republics," by Alonzo T. Jones. It is a large volume of over eight hundred pages, and one can not help wishing it had been divided into three volumes, the first treating with the ancient Roman Republic, the second with the Christian Church under the Empire, and the third, the present conflict between Church and State. The volume is well written, and, though largely a compilation of the greatest historians and writers of ancient times, is so presented as to give a thoroughly connected, interesting, and vitally instructive narration of the struggle of the ages for absolute religious freedom. In the first part we have a graphic picture of Rome under alleged republican power, in which one looks in vain for justice, finding only a long tyranny of the rich over the poor, broken at intervals by such intrupid leaders as the Gracchi, who in turn were invariably crushed by plutocracy. Next we note the rise of Christianity, at first a religion simple and pure, tolerant, tender, gentle, and wholly uplifting in influence. Next we see Christianity surrounded by paganism in Rome, the sun worship in the East, Grecian philosophy in Greece and Alexandria; and from each source we note it takes something of the dominant thought, forms, rights, and symbols. At last the worship of Jupiter and Apollo give place to the worship of Jesus; but before yielding the old faiths we note that to a great degree they transfer their spirit into the new belief, and Pontifex Maximus of pagan Rome gives place to Pontifex Maximus of Christian Rome, while the latter excels the former in rights, forms, rituals, and the splendor of official dignity. The simple and beautiful teachings of the carpenter's Son become lost in the royal pomp, the licentiousness and prodigality of the new State religion. Faithfully and with great sincerity our author traces the great apostasy which rose under the cloak of Christianity, but which took caste and color from its great defender, the bloody murderer Constantine. The history of the struggle for freedom in subsequent ages, the temporary or partial triumphs, and the present encroachment on the part of dogmatic and ritualistic theology upon the right of the people in our land, are very interesting and instructive. This work should be carefully perused by every patriotic citizen. It will appeal most strongly to that large class of deep thinkers whose clear vision beholds the terrible danger of the present silent but persistent struggle on the part of bigots to re-establish conditions which will bar freedom of thought along certain lines, and make persecution not only possible, but imperative on the part of those clothed with authority; weld together Church and State, and in so doing curse society as it has not been cursed since the Reformation opened the door to freedom, science, and progress. This volume should have a wide circle of readers.—The Arena, April, 1892.
