REV. A. W. PITZER, of Washington, has filed with the House Committee on the World's Fair a subsumious paper, in behalf of the American Sabbath Union, asking that the World's Fair be closed on Sunday. The statements upon which he bases his request are that,—

At the first World's Fair, in London, in 1851, the gates were closed on Sundays.

At the second, in the same city, in 1862, the gates were closed.

At the third, in Paris, 1867, the American, British, and Colonial exhibitors closed on Sundays.

At the fourth, in Vienna, there was the same Sunday closing.

At the fifth, in Philadelphia, there was complete Sunday closing.

At the sixth, 1878, and the seventh, 1889, both in Paris, American, British, and Colonial exhibitors closed on Sunday.

The Doctor evidently fails to see that this which is depended upon as so strong an array of precedents, is in fact, no precedent at all, in the line of what they are asking, namely, such action by Congress as will close the entire Exposition at at Chicago on Sundays. The facts stated are correct, as far as they go, but they do not apply to the point for the attainment of which they are used; that is the assumption by Congress of the authority to close the World's Fair on Sunday either by direct legislation or conditional proviso.
