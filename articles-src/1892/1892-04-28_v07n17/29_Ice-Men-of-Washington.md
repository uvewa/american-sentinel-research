THE ice-men of the city of Washington have issued a circular asking that the churches support them in a demand for the stoppage of delivery of ice on Sunday. In response to this Dr. A. W. Pitzer, of the Central Presbyterian Church, has held a special Sunday evening service, at which the ice-men were present in force and took seats together in the body of the church. Dr. Pitzer preached a very earnest sermon on "Sunday rest for every man"; and although it did not appear why the ice-men could not rest if they wanted to without the aid of Dr. Pitzer, the Church, or any one else, still some of them seemed eminently gratified with what was said. The different motives and forces are legion which are combining to secure obedience to Sunday laws as well as for their enactment and enforcement.
