# The World's Fair and the Constitution

THE profession of Christianity does not make men just, any more than the joining of popular churches, which are so much run by politicians and governed by the State, and general governments, have been enough in it to purge these abuses of debasing political methods within, and spending so much time in fruitless endeavors to ensure complimentary votes and resolutions proclaiming that "we are a Christian people," that "this is a Christian Nation," and that "the American Sabbath must be preserved." The proposition has fallen upon stony ground; but about the worst leaders of the whole business is that, leaders in the Church who pretend to adopt everybody the spiritual power of the gospel, to purify both the Church and the world.

AT the hearings before the House Committee on the World's Fair, in which the advocates of the Sunday closing of the National Exposition, by act of Congress, presented their views, no arguments were offered. The reasons given why Congress should be asked to do what was being asked on religious sentiment and present political consideration was not stated as such, nor were the real grounds of their demand discussed.

The fact of religion presented in Congress, was swept from the commission to Christianity, from the king and queen of Spain, through the colonial charters and their Church and State weddings, and the Revolution and the State found in State Constitutions and judicial decisions, clear down to the last opinion of Mr. Justice Brewer in the case of Holy Trinity Church. This most extensive array of erroneous precedent, backed up by petitioners, said to be several millions in number, and the claim made on behalf of some twenty millions of professed Christians in this country, of whose voice in this particular respect,* seemed to be wholly relied upon as sufficient to carry the vote with the Committee and Congress. Either of these claims ought to be sufficient to strike any thoughtful man with the gravity of this misguided legislation. The error of yielding such considerations of a most pernicious character is fast becoming so evident from actual experience as to become almost common-colonial. That the time has again come when it may be sufficient to know the fact of its existence as proof sufficient that they have a will and disposition to exercise of superior authority in civil affairs, certainly should from the situation of the American people, much more those in whom is enthralled the care of the legislative and judicial interests of the Nation, to the impartial guardianship of the religious movement to still farther increase the force and authority of precedent to have been found wanting.

The very precedents quoted are themselves evidence that all are agreed that this line of legislation and decrees should have gone no farther. The fact that subservience to the wishes of a religious body is proposed sufficient reason for such legislation, is sufficient cause for alarm. That all who profess even the forms of Christianity, and that however much they may be disposed to so rectify the ranks of the aristocracy of religion is imbued enough to exercise control. That among those they enumerate are many thoughtful men and wise, and strong, and devout, and charitable, and public-spirited and useful, as well as some who are conceited and unbalanced, who do change wholly with the spiritual authority of the Church with the world, and still they are counted as favoring that with which they are at present contented with, would these ministerial raises a grave doubt as to the safety of their flocks if such closing were not established, and which bases its requirements upon the assumption that because it is the moral and spiritual "cop" of this country.

In perfect consonance with these claims, but still more audacious was the plea made at one of those hearings before the committees, that "the Government has no right to use the money of the people to support an Exposition which opens its doors on Sunday contrary to the wishes of so many of the people who pay its taxes from week-day earnings to taken." There is a difficulty with this proposition. It is this: The taxes of the people are no more, and it will apply universally. Because there are many people who are convinced that the tariff laws as they now exist, money from taxes from them is taken, as such must not be appropriated for the enforcement of the tariff and the collection of duties under it. Because so many American citizens are politically anti-tariff Republicans, if they should object, no money drawn from them by taxation could be appropriated for the expenditure of a Republican House of Representatives.

On the same principle precisely, because there are so many Sunday Societies in this country the money drawn from the people by taxation cannot be appropriated for the use of a Fair which shall not be kept open on Sunday. If these are all purely secular arguments, any secular argument can be made to prove anything, and the same principles will apply equally to all cases.

The plea is specious, it contains a farther defect which is vital, and that is that ours is a "Christian Nation." This objection is for all "religious uses and usages" and it is one that destroys the civil plea entirely. It is not a civic, but a religious argument. The same ground cannot decide. Those to whom the paying of taxes is an exemption, of these the one big one secured, that it is to follow the Bible injunction and discipline those who do not pay it, ought to at least lest their obedience to the Lord it would lead them to teach by a better letter.

The National Religious Liberty Association does not advocate the opening or the closing of the Fair on Sunday, but it squarely argues that it is a religious question, and that as such it is not within the power of civil government. The Constitution says, "Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof." In 1797 a treaty was made with Tripoli which said, "The Government of the United States is not in any sense founded on the Christian religion, and as it has in itself no character of enmity against the laws, religion, or tranquility of Musselmans, and as the said States never have entered into any war or act of hostility against any Mahometan nation, it is declared by the parties that no pretext arising from religious opinions shall ever produce an interruption of the harmony existing between the two countries." All other treaties, is made a part of the supreme law of the land. We are to presume that here, by constitutional right, as well as by faith and practice, all religions are equal before the law, and none can claim preference.

That this equality of all religions before the law has extended to the various days of the week that are regarded as sacred by the several religions, was affirmed by the Senate of the United States in 1829. The Government was requested to stop the mail service on Sunday by law. The reply of the Senate was:—

> It is not the legitimate province of the Legislature to determine what religion is true or what is false. Our Government is a civil, and not a religious institution. Our Constitution recognizes in every person the right to choose his own religion, and to enjoy it freely, without molestation. Whatever may be the religious sentiments of citizens, and however variant, they are alike entitled to protection from the Government, so long as they do not invade the rights of others.

There is a natural law that this will do all that is needful, and we ask for nothing more. The Government represents the law; the ministers represent the gospel. They should prevent the criminal, the ministers should convert the sinner. We dare them about and make them go in the way that is convenient. That is the extent of religious government.

It is a matter of comparatively small moment whether the World's Fair is open or closed on Sunday; that which is paramount is of a paramount and vital importance, and that is that enough should be studied all upon such a subject—that the Constitution be not violated, either in letter or spirit.

This is plain enough. "The holy Sabbath of God has been given by the covenant of the Christian people," said one who thus boldly stated both his fact and his claim. It is not given by the covenant of the Christian people, it is given, as they say, by the law and the Sabbath of the Lord. In this way God has given it, not by the covenant of the Christian people. Neither Christ nor the apostles, nor the change made, nor the covenant of the Christian people.
