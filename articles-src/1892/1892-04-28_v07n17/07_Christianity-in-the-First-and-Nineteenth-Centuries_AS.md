# Christianity in the First and Nineteenth Centuries.

IN the first century of the Christians era the Christian religion, in its purity, was beginning to push its conquests against the superstitions of paganism; spreading into all the known world, gathering into its ranks converts from every nation. What were the agencies at work? Separated from the world, not by the aid of civil authority, but by the power of God. Spoken against by the authorities, opposed by them, and in spite of them, the disciples of the crucified One went on. "They shall lay their hands on you, and persecute you, delivering you up to synagogues, and into prisons, being brought before kings and rulers for my name's sake."

And ye shall be betrayed both by parents, and brethren, and kinsfolks and friends; and some of you shall they cause to be put to death.

In that early day only Christians were often dragged before the courts as criminals, arrested by the officers of the law at the instigation of the Jewish hierarchy, and many of them of life itself.

In the nineteenth century, in the land of Christ and the devil; and although the Son of God, under whose religion the professors— "The devil shall cast some of you into prison." In no instance do we find recorded that Christ ever did, or ever proposed to use this power. In no instance do we

civil laws, or any other human agency, the church cloaked with civil authority, its own professed followers should fine and imprison those who would not keep in some in faith and practice.

One true religion once needs any stronger support than the authority of God. When human civil law is framed to enforce religious tenets by civil penalties it is at once a confession of the weakness of the doctrine in the interests of which it is enacted, and an indication of its Satanic origin.

What dire change has come over the Christianity of the nineteenth century, rendering the method of Christ and the apostles in carrying the gospel of an infidel so much making it expedient to appeal to State Legislatures, and Congress instead, has enthralled the followers of Christ in the popular churches of today that fallen and corrupted her ways before God. Is not that she is about to take the place of the Pharisees and Sadducees who put Christ and the apostles to death, and the mother of harlots whose robes are stained with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus.

Those modern would be reformers are very zealous, thinking that they are doing sacred service for the cause of God and humanity. So did Saul, the apostle of the Pharisees seek, when, by the authority of the church clothed with civil power, he hounded his victims to the death, "verily thinking they believed in Jesus. Christ was true. He stood by that statement "as the lawyers were accounted 'as the filth of the world and the offscouring of all things,'" spoken against and the apostles, and brethren and were accused at being men that had turned the world upside down; and yet they were the true people of God, and to-day their work remains.

Modern popular religiousness are failing in its better efforts, and it would be very safe to so trust free civil law as to make it possible for them to punish, themselves in its better effort. The early Christians would have persecuted Jesus. If they have got enough of the right kind of religion to be an overwhelming help and defense they do not need the aid of civil law; but if they have not such a defense, for humanity's sake, do not put into their hands the power of civil power.
