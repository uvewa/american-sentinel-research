At the hearings before the House Committee on the World's Fair, in which those who advocated the Sunday closing of the Exposition, by act of Congress, presented their views, no arguments were offered. The reasons given why Congress should be asked to do this were based solely on religious sentiment and precedent. The field of religious precedent in law, was swept, from the commission to Columbus from the king and queen of Spain, through the colonial charters and their Church and State weddings, and the fragmentary survival of the union of religion and the State found in State Constitutions, statutes, and judicial decisions, down to the last opinion of Mr. Justice Brewer, that this is a "Christian Nation." This most extensive array of erroneous precedent backed up by petitioners, said to be several millions in number, and the claim that there were at least eighteen millions of professed Christians in this country whose "wishes were entitled to respect," seemed to be wholly relied upon as sufficient to carry the day with the Committee and Congress. Either of these claims ought to be sufficient to excite the suspicion of every thoughtful, clear-minded legislator. The error of religious precedent in our law has already become colossal. That the time has again come when this error begins to claim the fact of its existence as proof sufficient that it exists by divine right and is therefore of superior authority in civil affairs, certainly should rouse the attention of the American people, much more those to whom is entrusted the care of the legislative and judicial interests of the Nation, to the impending possibilities of this religious movement to still farther increase the force and authority of precedent by which it already claims to rule.

The very precedents quoted are themselves the strongest evidences possible that this line of legislation and decree should be followed no farther. The fact that subservience to the wishes of a religious aristocracy is asked so boldly, and with such insistence, is sufficient cause for alarm. That all who profess even the forms of Christianity, and that however hypocritically, are counted in to swell the ranks of the aristocracy of religion is in itself enough to excite suspicion. That among those they enumerate are many thoughtful men and women, whose hearts and minds are the abode of religion pure and undefiled, who disagree wholly with this course which their Bible tells them is the spiritual adultery of the Church with the world, and still they are counted as favoring that with which they are at total variance, this, if there were no more, must raise a grave doubt as to the safety of listening to the demands of a minority so constituted, and which bases its requirements upon the arrogant assumption that it is the moral and spiritual "400" of this country.

In perfect consonance with these claims, but still more specious was the plea made at one of these hearings before the committee, that "this Government has no right to use the money of the people to support an Exposition which opens its doors on Sunday contrary to the wishes of so many of the people who pay the taxes from which that money is taken." There is a difficulty with this proposition. Is it a proposition in pure civics? If it is it will apply universally. Because there are so many citizens so strenuously opposed to the tariff laws as they now exist, money drawn from them in taxes, if they object, must not be appropriated for the enforcement of the tariff and the collection of duties under it. Because so many American citizens are politically such earnest Republicans, if they should object, no money drawn from them by taxation could be appropriated for the expenditures of a Democratic House of Representatives. On the same principle precisely, because there are so many Sunday-keepers in this country the money drawn from the people by taxation cannot be appropriated for the use of an Exposition which may keep open on Sunday. If these are all purely civil questions they are all on the same footing, and the same principle will apply to all. But the absurdity is self-evident. The plea is specious, it contains a factor which is extra-civil, and that is that this is a "Christian Nation." The objection is made because of religious conviction. But that destroys the civil plea entirely. It is not a question in pure civics, and so Congress cannot decide it. Those to whom the paying of taxes is contrary to conscience have but one recourse, that is to follow the Bible injunction and distribute their wealth among the poor; then having lent their substance to the Lord it will be beyond the reach of the tax-collector.
