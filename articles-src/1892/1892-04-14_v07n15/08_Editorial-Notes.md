# Editorial Notes.

CORRESPONDING COMMITTEE, of this city, on the 6th inst., introduced a bill into Congress which provides for immediate and complete cessation of work of any kind or nature, now or heretofore actually occupied and used to the House of God the Gospel the City of Washington.

---

ACCORDING to the *Mail and Express* the street car companies of Chicago will not take any part in the question of the Sunday closing of the World\'s Fair, either for or against. This destroys an important point made by Rev. Mr. Stevenson, in his recent hearing before the House Committee on the Columbian Exposition, that thousands of dollars would be spent, if it was to compound Sunday opening.

---

As the result of arrival in that city, less barber who will close the other barber shops of the place in the fair. His proposition has been accepted, and notice has been served on the town. But the other men have employed the usual neutral retaliation and seek to close the barber shops, restaurateurs, livery stables, and news stands. We await results with interest.

The following extract is from the proceedings of a recent session of the city council of Atlanta, Georgia:—

"I have a petition touching the switching of cars in the city of Atlanta on Sunday, and this is what they ask: That the railroad companies be permitted to switch trains arriving in the city after midnight Saturday; from 12 o\'clock Saturday night until 12 o\'clock Sunday night no car must be moved, not even if it is loaded with live stock or perishable stuff."

"That is just what they have told me," said Mr. Turner.

"I understand," Mr. Turner, "this is in conformity with the ordinance of the city of Atlanta. The switching of freight trains must stop at midnight Saturday night and not resume until 12 o\'clock Sunday night. You can arrange to have your cars on hand early enough. But to take live stock and perishable stuff up to 8 o\'clock Sunday morning. After that hour it must be at the discretion of the superintendent to give to such things the opportunity to go to church."

For sometime past the railroads have been prevented from doing any switching or running of trains, Atlanta, on Sunday; but because of the difficulty of enforcing this restriction the Common Council now passes an ordinance permitting switchmen and other railroad employes to demonstrate a portion of the day, and then have "an opportunity to go to church" for conscience. If the day too is to be held as such; as if they had violated its sanctity just as much as if they had worked the entire twenty-four hours! Such reformers as this should convince thinking people that the whole Sunday law movement is not religious. It is to establish by legislation and their faith in God and his power to act upon the consciences and hearts of men, they are about to establish laws to compel men to appear to be religious, and to be practically as mean to the various kinds of hypocrites that they arrest.

---

Elsewhere in the state a similar course has been taken. In the city of Savannah all sales were stopped from Savannah—

Everything is sold openly in Savannah on Sunday except drugs. Everything closed up. Even the news-stands are prohibited. The news stands of the depot are boarded up, and the newsboys had to shut up their shops. The news-stands find it hard to keep open. Recently one of the boys was arrested for selling papers on the street. It is said they have to go to jail until the next morning.

---

The South is proving a good field for religious legislation. A number of new Sunday laws are now being urged by a southern one has led that moral law was enforced which the Sunday question comes into a civil law, and fix it away in the constitution so that no Legislature shall be able to make ready for use in a moment of hot blood.

The Freedom of Speech bill before the New York Legislature has been killed for this session, by a close vote. Mr. Connolly stated that in the bill, by a close vote. The representation of the commander of the Catholic Church in the House of Refuge on Randall\'s Island "that Catholic Church demanded this" as a right.

Senator Histed said he was opposed to the bill under any circumstances: "It is not an American bill, and I would be false to myself, if I should sanction any form of worship on anybody. I believe the Church and the State should be kept apart, and that religious bills should be kept out of the Legislature,—that interference with religion never does any good."
