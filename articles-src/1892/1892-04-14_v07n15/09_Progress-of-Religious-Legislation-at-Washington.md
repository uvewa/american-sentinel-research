# Progress of Religious Legislation at Washington.

THE city of Washington has been for some weeks, and still is, besieged by "National Reformers." The combination which has to change the religious character of the government of this nation, on Sunday, to which the government has made appropriations,—the Senate, the House, and the District of Columbia,—have had these measures made the difficulty of enforcing the Sunday-closing provision, presented for the consideration of Congress. Every citizen in the country is being asked to state their individual opinion on these questions by the *New York Mail and Express* and other papers. The result has been followed up by persistent personal effort. The religious forces in favor of Sunday and free religion are beginning to know their position, and to make that position felt. The battle of religion is marked by all the organized form of a religious boycott, which has marked the development; the acceptance of win-pulling, shrewd legislators that it is the method of the National Reform Congressional action, to block legislation upon the World's Fair, and make it mandatory that it be complied with. Their ferocity upon the question is further emphasized by the statement that already thousands of petitions are being sent in to

the difficulty the Sunday-closing provision be inserted, so that every issue of the Congressional Record covers a large proportion of the petitions presented to be for that purpose. Be sure of this that even the *Christian Statesman* is enabled and cries that at last the petitions are coming. The committees are overwhelmed with them and are asking. Anything more on the other side? Note which show that a few at least of our conscience-smitten Christians think that this is not a matter which properly calls for religious legislation.

When congressmen yield to the instigation of these religious lobbyists, rather than to their own private conviction, in the majority of cases.

The churches are, of course, being used to their utmost, in the effort to send petition upon petition to match the ears, also, of the church-going congressmen. Among them may be found the National Church, Rev. H. H. George, Mrs. M. E. Bateham, and the secretary of the department of the Sunday-closing department of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union; who are the chief of the Sunday closing of the World's Fair; and the effort is alone it is by the help of the Congress of the United States, which may close the gates to appeal for the laboring man, and for respect to the claims of the Christian religion. These National Reformers, as they claimed, were representatives of all Protestant Christian organizations; Christian Endeavor, Christian, of course, for no religious legislation action on these questions most bitterly demonstrate against the individual conscience; and that small minority which is dissatisfied with the religious character of such legislation in this country and go where there is no Sabbath legislation, and go to the places where they belong.

The situation is very much what a man has in his own mind that it apparently did not occur to the congressmen that 20,000,000 of petitions of that sort according to the plan of the *Mail* and not according to the individual consciences. Mr. George had evidently read closely our articles on the significance of the Supreme Court decision on the history of the establishment of religion in this country. Mr. George told the committee that it was a great significance of the discovery of this continent, and held that the discovery of the continent was in, to the name of the Queen of Spain, but also in the name of Jesus Christ. The continent was Christian as well.

The chief bulk of the petitions which he had received and transmitted to Congress for the closing were from the churches and religious organizations, and that these were the petitions to close the World's Fair on Sunday. More of the same nature is being received daily.

It is remarkable how very near all the items in the list of religious organizations to-day are Endeavor societies, the whole of them together. Every syllabus, Mission, and Assembly, Sabbath School Convention, Synod, and Assembly, Sabbath School Conference, Endeavor Society, Young Peoples of Christian Endeavor Union, the churches, the Good Templars, Sons of Temperance, the Women's Christian Temperance Union, and the American Sabbath Union, and all other organizations of a religious character, have been urged to make "interest" at Washington, to demand the closing of the Exposition on Sabbath, or to permit the same to be practically worthless through the withholding of the government's exhibits. The forces say that they will not patronize the Exposition in, etc. And yet we are told that this more than sufficient demonstration of religious conviction ends, and Sunday laws are not religious.
