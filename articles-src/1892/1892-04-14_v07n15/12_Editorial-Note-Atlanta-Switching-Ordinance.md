THE following extract is from the proceedings of a recent session of the city council of Atlanta, Georgia.

"I have here a petition touching the switching of cars on Sunday, and an ordinance on the same subject," said Mr. Turner, chairman of the electric light committee.

"The ordinance permits railroads to switch trains arriving in the city after midnight Saturday from that hour up to 8 o'clock Sunday morning, and again after 10 o'clock Sunday night, when the cars are loaded with live stock or perishable stuff."

"Isn't that against the State laws? asked Mr. Woodward."

"No," answered Mr. Turner, "this is in conformity with the State law. By our city laws all switching of freight trains must stop at midnight Saturday, and remain standing until midnight Sunday. This new ordinance permits roads to switch live stock and perishable stuff up to 8 o'clock Sunday morning, and again after 10 o'clock Sunday night. That in no way affects the men and still gives them an opportunity to go to church."

The ordinance was adopted.

For sometime past the railroads have been prohibited from doing any switching or other work in Atlanta, on Sunday; but because of the difficulty of enforcing this restriction the Common Council now passes an ordinance permitting switchmen and other railroad employees to desecrate a portion of the day, and then have "an opportunity to go to church" for confession. If the day can be desecrated have they not violated its sanctity just as much as if they had worked the entire twenty-four hours? Such ordinances as this should convince thinking people that this whole Sunday-law movement is gotten up by a set of religionists that have lost their faith in God and his power to act upon the minds and consciences of men, and so they go about to establish laws to compel men to appear to be religious, and construct these laws to suit the various kinds of hypocrites that they create.
