# The Supreme Court and a National Religion.

A most remarkable and unlooked for evidence of the tendencies of the nation which have only appeared in THE SENTINEL, on the derivation and growth of religious law, has been given even in a decision delivered by Justice Brewer of the Supreme Court of the United States. This decision also bears proof positive that the principles relied in those articles, from the facts which were taken as premiums, are sound. The accuracy of the historical situation as portrayed in these articles; and that, in logically following the lead, that the present movement for the unity of the State and religion,--or of Church and State; and religion,--or of working for the same thing,--has been wonderfully confirmed. Here is the most incontrovertible evidence that the same conclusions arrived at in these columns was just and warranted.

THE SENTINEL, has asserted that the weight of judicial precedent establishes the right of religious ecclesiasticism and the State in this country. Justice Brewer affirms the same thing. THE SENTINEL establishes the jurisdiction of the courts of legislation in religious things. Justice Brewer affirms the same thing, and is willing to be an instrument for the establishment of this jurisdiction; he decides favoring and establishing accepted arguments.

The Supreme Court of the United States has now concurred in the arraignment of the State of Tennessee (representing the State, in general) heresy prosecuting law, and has hastened to give testimony that it is itself practically convinced.

The case in which the Supreme Court has done this is that of the Rector, etc., of the Holy Trinity Church, vs. the United States. An English clergyman was contracted with by the managers of this religious body. The foreign contract labor law prohibits this arrangement; and it was held that the law had been violated. This was affirmed by the United States Supreme Court. On February 29, Justice Brewer delivered the opinion, from which there seems to have been no dissenting voice.

In view of the language, intent, and spirit, of the American Constitution to the disturbing, it is patent enough that matters pertaining to religion, or religious services of any character, would not fall under the jurisdiction of the United States Government, nor be amenable to the subject of congressional legislation; and had the question been raised, when the legislation was passed with the intent to cover within its provisions ministers of religion it would, to that extent, have been unconstitutional legislation; and this seems to have been the decision of the case upon the merits of the law. But by no means does Justice of the Supreme Court has not rested upon merit merely, the occasion was seized to deny to all who hold that the United States from making any law respecting an establishment of religion, to show that this country has, and already has had, a national religion.

He first shows that the statute, as worded, covers the broadest possible ground; then argues that this is sufficient precedent to justify the court in giving it a restricted interpretation and excepting of this case of laborers, together with others specifically mentioned in another clause; further, that the framers of the measure could not have intended to include ministers; but, still beyond these considerations, and above them all, is the broader one: "That we are a religious people." He goes on with force of argument to trace: that "this is a religious people;" that "this is a religious Nation;" that "this is a Christian Nation;" that "the morality of the country is deeply ingrafted upon Christianity;" and "these and many other matters which might be noticed, add a volume of unofficial declarations to the mass of organic utterances that this is a Christian Nation." Thus by the argument the progression is "religious people," "religious Nation," "Christian Nation," and "Christian land." The series culminates in the National Reform argument of "Christian Government," with the accompanying theory put to the theory that the Christian religion is the common law of the land. Individual States, by declaring, by flat of its Supreme Court, the United States to be a Christian Nation.

For the purpose of upholding these views two classes of historical and judicial precedents are cited, both of which are indiscriminately used to uphold the theory of the union of religion with the State. The one of precedents does establish the position taken, while the very presence of the other as a distinct class of arguments possible that the laws for the one set is as diametrically opposed to the other set is diametrically opposed to those which are cited as the parallel or the antipodal. No one who looked beyond the fact that the terms of law, holy and moral truths, are expressed in both could fail to see that they are so complete an antagonism to each other. Yet Justice Brewer treats them both together,--apparently unconscious of the discord,--as tending to the same point. His line of precedents begins back in the discovery of the country. The "commission from Ferdinand and Isabella;" "the grant of the Queen of Castile," to explore and discover countries; "the first colonial grant;" and each, and every seed will produce after its kind;" the patent granted to Sir Walter Raleigh from "Elizabeth;" the first charter of Virginia: *"propagating the Christian faith;"* the commission to Virginia, etc., in which he was authorized; in which, in his own language, only "they be not against the true Christian faith now professed in the Church of England;" his quoting King Charles, a Catholic, the record the State Church of England gave Virginia its charter, quoting Virginia, given in 1606, King James I. granted a charter to colonize Virginia, in the language of his divine Majesty, in propagation of Christian religion;" Justice Brewer supports these citations further by

Language of similar import may be found in the charter of privileges of the province of Pennsylvania, founded by William Penn, in 1681 and 1701; and the issue of one of the principal controversies of the time was that of the Christian religion desired to be one of the

In Connecticut the declaration upon, at the outset of their colonial career was very explicit, and to the purpose, being attested, affirmed that they did "enter into combination and confederation, together, to maintain and preserve the liberty and purity of the gospel of our Lord Jesus which we now profess, as also the discipline of the churches, which, according to the truth of the said gospel, is now practiced among us."

The charter of privileges of the province of Pennsylvania recites:

> Because no people can be truly happy, though under the greatest enjoyment of civil liberties, if abridged of the freedom of their consciences, as to their religious profession and worship: And Almighty God being the only Lord of conscience, Father of lights and spirits, and the Author as well as Object of all divine knowledge, faith and worship, who only doth enlighten the minds, and persuade and convince the understandings of people, I do hereby grant and declare...

In order to escape the full strength of the argument against this class of precedents, it is necessary to have placed farther and farther and show that

> No such person or persons inhabiting in this province or territories, who shall confess and acknowledge one Almighty God... shall in any case be molested or prejudiced... shall be in any case... nor shall be in any way be molested or prejudiced for his or her conscientious persuasion or practice. ... And that all persons who profess to believe in Jesus Christ, the Saviour of the world, shall be capable (notwithstanding their other persuasions and practices in point of conscience and religion) to serve this government in any capacity, both legislatively and executively.

Up to this point the quotations made are without exception quotations of the friends of Church and State. This class of colonists came from many parts of the United States and of different States, and planted the seeds of their Church and State in the Divinity to be moral duty,--whether they had recognition of the right that individuals possessed to be unmolested of God, or whether they are the survival of the early colonial religion. They testify to the things which are God's should be given to God: these are precedents that criminately uses them all to show the establishment of Christianity and the union of religion and State. To him the whole of these provisions having a relation to religion are precedents that establish that all men "are endowed by the Creator with certain inalienable rights," "appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectification of our intentions," and "with a firm reliance upon the protection of Divine Providence, we mutually pledge,"--these are all used indiscriminately with the above recited imperiled words and the assurances in the organic utterances of the First Amendment that Congress may not establish any religion; with the declaration that the State Constitutions are claimed in the same relation. "There is no dissonance in these declarations. ... There is a universal language... the existence of a God," etc. "That in view of the nature... the history of our constitutional law ... there can be no other than a declaration of belief in a God;" "the charter of 1606,... the Constitution of Massachusetts, 1780... every constitution of every one of the fortyfour States contain language which... tuna has a right to require the institution of ... the charter of Rhode Island... support of public Protestant teachers of piety, religion and morality." The charter of Rhode Island is not done voluntarily; or the Constitution of Maryland; the Connecticut Constitution of 1818. Yet Justice Brewer cites in the officious sense. T. A. B., of Allegany, Pa.; he quotes from the Maryland charter, "a profession of belief ... in God the Father, Christ his only Son, and in the Holy Spirit, ... an oath is meaningless unless it be to acknowledge the Holy Scriptures of the Old and New Testament to be given by divine inspiration."

In these three provisions of religious liberty and of religious bondage Justice Brewer sees no dissonance.

It is supposed to have little touch upon the private citizen, especially the non-religious citizen. But it must a declaration, consonant to the Constitutions of all the States, does not establish the legal principle of governmental recognition for prohibiting the free exercise thereof; etc. And it is a bull. There is no dissonance in these declarations. There is a universal language pervading them all, having one meaning; they are organic utterances; they speak the voice of the entire people.

In both classes of precedents there is as much dissonance as between the Mystic principles of the man who, leaving home, walks to Paul's time, and continues to work in Paul's time, and continues in the gospel of Jesus Christ; as much dissonance as between the civil freedom which the Saviour preached, and the religious despotism of which the Pope of Rome is the exponent; as much dissonance as between God and Satan; for the one line of thought represents the principles of one, and the other of the other.

This opinion quotes further legal declarations and opinions to the effect that Christ is part of the common law, and also the Supreme Court decision of the State to the Pennsylvania opinion of Mr. Justice Duncan.

It is also said, and truly, that the Christian religion is the religion of the people of Pennsylvania; and emphasizes this by further quotation.

If we pass beyond these matters to a view of American life as expressed by its laws, its business, its customs and its society, we find everywhere a clear recognition of the same truth.

To argue that this view of the case is not, and a volume of unofficial declarations, is to break beyond the suggestion that there is a Constitution or that there is any that the Supreme Court of the United States has now settled this case in favor of religion. What next? w. H. M.
