COMMENTING upon a recent sermon by Dr. Parkhurst of this city, an editorial writer for the *Sabbath Recorder* says that—Dr. Parkhurst believes that the government of the city of New York is one of the matters which concerns the kingdom of God on the earth as much as a revival of religion in his church does, and the displacement of a ring of bad men belongs as truly to the advancement of righteousness, which is a part of the kingdom of God, as does the conversion of a man to Christ.

And it seems from the connection that the editorial writer, who is also a minister, agrees with the Doctor.

How any minister can entertain such views is beyond our ken. The kingdom of God on earth is simply, as the apostle declares, "to take out of" the nations "a people for his name." How, then, "the government of the city of New York," or any other city or nation, even, can be "one of the matters which concerns the kingdom of God on earth as much as a revival of religion," is quite beyond the understanding of any body except National Reformers. One of two things is true, either the estimate placed upon the government of the city of New York is entirely too high, or that placed on the nature and value of the kingdom of God is infinitely below what it ought to be.

"The displacement of a ring of bad men" is always desirable, and civilly it is highly commendable; and so is the displacement of dishonest and inefficient employees by private corporations; but to assert that it "belongs as truly to the advancement of righteousness as does the conversion of a man to Christ," is in effect to assert that temporal and civil things are of equal importance with eternal salvation.

THE question was once asked, "What shall a man give in exchange for his soul?" Hitherto it has remained unanswered, but in the new light which now shines from the pulpit of the Doctor and the pen of the editorial writer, the answer is easy—get right politically. The Creator himself could devise no means for the advancement of righteousness in the earth except by giving his Son, that through faith in him men might become righteous; but now it is discovered; and the "displacement of bad men" from office stands on a par with the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ! What may we not look for next?
