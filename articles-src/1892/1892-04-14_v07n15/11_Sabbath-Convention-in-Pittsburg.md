# Sabbath Convention in Pittsburg.

At the so-called Sabbath Convention in Pittsburg, on the 29th ult., Rev. S. M. Belli, of Belton, said:—

We have not so much to fear from so ferocious an enemy, as from the timidity and apathy of the individual conscience. It is our own friends who are in danger of betraying the cause. We must make it impossible for any the public conscience, for the public has no right to set the individual conscience up. No party or its chairman. We have formed a sort of combination, to boycott the Exposition if it is not closed by our vote. We do about the same right of the individual of the individual conscience as the petitions of the individual conscience. These are matters which might properly be made the basis of this the oil or the salt well. This thing has got to be decided. It must be whether or no this country is for the Sabbath of the individual conscience or whether or not it is for the Sabbath of the compulsory Sunday law. The English bill, teaches us to read but not to read.

And the Convention said "Amen," and went right on canvassing for civil laws to compel Sunday observance. But civil law can never reach and revitalize the individual conscience. The people who keep Sunday by law makes them worse better than they would by law make themselves better than they are.
