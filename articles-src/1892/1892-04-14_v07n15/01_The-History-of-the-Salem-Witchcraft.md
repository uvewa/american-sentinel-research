# The History of the Salem Witchcraft.

The history of the Salem Witchcraft has just been retold in the *New England Magazine* by W. S. Nevins, containing its impressions for our time.

The progress of National Reform doctrine in this country has been wonderfully hastened during the past few years; startling as we might say; and yet few are alive to the dangers that lurk in the inevitable aggressions of misguided religious zeal and blindness cut-and-out moral rights.

Poor and well-intentioned people argue that as civil government is ordained of God, his law ought to be the standard of all law, and that civil government, which is his creation, ought not to suffer any preventable violations of his law; hence, our Sunday laws, which are designed (they tell us grand) a day popularly supposed to be divinely set apart for rest and worship; and it is argued that by the State's failing to guard that day by law, the State itself becomes guilty of enforcing violations of the divine law.

The Puritans, how fondly remembered, argued in regard to witchcraft most as many now do in justifying modern Sunday laws. They said, "There is a divine law against witchcraft; the Bible says, 'thou shalt not suffer a witch to live;' Ex. 22:18. And, again, 'a man also or a woman that hath a familiar spirit, or that is a wizard, shall surely be put to death;' Lev. 20:27; and believing it to be the duty of the State to enforce the divine law as given for the guidance of civil relations, they had no choice but to put to death persons adjudged guilty of witchcraft, however resistant our modern reformers who sigh for "a touch of the Puritans" would have to follow the logic of the Puritans to its legitimate conclusion.

Like all religious persecutors, when they are in the past, the hanging of witches in Massachusetts had no occasion! that is, it was seen to be wholly without justification. Mr. Nevins attributes "the whole of the unfortunate delusion" to a special neighborhood insanity, a wholesale delusion. It was like a cyclone that sweeps over the land, or a conflagration that wipes out of existence a whole section of a city. We do not realize the awful events which is being enacted around us. Only when the storm has passed and we awake to a thorough comprehension of the calamity, do we appreciate its force; thus the burst of its raging seems almost sudden. Such, I judge, was substantially the case with our ancestors two centuries ago. They did not realize, during the summer of 1678, the enthusiasm of the tragedy they were enacting.

Any more did the Puritans realize the awfulness of their acts? The writer has already quoted answers: "They believed that they were casting out devils; and that any measures, however severe, were justified." Their language after the storm was passed and a calm had settled over the land, implies as much, and more, that the full realization of what they had been doing dawned on them only after all was over: "We of the present generation," concludes Mr. Nevins, "shudder at the intolerant persecution and superstition of our ancestors. Let us do nothing to encourage bigotry, or allow foolish considerations to blind us. It is well to review the narrow or unjust acts of our ancestors sometimes, as we would place a beacon on some shoal or reef where a ship has been wrecked, to warn others of the danger."

But it is one thing to "shudder at the intolerant persecution and superstition" of others, and quite another to avoid everything of the kind ourselves. The Puritans were far worse than other men. They had many sterling qualities; and doubtless the most of them felt themselves bound to do just as they did do. There was the divine law against witchcraft, and there was the civil law making it the duty of the Colony to enforce the divine law. It was the law that put to death the "witches." When a number is executed by the law, nobody in particular seems responsible for it; it is the law that does it. And so the Puritans reasoned; they only enforced the law. But why did they not change the law? Simply because when the occasion arises there is no mood for it. And this points a moral, namely, that such laws may result in persecution; ought never to be made; and if made, ought to be repealed when used as in the above case, and in the arrest and prosecution of men for the exercise of the rights of mind and conscience in matters of religion.

Not all the Puritans were honest; not all acted conscientiously. The most responsible writers do not hesitate to charge that the first accusations of witchcraft were made maliciously, and for personal reasons. Thus the law, whether made good, or at least harmless, because the indifference of personal malice was the same. The same thing is true of our present Sunday laws; in several of the States they have been made, not as they were designed to be, the conservators of "public morals," but the instruments of religious persecution. The sacred rights of citizens ought not to be thus dependent upon the whim, the prejudices, or the enmities of their fellows. Civil governments are instituted to secure to the individuals the inalienable rights which they may be the state of mind of those in power. It is a vital part of the political creed of this commonwealth a Gibraltar of defense against oppression. If prejudice denies justice in the lower courts, if the law is right, the higher courts can reverse the wrong; but the higher courts cannot secure to individual men that which the lower courts deny.
