One argument advanced in support of Sunday laws is that—

the Nation can not be preserved without religion, nor religion without the Sabbath, nor the Sabbath without laws; therefore, Sabbath laws are enacted by the right of self-preservation; not in violation of liberty, but for its protection.

This is plausible, but none the less fallacious. A like argument might be made to justify State support, or patronage, of religion; for instance: "The Nation can not be preserved without religion, nor religion without general Christian education; nor can such education be given to all unless the State does it; therefore, the State should teach religion for its own preservation. The State teaches religion by the right of self-preservation, not in violation of liberty, but for its protection." This is substantially the argument used by Emperor William I., in 1878, when in writing to the Marquis of Roon, he said:—

This denial of God goes hand in hand with social democracy, and here in the midst of peace we have arrived at a condition which the French Revolution reached at its most horrible stage, i. e., the abolition of God.

A few months later, alluding to the revival of faith in God which he conceived to be politically essential, the Emperor wrote:—

A beginning has been made through the new law, but the shattered foundations of the Church must now be strengthened.

With William I. the question of religious education of the people was purely political; it was for the preservation of the State; and why was not the argument just as good and just as valid when applied to the matter of religious education as when applied to Sunday laws?

The same reasoning is in Russia used against that most exemplary of Russian sects, the Stundists. In the Finsk Tidskrift for February, B. Estlander says:—

The situation of the Stundists became very much embarrassed in the seventies, when the nihilistic propaganda was on the increase. In 1884 the Bishop of Mobileff reported to the Synod that "the influence of the Stundists is very injurious to the people's religious faith." "They create discontent among the people against the existing authorities of the State."

Of course the State had to defend itself against a people that threatened its very existence; hence, the repressive measures adopted against those very pious and inoffensive people.

Self-preservation of the State also is urged by William II. in justification of his Educational bill.* In May, 1889, the Emperor said:—

That the school may be made serviceable throughout its various grades, in working against the spread of socialistic and communistic doctrines, is a thought with which I have been long occupied.

The school must endeavor to impress the conviction on young minds that the teachings of Social Democratism are not only contrary to the law of God and Christian principle, but are unpractical, and dangerous in the sequences to which they lead, both as regards the individual and society.

For these reasons the Emperor has been lending his influence and power to bring about a closer union between the Church and the school. His object is not religious but civil; for while the authority of the Church over the school is largely increased, it is only for political purposes, and with political results. Says the Countess Von Krockow, in the Independent:—

Whatever success has been achieved by re-enforcing the authority of the school with that of the Church, has been a success strictly and purely political. Neither religion nor morality has been conclusively advanced by the plan. Morality is no higher than in countries where the Church is independent of the State; and all lay interest in Church affairs is even sunk below that which is found in States with secularized schools.

And again, the same writer says that the idea is to enforce the injunctions of His Majesty, to purify the school of unacceptable teachers, and to impress upon every child born in the kingdom the fear of God (Gottes furcht; "fear," mind you; these military statesmen say nothing of love). The influence and power which is lent to the two chief churches of the country is lent upon the assumption that both are inimical to Democratism.

Prussia calculates that Evangelicals and Catholics will march divided, but strike united.

The scheme is to give the churches, Protestant and Catholic, control of the schools; the churches in return to give the empire the full weight of their influence in opposition to Socialism, which in the Emperor's view would mean nothing short of social anarchy; hence, to his mind, the measure is one of self-preservation for the empire, and so, fully justified in the very nature of things.

Something of the extent of the power given to the Protestant and Catholic churches, may be estimated from the fact that there are 66 per cent. of schools with only one teacher, and the Emperor proposes to give the priests and clergymen the right of withholding from teachers the privilege of giving religious instruction, that is to say, the right to be teachers at all, for a "teacher publicly branded as unfit for giving such instruction becomes done for," as a German writer has expressed it.

Thus the power of the Church over the school is to be made absolute for civil purposes; the Church and the State in Germany are to be more firmly united than before, but only for political reasons. Is it, however, any the less a union of Church and State because the State, and not the Church, is to be the chief beneficiary?

Another point of interest in this matter is the fact that in this more perfect union of Church and State, the school being the connecting link, the point of contact, the union of the State is not with a single sect, but with several. But does that make it less a union of Church and State? In this country those who demand what they call a union, not of Church and State, but of religion and the State, are wont to define a union of Church and State as a union of a sect and the State; but is it any less a union when the whole body of believers, as nearly as may be, are made one of the parties to the union?—Certainly not; on the contrary it adds to what is at best an adulterous union, the wickedness of polygamy.

The history of the first union of Christianity and the State, in the Roman Empire under Constantine, is simply repeating itself in Germany. William II., like Constantine I., is seeking to strengthen his empire by uniting, for a common purpose and a common cause, all the discordant elements of religion. The result will be that he will either bind the German Church as a whole, Catholic and Protestant, to his chariot wheels, or else the churches, having learned their united strength will use it to enslave the civil power as did the Papacy in the Dark Ages. Will this country learn wisdom from the history of the past, and from the living object lessons of the present, and instead of uniting Church and State under the misleading name of a union of religion and the State, make still wider the separation which has hiterto been maintained between them by our national Constitution?

* Since this article was put in type the Educational bill has been withdrawn, but only because of the strength of the opposition to it. The conflict between Monarchy and Socialism has not just the same; and the protection of the Church. For the present that particular measure has been defeated, but as long as the principle that civil government may, for practical purposes, champion religious institutions and enforce religious dogmas and observances, is admitted, the danger will remain. The control is probably only begun in Germany. A truce has been declared; the real battle may come later.
