THE Aldermen of this city do not propose to be left behind in the mad rush to do honor to Sunday if they can help it; and so on the 5th inst., the Board gravely determined to do no business "on any Monday that falls on Sunday." The action was on this wise: The Consolidation act sets forth that the assessment rolls must be received by the Board on the first Monday of July. This year the Fourth falls on this particular first Monday. In order to get around the difficulty the following resolution was offered and soberly (in the sense of gravely) adopted:—

Resolved, That the State Legislature be and is hereby respectfully requested to pass an amendment to said act enabling the Board of Aldermen, whenever the first Monday of July shall fall upon a Sunday or legal holiday, to meet at noon on the following day for the purpose of receiving said assessment rolls.

And thus another "safeguard" has been thrown around "our American Sabbath."
