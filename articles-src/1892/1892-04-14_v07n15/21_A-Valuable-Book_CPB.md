THE most valuable book which has recently come to the notice of the writer is "The Two Republics," by Alonzo T. Jones. Of course, the book deals with Rome and the United States. There have been other republics, but these are pre-eminently the two republics of all history—Rome in ancient times, the United States in modern; Rome in the Old World, the United States in the new; Rome, a republic in name, a despotism in fact, the United States, "a Government of the people, for the people, and by the people," in its inception, but with its history only partially made, and its story not yet fully told. What the finale of that story is likely to be is not stated in Mr. Jones' book, and yet the reader is scarcely left in doubt upon the subject.

The book contains nearly nine hundred pages, and is divided into twenty-eight chapters; and the reader will naturally divide it into three parts, first that treating of Rome, second that devoted to the great apostasy of the Christian Church resulting in the Papacy, and third the influences now at work having a tendency to produce a like result in our own country, and in the not distant future.

From the first chapter to the last paragraph, "The Two Republics" is not only readable, but it is intensely interesting, presenting, as it does, not disconnected historical facts, but a connected story of the development of the Papacy, with the moral of every step so plainly pointed out that every one can see just the bearing that it had upon the final overthrow of liberty of conscience. And not only so, but the principles are made to stand out in such bold relief that one wonders why it is that they have been so imperfectly understood, and so little appended.

The persistent efforts to bring about what some are pleased to call a union of religion and the State in this Republic, gives an added interest and point to this book that it could not otherwise have. Indeed, it is safe to say that but for so-called National Reform the book never would have been written. But it has been written none too soon; and now that it has been published, it should be given the widest possible circulation. No one can carefully and candidly read "Two Republics" and not be convinced that a very grave danger threatens civil and religious liberty in this country. The book ought to be placed in the hands of hundreds of thousands of thinking men and women, and it ought to be done speedily.
