# Uncertainties Log: v07n15 (1892-04-14)

## General Notes

This OCR file was generally clear and legible. The following items were noted:

### Page 1, Editorial Notes
- Line reference "summer of 1892" in Nevins quotation appears to be an error in the original (should likely be "1692" referring to the Salem witch trials), but transcribed exactly as printed.

### Page 4, "Uniting with Rome" article
- Author attribution: The article ends with "R. C. PORTER" - identified as R. C. Porter based on the signature.

### Page 5, "Legislative Religion at Washington"
- Reference to "P. D. Widner" - spelling uncertain, could be "Widener" but transcribed as printed.

### Page 5, Footnote
- The footnote about the Educational bill being withdrawn appears mid-sentence and is slightly unclear in its placement, but transcribed as it appears in the original.

### Page 7, National Religious Liberty Association section
- Address listing shows "43 BORN ST." - this appears to be "BOND ST." based on the masthead, but OCR shows "BORN" so transcribed as appears, though likely a printing artifact.

### General OCR Quality
- The OCR was of good quality overall
- Standard abbreviations and punctuation preserved as printed
- Block quotes properly indicated with standard formatting
- All author initials clearly visible and identified

## Resolution
All uncertainties were resolved through context, cross-referencing with the masthead, and careful reading. No significant ambiguities remain that would affect the accuracy of the transcription.
