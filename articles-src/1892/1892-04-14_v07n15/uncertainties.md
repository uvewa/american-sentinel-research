### Article 08: Editorial Notes (page 7, left column)
- **Page 7, Left column, Atlanta railroad switching item**
  - **Second pass completed:** Yes

  - **Second pass completed:** Yes
  - **Confidence:** LOW — This article's text is extremely difficult to read accurately. Many sentences appear garbled or incomplete. The overall argument can be followed but exact wording is uncertain in numerous places.

- **Page 8, Left column**
  - **Second pass completed:** Yes

### Article 14: A Valuable Book (page 8, right column)
- **Page 8, Right column**
  - **Second pass completed:** Yes

## Overall Assessment

The scan quality for this issue is moderate. Pages 1-6 (articles 01-07, previously transcribed) have better readability than pages 7-8. The editorial notes and shorter items on pages 7-8 are printed in smaller type and are more challenging to OCR accurately. Several articles in this batch (08, 09, 13) have LOW confidence ratings due to garbled text and unclear sentence boundaries. A higher-resolution scan would significantly improve accuracy for these articles.
