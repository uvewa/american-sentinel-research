In the Christian Statesman, of March 26, I find the following statement taken from the Catholic Universe:—

Rev. Wilbur F. Crafts, the senior editor of the Christian Statesman, Pittsburg, evidently does all within his power to establish lines of common action in which Catholics and Protestants as Christians and Americans can join. It is a worthy programme, and our best wishes to our good friend in it.

What are the "lines of common action in which Catholics and Protestants as Christians and Americans can join," as presented by Mr. Crafts through the columns of the Christian Statesman? It will be readily observed by the readers of the Statesman that the most prominent line followed by the editor is a demand for religious legislation, especially compulsory Sunday observance.

How have Protestants come to observe Sunday as the Sabbath? Let our Catholic friends answer:—

It is worth its while to remember that this observance of the Sabbath—in which, after all, the only Protestant worship consists,—not only has no foundation in the Bible, but it is in flagrant contradiction with its letter, which commands rest on the Sabbath, which is Saturday. It was the Catholic Church which, by the authority of Jesus Christ, has transferred this rest to the Sunday in remembrance of the resurrection of our Lord. Thus the observance of Sunday by the Protestants is an homage they pay, in spite of themselves, to the authority of the church.—*Paris Talk about the Protestantism of To-day, page 213.*

In the light of these facts it is easy to see why Catholics can unite with Protestants to enforce Sunday observance. It is also plain that it is not because the Catholic Church is changing her faith and adopting the Protestant principles of the Bible and the Bible alone as her rule of faith, but because on this line Protestants are adopting Catholic principles. I am not surprised that a Catholic editor should give expression to such words of commendation of the course being pursued by Protestants on this line; but that a Protestant editor can regard such remarks as complimentary is passing strange. Surely the time has come to inquire what is the character of this professedly Christian system with which Protestantism is about forming a coalition to advance the religion of Jesus of Nazareth.

It is a system of self-exaltation seeking worldly wealth and honor and power. "A system which, pretending to be that of Christ, suppressed the Bible, extinguished knowledge, locked up the human mind, amused it with the most ludicrous baubies, and granted official licenses to commit all species of crime and impurity." A system that, having departed from the plain word of God and adopted tradition in many of its observances, formed a creed and called upon the State to enforce it upon all its subjects under penalty of death. Under this system millions of Christians were put to death in the most cruel manner that it was possible to invent.

Such is the system that now praises a Protestant editor for doing "all within his power to establish lines of common action in which Catholics and Protestants as Christians and Americans can join." And this is not strange since these "lines" contain the very principles that have made this system the iniquitous thing that it is. To those who think that the religion of Christ would be advanced by forming a union with such a system on the lines of compulsory religious observance, I would submit the following facts concerning the character of the religion of Christ:—

Unlike all other founders of a religious faith, Christ had no selfishness, no desire of dominance; and his system, unlike all other systems of worship, was bloodless, boundlessly beneficent, inexpressibly pure, and, most marvelous of all, went to break all bonds of body and soul; and to cast down every temporal and spiritual tyranny. It was a system calculated for the whole wide universe; adapted to embrace men of all climes, all ages, all ranks of life, or intellect; for the rich and for the poor; for the savage and the civilized; for the fool and the philosopher; for man, woman, and child; which, recognizing the grand doctrine, that "God made of one blood all the nations of the earth, represented the Almighty as the Father, and all men as brethren born to one universal love, to the same inalienable rights, to the same eternal hope.

He himself was the living personification of his principles. Demolishing the most inveterate prejudices of men, by appearing a poor man among the poor; by tearing away from aristocratic pride and priestly insolence their masks of most orthodox assurance; by proclaiming that the truth which he taught should make all men free; by declaring that the Gentiles lorded it over and oppressed one another, but that it should not be so with his followers; by pulling down with indignation spiritual pride in high places, and calling the poor and the afflicted his brethren, and the objects of his tenderest regard, he laid the foundation of civil and religious freedom, of mental power growing out of unrestrained mental energies, and of love and knowledge co-equal in extension with the world. This perfect freedom of universal man he guarded by great everlasting principles, intelligible to the mind and the conscience of the whole human race; and on which men in all countries might found institutions most consonant to their wants. By declaring that wherever two or three were met together in his name, he would be in the midst of them, he cut off forever every claim, the most specious, of priestly dominance; and by expressing his unqualified and indignant abhorrence of every desire of his disciples to call down fire from heaven upon his enemies, or to forbid those to preach and work miracles in his name who did not immediately follow him, and conform to their notion, he left to his Church a light more resplendent than that of the sun, on the subject of non-interference with the sacred liberty and prerogatives of conscience.

God forbid that the Protestant Church should ever step aside from these pure principles of the gospel of Christ, and following the traditions of Rome, unite with her in demanding legislation in support of her holy days. The religion of love brought to the world through Jesus Christ, seeks no enactment of human legislators to give it success. Its power is from above. Trusting in that power though walking the narrow way in humility, under difficulties, every day's march is a march of victory, and her steady advance is the advance of a conqueror.

Entering the political arena, she separates from this power, lays aside her robes of victory, and like Samsun who when shorn of his locks fell weak and helpless into the hands of his enemies, the Philistines, so the Church of Christ, thus separated from the source of her power, falls powerless into the hands of her great foe antichrist.

Let every true Protestant still protest against the traditions of the Church of Rome, and in harmony with the teachings of Christ still plead that the Church and the State be kept forever separate.
