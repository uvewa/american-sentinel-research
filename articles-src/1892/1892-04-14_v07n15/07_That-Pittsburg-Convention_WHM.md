# That Pittsburg Convention.

THE National Reform and American Sabbath Union socialists, recently, the second annual convention of Sabbath, or more properly, Sunday-law societies, was referred to in these columns last week. This convention represented the Sabbath Union, and of course indorses and adopts its methods, with but a good deal of energy added.

That Pittsburg meeting was not large, but the morale was, from a National Reform standpoint, excellent, and the spirit that pervaded it could but impress the observer with the fact that the men who are pushing the Sunday movement in the western part of the Keystone State, though rough, make amends to the nature of their work, are very real in their convictions.

Protestant influence is strong in Pittsburg and Allegheny City, and where the civil power is strong in the exercise of that influence, as is the case in Pittsburg. The Sunday laws, Americans say, are, for the most part, theoretically very fair in the Decalogue, and especially is this true of the United, and the better Protestantism. For this reason it is that you hear less than some others about the "evil Sabbath," and hear their demand for Sunday laws urgently upon the divine law, as rather undesired. This was very noticeable in the Pittsburg meeting.

AGAINST the whole border of the Columbian, the enforcement of the "Sabbath" at the World's Fair on Sunday. Only one man in the attendance, who was not officially, as I suggest, the only effective man, or so regarded.

In the statement of the work done by the Association during the year, the chairman, Rev. Dr. Robinson, of Allegheny City, said that an attempt had been made to repeal the "Sabbath" laws of the State, but that it had failed. The Association, he stated, had caused "1,500 letters to be written to the members of the Legislature asking that our Sabbath laws be not repealed, or they may be repealed." How excited they are may be judged from one that even their execution, concerning one of them, that even a man is sometimes imprisoned under them; and the same thing, if Mr. Robinson and his co-workers could control affairs, would happen still more frequently.

A good deal of stress was laid upon the fact that they only asked that men be required to obey the law, and that the law had not come down from Penn's time. But both of these have been put forth in justification of persecution in every age. The Papists only imprisoned and burned those whom they burned already; show the laws, some of which were even more severely enforced. A man was imprisoned in vain; and yet those very men, who in colonial times sent Roger Williams out to an oppressive Sunday law, as they say because a law had permitted it. The very men who died by the fagot and the rack and a law being enforced; law like this one of old, a law must stand, not upon its age, nor upon the fact of its not being enforced on its merits.

MR. CRAFTS is important. He adopted what he called a "Sabbath Reform," in Pittsburg, many years ago, and the spirit that pervades naturally adopted him because of his "jingo" methods. He does what he can in the West. Three he gathered around him, and he never can tell how well himself whom he has been able to use to accomplish a share of his purpose.

MR. CRAFTS is fertile in expedients, and though after organizing the American Sabbath Union, the control of it was wrested from him, and he himself apparently dropped, he organized, in Pittsburgh, of the Union, in Philadelphia, December last, a convention of his own, and gathered around a following larger than before, with which he can do, and doubtless will do, just as he has done with the old Christian Statesmen and returned it to Pittsburg. The energy of the individual accounts of the energy of its individual activity of the Western Pennsylvania section.

CRAFTS' intentional and impartially distributed to the account of the spirit of intolerance that pervaded the Pittsburg convention. What this spirit of intolerance as it exists in Pittsburg to-day, is a circular to the present editor of the *Statesman*, and it is to like its creator that there is no mistaking either its origin or its purpose.

The purpose of the Western Pennsylvania Sabbath Association is clearly to enforce upon all people the Sabbath idea of Sunday; not by educating the individual conscience, by the light of the divine science, but by enforcing the law of the state, by means of fines appealing to the pockets of those who refuse to observe the day of rest, not by natural suasion, but by human customs.

The methods of work adopted, not only by the Pittsburg Saturday, because by the National Reform colors of whatever canvasses every citizen in this country, are both easy and effective. Formerly they circulated petitions for individual signatures.

According to the newspapers the name of Quay has for years been prominent with that lack of political conscience; but now a comparison has been found fit. In reference to Sunday at the World's Fair. He is reported as being much shocked at the idea of opening the Fair on Sunday; and as saying, "Not and do I favor it? If no possible good could be accomplished by keeping the Fair open on Sunday, other than increase of revenue, and the opinion of those who are opposed to its opening should be respected. I am personally in favor of keeping the Fair open on Sunday."

Mr. Quay is a politician from Pennsylvania, which is a new thing. The Pennsylvania State is now very largely religious. The religious temperament, which works at all against religious laws at the present time, would certainly a grave error of judgment, politically speaking. The era of religion in politics is now well under way.
