ACCORDING to the Mail and Express the street-car companies of Chicago will not take any part in the agitation of the Sunday-closing of the World's Fair, either for or against. This destroys a sensational point made by Rev. Mr. Stevenson, in a late hearing before the Senate Committee on the Quadro-Centennial, in which he declared that a representative of the Chicago street railroads had said that fifty thousand dollars would be spent, if need be, to compass Sunday opening.
