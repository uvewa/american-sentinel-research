THE Freedom of Worship bill before the New York Legislature was "killed" in the House on the 6th inst. by a close vote. Mr. Connolly stated that the object of the bill was to permit the observance of the ceremonies of the Catholic Church in the House of Refuge on Randall's Island. The Catholic Church demanded this "as a right."

General Busted said that he was opposed to the bill under any circumstances. "It is an un-American bill," he said. "It's not the State's business to enforce any form of worship on anybody. I believe the Church and the State should be kept apart, and that religious bills should be kept out of the Legislature. State interference with religion never did any good."
