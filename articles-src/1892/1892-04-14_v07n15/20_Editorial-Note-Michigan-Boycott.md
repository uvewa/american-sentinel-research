THE Methodist Record, of Grand Rapids, Michigan, advises this Nation, through the President, to withhold its money from the management of the Exposition, if the gates of the Fair are not "closed on the Sabbath." The Michigan Sabbath Watchman, the American Sabbath Union organ for the State of Michigan, is more ardent, and says:—

The Watchman advises more than this. It asks this Nation to withhold from this Exposition, its Christian, moral, and patriotic manhood, with what money such persons would otherwise carry to the Fair, if the gates are not closed on Sabbaths.

This is simply advising Sunday keepers, by a system of boycotting, to coerce this Nation into the observance of Sunday. Who can not see that this spirit which thus seeks to carry its measures by threats and intimidations, will erelong say that no man can buy or sell, save he who keeps Sunday, and is a pretender to religious piety, however hollow the pretension? Read Rev. 13:16, 17.
