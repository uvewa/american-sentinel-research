# Does God Justify the Means?

Every argument advanced in support of Sunday laws is that—

God cannot be worshiped without religion; or religion without the Sabbath; nor the Sabbath without the observance of Sunday; therefore the State should enforce the observance of Sunday by law, not for God's sake, or for religion, but for its own sake of humanity.

This is plausible, but seize the less fallacious. A like argument might be made in behalf of State aid to any denomination, for instance: "The Nation can be preserved without morality; nor religion without general Christian education for our youth against Bible-teaching, and unless the State does it; therefore, the State should provide for this religious preservation. The State teaches religion for the safety of self-preservation, not in the sake of Divinity, but for the state's own sake." This is substantially the argument, and it was the argument used by the German monarchy to the Marquis of Reno, he said in a democracy, and here in the midst of peace we have a state of affairs not unlike the State of the precedent in its most barbarous form, i.e., the civil government enforcing religion.

A beginning has been made through the new law, but the admitted foundations of the Church must rest on principle.

With William I. the question of religious education of the people was merely a question of politics. It is only one of its components, and it is not a question of Church and State; and why was not the argument as applicable to one as to the other, applied to the matter of religious education, precisely as it is applied to Sunday rest?

The same reasoning as in Russia is used, against that not applying to Sabbath laws, the Stundists, the Penal Fraternity the Flogging, & Rabbinical sects.

The situation of the Stundists became very embarrassing for the Government, and evidently the Bishop of Mobler reported to the Synod that influence of the dissensions in the direction of the prompt religious faith. The repressive measures were against the priests against the criminal codes.

Of course the State had to defend itself against a people that it deemed itself in its very existence; hence, the repressive measures adopted against those very pious and inoffensive people.

Self-preservation of the State is also in-

voked by William II. in establishing, by the "new method of petitioning," namely, by command understated. Christians, Sunday, Young Peoples Christian Temperance, Woman's Christian Temperance, Endeavor, Young Peoples Christian Endeavor Society, and the Colleges of the ministry—as the voice of the entire membership. Then we come back to the fact that these gentlemen would not take interest enough to sign a petition unless they knew something about it. But we know next to nothing of this motion and its scope except that they knew, led to regard the individual and so declare.

For these reasons the Rappswyer has been led to abandon the thought of using violence and to substitute means and more in the right direction. The Sunday and the holiday question is not about a closer union between the Church and State but it concerns first of all religion, not civil; for while the authorship of the civil Church, or the Church as its legally recognized, it is only for political purposes that would coincide a graver error of religious political, with, political, result. The era of religion in politics is now well taken care of. w. H. M.
