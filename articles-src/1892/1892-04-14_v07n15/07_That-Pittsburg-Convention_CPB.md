The Western Pennsylvania Sabbath Association, so-called, the second annual meeting of which, in Pittsburg, on the 29th ult, was referred to in these columns last week, is an auxiliary of the American Sabbath Union, and of course indorses the principles of the parent association, and adopts its methods, but with a good deal of energy added.

The Pittsburg meeting was not large, but its morale was, from a National Reform standpoint, excellent; and the spirit that pervaded it could but impress the observer with the fact that the men who are pushing the Sunday movement in the western part of the Keystone State, though very much mistaken as to the nature of their work, are very much in earnest.

Presbyterian influence is strong in Western Pennsylvania; and, so far as the writer could judge, it is strong in the so-called Sabbath Association. Presbyterians are, for the most part, theoretically very loyal to the Decalogue, and especially is this true of the United, and the Reformed Presbyterians. For this reason they say less than some others about the "civil Sabbath," and base their demand for Sunday laws squarely upon the divine law, as they understand it. This was very noticeable in the Pittsburg meeting.

ALMOST the whole burden of the Convention was the enforcement of the "Sabbath" laws of the State, and the closing of the World's Fair on Sunday. Only one speaker seemed to discern the real difficulty, and suggest the only effective remedy. His words are quoted on another page.

In his statement of the work done by the Association during the year, the chairman, Rev. Dr. Robinson, of Allegheny City, said that an attempt had been made to repeal the "Sabbath" laws of the State, but that it had failed. The Association, he stated, had caused "1,500 letters to be written to the members of the Legislature asking that our Sabbath laws be not repealed, for they are most excellent." How excellent they are may be judged from the fact that even conscientious observers of the seventh day have been fined and imprisoned under them; and the same thing is liable to occur again, and certainly will occur if Mr. Robinson and his co-workers are successful in maintaining the law.

A 6000 deal of stress was laid upon the fact that they only asked that men be required to obey the law, and that the law had come down from Penn's time. But both of these pleas have been put forth in justification of persecution in every age. The Papists only demanded that the heretics whom they burned should obey the laws, some of which were even more venerable than is the Sunday law of Pennsylvania; and yet these very men, who in Pennsylvania are insisting upon obedience to an oppressive Sunday law, as they say because it is a law, honor the memories of men who died by the fagot and the rack for disobeying law. Can they not see that a law must stand, not upon its age, nor upon the fact of its existence, but upon its merits?

MR. CRAFTS is an important person in so-called "Sabbath Reform," in Pittsburg. When the American Sabbath Union virtually dropped him because of his "jingo" methods, he took Mr. Greeley's advice and went West. There he gathered around him a goodly number of better men than himself whom he has been able to use to good advantage in furthering his purposes.

MR. CRAFTS is fertile in expedients, and though after organizing the American Sabbath Union, the control of it was wrested from him, and he himself systematically snubbed at the annual meeting of the Union, in Philadelphia, December 1890, in less than a year he had gathered around him a following larger than before, and had by a coup d'etat captured the Christian Statesman and removed it to Pittsburg. The energy of the individual accounts in no small measure for the activity of the Western Pennsylvania Sabbath Association, as does also Mr. Crafts' intolerant and inquisitorial disposition account very largely for the spirit of intolerance that pervaded the Pittsburg Convention. "Sabbath Reform," so-called, as it exists in Pittsburg to-day, is a creation of the present editor of the Statesman, and it is so like its creator that there is no mistaking either its origin or its purpose.

The purpose of the Western Pennsylvania Sabbath Association is clearly to secure a more general and rigid observance of Sunday; not by educating the individual, not by appealing to the conscience, but by enforcing the law of the State, and by means of fines appealing to the pockets of those who refuse to observe the day set apart, not by divine authority, but by human custom.

The methods of work adopted, not only by the Pittsburg Sunday boomers, but by the National Reform cohorts of whatever name everywhere in this country, are both easy and effective. Formerly they circulated petitions for individual signatures.

Now Mr. Crafts urges all to adopt the "new method of petitioning," namely, by vote and indorsement. Churches, Sunday schools, Young Men's Christian Associations, Woman's Christian Temperance Unions, Young Woman's Christian Temperance Unions, Young Peoples Christian Endeavor Societies, etc., etc., indorse the petition by vote, then the officers send it in as the voice of the entire membership. In this way very many are counted who would not take interest enough to sign a petition, and equally as many are counted more than once, for in these days of multiplied associations there are few who do not belong to more than one organization. This method is entirely worthy of its author, whether it is understood as originating with the editor of the Statesman, or with the father of all deception and double dealing.

ANOTHER method of petitioning, highly recommended by the Statesman, is by personal letters to members of Congress and of Legislatures. Our law makers are to be given no rest until because of weariness if for no other reason they yield to the demands made upon them in behalf of the Sunday Sabbath. Truly, those who are engineering the Sunday-law campaign are an exemplification of the correctness of the conclusion of the wise man: "Lo, this only have I found, that God hath made man upright; but they have sought out many inventions." And in it all they think that they are doing God service. What a terrible mistake!
