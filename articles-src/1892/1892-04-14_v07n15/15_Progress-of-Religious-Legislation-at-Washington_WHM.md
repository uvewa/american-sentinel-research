THE city of Washington has been for some weeks, and still is, beseiged by "National Reformers." The committees which have in charge the religious measures,—the bill to forbid expositions opening on Sunday, to which the Government has made appropriations; and the Sunday law for the District of Columbia,—have had these measures made more prominent to them than any other matter presented for the consideration of Congress. Every senator and representative has been sounded as to their individual opinion on these questions by the New York Mail and Express and Independent, and the result has been followed up by persistent personal interview, until now the advocates of legislative religion are beginning to know their political friends; those whom they can use, whom cajole, whom intimidate; and now the progress of political religion is marked by all the organized form of a regular political campaign, and accompanied by all its accessories of wire-pulling, shrewd legislative methods, and appeal to personal interest and reputation. It is the fixed purpose of those who are attempting to close the World's Fair on Sunday, by congressional action, to block legislation upon the World's Fair, if possible, unless their requests are complied with. Their fervor upon the question is rising almost to the height of a mania. Hundreds of thousands of petitions are being sent in to congressmen asking that no appropriation be made unless the Sunday-closing provision be inserted, so that every issue of the Congressional Record shows a large proportion of the petitions presented to be for that purpose. So many are they that even the Christian Statesman is satisfied, and cries that at last the petitions are coming. The committeness are overwhelmed with them and are asking, are there none on the other side? None which show that a few at least of our constituents understand that this is not a matter which properly calls for congressional legislation?

When congressmen yield to the insistency of these mistaken religionists it will be against their own private convictions, in the majority of cases.

THE churches are, of course, being used to their utmost in the effort to mold public opinion, and reach the ears, also, of the church-going congressmen. On Sunday, April 3, at the First Congregational Church, Rev. H. H. George, Mrs. M. E. Catlin, and the lady secretary of the petition branch of the Sunday-closing department of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, spoke on the subject of the Sunday closing of the World's Fair and the efforts to attain it by the help of the Congress of the United States. Mr. George repeated the usual appeal for the laboring man, and for respect to the demands of this Christian Nation, of which three-quarters, as he claimed, were professing Christians. He inveighed against those who oppose legal and legislative action on these questions most bitterly and intensely, saying that the time was coming when that small minority which is dissatisfied with the present Sunday laws will have to leave this country and go where there is no Sabbath, and there live with a continental Sunday, and die there, and go to the place where they belong.

The place where they belonged seemed so definite in his own mind that it apparently did not occur to him to elaborate any further, so his hearers filled that out according to their individual tastes.

Mr. George had evidently read Justice Brewer's presentation from the Supreme Bench, of the history of the establishment of religion in this country, for he coincided with him as to the religious significance of the discovery of this continent, and said that Columbus took the New World not only in the name of the Queen of Spain, but also set up the cross and took it in the name of Jesus Christ as well.

Mrs. Catlin told of the petitions which she had received and transmitted to Congress during the month of March, amounting to one hundred and eighty-six thousand, asking that Congress take measures to close the World's Fair on Sunday. The lady secretary gave complete statistics of their whole petition work.

IT IS REMARABLE how every bill to license the liquor traffic always has the sop of a Sunday-closing clause thrown in. Every session of Congress sees three or more of these offered for the District of Columbia. The last one is a high license, calculated to make whisky selling a gilt-edged business, and highly moral, because in the hands of a select class of Sunday-keeping Christian saloon keepers. When Satan makes his final visit to this world and announces himself a strict Sunday observer, what a cry there will be that he is not so black as he was painted!
