# Comments on Dr. Parkhurst's Sermon.

COMMENTS upon a recent sermon by Dr. Parkhurst of this city, an editorial writer for the *Sabbath Recorder* says that:—

Dr. Parkhurst believes that the government of the city of New York is one of the matters upon which it is proper for the minister to take action, and a revival of religion in his church does, and the result has been that recent experience will be to the advancement of righteousness, which is to say the kingdom of God, and does the conversion of a man to Christ.

And it arises from the connection that the editorial writer, who is also a minister, agrees with the Doctor.

How any minister can entertain such views is beyond our view. The kingdom of God on earth is simply, as the apostle Paul declared, the gospel of God to all people for his name." Now, then, the government of the city of New York, or any other city or nation, can never "one of the matters which concern the kingdom of God as much as a revival of religion," is quite beyond the three, either the ultimate places upon which the National Reformers. One of two things is true, either the ultimate place upon the government of the city of New York is entirely too high, or that placed on the government of the city of New York is infinitely below what it ought to be.

"That displacement of a ring of politicians is always infinitely, and civility is like commandments; and as the displacement of dishonest and inefficient servants may be necessary. But the connection of 28 a man to Christ," is in effect to assert that temporal and civil things are of equal importance with eternal salvation.

That question was once asked, "What shall a man give in exchange for his soul?" Hitherto it has remained unanswered, let in the new light which now shines from the pulpit of the Doctor and the pen of the editorial writer, the answer is easy—get right politically. The Conservator himself could derive no means for the advancement of righteousness in the earth except by giving his Son, that through faith in him men might become righteous; but now it is discovered; and the "displacement of bad men" from

office stands on a par with the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ! What may we not look for next?

The Aldermen of this city do not propose to be left behind in the mad rush to do honor to Sunday if they can help it; and on the 5th inst., the Board gravely determined to do a fine business "on any Monday that fallen Sunday." The action was the Board's expression of opinion, and in the Board the opinion that it would also be a further act; and further, that forth that the assessment rolls must be received by the Board on the first Monday of July. This year the Fourth falls on this particular first Monday. In order to have the question the difficulty the Fourth celebration the resolution was offered and soberly (in the senate of gravity) adopted:—

*Resolved*, That the State Legislature be and is hereby requested to enact such legislation as shall enable said Board, of Aldermen, to meet to ask an enabling law the Board of Aldermen, to meet for the transaction of any business on Sunday or legal holier, to meet at once on the following day and the proposition was adopted.

And thus another "safeguard" has been thrown around "our American Sabbath."
