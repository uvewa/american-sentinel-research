THE Michigan Sabbath Watchman says it "feels called upon to say that the time has arrived when every Ministerial Association, Conference, General Conference, Synod, and Assembly, Sabbath School Convention, Epworth League Chapter, Christian Endeavor Society, Young Men's Christian Association, the Good Templars, Sons of Temperance, the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, the American Sabbath Union, and all other organizations effected for Sabbath observance should resolve and declare that if it is ultimately decided to open the gates of the Exposition on Sabbath, or to permit the sale of intoxicating liquors on the grounds, that the Exposition is absolutely unworthy of their respect, and that they will not patronize the Exposition in any way whatever."

Look at the list! What an array of religious organizations! And yet we are told that this movement for enforced Sunday observance is not for religious ends, and Sunday laws are not religious laws!
