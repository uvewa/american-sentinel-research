# Methodist Board and the World's Fair.

The Methodist Board, of Grand Rapids, Michigan, advises this Nation, through the President, to withold its money from the management of the Exposition, if the gates of the Fair are opened on "the Sabbath." The *Michigan Sabbath Watchman*, the American Sabbath Union organ for the State of Michigan, is more ardent, and says:—

The *Watchman* advises more than this. It asks this Nation is withdrawn from this Exposition, its exhibits, and its paid performers and all its interests. Fair, if the gates are not closed on Sabbath.

This is simply a method of demoralizing the masses, by a system of boycotting, to coerce this Nation into the observance of Sunday. Who can not see that this spirit which thus seeks to carry its measures by threats and intimidations, will ending up that

no man can buy or sell, save he who keeps Sunday, and is a promoter to religious piety, however hollow the pretension? Read Rev. 13:15, 17.
