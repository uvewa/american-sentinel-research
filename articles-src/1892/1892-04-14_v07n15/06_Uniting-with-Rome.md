# Uniting with Rome.

And again, the same writer says that the best counteracting means is to introduce into the public school an element of religious education, teaching of religion in the public school, and elementary religious instruction, for the State churches of the country is best upon the assumption that the people are religious, and will be religious.

The attempt to let in five churches, of Protestantism and Catholicism, and to control the worship of over one hundred millions of the empire the full weight of their influence, has been great enough, yet not in the Emperor's would mean nothing to him. They may be suppressed, that, the manners in case of emergency, does not permit of a full permitted, but are a full permitted in its very nature of things.

Something of that excess of the power given to the President and Catholic churchmen, of these the greater number, there are six per cent. of schools with this privilege, the right of the right of withholding from teachers the right of teaching, the German saying, that to say, the right to be left secure in his simple faith, the right to be quiet for giving and instruction beyond a state religion.

The attempt to forever of the Churches over the school is to be made secure the civil world and its end results. The union of the Church and the State in Germany are to be more firmly united. What, however, we have said, is this a union of Church and State? It is the union of Church and State, but a union, not of Church and State of an individual sect and the State as a whole of believers, as nearly as may be, are made one of the contrary it adds to what is at best an incomplete religious instruction.

The history of the first union of Christianity and the State, in the Roman Empire under Constantine, is simply repeating itself in Germany. William II., like Constantine I., is seeking to strengthen his empire by uniting, for a common purpose as a common union, and all the dormant interests of religion. The result will be that he will be called the head of the Church, as a whole, Catholics and Protestants, to his charted schools, or else the churches, with all their independent strength, will use it to enslave the civil power. The history of the old, and from the living object lessons of the present, and instead of uniting God and State under the misleading name of a union of religion and the State, make still wider the separation which has hitherto been maintained between their two natural Constitutions? p. r. b.
