# The Michigan Sabbath Watchman.

Mr. Crafts will still try to adopt the "new method of petitioning," namely, by command understated. Christians, Sunday Young Peoples Christian Temperance, Woman's Christian Temperance Endeavor, Young Peoples Christian Endeavor Society, and the Colleges of the ministry—as the voice of the entire membership. Then we come back to the fact that these gentlemen would not take interest enough to sign a petition unless they knew something about it. But we know next to nothing of this motion and its scope except that they knew, led to regard the individual and so declare.

For these reasons the *Rappswyer* has been led to abandon the thought of using violence and to substitute means and more in the right direction. The Sunday and the holiday question is not about a closer union between the Church and State but it concerns first of all religion, not civil; for while the authorship of the civil Church, or the Church as its legally recognized, it is only for political purposes that would coincide a graver error of religious political, with, political, result. The era of religion in politics is now well taken care of.

And such must be the verdict of every unprejudiced and candid mind. And along with the history of these colonies and of the early history, let us be reminded of the one in that time. The foundation was laid in a spirit and in a hope that was common to those of different things, and in the not distant future.

The *Michigan Sabbath* Watchman says in "editorial notes" that "The description of the paragraph, 'The Two Republics' is not only interesting, but instructive, and is of such as commanding, as it does, not disconnected and far separated facts bearing mainly upon the development of the Papacy, without the influence upon both church and state, that every one can see just the bearing and the result of every move in the direction of liberty of conscience. And not only on every one can see, but its fascination is such that when taken up, it is hard to lay down; and the question arises, How is it that they have been so unfortunately ignored in previous works?"

The persistent efforts to bring about a closer union between the State and religion and the State in this Republic should impel all liberty-loving Americans to know that it could not otherwise have come to pass to note that its full history of National Reformers the book had never come to our notice; and now that it has arrived that its time too soon; and now that it is here the issue is it could not have thus far been probably overlooked. Any one can now see it simply undeniable. Any one can now unprejudicedly and candidly read "The Two Republics" without being forced to see graver danger threatens religious liberty than the country has ever known. It ought to be placed in the hands of hundreds of thousands. It is a book that is greatly needed, and it ought to be given a speedy reading.

And such must be the verdict of every unprejudiced and candid observer. But civil law can never reach and revitalize the individual, and the persecuting qualities, can not be reduced, but rather intensified, by appeals to law. But the result must follow that it was so, and that was a manifested religious zeal, only made them more resolute in their course, just as the Puritans have done with the stolid sentiment, that the Pilgrims of the Puritans would have never prospered, just because they settled New England two hundred and seventy years ago. As for the Mormons, it is not likely that anybody ever heard of their raids, excepting always, of course, the President of Harvard College, which has several Mormon missions, will use in them in defenses of religion liberty; there are too many living witnesses of their intolerance.
