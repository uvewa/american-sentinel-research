# Legislative Religion at Washington.

The progress of the success gained from sharp legislative practice, in the Legislature of New York, where the Sunday-closing bill was carried through the Senate as the Quaker-Oats senators, and others advocating the bill to prohibit the Sunday opening of the Columbian Exposition, and its appropriation money, have forced the consideration of this measure, upon the Senate Committee on the Quadro-Centennial. The Committee has been compelled to give to them, to this Sunday closing discussion, in order to forestall the question, the question as an obstructive measure to prevent or hinder appropriation, necessary for the dignified success of the Exposition, taken conditional on Sunday closing. A clause has been inserted into a bill which reads, "That no exhibition or exhibit on the Exposition grounds open by Congress shall be opened on Sunday."

More, of Massachusetts, and in the Senate by Mr. Colquitt, of Georgia. In the Senate the bill was first referred to the Committee on Education and Labor; evidently, from the force of habit, as

this measure, has nevertheless been the father of or leading mover for many a Sunday bill in his character in the Senate. It has also been referred and is now in the possession of the Quadro-Centennial, of which Mr. Peffer is chairman. S. S. Gross, of its chairman, it is said that the Senate Committee on Appropriations will refuse to consider the question of appropriations for the World's Fair, unless the Sunday-closing clause is also a matter within the jurisdiction of the Committee. It is expected that the committee has complete jurisdiction over all bills and resolutions relating to governmental aid to the Columbian Exposition.

On March 31, the Senate Committee on Quadro-Centennial gave a hearing in the interest of Sunday closing at which the friends of the United States were represented. Among those who represented that the large amounts asked for are that they are appropriated for exhibitions of the United States Government at the Exposition were: Rev. H. H. George, for the National Reform Association; A. H. Lewis, for the Seventh-day Baptists; A. Rauschenbach, for the National Reform, representing the Brotherhood of the National Federation; E. T. Gillette, and legal reasons for the Sunday-closing of the Exposition; and J. C. Batty, who took for granted, evidently, as something he expressed, that this bill in the United States should not be opened. The Sunday appropriation money, might be passed and the Exposition is to be opened on the Sunday by resolution. Mr. Stevenson told the committee that 4,000,000 of church members had petitions for Sunday closing. He also stated that he had made the Centennial Exposition, at Philadelphia, the basis for closing, and that there was 18,000,000 of church members. He also stated that 200,000 of church members, about 84,000,000 of people in the United States in favor of closing of the Exposition, at Chicago. He also announced that the labor organizations favor closing as a moral support to the railway brakes, since, when he represented that there was petitioned for the closing of the Fair. He also said that the organizations that he represents had actually resolved to prohibit the Sunday running of interstate trains if the Fair was opened on Sunday. Mr. Stevenson the information that he had brought to influence the body that it was not in favor of closing the Exposition on Sunday, and to that extent the body of this organization expressed their willingness. Grace has given influence upon the congressional interference. Grace that, as said, Mr. F. H. Shepard, also Mrs. Bateham, of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union. A mass of petitions was also presented and among the petitions it was stated there was a large stockholders in a Chicago Corporation.

The committee to give further hearing upon the matter was adjourned with a desire for an impartial discussion of the whole question.

The hearing upon the Sunday-closing question, before the Senate Committee, also brought out a number of Sabbath, Christian and Sunday Reformers in Washington. Col. Elliot F. Shepard, and after giving a personal defense for the closing of the Exposition, was surprised that a man who is so many kinds of extreme, could at the same time be so courteous and graceful a gentleman, regarding the matter as his subject.

A good many of the States that have made an
