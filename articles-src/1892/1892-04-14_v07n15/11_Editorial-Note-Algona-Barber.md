AMONG those "under conviction" at Algona as a result of the revival in that city, is a barber who has informed the church of his choice, that if they will close the other barber shops of the place on Sunday, he will join their church and close his shop. His proposition has been accepted, and action has been taken in due form. But the other barbers have employed the usual tactics of retaliation and seek to close the butcher shops, restaurants, livery stables, and news stands. We await results with interest.—Workers' Bulletin, Des Moines, Iowa.
