PROFITING by the success gained from sharp legislative practice in the Legislature of New York, where the Sunday-closing clause to the World's Fair appropriation bill was carried through the Senate as a rider to the appropriation, those who are advocating the bill to prohibit the Sunday opening of exhibitions, where Congress has appropriated money, have forced the consideration of this measure upon the Senate Committee on the Quadro-Centennial. The committee has been compelled to give its time, to this Sunday closing discussion, in order to forestall the use of the question as an obstructive measure to prevent or hinder appropriations, necessary for the highest success of the Exposition, unless conditioned on Sunday closing. This bill, the enacting clause of which reads, "That no exhibition or exposition for which appropriation is made by Congress shall be opened on Sunday" was introduced in the House by Mr. Morse, of Massachusetts, and in the Senate by Mr. Colquitt, of Georgia. In the Senate the bill was first referred to the Committee on Education and Labor,—evidently from the force of habit, as Mr. Blair, formerly chairman of that committee, has heretofore been the father of, and sponsor for, all bills of this religio-legal character in the Senate. It has since been transferred to the Committee on the Quadro-Centennial, of which Mr. Pettigrew, of South Dakota, is chairman. It is said that the Senate Committee on Appropriations has determined to refer all questions of appropriations for the World's Fair to this committee, and give it absolute jurisdiction over all bills and resolutions in reference to governmental aid to the Columbian Exposition.

ON MARCH 24, the Senate Committee on the Quadro-Centennial gave a hearing upon this Colquitt bill, which would enact that the funds of the United States should rest from profit-making on Sunday, where they are appropriated for exhibitions and expositions. Those who addressed the committee were Rev. H. H. George, for the American Sabbath Union; Rev. T. P. Stevenson, for the National Reform Association; and L. S. Coffin, of Iowa, representing the Brotherhood of Railway Men. Mr. George presented religions and legal reasons for the Sunday-closing of the World's Fair, at Chicago, taking it for granted, evidently, as something beyond question, that this bill to close all exhibitions, for which the United States appropriates money, might be passed and affect retroactively the Columbian Exposition. Mr. Stevenson told the committee that the Christian people of this country made the Centennial Exposition, at Philadelphia, a success financially; and claimed that there were 18,000,000 of church communicants, and, with those under their influence, about 54,000,000 of people in the United States who demand the Sunday-closing of the Exposition, at Chicago. Mr. Coffin asked for congressional action as a moral support to the railway brakemen, whom he represented, and to assist them in making terms with their employers. He also said that the organization he represented proposed asking Congress to prohibit the Sunday running of interstate mall trains. Some questions elicited from Mr. Stevenson the information that he had reason to believe the Local Board was not in favor of closing the Exposition on Sunday, and on that account he came to ask congressional interference. One of the private reasons which he made public was that, as he said, P. D. Widner, delegate at large on the Exposition Board, from Pennsylvania, had declared that he would spend 50,000 to prevent the Sunday-closing of the Fair, and this because he was a large stockholder in a Chicago street railway company.

The committee is to give further hearing upon this subject, and have expressed a desire for an impartial discussion of the question and a presentation of different views.

THE hearing upon the Sunday-closing question before the Senate Committee drew quite a number of Sabbath Unionists and National Reformers to Washington, and among them was Col. Elliott F. Shepard, President of the American Sabbath Union. A reporter for the Post interviewed Mr. Shepard, and after giving a personal description, in which he seems to have been surprised that a man who is so many kinds of a crank could be at the same time so courteous and graceful a gentleman, reports him as saying:—

A good many of the States that have made appropriations for the Exposition have provided that their exhibits shall not be open to the public on the first day of the week. Christian sentiment all over this Nation is against running the Fair seven days in succession. Did not the United States Supreme Court decide but a few days since that this was a Christian country? In the case of the minister who came to New York under an agreement with a congregation to act as their pastor, and was fined for violation of the law against contracts for alien labor, Justice Brewer very properly asserted from the Supreme bench that ours was a Christian land, and that such a construction of the law was contrary to public policy.

The President of the Sabbath Union and all other religious legislationists may well plume themselves upon this decision from Justice Brewer; in it he has given expression to opinions which as coming from the Supreme Bench will have no small bearing upon the enforcement of religious law in this country.

As has always been the case with the yearly agitation of the different phases of the Sunday question before congressional committees, so this year the desire to concentrate upon congressmen the multiplied force of ministerial eloquence has brought to the committee rooms and the corridors of the Capitol, a contingent of visiting clergymen. Opportunity is thus made for their voices to be heard, upon the subject of religious law and its enforcement, in the different churches of the city. At the present time, Rev. Mr. Stevenson and Rev. Mr. George have both spoken with a certain voice. Mr. Stevenson makes a noble and eloquent appeal for the Sabbath of the Bible, shows its inviolability, and that it is an eternal sign between God and his people, his memorial, and then descending to pathos,—and to Sunday,—says:—

My State, Pennsylvania, is in danger of losing her Sabbath this present session of Legislature. Shall we as a Nation have a Sabbath? It is the living issue in every State. We are asked to say before the world,—before fifty-eight nations,—"We have no Sabbath." It is the duty of Government to preserve the Sabbath, it is made to protect Sabbath rights.

Mr. George says that the question whether we shall have a Sabbath is to be settled in 1893; the alternative, in his mind, being that the opening of the Fair on Sunday will do away with the Sabbath. It is evidently part of the general programme that Washington pulpits shall be occupied from time to time by different clergymen of prominence in the Sunday-law movement.

The District Commissioners, in order to keep in sympathy with a Presbyterian administration and the rapidly growing political influence of the National Reform Association, have openly favored the rigid application of the Sunday laws for the District of Columbia, now in force, and the addition of others which may be more readily enforced. The various bills presented by recommendation of the Commissioners for the regulation of the liquor traffic in the District have always contained a close Sunday clause though with wide open privileges for the rest of the week. Their last order is to compel all proprietors of billiard tables, pool tables, bagatelle tables, Jenny Lind tables, or other like tables, shuffle boards and bowling alleys for public hire, in the District of Columbia, to remain closed during the twenty-four hours of Sunday.

The political strength which the party of religious legislation is gathering, is well exemplified by the position on the Sunday-closing of the Fair, with which Senator Matt Quay, of Pennsylvania, is credited.

According to the newspapers the name of Quay has for years been synonymous with utter lack of political conscience; but now a conscience has been found for him in reference to Sunday at the World's Fair. He is reported as being much shocked at the idea of opening the Fair on Sunday, and as saying, "No I am not in favor of it; no possible good could be accomplished by keeping the Fair open on Sunday, other than increase of revenue, and the opinions of those who are opposed to such a course should be respected. I am personally opposed to keeping the Fair open on Sundays."

Mr. Quay is a politician from Pennsylvania, and the law and the politics of that State is now very largely religious. The Pennsylvania politician who should array himself against religious laws at the present time would commit a grave error of judgment, politically speaking. The era of religion in politics is now well under way.
