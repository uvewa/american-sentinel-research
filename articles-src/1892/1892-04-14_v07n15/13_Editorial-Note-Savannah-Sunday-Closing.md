Elsewhere in the same State a similar course has been taken by the "city fathers," as is shown by this special from Savannah:—

Nothing could be bought openly in Savannah today except drugs. Everybody closed up. Even the barbers, despite the city ordinance giving them the right to keep open in the morning, thought it best to shut up their shops. The news stands followed the example of the others, and one newsboy was arrested for selling papers on the street. It is the first time, at least since the war, that business has been so generally suspended on Sunday.

The South is proving a good field for religious law. It has ever been that the climatic indolence induced by a southern sun has bred that moral inertia which leads people to formulate their conscience into a civil law, and file it away in the proceedings of a city council, as a handy weapon to have ready for use in a moment of hot blood.
