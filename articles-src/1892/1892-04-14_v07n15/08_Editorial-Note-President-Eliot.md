APROPOS of our article of last week, on "Liberty Indeed," is a paragraph from the Sun, of March 27, concerning President Eliot's Salt Lake speech, in which he likened the Mormons to the Puritans, and for which he has been roundly berated by the Gentiles of Utah. The Sun says:—

We are not at all sure that his comparison of the Mormons with the Pilgrims is not fair. Neither the Mormons nor the people of Plymouth and Massachusetts Bay had the slightest idea of religious liberty. The immigrants to Massachusetts came to a new country for the purpose of worshiping God in their own manner, and raising thunder with any other form of worship. Indignation created by the polygamous practices among the Mormons, drove the colony westward, and there a theseracy was founded just as a theseracy had been founded in Massachusetts two hundred years before. The fatal weakness was in assuming that it was in illustration of religious liberty. Both the Mormons and the founders of New England were exemplars of religious despotism.

And such must be the verdict of every unprejudiced person who familiarizes himself with the history of these peoples—the Puritans, and the Mormons. It is high time that we cease to hear either of them extolled as defenders of liberty of any kind; nothing could be farther from the truth. That both the Puritans and the early Mormon emigrants had certain sterling qualities, can not be denied; but those qualities when controlled by a false and misdirected religious zeal, only made them the more relentless persecutors. Let us have done with the sickly sentiment, that clothes the Puritans with a sanctity they never possessed, just because they settled New England two hundred and seventy years ago. As for the Mormons, it is not likely that anybody outside their own ranks, excepting always, of course, the President of Harvard College, which has several Mormon students, will see in them defenders of religious liberty; there are too many living witnesses of their intolerance.
