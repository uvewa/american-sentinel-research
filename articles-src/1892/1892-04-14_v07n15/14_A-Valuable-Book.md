# A Valuable Book.

The most valuable book which has recently come to the notice of the writer is "The Two Republics" by Alonzo T. Jones. It is a comprehensive history of Rome and the United States. These two republics, by far the most remarkable, have been overwhelmingly, to this point respectively the two republics of all history. Of Rome it is asserted that, in its great advance in modern forms in the Old World, the United States is the new. Rome, a Republic first, was a development from Republic, a Government of the people, the State. It is a Government of the people from its inception, but with its history only just beginning. The first part of the story is told. What the finale of that story will be is for the future to disclose. Read the book, and yet the reader is scarcely left in doubt on this point.

This book contains nearly nine hundred pages, is divided into twenty-three chapters, and the reader will naturally find his interest in those devoted to the history of Rome, secured that devoted to the great apostacy of the Christian church, developing in the Papacy, their civil influence on the respective States, and influsence not as well having a tendency through its influence in the not distant future, and in the not distant future.

The description of the paragraph "The Two Republics" is not only interesting, but instructive, and of such a commanding, as it does, not disconnected and far separated facts bearing mainly upon the development of the Papacy, without the influence upon both church and state, that every one can see just the bearing and the result of every move in the direction of liberty of conscience. And not only on every one can see, but its fascination is such that when taken up, it is hard to lay down; and the question arises, How is it that they have been so unfortunately ignored in previous works?

The persistent efforts to bring about a closer union between the State and religion and the State in this Republic should impel all liberty-loving Americans to know that it could not otherwise have come to pass to note that its full history had never before been published. The book had never come too soon; and now that it has arrived, it should not have thus far been probably overlooked. Any one can now unprejudicedly and candidly read "The Two Republics" without being forced to see graver danger threatens religious liberty than the country has ever known. It ought to be placed in the hands of hundreds of thousands. It is a book that is greatly needed, and it ought to be given a speedy reading.
