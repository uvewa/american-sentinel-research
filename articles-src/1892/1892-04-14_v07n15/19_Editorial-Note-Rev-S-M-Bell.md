AT the so-called Sabbath Convention in Pittsburg, on the 29th ult., Rev. S. M. Bell, of Butler, said:—

We have not so much to fear from foe as from friend. The great foe of the Sabbath is the corruption and apathy of the individual conscience. It has come upon us little by little. We have gone through the years until the individual conscience—I will not say the public conscience, for the public has no conscience—has become weak. Very largely the individual has committed his conscience to his party or to his church. We have formed a sort of conscience trust. We pool our consciences and pay for the relief by our votes. We do about the same thing in the church. I want to say that the great peril of the Sabbath is the corruption and the apathy of the individual conscience. There are some that can not get along without the Sunday paper; some think it no violation of the old law to pump the oil or the salt well. This thing has not come from without but from within. I would have no fear for the Sabbath if the individual conscience were right. I have no hope of saving the Sabbath except as we revive the individual conscience.

And the Convention said "Amen," and went right on clamoring for civil laws to compel Sunday observance. But civil law can never reach and revitalize the individual conscience. The people can never by law make themselves better than they are.
