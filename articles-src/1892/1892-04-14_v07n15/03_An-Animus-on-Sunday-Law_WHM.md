# An Animus on Sunday-Law.

The *Christian Statesman* of March 31, 1892, gives vent to its malice in this manner:—

The *New York World* of Feb. 16, published an editorial on the recent attempts in New Jersey to enforce the old Sunday laws, from which we extract the following:—

"Now, we wish to remark that this most remarkable enforcement of certain obsolete and antiquated old laws, in every village and hamlet, and also in a great city, that forbids the sale of newspapers on Sunday, to stop the delivery of milk and meat on the Lord's day, to arrest all those who violate the blue law—it stands against churches every Sunday on pain of suspension and penalties for the running of trains and the delivery of mail by the railways on Sunday except to attend church or a funeral, is the most remarkable exhibition of a body of men backed by the law of New Jersey making it a law forbidding a man to leave his own home for any purpose on the day set apart by statute and including everything as included in the spirit of this ancient legislation, as sweeping as if lying was punished as swiftly as in the days of the Salem Witchcraft."

That an editor so was moved by the malice exhibited, and by the Seventh-day Adventist endeavor, in the same editorial, to show the maintaining equally absurd misrepresentation of the relationship between the liberty of the individual and the enforcement of these laws.

This is only a fair sample of the way in which the *Statesman* and its satellites continually show their animus against those who read their books through deception, in their real for their observance of Sunday with all its sacredness.

The writer is not aware of just what certain citizens of Keyport, N. J., have banded themselves together to do, but he has a copy of the New Jersey Sunday law, which, by the way, exceeds in rigor the laws of any other State,—but we are aware that the editor-in-chief of the *Christian Statesman* has assumed a despotism over all upon ministers and others, in every city and hamlet in the country, to form themselves into "Rest Day Leagues" for the prevention of violations of Sunday laws. In a lecture which said editor has delivered in Illinois?, which, not long since, he boasted of the "League" organized there being in his 1500.

If any one will take the time to read the provisions on the statute books of New Jersey, regarding Sunday observance, he will readily see that they are not far removed from the spirit of what are commonly called Blue Laws. Section one provides that no worldly employment or business, or labor, except works of necessity and charity, or business, or ordinary or servile work, shall be done, performed on the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday, and charity exempted.

Section two provides that no person shall be, store, perform, and, or practice by any person or persons within the State, on the Christian Sabbath, or first day of the week, commonly called Sunday "any worldly labor and business" on Sunday. The provisions of this same sections are so comprehensive and broad as provide that "no person going to or returning from, any church or place of worship, shall carry or convey any burden of mines, or going to call a physician, entertainment of company, burying of the dead," allowed as traveling within the meaning of the provision. This section would amuse the people of New Jersey that it in fact reaches every place and form of public and private affairs, by providing also "that nothing in this act contained shall be construed to prohibit the dressing or selling of victuals in private families, or to hinder

Section four declares that "no wagoner, carrier, drayman, drover, butcher, or higgler, or their servants, shall travel with his or their wagons, carts, or drays," on Sunday under a penalty of

Section three of the supplement to the general act, and the act relating to the transporting transportation on water, provides that one trains, steamboats, cars, or other vehicles shall have power "to regulate and restrain the landing on canal premises, by either public or private conveyance, of any persons arriving in the vicinity of the New Jersey, commonly called Sunday, except on errands of

It is left to the judgment of the candid reader of the *New York World* greatly misrepresented the character of the law under the head of "exceedingly interesting" and "remarkable," or the law is either authoritatively or falsehood, in its statements regarding the law. The citizens of Keyport, N. J., provided they are doing nothing more than enforcing literally the Sunday law of their State, which the *Statesman* does not deny.

The most interesting and noteworthy feature of this article more noticed in this particular turn which the writer gives to it in his concluding comments. The *World* is a journal for which no defense from friends of the World need be made. In it the *World* is for once free to speak plainly in this matter as against the *Statesman*. It should be noticed that the *Statesman*, by some process of reasoning, has found cause first to try to strike a blow at the Seventh-day Adventists, and calls them liars and thieves. He starts not with an alleged falsehood, upon the part of the editor of the *World*, and winds up with a venomous attack upon Seventh-day Adventists.

Referring to the quotation from the *World*, regarding the above, here is a fair sample of the way Seventh-day Adventists are dealt with by the *Statesman*. In their zeal for their own ministerial interpretation of God's law. "Baptists are similarly supposed to be taken from the same class of sin which they are set forth to represent. But we have not yet taken up the idea that the Statesman has become a Seventh-day Adventist. Misrepresentation or ignorance on his part can be taken as a "fair sample."

The *Statesman* speaks of the Seventh-day Adventists as being the violators of the fourth commandment. The difference of opinion upon this and the nature of amity of the case, in themselves a matter of interpretation of the Bible, in whose interest the *Statesman* speaks for, whatever with Sabbath or other religious organizations. For the fact is that the Seventh-day Adventists have the same right as the editor of the *Christian Statesman* to interpret the fourth commandment and the Bible that any other people have, and the fourth commandment is the commandment of this people, as well as state a fact; and the editor of the *Statesman* should do not interpret the fourth commandment as the *Statesman* interprets it. As every one take it as it reads. It says, "The seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God," and the day they observe. It is only by "interpreting it," and making it say something it does not say, that it can be made to read "or mean" anything else. The *Statesman* reads and "interprets" it to mean "the first day;" "the day upon which Jesus Christ rose from the dead and sanctified, to mean a day upon which Christ never bestowed any special sanctification." And because Seventh-day Adventists take the commandment as it reads, and are not willing to accept the *Statesman's* interpretation, which is but a "mistaken interpretation" (!) and the *Statesman* says they violate Sunday laws, legislation, and Sunday Rest legislation, to bring their practice in conformity with the *Statesman's* misinterpretation. Evidently it sees in the little horn the spirit of the papacy standing in the gate. Read the third chapter of Daniel. w. H. M.
