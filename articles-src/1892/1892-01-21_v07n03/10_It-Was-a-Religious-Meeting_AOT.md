The readers of THE SENTINEL have been made aware of the conflict just closed in Toronto, Ontario, over the Mayor's proposition to submit the question to the people whether or not they would allow their street cars to commence running on Sunday. In reporting a recent mass-meeting, called to discuss the question, the Toronto Mail says:—

The chairman said they were only doing right in looking on this as a religious meeting, and therefore he would call upon all present to join in the doxology. This was done, and then Rev. Dr. Dewart led in prayer.

This discussion relating to Sunday laws seems to be adapting itself to the various shades of sentiment in different places. In the United States, where a State religion would be at a discount, the advocates for Sunday laws tell us in their public meetings, that it is only a civil rest day that they want, leaving the statement, that they will bring out the religious idea as soon as practicable, to be spoken in the ear of supposed friends. But in the Queen's dominions, where the people are accustomed from long practice to endure the hollow farce of submitting to a creed supported by a civil Parliament, the defender of Sunday legislation talks right out, saying that a meeting called to create such sentiment is religious, and opens it accordingly with the doxology and prayer.

History abounds in illustrations of the horrors of religious persecutions. But of course, in the minds of those who were thus staining the record of human events with their infamous deeds of relentless intolerance, they were doing no wrong! they were not persecutors; oh, no! they were simply doing it all for the good of the poor souls who were not sensible of the errors into which they had fallen. How strange that men of intelligence, with all the facts of the past before them do not see in their efforts and arguments for Sunday laws, the beginning of those same acts of horrible cruelty. Neither the religion of Jesus Christ, nor any of its precepts, needs the support of civil law. And if we seek aid from the civil arm, it should prove to us that we have departed from the simplicity of the Christian faith.
