Our Day for January gives twenty-five pages to the Sunday closing of the World's Fair. Fourteen of these pages are devoted to an article by Rev. W. C. Wood, who by his free use of Mr. Crafts' stale arguments and illustrations, shows himself to be a platitudinarian of no mean attainments. The other eleven pages are by the editor, who, like Mr. Wood, has added nothing new to the discussion. The determination to have it so is the only thing that could possibly reconcile intelligent readers to the perusal of such Sunday-law sophistries.
