CHRISTIANITY fostered and supported by a civil government ceases to be Christianity, and loses its power either to elevate people in its moral code or to present them from sinking to ever greater depths of vice than that in which it finds them.

GOVERNMENTS have in past ages assumed to dominate the realm of conscience, the sequel in the history of the Inquisition. The thumbscrew, the rack, and the fagot are inseparable from the theocratic theory of civil government. Men may affirm that they would not carry it as far as that, but it is impossible for them to stop short of it without abandoning their theory. It is for this reason that we oppose all Sunday laws; they are the beginnings of intolerance; they constitute a trench upon the most sacred of rights, the rights of conscience, the right to worship (church-going or not, as an individual right to worship) lawfully or not to worship.

WHEN it is not so serious a matter, it would be amusing to witness the sang froid with which the Sunday advocates appeal to the fourth commandment, which, as they must surely know, has not the slightest reference to the first day of the week, but does enjoin the exact observance of the seventh day. An example of this wresting of the word of God is found in an article on "Sunday Closing of the World's Fair," by Rev. W. C. Wood, in *Our Day* for January. Mr. Wood says:—

> The God who once Catechistry for us, a great bond our hearts is, and whose are all our ways. If we decide this question without supreme reference to his will, he may not be with us in our next great Gettysburg for us. He may allow the next Pizarro's charge our national glory to engulf us. He exiled his own Israel to Babylon for seven times ten years because they did not keep his Sabbath day. (2 Chron. 36:21; Isa. 60:13, 14; Jer. 17:21-27; and 25:4-12.)

Every scripture cited here applies only to the seventh day, and not one of them has the slightest reference to the first day of the week. How dare men who profess such methods plead for morals, and invoke Divine Providence to favor their divine institutions?

The first error is in the assumption that civil government has any duty in enforcing the law of God. The attempt to compel Sabbath-keeping by human enactments would be equally wicked were the effort made in behalf of the true instead of a spurious Sabbath.
