"THIS is getting to be a sweetly paternal Government," says the Sun, and indeed it is. The latest is a bill by Senator Sherman, "to promote and encourage the display of the flag of the United States." Upon this the Sun remarks—

So far as our experience goes, the people of the United States have never shown any need of stimulation by the Government in the patriotic practice of displaying upon all proper occasions their glorious and beloved banner. This bill provides that the Quartermaster-General of the army shall sell for cash, to anybody that applies, flags of the regulation patterns at the contract price at which they were purchased by the Government; and it provides further that anybody who shall sell at a profit any flag thus acquired shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and be subject, upon conviction, to fine or imprisonment, or both. . . . The Sherman bill merely makes the United States Government the agent of certain favored contractors to undersell all other flag makers or dealers. As for the proposal to regulate for all time, by penal enactment, the price at which a private citizen may dispose of his own property, purchased and paid for, we do not believe the constitutional power to do that is in Washington.

The question of constitutional power to regulate such matters does not trouble our law makers very much these days. The people seem to regard Congress as all powerful, and some members of that body seem to think so too. A confirmation of this is found in the fact, that Congressman Morse, of Massachusetts, has introduced a bill to prohibit appropriations by the Government to any exhibition open on Sunday. That is, Mr. Morse proposes, that the present Congress shall dictate to all future Congresses what they shall do. Mr. Morse ought to know that any act passed by one Congress can be repealed, either in whole or in part, by any subsequent Congress. The usual clause, "All acts or parts of acts inconsistent herewith are hereby repealed," would destroy the force of the prohibition which the Sunday zealots propose to put upon Congress for all time.
