"If the Sunday papers are pressed too hard they will retaliate by instigating prosecutions against certain Monday morning papers, a large portion of their labor being performed on Sunday. Several aldermen in this city have raged a harvest by law and order prosecutions, and once the State, through its local agent, is investigating the disposition of the money so received for fines.

The progress of the development of the ideas of governmental patronization in the Old World, is quite extraordinary. Emperor William of Germany has projected a grand cathedral, at Berlin, to cost $3,000,000, to be the showpiece of the State religion. Having also provided for the distribution of spiritual food of the prescribed quality to his subjects, the "intendental cooking school" is to be established which is to direct more cultural diet. In Switzerland, the government has assumed control of the teaching system, and proposes to nationalize the water power. Thus it is that the process of papal development grows on in all the different relations of life, both spiritual and material.

FRANCIS POPP, writing from Hall, England, of the condition of the churches in that country, describes the methods of carrying out the prevailing ideas that the people must be coerced, and says: "The great idea is to keep the congregation good tempered and jolly, and to have a good time. It is the incumbent duty of the preacher to amuse them and make them laugh, by starting ridiculous subjects in, which, as a matter of course, truth is so often sacrificed for wit. It is a pitiful sight to see a minister of the gospel of Jesus Christ standing up to laugh as truly and laboriously as any clown in a circus could do. And to think that the church was anxious to enforce the old Sunday law of Charles I.

*A distress from Washington say:*—"The trouble between John Cunningham Morgan and the associates, and the Washington Monument Association has been not adjusted, without injury to the dignity of either party. Archbishop Ireland of St. Paul has been the principal representative of the Church in bringing about this settlement of a difficult problem.

The Church has taken a step forward in its willingness to relinquish its strict exclusive dogma, but at the same time it has lost nothing; for there has been established a heartier co-operation than ever existed between the Catholic schools and the government.

This is quite in line with the discernment, which, it will be remembered, Senator Dawes made in the Senate, when it appeared that the Catholic and other denominations as well, had obtained a hold upon the Government for the support of Indian schools which it was impossible to shake off.

The *New York Observer* has this among its book notices: "The Two Republics; or Rome and the United States of America," by Elder A. T. Jones, is a work prepared with much care and logical ability, to contrast the principles of the governments of the two republics with regard to the place of religion. The principles of Rome in all its phases is that religion and government are inseparable, while the principle of the United States is that religion and government are essentially distinct and totally separate from civil government, and exempt from its responsibility or control. The influence of Christianity in antagonizing Rome\'s governmental principles as stated is admirably illustrated, and in a brief and contrasting way the author also shows how much Christianity had to do, and how Christianity was the direct agent, in securing the separating of religion and civil government.
