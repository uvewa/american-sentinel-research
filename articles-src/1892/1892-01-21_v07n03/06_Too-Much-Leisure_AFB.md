The point upon which the batteries of the American Sabbath Union are being concentrated with a view to creating sentiment for the enforcement of existing Sunday laws and the enactment of more rigid statutes, is the so-called "Sunday slavery" of laboring men. Sunday-law orators lash themselves into a frenzy of excitement in describing a condition of things which, they assert, is "worse than African slavery." Meanwhile the workingmen pass resolutions asking that the Fair be open on Sundays, and resent that hypocritical pious paternalism, which, as in the case of our lady managers, votes to close the Fair against the workingmen "to preserve the sanctity of the Sabbath" and then spends the following Sunday yachting on the lake. This indifference on the part of laboring men to their "enslaved" condition, draws forth numerous expressions of surprise and disgust from the workingman's self-constituted guardians that workingmen refuse to dance when the Sunday-law advocates so studiously fiddle. But laboring men are wide-wake and have discovered, they think, that this "antagonism to Sunday labor is more theological than humanitarian," and that this mourning for the "slaves of the nineteenth century" partakes largely of the nature of "crocodile tears." That the laboring man is not without reasons for his conclusions is becoming more and more apparent. All are familiar with the Sunday-closing arguments that the laboring man should have an opportunity to "improve his mind," cultivate his spiritual nature, "get acquainted with his family," etc. With this in mind note the following answer of the leading Sunday-law advocate of the country, as published in the Christian Statesman, of December 11, to the question of a labor leader, "I suppose the churches are not yet with us on the eight-hour law?" Said the Sunday-law champion in reply, "Many of us believe all the work that needs to be done could be done in the eight-hour day, but we fear that a majority of the working men can not wisely use eight hours a day of leisure." (Meaning the time remaining of the day after eight hours work and eight hours sleep.) When arguing for Sunday closing the workingmen are told that they haven't sufficient leisure to get acquainted with their families, but when it is proposed to give them one hour more leisure morning and evening of each working, day the grave fear is expressed that they "can not yet wisely use eight hours a day of leisure."
