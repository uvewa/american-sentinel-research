As THE SENTINEL has more than once had occasion to remark, Russia should be a country after the heart of all National Reformers. God is recognized there in the government at every turn and at the most unexpected places. The powers that be are thoroughly ordained of God, in the National Reform sense, and consequently, according to some people's way of thinking, Russia should be the first of "Christian nations." The following questions and answers are translated from a Russian "catechism for the use of schools and churches in the Polish provinces of Russia." It is published by order of the government and its study is compulsory:—

Question. How is the authority of the Emperor to be considered in reference to the spirit of Christianity?

Answer. As proceeding immediately from God.

Q. How is this substantiated by the nature of things?

A. It is by the will of God that men live in society, hence the various relations that constitute society, which for its more complete security is divided into parts called nations, the government of which is entrusted to a prince, king, or emperor, or in other words a supreme ruler. [France and the United States are not in it.] We see, then, that as man exists in conformity to the will of God, society emanates from the same divine will, and more especially the supreme power and authority of our lord and master the Czar.

Q. What does religion teach us, the humble subjects of his majesty the Emperor of Russia, to practice towards him?

A. Worship, obedience, fidelity, the payment of taxes, service, love, and prayer, the whole being comprised in the words, worship, obedience, and fidelity.

Q. Wherein does this worship consist, and how should it be manifested?

A. By the most unqualified reverence in words, gestures, and demeanor, thoughts and actions.

Q. What kind of obedience do we owe him?

A. An entire passive and unbounded obedience in every point of view.

Q. In what consists the fidelity we owe to the Emperor?

A. In executing his commands most rigorously without examination, in performing the duties he requires of us, and in doing everything willingly and without murmuring.

Q. Is the service of his Majesty the Emperor obligatory on us?

A. Absolutely so, we should if required, sacrifice ourselves in compliance with his will, both in a civil and military capacity, and in whatever manner he may deem expedient.

Q. How are irreverence and infidelity to the Emperor to be considered in reference to God?

A. As the most heinous sin, the most frightful criminality.

Q. Does religion forbid us then to rebel or overthrow the government of the Emperor?

A. We are interdicted from so doing at all times and under any circumstances.

And so on by the yard. In another place the omnipresence of the Emperor is taught in this most precious document:

Q. Independently of the worship we owe the Emperor, are we called upon to respect the public authorities emanating from him?

A. Yes, because they emanate from him, represent him, and not as his substitutes, so that the Emperor is everywhere.

We have here a good illustration of the logical outcome of the National Reform idea, or a man-made theocracy. It always ends in a Pope of some sort or other, and one, who standing in the place of God, consequently requires to be worshiped. Heaven preserve us from a so-called Christian nation going full blast.
