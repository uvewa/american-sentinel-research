CAN it be possible that there are many papers in the United States with as inadequate a knowledge of the thought and current news of the day as is betrayed in this extract from the Spokane Chronicle?—

THE AMERICAN SENTINEL, a paper published in opposition to the passage of any Sunday laws by civil authority, contending that Church and State must be totally divorced, finds considerable fault with a recent decision by Judge Hammond of the United States Court. He had before him the case of some extreme believer in the extreme of Sunday license, and it was claimed that the petitioner's exercise of his peculiar Sunday fad, interfered with the exercise of other people's Sunday rights. The details of controversy are not given, but Judge Hammond said:—

The petitioner cannot shelter himself just yet behind the doctrine of religious freedom in defying the existence of a law and its application to him, which is distasteful to his own religious feelings or fanaticism, etc.

This appears to draw the line between liberty and license, and is only an echo of the safe old doctrine that a man can't do just what he pleases in this country because it happens to be a matter of conscience and belief. We believe in liberty of worship, so long as it doesn't openly conflict with personal rights, and yet it is not considered the thing here to let a mother toss her children into the river, or to let a widow sacrifice herself by her dead husband's side, according to the Indian suttee. Our anti-Sunday law friends, in this particular case, have probably run across a gentleman who wanted to keep Sunday in a way that would break up everybody else in his neighborhood, or trample on some vested rights. Judge Hammond was eminently right in putting a curb hit on him.

The course of reasoning on these assumed premises, by which the conclusion is drawn that Judge Hammond did eminently right in giving the decision he did is no less ludicrous than the premises are erroneous and the facts incorrect.
