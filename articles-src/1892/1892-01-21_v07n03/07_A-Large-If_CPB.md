THE Christian Patriot, a Tennessee paper, publishes a communication on "Sunday laws," in which occur these words:

In this grasping, greedy age, we need the Sabbath laws to stand between those who "would sell the needy for a pair of shoes," and the day laborer. The body, mind, and soul of the toiler demands the Sabbath rest.

In Tennessee they have a law which fines and imprisons men for common farm labor on Sunday, even after they have kept the previous day, according to the fourth commandment. Can any honest man even attempt to justify such a law by platitudes about the necessity of Sabbath rest? When the "body, mind, and soul" of man demands anything, civil law is not necessary to enable him to obtain it. Those who want to rest upon Sunday will find means to do so; as a good many thousands of people in this and other countries find it very possible to rest regularly upon the seventh day, the Sabbath of the Lord; and this even when trammeled and oppressed by iniquitous Sunday laws, such as the Tennessee statute.

Again, the Patriot writer says:

If law is for the weak as well as the strong, if the object of law is to make it easy to do right and difficult to do wrong, then we need better Sabbath laws and men who have conscience for their oaths to enforce them.

There is a very large "if" in this paragraph. The true object of civil law is not "to make it easy to do right and difficult to do wrong." This definition of the object of law comes to us from one of the Church and State countries of the Old World, and is entirely un-American. The only legitimate object of civil law is to make every man secure in his person, property, and reputation. It deals only with rights and wrongs, which are civil; and has nothing to do with right and wrong, which are moral. "Better Sabbath laws, and men who have conscience for their oath to enforce them," simply means laws that will better enable some men to compel other men to conform to their ideas of religious duty under pains and penalties, in other words, laws authorizing persecution for conscience' sake.
