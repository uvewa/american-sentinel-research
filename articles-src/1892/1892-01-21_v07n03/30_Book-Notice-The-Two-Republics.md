THE NEW YORK Observer has this among its book notices:

"The Two Republics; or Rome and the United States of America," by Alonzo T. Jones, is a treatise prepared with much care and logical ability, to contrast the principles of the government of the two republics with regard to the place of religion. The principle of Rome in all its phases is that religion and Government are inseparable, while the principle of the United States is that religion is essentially distinct and totally separate from civil government, and exempt from its cognizance. The influence of Christianity in antagonizing Rome's governmental principle, as stated, is admirably illustrated, and in a lucid and convincing way the author also shows how much Christianity had to do in establishing and developing in the United States the separating of religious and civil government. The book will well repay diligent study. Battle Creek, Michigan; Chicago, Illinois, Review and Herald Publishing Company.
