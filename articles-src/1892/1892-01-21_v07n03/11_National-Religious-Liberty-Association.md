## National Religious Liberty Association.

### DECLARATION OF PRINCIPLES.

We believe in the religion of the Bible, and in the rights of all men.

We believe in supporting the civil government, and submit to its authority.

We deny the right of any civil government to legislate on religious questions.

We believe it is the right, and should be the privilege, of every man to worship according to the dictates of his own conscience.

We also believe it to be our duty to use every lawful and honorable means to prevent religious legislation by the civil government, that we and our fellow-citizens may enjoy the inestimable blessings of both civil and religious liberty.

In Butler, Pa., the clergymen and the Law and Order League are agitating the enforcing of Sunday laws.

In the Senate, on January 13, many petitions in favor of the loan of $5,000,000 to the World\'s Fair were presented, conditioned on the Fair being kept open on Sundays.

The managers of the Brooklyn Sunday School Union, have recently taken action endorsing the observance of all the Sunday schools of the United States, against the opening of the Chicago Park on Sunday.

The Third Board of Education, of Edgewater, New Jersey, has decided to maintain the reading of the Bible and the recitation of the Lord\'s Prayer at the opening exercises of the public schools. The vote upon the question stood: averse 16 to one.

The city council of Trenton decided, that, if five thousand tax-payers of the city made the request, the question as to whether the running of street cars should be permitted on Sunday would be submitted to popular vote. It was voted upon at that election, and carried. A mail boat was then still considered to be an example to the rest of the world of a "civilizing city."

This Sabbath Association of Illinois, at an annual meeting just held, passed resolutions especially requesting the State of Illinois to close its individual State exhibit at the coming World\'s Fair, on Sunday; irrespective of what might be the decision of the Commissioners as to the Exposition as a whole.

The following is from the *Star,* of Washington.

A former Secretary Notkins has written a letter to Mrs. S. D. D. Frias and Mrs. Mary E. Catlin, of the Woman\'s Christian Temperance Union, in regard to moving the Berger family to their home.

Mrs. Frias still attaches to the latter her remarks to the Commissioner of Immigration at that port, in Argument last, this order, showing that it is the means and purpose of the Treasury Department to require Sunday in the matter of further closing of immigrants just so far as it can be done without making dissatisfied and distance among the immigrants.

ARCHBISHOP IRELAND has expressed himself in a very striking way, in which the church must consent to uphold the right of the State to enforce Sunday observance. He asserts a fundamental and distinct policy fidelity to the State. This is natural; it is consistently Roman Catholic. All Roman Catholic churches should support Sunday laws and their enforcement. And in the long run, the State may find this in the assurance of prophecy.

THE "NATIONAL REFORM" Society of Christian Endeavor has appointed a committee on Sunday closing of the World\'s Fair. This committee is composed of the presidents of the local societies of the local directory of Chicago; names and addresses of these people may be known to the society. And Territorial; blank petitions; sample resolutions, etc. All this the concern of a special first day closing of the World\'s Fair.

THAT Post Office is now closed on Sundays, and an investigation pronounced to lead on that day, exceptions may be permitted to operate under the Secretary of the Treasury. It is reported that the offices will be made permanent, and hereafter those places where the offices were once situated before will be obliged to remain established. The advantage of this general closing of the Post Office in which to develop city fever and other diseases originating from filth and from unwholesome nourishment.

"THE *World\'s Fair* bill has this down to the care of the exhibition of legal tendencies to religious matters on Sundays and to observe it. In Vienna the picture galleries and similar institutions of the State have also published its minister from certain quarters as carrying on the day in the military barracks. If this step is taken in that in the schools or distills purposes of by the Methodist Church, it is intended that the sanctions of masses are meaningless before any of the faithful."

### Pennsylvania Blue Laws Revived.

From the correspondent of the *Enquirer,* from a dispatched, the following in reference to an old blue law in the State of Pennsylvania:

Information to the number of one hundred men was made before Alderman James before by the Law and Order Society against saloons, rarities, and cigar officers on the order, Lizgurski, and prosecutions were taken from various citizens under the Blue Laws of 1794, through the deputy members of the Legislature.

The Law and Order Society is a very respectable body and the dues papers contained, are making it hard for the organizations by means of enforcing old and obsolete laws. In November they obtained the arrest of poor widows, and invalids of both sexes, for the sale of provisions upon the Lord\'s day and the arrest of poor widows, and invalids of both sexes, and cigars.

A demand Wishart, formerly a captain in the United States regular army, was until recently agent of the Society and after in these proceedings. Now he is located in Newark, New Jersey, continuing his operations.
