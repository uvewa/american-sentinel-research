FRANCIS HOPE, writing from Hull, England, of the condition of the churches in that country, describes the methods of carrying out the prevailing idea that the people must be amused, and says: "The great idea is to keep the congregation good-tempered and jolly, and to have a good time. It is the incumbent duty of the preacher to amuse them and make them laugh, by uttering ridiculous sayings, in which, as a matter of course, truth is too often sacrificed for wit. It is a pitiful sight to see a man standing in the sacred desk and playing for a laugh as truly and laboriously as any clown in a circus. Yet it is these very people who are most anxious to enforce the old Sunday law of Charles II."
