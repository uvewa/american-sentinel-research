Word and Work has this item in reference to the exhibition of legal intolerance in religious matters in Austria: "There is no religious liberty in Russia, and not much in Austria. In Vienna the police have just closed the German Methodist Chapel, and have also prohibited its minister from officiating anywhere in the city. The ground upon which this step is taken is that in the articles of faith professed by the Methodist Church, it is stated that "the sacrifices of masses are blasphemous fables and dangerous doctrines."
