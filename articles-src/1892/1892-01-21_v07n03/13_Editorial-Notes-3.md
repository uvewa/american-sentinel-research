NOTWITHSTANDING the fulminations of the *Mail and Express,* of this city, the Metropolitan Museum of Art is to be open to the public the coming Sunday afternoon.

Our Day for January gives twenty-five pages to the Sunday closing of the World\'s Fair. Fourteen of these pages are devoted to an article by Rev. W. C. Wood, who, by his free use of Mr. Crafts\' stale arguments and illustrations, shows a decided aptitude to be a painstakist of no mean attainments. The other papers are pages by the editor, who, like Mr. Wood, the Rev. I. J. Lansing and others, has shown a determination to leave it to its the only thing that could possibly reconcile intelligent readers to the perusal of much Sunday law argument.

"The *Christian Endeavor Country* Club, of this city, was recently enlivened by a discussion of the Sabbath question at one of its meetings, by Col. Elliott F. Shepard of the great appeal. Mr. Shepard replied: Rev. Dr. A. H. Lewis, of the Seventh-day Baptist Church. Colonel Shepard indulged in the usual Sunday arguments, while Dr. Lewis showed, that by both history and the original Hebrew, Saturday was the day of creation, and that in putting Sunday in the Bible Sabbath. He defended the opening of the museums on Sunday, on the ground that as the State religious exercises on Sunday, it should provide places of resort less hurtful than the saloons. He was, however, opposed to any State interference in the matter of Sabbath observance. The audience was an interesting one. The speaker and his evidently had the sympathy of his audiences."

The Law and Order League of Pittsburg is now undisputing its earnest the championship of the cause of the American Sabbath Union, and begun its campaign for enforced Sunday observance by obtaining warrants for the arrest of all the employees of the newspaper and the Union News Company, of Pittsburg, not excepting the persons and agents who make up and sell and deliver the Sunday papers. The action is brought under the old Pennsylvania Sunday law of 1794, which has been virtually a dead letter for nearly a century. It is understood that it is the intention of the Law and Order League to proceed against the proprietors of Pittsburg Sunday papers, also, under the same antiquated act. It is evident that the Sabbath Union intends to use this much vaunted sword arm with deadly effect in Pittsburg. Those who are noting the rapidly developing events in the progress of religious legislation, will look with interest to see the result of this crusade by which the management of the Christian Statesman celebrates the entrance of their paper into the new home. No doubt the paper of Pittsburg is generally will appreciate the courtesy which marks its advent among them.

"This is getting to be a rosely pastor. 'Government?' says the Sun, and indeed it is. The latest is a bill by Senator Hiscock to prohibit by law everywhere the display of the flag of the United States." Open this *Sun* remark:—

So far as we experience sees the people of the United States have not above any need of stimulation by the Government in the patriotic practice of displaying old and proper counterfeits but glorious and beloved banner. This bill provides that the Quartermaster-General of the army shall furnish, to anybody that applies, either flags or the republican standard, the cost not to exceed ten dollars. But the flag displayed by the government, and it provides further that the people shall not have the flag anywhere or acquired shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be punished by fine. This is at once improper.

The Sherman bill merely make the United States Government the mail carriers forevod contractors to subserve all other flag makers or dealers, for if the proposal to regulate for all time, by great enactment, the price at which a private citizen may sell copies of the stars report, purchased and paid for, we do not believe the constitutional power to do so shall in Washing- ton.

The question of constitutional power to regulate such matters does not trouble our law makers very much now these days. The people seem to regard Congress as all-powerful in any case. The next measure they are likely to make considered for them is to think as to. A notification of the limitation of power is found in the fact, that Congressman Morse of Massachusetts, has introduced a bill to prohibit appropriation by the Government to any exhibition open on Sunday. That is, Mr. Morse proposes that the present Congress shall dictate to all future Congresses what they shall do, and this, too, in the matter of appropriation passed by one Congress can be repealed, either in whole or in part, by any subsequent Congress. The usual attitude "all acts or parts of acts inconsistent herewith are hereby repealed," would destroy the force of the prohibition which the Sunday sensible proposer to get your Congress for all time.

CAN it be possible that there are many papers in the United States with an intelligent knowledge of the thorough and current news of the day as is displayed in this extract from the Spokane *Chronicle:*—

THE AMERICAN SENTINEL, a paper published in New York, is the most prominent national authority, contending that Church and State must be totally divorced, finds considerable fault with a recent decision by Judge Hammond of the United States Court, in which the judge presents the extreme between in the extreme of Sunday license. When it was charged that the publication complained of, its popular Sunday laid, interfered with the civil rest of other people\'s Sabbath rights. The details of controversy are not given, but Judge Hammond said it was the law.

The petitioner cannot absolve himself just yet on the distinction of religious and civil duty, because the State has a law and the superintendent agrees that it is intended to fix the relations in religious affairs by temporal law.

This appears to draw the line between liberty of conscience in a narrow and he also set forth that a man can\'t do just what he pleases in this country. When it happens to touch liberty of conscience and belief. We believe in liberty of worship, no to long as it doesn\'t openly reach the personal rights, and yet it is not considered the thing to lead him to a decided matter even children into street, or for it is a widow accline herself by her own act. But conscience demands liberty of conscience.

Our own Sunday law friends, in this particular, take issue differently. They demand the right to keep Sundays in a way which will destroy everybody else in this neighborhood\'s rest, and then say their religious right is putting all on the best.

The course of reasoning on these assumed statements, by which the conclusion is drawn by that Judge Hammond set himself up rightly that giving discretion that the less on less fallacious than the premises are erroneous and the first arguments themselves.
