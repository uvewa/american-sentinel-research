DESPATCHES from Washington say, "The trouble between Indian Commissioner Morgan and the authorities of the Roman Catholic Church has been amicably adjusted, without injury to the dignity of either party. Archbishop Ireland, of St. Paul, has been the principal representative of the Church in bringing about this solution of a difficult problem.

The Church has taken a step forward in its willingness to relinquish its strict sectarian discipline, but at the same time it has lost nothing; for there has been established a heartier co-operation than ever existed between the Catholic schools and the Government."

This is quite in line with the statement, which, it will be remembered, Senator Dawes made in the Senate that the Roman Catholic Church, and other denominations as well, had obtained a hold upon the Government in the matter of the Indian schools which it was impossible to shake off.
