GOVERNMENTS have in past ages assumed to dominate the realm of conscience; the sequel is the history of the Inquisition. The thumbscrew, the rack, and the fagot are inseparable from the theocratic theory of civil government. Men may affirm that they would not carry it so far as that, but it is impossible for them to stop short of it without abandoning their theory. It is for this reason that we oppose all Sunday laws; they are the beginnings of intolerance; they necessarily trench upon the most sacred right of man, namely, the right to worship (which carries with it the right not to worship) just as seemeth him good.
