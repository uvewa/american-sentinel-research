ARCHBISHOP IRELAND has expressed himself in a published paper on the Sunday question, in which he upholds the right of the State to enforce Sunday observance, and urges upon Roman Catholics a stricter fealty to the Sunday. This is natural; it is in fact a logical necessity that Roman Catholic authorities should support Sunday laws and their enforcement. More than this, that they will do so there is the assurance of prophecy.
