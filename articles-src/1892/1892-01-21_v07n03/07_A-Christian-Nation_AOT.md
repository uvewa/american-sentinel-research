## A Christian(?) Nation.

AS THE SENTINEL has more than once had occasion to remark, Russia should be a country after the heart of all National Reformers. God is recognized there in the government at every turn and at the most unexpected places. The powers that are so religiously ordained of God, in the National Reform sense, and consequently, according to some people's way of thinking, Russia should be the first of "Christian nations." The following questions and answers are translated from a Russian catechism for the use of schools and churches in the Public provinces of Hungary. It is published by order of the government, and its study is compulsory:—

*Question.* How is the authority of the Emperor to be considered in reference to the spirit of Christ as proceeding from God.

*How is this esteemed by the nature and authority of the Emperor?*

*A.* It is by the will of God that men live in society; it is by the will of God that this society, which for its more complete security is divided into separate nations, the governing of which is entrusted to a prince, king, or emperor; in other words a supreme power. (These in the United States are not so in it.) We see, then, that a man ceases to conform to the divine will which emanates from the entire divine will, and ceases conforming the supreme power and authority to exalt and master the Christ.

*Q.* What does religion teach us, the humble subjects of his majesty the Emperor of Russia, to practice towards him?

*A.* Worship and fidelity, the payment of taxes, service, love, and prayer, the whole being comprised in the words, fidelity and obedience.

Whereby. Whence does this worship consist, and how is it manifested?

*A.* By the most unequalled reverence in words, gestures, and demeanor, thoughts and actions.

*Q.* What kind of obedience do we owe him?

*A.* An entire passive and unbounded obedience in all public cases.

*Q.* What consists the fidelity we owe to the Emperor?

*A.* In reserving his commands obediently, without examination, in performing the duties he requires of us, and in doing everything willingly and zealously.

*Q.* Is the service of his Majesty the Emperor connected with Religion?

*A.* Absolutely; we should if required sacrifice ourselves to complete obedience with him, but in civil and military capacity, and in his manner also he may have many experiences.

*Q.* Are there any interpretations and limits of obedience? Is the Emperor to be considered in reference to God?

*A.* Yes; there are limits. Every one who opposes his religious fidelity can in the then refer to the civil power alone as authoritative.

*Q.* What is the obligation to the Emperor to the ruling government of the Emperor?

*A.* We are commanded to know it clearly. Obey the laws.

And so by my Lord. In another place the omnipresence of the Emperor appears:

To guard the maintenance of the worship of God at all public ceremonies where we use the words the Emperor, we are called upon to repeat the public prayer.

I. So be, leaders they command their men, followers shall pray "in his name." And as a Commander, we are to bless his maintenance, so that an entire realm in his maintenance, so that all nations calling give full blast.

## It Was a Religious Meeting.

Our readers, THE SENTINELS, have been made aware of the conflict just closed in Toronto, Ontario, over the Mayor's proposition to submit this question to the people whether or not they would allow or would their street cars to commence running on Sunday. In reporting a mass meeting called to discuss the question, the *Toronto Mail* says:—

The chairman said they were only doing right in looking on this as a religious question, and so far as he was to told as all appeals were to his time for he would call upon all present, and in the meantime he invited all the ministers upon the platform to lead in prayer.

This statement the newspapers have long ceased to be astonishing itself to the various sort of sentiment in different places. When the United States, where a State religion would be set as a discordance, the question for Sunday laws set in their public meetings, that is only a civil rest day that they're seeking. What matter if it be that they will bring out the religious idea at once as at such, could be. He spoke in the ear of surprised friends. But in the nation's dominions, where the people are accustomed from long practice to nature the hollow farce of submitting to a creed supposed by a civil Parliament, the defender of Sunday legislation talks right out, and sentimentalism a religious, and opens accordingly with the doxology and prayer.

History showed in the illustration of the horrors of religious persecution. But of course, in the minds of those who were thus mishandling the record of human events with their infamous deeds of religious intolerance, they were doing no wrong. Where they were not persecutors, oh no! they were simply doing it all for the good of the poor souls who were not sensible of the errors into which they had fallen. How strange that men of intelligence, with all the facts of the past before them to set on their efforts and arguments for Sunday laws, the beginning of those same acts of horrible tyranny. Not the religion of Jesus Christ, nor any of its precepts, needs the support of civil law. And if we seek aid from the civil arm, it should prove to us that we have departed from the simplicity of the Christian faith.

A. O. TAIT.
