## Would Not Sunday Rest Protect a Day of Worship?

The following affirmative answer to this question is by President Crafts of the Pearl, Ohio, in his after-dinner arguments in Sunday advocacy:

Business men and professional men, stimulated to ceaseless exertion by rivalry and competition in their respective callings, find themselves imprisoned in the harness of relentless toil, tied to their offices during the business hours. On the day of rest, we deny the right of the telephone, mail or telegram. Nothing but universal rest can give universal rest. Without a law that shall stop all business on that day, the doctors, the plumber, dressmaker, druggist, the florist, and all others that supply the needs of those who do not rest, can find no pause, no rest. Without the day of worship, moral disease, nervous disease are painfully prevalent.

But ask any doctor or plumber how much rest they would lose, whether the businesses rest, our custom must obey and allow their energies advocates said definitely the justification of the same institution.

Business men and professional men, stimulated to ceaseless exertion by rivalry and competition, imprison themselves in the harness of their business and daily toil and live in their hours of rest imprisoned by despotism of spirits and greed, which hold them in bondage. Never since the days of men more in practically needed, more evidently indispensable to society than now. And even natural, electricity, and secondary consultations demand it. Along the forty to one port the lord holds worker as well as the weary and spent. And yet in city after city, from within a few years your home the Sunday newspaper, which, if left it enter, will fill the day of peace with the noise of strife and the dust of earth life. In the still watches of the night the rumble of the car before the door is heard. Not that the day be kept as the Lord's Day, as a Christian Sunday, not as a Jewish Sabbath.
