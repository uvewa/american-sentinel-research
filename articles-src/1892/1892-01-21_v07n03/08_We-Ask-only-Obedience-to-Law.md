## "We Ask only Obedience to Law."

Under the title, "How to Organize Law and Order," and with the express endorsement of "all officers of justice and divines," both of officially and of their class, A. Winsock, of Newark, N. J., gives in the *Christian Statesman,* the method of organization of Law and Order Leagues. This is worthy of comparison with the methods of formation of "Foot Leagues," published not long ago in *Tax Reaction.* Further articles dealing with this are preeminently for Mr. Wishart, "The Descreet System," and the questions, theoretical and practical, which made in the working of these voluntary organizations.

Since the work of the Law and Order Leagues has been chiefly directed at the signs of success in reducing crime and in securing an enforcement of laws for the outward observance of the Sabbath, it has been appealed to, from the standpoint of its phase or its plans of organization, forms of Constitution, and methods of work. To the first step to be taken in the organization of Leagues. The following suggests a plan:

"To find a number of the best citizens of the place who 'sigh and cry for all the abominations that be done.' Run. 6. . . which is a good chapter to read to communicate the spirit of the object. Organize, it is then easy, to pledge 'their lives, their fortune, and their sacred honor,' not for the fathers, to the attainment of the object of law enforcement; remembering that law can be promoted without two things which are 'the abolition of this institution of saloon-keepers and other shutter-bars, are careful to provide and protect.' These are some moments without lack, and through corporate enterprise.

What cost is a man nothing, either of labor or money, or a bit, that is to be preciated; and what man gave of their means to support financially is many of their most moral support, and best effort. Having made use of the fends to meet the expense of the work, much having been done; and it would be well to place it on a basis. I now have the honor to represent. The Citizens\' Law and Order League.
