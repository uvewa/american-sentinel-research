The proper spiritual use of the day must of course, be entirely voluntary. Its observance on a day of quiet, of cessation from business, is to be enforced by law only on the ground that men are to be restrained from whatever would disturb or interfere with the worship of others or their observance of the day. When this has been secured by law and is enforced by public opinion and by faithful officers of the law, is done which the State can do. Education and Christian influences must do the rest. "The Church is a spiritual body, ruling on the State only by the moral and spiritual forces of individual persons." So much as to its influence and government.

Nothing in all this affords the slightest reasons for Sunday laws. "Business and professional" men need not be "pressed" to their homes and into their hours of sleep by the incessant click of the "ticker" and the imperious bell of the telephone, unless, because of greed, they will to have it so. The State has no duty to protect such men against themselves.

The same is true of the Sunday paper; it has no power to force its way into any man's home. The man who does not order or buy the Sunday paper, will not be annoyed by it. "The proper spiritual use of the day" can be had without the Sunday paper just now not having it. "The proper spiritual use of the day of judgment," indeed, is voluntary, and so should every other use of that or any other day. Every matter, then to this extent has been only the matter of individual effort, and the State has no just right to deprive him of any portion of it. Sunday laws, so far as they now exist, fall almost utterly to prohibit the very kind of work that most tend to distract those who desire proper quiet upon that day. And not any injurious custom could, as our readers know, be cited in which curtain factors and other quiet private works, which could not possibly disturb anybody, has been severely punished, under the laws which are professedly designed only to protect those who desire to keep the day. The fact is, as appears in the extract quoted from President Gates, Sunday laws are wholly religious, and are designed to at least foster the religious observance of that day. Were it not for the popular notion that God requires Sunday rest, we would hear nothing of the insanity for enforced Sunday rest.                       C. P. B.
