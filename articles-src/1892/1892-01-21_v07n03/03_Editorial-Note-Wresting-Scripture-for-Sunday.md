WERE it not so serious a matter, it would be amusing to witness the sang-froid with which the Sunday advocates appeal to the fourth commandment, which, as they must surely know, has not the slightest reference to the first day of the week, but does enjoin the sacred observance of the seventh day. An example of this wresting of the word of God is found in an article on "Sunday Closing of the World's Fair," by Rev. W. C. Wood, in Our Day for January. Mr. Wood says:

The God who won Gettysburg for us, a providential battle, is still the Almighty, "in whose hand our breath is, and whose are all our ways." If we decide this question without supreme reference to his will, he may not win our next Gettysburg for us; He may allow the next Pickett's Charge not only almost but quite to succeed. He exiled his own Israel to Babylon for seven times ten years because they did not keep his Sabbath day (2 Chron. 36:21; Isa. 68:13, 14; Jer. 17:21-27; Neh. 13:18).

Every scripture cited here applies only to the seventh day, and not one of them has the slightest reference to the first day of the week. How dare men who practice such methods plead for morals, and invoke divine Providence to favor their duplicity?

The first error is in the assumption that civil government has any duty in enforcing the law of God. The attempt to compel Sabbath observance by human enactments would be equally wicked were the effort made in behalf of the true instead of a spurious Sabbath.
