## A Large "IF."

Under the title, "How to Organize Law and Order," and with the express endorsement of "all officers of the law and divines," both of officially and of their class, A. Winsock, of Newark, N. J., gives in the *Christian Statesman,* the method of organization of Law and Order Leagues. This is worthy of comparison with the methods of formation of "Foot Leagues," published not long ago in *Tax Reaction.* Further articles dealing with the form of organization are also worthy of comparison. Particular attention is called here to Article III, on which, with the provisions following, comment will prove instructive.

In his amazing gravity, we see that the Sabbath laws as were observed between these laws to insist between those who "would sell the sinner for a pair of shoes," and the sale of the body, mind, and soul of the toiler demands our attention.

But before that those in Tennessee have a law which stands and impresses from one common farm labor on Sunday, even after they have kept the previous day, according to the fourth commandment. Can any honest man ever attempt to justify such a law by platitudes about the necessity of Sabbath rest? When the "body, mind, and soul" of man demands anything, civil law is not necessary to enable him to obtain it. Those who want to rest upon Sunday will not be forced to do work. Is it not more natural for man to rest, and a good many thousands of people in its midst are idlers and vagrants?

And it is very possible to rest regularly upon the seventh day, the Sabbath of the Lord, and this even when travestied and oppressed by iniquitous Sunday laws, such as the Tennessee statute.

Again, the *Patriot* writer says:

> If law is for the weak as well as the strong, if the object of law is to make it easy to do right and to do wrong, then we have a case here for which the statute book provides remedial action. There are men and women who want to be something but can find neither the work nor the way to their ambitions.

> There is a very large "if" in this paragraph. The true object of civil law is not "to make it easy to do right and difficult to do wrong." This definition of the object of law comes to us from one of the Church and State countries of the Old World and is entirely un-American. The only legitimate object of civil law is to make every man secure in his person, property, and reputation. It deals only with rights and wrongs, which are civil, and has nothing to do with right and wrong, which are moral. "Better Sabbath laws, and more law-abiding citizens for their oath to enforce them," simply means laws that will better enable some men to compel other men to conform to their ideas of religious duty under pains and penalties, including, in effect, heavy fines and imprisonment for conscience' sake.
