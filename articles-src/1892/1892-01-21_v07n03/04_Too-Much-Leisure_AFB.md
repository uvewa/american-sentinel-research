## Too Much Leisure.

THE point upon which the batteries of the American Sabbath Union are the most concentrated with a view to creating sentiment for the enforcement of existing Sunday laws and the enactment of more rigid statutes, is the so-called: "Sunday slavery" of laboring men. Sunday-law crusaders launch themselves into a tirade of impassioned oratory in describing a condition of things which, they assert, is "worse than African slavery." Almost in the same breath their paper resolutions asking that the Fair be open on Sundays, and that all hypocritical pious pretensions which, as in the case of our lawmakers, vote to close the Fair against the workingmen "to preserve the sanctity of the Sabbath" —that spend the following Sunday yachting on the lake. This indifference on the part of laboring men to their "concern" for Sunday observance, drives forth numerous expressions of surprise and disgust from the workingman's self-constituted guardians that workingmen refuse to dance when the Sunday-law advocates so obediently fiddle. But laboring men are wiser, and more and have discovered, they think, that the "antagonism to Sunday is not so much theological than humanitarian," and that this crusade for the "values of the nineteenth century" partakes largely of the nature of "crocodile tears." That the laboring man is not without reason for his conclusions is becoming more and more apparent. A comparison of all the Sunday-closing arguments that the laboring man should have an opportunity to "improve his mind," cultivate his spirit and his nature, "get acquainted with his family." With this in mind note the following maxim of the leading Sunday-law advocates of the country, as published in the *Christian Statesman,* of December, in the Christian Statesman it is said:—

"It was at the time the question was asked: 'are not yet with us in the eight-hour law?' Said the Sunday-law champion in reply, 'Many of us believe all the work that needs to be done could be done in the eight-hour day; but we fear that a majority of the working men can not intelligently use eight hours a day of leisure.'" (Meaning the time remaining of the day after eight hours work and eight hours sleep.) When arguing for Sunday closing the workingmen are told that they haven't sufficient leisure to get well acquainted with their families, but when it is proposed to give them one hour more leisure morning and evening of each working, day the grave fear is expressed that they "can not yet intelligently use eight hours a day of leisure."
