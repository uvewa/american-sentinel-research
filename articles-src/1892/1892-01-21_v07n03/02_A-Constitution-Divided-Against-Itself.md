## A Constitution Divided Against Itself.

The Constitution of the State of Tennessee, framed by a convention which assembled for that purpose at Nashville, in 1870, and submitted to the people, and ratified in March of the same year, contains, in the Declarations of Rights and following articles, those sections in reference to religion and the relation of religious questions to civil affairs:—

ARTICLE 1, Sec. 3. That all men have a natural and indefeasible right to worship Almighty God according to the dictates of their own conscience; that no man can, of right, be compelled to attend, erect, or support any place of worship, or to maintain any minister against his consent; that no human authority can, in any case whatever, control or interfere with the rights of conscience; and that no preference shall ever be given, by law, to any religious establishment or mode of worship.

SECTION 4. That no political or religious test, other than an oath to support the Constitution of the United States and of this State, shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under this State.

SECTION 5. . . . . . and no religious or political opinions shall disqualify a man from holding any office.

ARTICLE 9, Sec. 1. Whereas ministers of the Gospel are, by their profession, dedicated to God and the care of souls, and ought not to be diverted from the great duties of their functions; therefore, no minister of the gospel, or priest of any denomination whatever, shall be eligible to a seat in either house of the Legislature.

SECTION 2. No person who denies the being of God, or a future state of rewards and punishments, shall hold any office in the civil department of this State.

ARTICLE 11, Sec. 15. No person shall in time of peace be required to perform any service to the public on any day set apart by his religion as a day of rest.

SECTION 12. The declaration of rights hereto prefixed is declared to be a part of the Constitution of the State, and shall never be violated on any pretext whatever. And to guard against transgression of the high powers we have delegated, we declare that everything in the Bill of Rights contained is excepted out of the general powers of the government, and shall forever remain inviolate.

Now the true office of a declaration of rights in a national or State Constitution is to express therein the fundamental principles of political liberty, and enact them into law. Political liberty can not be universal in a State which holds it to be the province, or any part of them, civil freedom in religious matters; expression of observance; that discriminates between individual sects of religionists, or between professed religionists and those who have less or profess to all, or deny its authority. To express this idea in the completeness in the intent of Section 5 previously quoted, and it is in the declaration of rights of the State of Tennessee, previously quoted.

The absurdity of the principle is admirably illustrated in that the declaration is solemnly enacted as the fundamental law, and yet on English tongue affords, in Sections 13 and 14 of Article 11. The bill of rights is, by special provision, declared to be a part of the Constitution of the State, and never to be violated; and to emphasize this still more, everything contained in the bill of rights is declared to be excepted out of the general powers of the government, and to remain forever inviolate. Yet, in spite of this solemn assurance, emphasized by repetition, and again and again declared forever inviolable, in a succeeding article, within the very body of the Constitution itself, are found two sections totally at variance with the principle and the spirit of the principles laid down in the bill of rights as fundamental to the political liberty of the State. The express provision is a declaration of the bill of rights, that no political or religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office of public trust is explicitly violated in Sections 1 and 9 of Article 9, which makes a religious test for membership in the Legislature, and for holding civil offices—the one disabling certain ministers and priests of any denomination whatever, and making their religious profession a test of disqualification for the holding of public office. That this discrimination arises from prejudice is shown by the illusioned reasoning—nay, the non-reasoning of it.

The motive for the discrimination arises from religious prejudice against the Roman Catholic denomination, but in order to deprive those of the privilege of holding civil office, it was necessary to make an exclusion indiscriminately general to all who follow the ministerial calling. But Religion in hand gains a still broader spirit of intolerance, in that it is declared that no one who denies the existence of God, or disbelieves in a future state of rewards and punishments—that is, presumably, in the orthodox of the known and held, can hold any civil office under this State of Tennessee.

Such discrepancies as these in fundamental law are fatal. Sooner or later this flaw will develop and disaster result. But out of the extension of this flaw into the growth of statutory law arises a still greater antagonism between Constitution and the consideration for the consideration of which the space allotted this article will not suffice.
