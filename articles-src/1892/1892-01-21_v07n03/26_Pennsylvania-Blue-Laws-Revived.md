A special dispatch to the Evening Post, from Pittsburg, contains the following in reference to the course of the Law and Order League in that city:

"Informations to the number of one hundred were made before Alderman Rohe yesterday by the Law and Order Society against agents, carriers, and business office clerks of the Leader, Dispatch, and Press, the only Sunday papers here. The informations were made under the Blue Laws of 1794, which the country members of the Legislature refuse to repeal.

"The Law and Order Society is a very unpopular body and the three papers mentioned, are making it hot for the organization by means of editorials and cartoons. The Society has been securing the arrest of poor widows, and invalids of both sexes, for the Sunday sale of candy, ice cream, soda water and cigars.

Alexander Wishart, formerly a captain in the United States regular army, was until recently agent of the Society, and active in these prosecutions. Now he is located in Newark, New Jersey, where he will begin a similar crusade. A constable from the rural districts has been installed as Wishart's successor.

"If the Sunday papers are pressed too hard they may retaliate by instigating prosecutions against the Monday morning papers, a large portion of their labor being performed on Sunday. Several aldermen in this city have reaped a harvest by law and order prosecutions, and now the State, through its local agent, is investigating the disposition of the moneys received for fines."
