## A State Can Not Be a Theocracy.

As is the reputation of Joshua as also in the nomination of the judges who governed Israel, the people accepted them as rulers appointed of Heaven, through whom the will of God was to be revealed. In the days of Samuel the people demanded, by the people, restless under that form of government, and asked to be governed by kings as were all the other nations around them. 1 Sam. 8:4, 5. The Lord instructed Samuel to grant their request, if, after telling them what hard service such a change would bring them, they should still persist in their desire. According to Samuel\'s bid them, from God, a king would rob them of their sons to be his servants and soldiers, and that he would take their fields, vineyards, and olive gardens, with a portion of their flocks; and before them upon the citizens of State. But the people refused to heed the warning, and cried still more earnestly: "Nay; but we will have a king over us."

And yet God did not desert that people. He pointed out through his prophet men who should be their king. They had no way whatever in the selection. Saul rejected the direction of God in governing the people, and was therefore deprived of his kingly office, to give place to another of God\'s chosen rulers. David was anointed by Samuel to govern Israel in God\'s name. Solomon succeeded him, and "sat on the throne of the Lord as king instead of David his father." 1 Chron. 29:23. The "throne of the Lord" was occupied by a succession of kings, each committing his own ideas of government, more or less, with the instructions for this purpose formerly given by Jehovah, until the kingdom of Israel could no longer be recognized of God as the government which he had appointed. He therefore sent his prophets to be heard by the other nations, exclaiming: "I will overturn, overturn, overturn it: and it shall be no more till he come whose right it is; and I will give it him." Ezek. 17:16-19 and 21:25-27.

It will be noticed that the theocracy thus established, which was the true one and only, never established religion. Its work, in its existence, was confined to believers in God and his word, and in no sense was it intended for the other nations of the earth. Even though God ruled "over all the kingdoms of the heathen," (2 Chron. 20:6,) he could be considered of none of those to submit to the forms of government he prescribed for his people. Upon relinquishing the theocracy, God said, "I shall be no more, to cause them whose right it is; and I will give it him." To whom did this statement refer? When Christ was about to appear as the world\'s Redeemer, it was said by his mother: "He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest; and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David; and he shall secure the house of Jacob forever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end." Luke 1:32, 33, 35.

But did Christ receive this kingdom while here on earth? Certainly he did not; for just before his crucifixion he said to Pilate: "My kingdom is not of this world." John 18:36. After his resurrection, and just as he was about to ascend to heaven, his disciples asked him if he would not restore the kingdom to Israel? Acts 1:6. This question and the Saviour\'s reply show that he had not then done so. He had, however, before that promised that his disciples should judge the tribes of Israel when he should sit in the throne of his glory. Matt. 19:28. But not to the time when he should occupy that position he definitely said: "When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit on the throne of his glory." Matt. 25:31. The connection of this text shows that at the coming of Christ the affairs of the universe are to be arranged, and all nations are called to stand before Christ in the final judgment, so that a civil and temporal king can never again lord as the nations of the world command in their present state.

Even though the Scriptures did not reveal the truth on this point so clearly, a moment\'s thought would show that this must be the case; for no nation or government now to be found in which all its members are loyal to God in the same sense as were the true Israelites. A man may not only be a king, but as a Father also. His rule over them was, therefore, one of spiritual watch care over their morals, as well as over their temporal interests. A true theocracy is, in fact, the blending of civil and religious rule made under one head of government. Such a state of things can not necessarily include documentary instructions in both of these branches, from the same source and through the same set of officers. But in a mixed polity like our earthly government, this could not be done with God\'s sanction; for he has expressly said that his people are to have no part with infidels; no connection with wicked men who will not acknowledge Christ, in order for him to be a Father unto them, they must come out from among, and be separate from such unholy connections. 2 Cor. 6:14-18.

From it will be seen how utterly impossible it would be to mix in the disorderliness of any nation the interests of religious teaching. In purely civil things all the subjects of a State or nation may be easily governed alike; it does not matter not what differences of religious belief may exist then discriminating practically in their duty to God, the common interest of all demands that a uniform, just, governing alike the right and privilege of each and all shall be enacted.
