THE Law and Order League of Pittsburg is undertaking in earnest the championship of the cause of the American Sabbath Union, and begins its campaign for enforced Sunday observance by obtaining warrants for the arrest of all the employes of the newspapers and the Union News Company, of Pittsburg, not forgetting the news agents and paper carriers who sell and deliver the Sunday papers. The action is brought under the old Pennsylvania Sunday law of 1794, which has been virtually a dead letter for nearly a century. It is understood that it is the intention of the Law and Order League to proceed against the proprietors of Pittsburg Sunday papers, also, under the same antiquated act. It is evident that the Sabbath Union intends to use its much vaunted sword arm with deadly effect in Pittsburg. Those who are noting the rapidly developing events in the progress of religious legislation, will look with interest to see the result of this crusade by which the management of the Christian Statesman celebrates the entrance of their paper into its new home. No doubt the papers of Pittsburg in general will appreciate the courtesy which marks its advent among them.
