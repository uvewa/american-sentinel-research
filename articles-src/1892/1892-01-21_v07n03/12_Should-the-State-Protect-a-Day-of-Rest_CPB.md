The following affirmative answer to this question is by President Merrill E. Gates, LL.D., in the American Sabbath. We quote it only for comment:—

Business men and professional men, stimulated to extreme exertion by rivalry and competition, kept at the highest tension by the telegraph, pursued to their homes and into their hours of sleep by the incessant click of the "ticker" and the imperious bell of the telephone, must have a day of rest. Already, after ten years of the telephone, nervous diseases are painfully prevalent. High pressure in business and in social life is followed by depression of spirits and exhaustion of nerve-force and brain-power. Never was the day of rest more inperatively needed, more evidently indispensable to man's welfare, than in these days of railroads, electricity, and ceaseless newspaper reading. Stop the hurry one day in seven! Let the tired brain-worker as well as the weary laborer, cease from his customary tasks. Shut out from your home the Sunday newspaper, which, if you let it enter, will fill the day of peace with the same ceaseless din of strife and turmoil and crime that fills the atmosphere of every-day life. In quietness, and restfully, for body, mind, and soul, let the day be kept as the Lord's Day, as a Christian Sunday, not as a Jewish Sabbath.

The proper spiritual use of the day must of course, be entirely voluntary. Its observance as a day of quiet, of cessation from business, is to be enforced by law only on the ground that men are to be restrained from whatever would disturb or interfere with the worship of others or their due observance of the day. What this has been secured by law and is enforced by public opinion and by faithful officers of the law, all is done which the State can do. Education and Christian influence must do the rest. "The Church is a spiritual body, acting on the State only by the moral and spiritual forces of individual persons." So much as to the State and our duty in this matter as citizens.

As Christians, we find the highest warrant for the observance of the day in the directly revealed command of God enforced by the consciousness of our own need of time for the especial consideration of spiritual truth.

Nothing in all this affords the slightest reason for Sunday laws. "Business and professional" men need not be "pursued to their homes and into their hours of sleep by the incessant click of the 'ticker' and the imperious bell of the telephone," unless, because of greed, they will to have it so. The State has no duty to protect such victims of their own avarice.

The same is true of the Sunday paper; it has no power to force its way into any man's house. The man who does not order or buy the Sunday paper, will not be disturbed by it. Those who do not want the Sunday paper need not have it.

"The proper spiritual use of the day must," indeed, be voluntary, and so should every other use of that or any other day. Every man's time is his own, and the State has no just right to deprive him of any portion of it. Sunday laws, so far as they now exist, fail almost utterly to prohibit the very kinds of work that tend most to disturb those who desire quiet upon that day. And not only so, but numerous cases could, as our readers know, be cited in which quiet farm labor and other quiet private work, which could not possibly disturb anybody, has been severely punished, under the laws which are professedly designed only to protect those who desire to keep the day.

The fact is, as appears in the extract quoted from President Gates, Sunday laws are wholly religious, and are designed to at least foster the religious observance of the day. Were it not for the popular notion that God requires Sunday rest, we would hear nothing of the necessity for enforced Sunday rest.
