THE following is from the Star, of Washington, D. C.:

"Assistant Secretary Nettleton has written a letter to Mrs. S. D. La Fetra and Mrs. Mary E. Catlin, of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, in regard to closing the Barge Office at New York on Sundays.

"He calls attention to the letter he wrote to the Commissioner of Immigration at that port, in August last, on this subject, showing that it is the wish and purpose of the Treasury Department to suspend Sunday work in the matter of landing immigrants just so far as it can be done without causing discomfort and distress among the immigrants, which, he says, no humane citizen would care to produce.

"He says, 'It's my hope that with the cooperation of the steamship companies, Sunday work can be practically abolished, during a large portion of the year.' He assured the ladies that the Department needed no urging in the matter of 'seeing that all of its employes have that Sunday rest which nature so clearly requires and to which the law entitles them, except when labors of necessity or charity prevent.'"
