# Uncertainties Log - v07n03 (1892-01-21)

No significant uncertainties encountered. The OCR file was generally clear and readable. Some minor observations:

1. **Author initials**: All author initials were clearly marked at the end of articles and matched known authors.

2. **Reprinted articles**: Source attributions were clear (e.g., "—*Evening Post*", "Word and Work").

3. **Table formatting**: The Law and Order League constitution tables were preserved as markdown tables from the OCR.

4. **Scripture references**: Minor potential OCR error in article 03 - "Isa. 68:13, 14" (should likely be Isaiah 58:13-14, but transcribed exactly as printed).

5. **Author "J. O. CORLISS"**: Article 05 signed "J. O. CORLISS" - this author not in the known authors list, transcribed as given.

All text transcribed exactly as it appeared in the OCR file, preserving original spelling, punctuation, and formatting.
