THE progress of the development of the ideas of governmental paternalism in the Old World, is quite rapid. Emperor William of Germany has projected a grand cathedral, at Berlin, to cost $2,500,000, to be the tabernacle of the State religion. Having thus provided for the distribution of spiritual food of the prescribed quality to his subjects, the "imperial cooking school" is to be established from which to direct their material diet. In Switzerland, the government has assumed control of the banking system, and proposes to nationalize the water power. Thus it is that the process of papal development goes on in all the different interests of life, both spiritual and material.
