THE Barge Office is now closed on Sundays, and no immigrants permitted to land on that day, consequent upon imperative orders from the Secretary of the Treasury. It is supposed that the order will be made permanent, and hereafter those passengers arriving too late to disembark on Saturday, will be obliged to remain on shipboard until Monday morning; thirty-six hours more, in some cases, in which to develop ship fever and other diseases incident upon steerage travel in ocean steamers.
