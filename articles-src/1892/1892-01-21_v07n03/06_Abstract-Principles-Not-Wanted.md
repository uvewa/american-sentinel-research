## Abstract Principles Not Wanted.

It seems that the lately elected Corresponding Secretary of the American Sabbath Union has accepted and published the false ideas in reference to the principles of THE AMERICAN SENTINEL, the National Religious Liberty Association, and the Seventh-day Adventists, as regards religious legislation, which Sunday-law workers have so industriously circulated. This inability of those who favor religious legislation upon religious subjects to understand that all who oppose them do so from love of their abstract principles of religious and civil right and duty, and from no selfish through or purpose whatever, is phenomenal. So persistent is this misunderstanding, it would seem a moral impossibility for them to conceive of any one acting from higher motives of abstract right. If that shall stand by and hear Christ say, "Father forgive them for they know not what they do," they would have asked what possible advantage he could be expected to gain from such a speech as that.

The Corresponding Secretary of the American Sentinel Union, in an article in the *Boston Investigator,* gives evidence in his mistaken bias as to the grounds of opposition to religious laws and makes an uncountable quotation from some public journal now before us in this paragraph.

Said one to a prominent Adventist who was exhibiting and distributing tracts in opposition to the observance of the old Jewish Sabbath that was to be enforced:—"Your people don't feel compelled to work for its enforcement!"

The palpable error of any such statement as this is so fully and satisfactorily set forth in the *Investigator* of December 10, by C. H. Reynolds, Secretary, Washington Secular Union, that the article is here reproduced almost entire:—

"This is a grave persecution of ideas. Every prominent Seventh-day Adventist, in speaking against the Sunday law is most thoroughly poised upon the subject. It would, therefore, be entirely superfluous for each one to have to make such reply. The concentrated energy gave the evidence that this unprovoked attack upon our most efficient and influential co-workers was a mistake and a misrepresentation of their position and motives.

"The Seventh-day Adventists are, without exception, the opponents of any union between Church and State, and national, State, or municipal laws for the regulation of practices which are religious in character. The Seventh-day Adventist Religious Liberty Association is a large and powerful organization, with offices at New York City, Washington, D. C., Chicago, Oakland, California, and Battle Creek, Michigan. Its motto is: 'Equal and exact justice to all.' Keep the State and Church forever separate was published and advocated principles it has published in a devoted principle, set and 'This is a grave persecution of ideas.'

"We believe it in all this, and should be the privilege, of every man to worship according to the dictation of his own conscience." "And we deny the right of any civil government to legislate on religious matters."

To reprint in an AMERICAN SENTINEL, a most fertile, able and consistent exposition of Sunday laws, religious exercises in our public schools, and the exemption of Church property from taxation.

The Seventh-day Adventist have written, published and distributed many pieces of literature advocating the abolition of all Sunday laws and the casting of that subjects in action for the entire and complete divorce of Church and State, in any case work during the past three years, than the American Secular Union, if the malicious have ever distributed from the day of its first inception up to the present.

To repeat in an AMERICAN SENTINEL, a most fertile, able and consistent opposition of Sunday laws, religious exercises in our public schools, and the exemption of Church property from taxation.

The Seventh-day Adventist have written, published and distributed many pieces of literature advocating the abolition of all Sunday laws, and the casting of the subjects as an argument in favor of the entire and complete divorce of Church and State, in any case work during the past three years, than the American Secular Union, if the malicious have ever distributed from the day of its first inception up to the present time.

By their honored and accredited exponent, Alonzo T. Jones, editor of THE AMERICAN SENTINEL. Before that committee this very point was brought out clearly and distinctly, over and over again. I give brief quotations:—

*Senator Blair*—"Would it be your position to use your rights in this case?" in regard it voted of saying to say "the Lord" was.

*Mr. Jones*—No, sir.

*Senator Blair*—Yes, of course it was framed as a religion test day, and the day of rest. On the seventh day the rest day the way which we observe; of this bill proposed to promote its observance or to compel men to do work upon that day; we would oppose it just as strongly as we oppose it now.

*Senator Blair*—We oppose all Sunday laws of all countries in all nations.

*Senator Blair*—Yes, as an American, and of Sunday law?

*Mr. Jones*—Yes. We are against every Sunday law that was ever made in this world from the first enacted by Constantine to this one now before us; and we would be against a Sabbath law, a Saturday law, if it were proposed; for that would be equally wrong.

"—and this is constantly the tenacious claim of every one of their papers, publications, and ministers, and heartily endorsed by every Seventh-day Adventist know to be untrue."

"This whole argument of Elder Jones has been published in pamphlet form, and thousands of copies have been distributed."

"Nor is it the only case. On... more than on February 18, 1890, the committee on the District of Columbia, held a hearing on a Sunday bill, introduced by Mr. W. C. P. Breckinridge. The Seventh-day Adventist Sentinel was heard before this committee. I quote from the verbatim report of the session:—"

*The Chairman*—We desire to know in what respect—

*Mr. Jones*—"I speak in behalf of the Seventh-day Adventists, and the Religious Liberty Association, and are pastor. I agree or has been affirmed so far, to speak in behalf of a Sunday observance." *For from it,* gentleman of the committee. If this bill S.S. 3254 was to have incorporated into it, instead of "Sunday," the rest of the day of the week, the words "Saturday, or the seventh day of the week" no one in this one could oppose it stronger than I.

*Mr. Jones*—"Objects that on the subject of religion of whatever interfering with the first clause entered. Therefore the Seventh-day Adventists while clearly objecting would more emphatically say, with emphasis upon every word: We protest emphatically against this legislation, for the same pro forma, it is time for all the people to declare, as men honestly and conscientiously believe before God; and of right ought to be, free and independent of all entanglements of religious establishments."

In the case of State of Tennessee vs. King, Judge Hammond in his decisions of King\'s case has thus taken fundamental statement as those of the Corresponding Secretary of the American Secular Union. A full retraction was published in THE AMERICAN SENTINEL of November 19, giving copy of a letter from Mr. Jones to Elder E. A. Olsen, President of the General Conference (the highest office in the Seventh-day Adventist ranks).

"Mr. Jones quoted the statement made by the judge, that the (King\'s case) were religious feelings or fanaticism (in) that the seventh day of the week, instead of the first, should be set apart for the day of public rest and religious practices. This is what he really believes and teaches, and his sect; and not that each individual shall select his own day of public rest and his own day of labor,' and asked, 'is that so?' Elder Olsen replied:

'I have been personally connected with the Seventh day Adventist denomination for more than thirty years, and I am firmly set not to entertain formally for the past twenty years on its council, and am familiar with its purposes. Our belief and wish is directly the opposite of that held by those previously quoted.'

"There is no excuse for an avowed opponent of secularism being ignorant of the truth."

"The Corresponding Secretary of the American Secular Union has published but a few true facts relative to the collection of statements which are not only utterly unfounded, but which public and official records show to be untrue, and which all who have ever briefly conversed with any intelligent Seventh-day Adventist know to be untrue."
