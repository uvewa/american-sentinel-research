THE Nineteenth Century Club, of this city, was recently enlivened by a discussion of the Sabbath question at one of its meetings, by Col. Elliott F. Shepard and Rev. Dr. A. H. Lewis, of the Seventh-day Baptist Church. Colonel Shepard indulged in the usual Sunday arguments, while Dr. Lewis showed plainly, both from sacred and profane history, that Saturday and not Sunday is the Bible Sabbath. He defended the opening of museums on Sunday, on the ground that as the State requires idleness on Sunday, it should provide places of resort less hurtful than the saloons. He was, however, opposed to any State interference in the matter of Sabbath observance. The doctor was frequently and heartily applauded, and evidently had the sympathy of his audience.
