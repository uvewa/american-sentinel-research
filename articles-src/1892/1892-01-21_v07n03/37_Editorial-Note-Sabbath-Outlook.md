THAT excellent publication, the Outlook, a Sabbath quarterly, Rev. A. H. Lewis, D. D., editor, formerly published at Alfred Centre, has been removed to this city, and enters upon its tenth volume as a monthly. It will hereafter be known as the Sabbath Outlook. The Outlook will continue to educate its many readers along the same lines of truth formerly followed. But as a monthly the articles are shorter and more varied, making it altogether a more readable and popular magazine. For the information of those not acquainted with it we give the following table of contents of the January number:—

Christian Greeting to each Reader: Professor Adolph Harnack on the Paganizing Christianity; Oriental Christianity; Mr. Crafts' "Whole Constellation" Sunday Law; Indifference of Christians Concerning Sunday; Enforcing Sunday Law on a Railroad Company; The Sabbath and Sunday, the Difference Between Them; Compelling Christians to Keep Sunday; "Where Lies the Difficulty?" Holy-day or Holiday? Religion the only Basis of Sabbathism; Book Notices.

Subscription price, 50 cents per year.
Address, Sabbath Outlook, Room 100, Bible House, New York City.
