THE NEW YORK WORLD has opened a column to women for the expression of their views of the Sunday closing of the World's Fair. At the head of the column it says:—

Twelve out of thirteen of the Board of Women Managers of the exhibit of the State of New York for the World's Fair, have protested against the action of the General Manager in deciding to close the Fair on Sunday. It would be interesting to know how women generally regard this matter. Are the twelve women of the board alone in their opinion or do all the women in the country stand as twelve to one in favor of opening the Fair every day of the week? These columns are open to a discussion of the question. Every woman is invited to cast her vote for or against the closing of the Fair on Sunday and to state her reasons. No vote will be recorded unless accompanied by the voter's name and address. These will be published or not, according to the voter's wish.

In its issue of Sept. 22, the World records the vote as five to one in favor of Sunday opening. A Brooklyn woman in the course of a pungently forcible expression of her views says most emphatically, "No force bill methods will avail in church matters." Certainly they will not avail to enforce true religion.
