THE utter inconsistency of a union of religion and the State has just received a very forcible illustration. The Supreme Court of the United States, in its already famous decision of the 29th of last February, embodied as a part of that decision the following words from Chancellor Kent, of New York, the "famous commentator on American law:"—

The people of the State . . . profess the general doctrines of Christianity as the rule of their faith and practice; and to scandalize the author of these doctrines is not only, in a religious point of view, extremely impious, but even in respect to obligations due to society, it is a gross violation of decency and good order. . . . The free, equal, and undisturbed enjoyment of religious opinion, whatever it may be, and free and equal discussions on any religious subjects, is granted and secured; but to revile with malicious, blasphemous contempt, the religion professed by almost the whole community, is an abuse of that right. Nor are we bound by any expression of the Constitution, as some have strangely supposed, either not to punish at all, or to punish indiscriminately, the like attacks upon the religion of Mahomet or the Grand Lama; and for this plain reason, that the case assumes that we are a Christian people, and the morality of this country is deeply engrafted upon Christianity, and not upon the doctrines or worship of these impostors.

In thus speaking the Supreme Court declares that Christianity (the religion of Jesus Christ) is the true, or orthodox religion, and that all others are impostures; for these two false religions that are named must be considered as representing all false religions as distinguished from Christianity. But further, the Court also gives fair warning that if the worshipers of any of these systems shall be attacked because of their faith, they are not entitled to protection, for their religion is an imposture.

Now it so happened that, not far from the time that our Christian (?) Nation was thus declaring through its highest judicial authority that Mahometanism was heretical and not entitled to protection, some zealous Mahometans became imbued with the very same sentiment concerning Christianity.

In Turkey the Church and the State are united, and Mahometanism is the national religion, just as Christianity has been declared to be the religion of our Nation, and "to scandalize the author of these doctrines (their prophet, Mahomet), is not only, in a religious point of view, extremely impious, but even in respect to obligations due society, it is a gross violation of decency and good order." Yet Christian missionaries from the United States of America are there, telling those worshipers of Mahomet that they have been deceived, that Mahomet was no prophet but only a pretender, and, in short, scandalizing the author of their religion. We believe that these statements are true, in fact, and recognize Mahomet only as a false prophet; but it does not look that way to his followers, but must appear as a reviling "with malicious, blasphemous contempt, the religion professed by almost the whole community." So it was perfectly natural, and perfectly legal also, for them to arise in righteous indignation and suppress this "gross violation of decency and good order." This they proceeded to do, and they went at it in a very energetic manner; that is, they plundered and burned the houses and schools of the missionaries, and grossly assaulted the persons of the missionaries themselves.

The poor missionaries appealed to the Turkish Government for protection. But they were met with the indifference that comes from the idea that we are not bound by any expression of the Constitution, as some have strangely supposed, to punish indiscriminately the like attacks upon the religion of Jesus Christ or the Grand Lama; and for this plain reason, that the case assumes that we are a Mahometan people, and the morality of the country is deeply engrafted upon Mahometanism and not upon the doctrines of these impostors.

Of course the missionaries next appealed to the United States for a redress of their grievances; and our Christian (?) Government is now demanding an indemnity for these outrages.

This demand will probably be acceded to, because the United States is a powerful nation and Turkey is very weak. But there is no justice in such a demand by our Government, for the Turks were only doing what our Supreme Court had just declared to be proper and right. Nor can the churches of our land call it persecution, for the majority of them have rejoiced in the judicial decision herein cited; and, according to that, those missionaries were certainly guilty of scandalizing the author of the Turkish religion, and so were guilty of "a gross violation of the decency and good order" of the community in which they lived.

This is not written in defense of those outrages, for the writer has the most hearty sympathy for those earnest, godly missionaries who have taken their lives in their hands to carry the glad tidings to those who sit in darkness. But he has just as much respect, and no more, for Church and State in Turkey as in the United States of America. If it is right for a civil court in the United States to declare what is the true religion and what the false, it is right for the Turkish Government to make a like decision for Turkey. If it is "a gross violation of decency and good order" in the United States to scandalize the author of the national religion of the United States, then it is a gross violation of decency and good order to so revile the author of the Turkish religion in Turkey. If we are not bound to punish attacks upon Mahometanism in a Christian nation, they are not bound to punish attacks upon Christianity in a Mahometan nation. The principle is that the majority have a right to declare that the religion of the minority is heretical, and that is a part and parcel of the mystery of iniquity that fostered the Inquisition in Europe during the Dark Ages, and expects some day to bring to an end—by the same means, of course—religious liberty in the United States of America.
