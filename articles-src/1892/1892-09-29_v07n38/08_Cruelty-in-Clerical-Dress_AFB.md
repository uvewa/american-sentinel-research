# Cruelty in Clerical Dress.

To the person who imagines that the spirit of religious persecution cannot survive in this country, we submit the following conversation held recently passed, in substance, between Rev. McLean, Secretary of the College of Bishops of the American Sabbath Union, and A. F. Ballenger, Secretary of the National Religious Liberty Association:—

MR. MCLEAN.—The Seventh-day Adventists are not the only ones who go in securing Sunday laws. They are the only ones who go in securing Sunday laws; and it is an outrage. And if they are in conflict they are protected by some of the churches, but the laws give them the right to enforce attendance in the streets in the church guard.

*Mr. B.*—Well, let me ask you if the State of Missouri has the right to compel one to go to church?

*Mr. M.*—Christians should obey the law.

*Mr. B.*—Yes, that is true; but is it right to have a law requiring us to go to church? ... that there, representing laws is how down to the image to the beast. Suppose the State should pass a law that would compel you to rest the seventh day of the week; would you keep it?

*Mr. M.*—No! I would not regard such a law at all.

*Mr. B.*—Then if it is right for you to disobey a wicked law, to sin, and you know Acts ... and is also your free American.

*Mr. M.*—I will state what I ...

*Mr. B.*—

> "To me, and will continue to oppose it."

*Mr. B.*—Then you are opposed to repealing laws that are unjust, are you?

*Mr. M.*—I don't know that the Adventists are not working on their farms on Sunday.

*Mr. B.*—I am glad I asked. I will use your words ... against them before the Supreme Court. ...

*Mr. M.*—(excitedly:) "I didn't say that. I didn't mean it! I will'm n't n't."

That is, he had recommended words with which to make it stronger, and the result was—

A. F. B.
