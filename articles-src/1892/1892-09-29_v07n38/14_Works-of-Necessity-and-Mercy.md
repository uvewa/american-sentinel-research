Of the saving clause, "Except works of necessity and mercy," usually found in Sunday laws, the Baptist Examiner says:

There has been of late a notable expansion of men's ideas of what constitute works of necessity and mercy. Great cities and modern conditions of living have made some things necessary that were not so formerly. In a rural community families may easily provide themselves with food, beforehand, and can ride to church in their own carriages. It would be a cruelty to the poor in our cities, unable to buy ice or provide proper storage, to forbid them to buy food early Sunday mornings, especially milk, and if any but the rich ride to church it must be in public cars.

This paragraph is worthy of more than passing notice, because while it is seemingly very liberal, it is in fact extremely narrow. The idea of the writer clearly is to restrict all travel on Sunday to church going. It is for that purpose that the cars must run; that is the "necessity" which exists for public conveyances upon the first day of the week. People may be permitted in mercy to buy food on Sunday to prevent them from starving; from "necessity" to ride to church. The poor man who wants to go elsewhere may possibly be permitted to walk, provided he does it reverently.
