# "In God Is It?"

UPON the heading, "Exposition Sunday," the *Tribune* says:

The closing stanzas of Prof. John K. Paines' Columbus Ode, written to be performed at the dedication of the Exposition buildings at Jackson Park on October 21:—

From year to year, with widening reach of thought,

*From land to land, with all of heroism,*

What we would like to know is, *how is it* in the mind?

> Really, we would like to know what is meant by the "brotherhood of all religions" and the "brotherhood of peace" without the aid of Christ is not the brotherhood of peace.

It is not our purpose—to explain the meaning of the "Columbian Ode"—what is its birth? Mr. Paine could probably do that better than any one else. Neither do we propose answering any question, but rather ask one. The *Cynosure* implies that God is not in the "Columbus March and Cynosure" would be in it— any more if it contained the couplet,— "From fear free from all worship and all blame."

To be more explicit, would a formal recognition of God by a godless poet and by a godless age be a recognition? Must not all acceptable service be in spirit and in truth? When a man says he is eighteen hundred years ago that "this nation is God's must obey him how he is, and that he is a reminder of them that diligently seek him." Would God be in the familiar words:—

> "I have read for once when a blessing of if they did not come willing my song hearts full of "praise to him, any more than he was in the same words sung by the multitudes who before martyring Christ triumphantly—Certainly not. Then why does the *Cynosure* imitate, upon 'Exposition Sunday.'
