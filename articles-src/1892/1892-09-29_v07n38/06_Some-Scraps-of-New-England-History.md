# Some Scraps of New England History.

## THE SUFFERINGS OF THE QUAKERS.

THE first article calls for the statement that the laws against the Quakers were not allowed to become a dead letter but were enforced in the regular Puritan way. Just what that way will was will appear in the following scraps of history. In 1657 by Governor Endicott:

> I wish to let you for reconsider, and to require and command you to ... be sure to take care, in each case of John Copeland, Christopher Holder, and the others, Quakers, "such as shall be in their hands, and therefore against the rule if immediately, 'punished.'"

In the latter part of the same year the following order was issued by the court:—

> We sentence, the Quaker Edward, to be whipped, wife and daughter of Lawrence Southwick also, of Massachusetts.

The Quakers were then imprisoned, presenting they have no assistance, for if such who, which was made upon account of the dance of these laws—they shall be sold to any of several countries and shall be fully empowered to sell the said Lawrence Southwick and others.

With this latter sentence there is connected an important series of events. At Southwick, wife and daughter of Lawrence Southwick, Lawrence Southwick had who had been members of the Salem church before the Quakers came. They had three children, Joseph, who was a man grown, and the two younger ones who were but mere youth. The old gentleman and his wife were arrested at the beginning of the year 1657, upon a charge of harboring Quakers. The old gentleman was released, but as a was found they was found upon it, a fine of about forty shillings. If they were not she they then left Massachusetts, after being known some of their friends. A man named ...with said he used the family at a place, church, and worshiped. But he was taken to Boston as a heretic. ... Cassandra Southwick and their son Joseph, were taken to Boston in the autumn. Upon their arrival there, February 4, without even the form of a trial, both were whipped and imprisoned eleven days, the mother especially weak. In cold, in addition to this, they were fined four pounds and thirteen shillings for, as it would; absence from church on Sunday, and their cattle were seized and sold to pay this fine.

The following summer two Quakers, William Leddra and William Brend came to Salem. They, with five others, among whom were Lawrence Southwick and his wife and had suffered, were arrested for meeting together as a Quaker meeting. This time the authorities concluded to break up the meeting, and put all together in a room in the house of correction and left them there, without food. Five days and nights were they shut up close. Food was denied them, unless they would work to pay for it. "In ways which were wrongfully confined," was Brend went five days without anything to eat. After this, however, on a slight thread of suffering, for on the second day of their imprisonment, they all were severely thrown back into the close room dark, and there they were kept nine days without fire, but the bare boards. On the second day two of the women asked the jailer if they could go if they would pay the constable's charge. The jailer said Yes, and they paid.

The next day, at the jail, a prisoner, having been brought before the court, the Jailer, Force to the elder Southwick, Bond with iron round his neck and hands in irons, and kept him in that state for sixteen hours, from five o'clock in the morning to nine o'clock at night.

The next day Brend was put to the mill to work; but he refused, saying that he would to his hands, as it would, as he could assembly and for that he refused and so from his place was worked, and to be refused, ... after his companion in the morning. The jailer used a pitched rope and began to beat him. He turned over his back and arms again and again. Unsatisfied with the result, he fetched another rope, thicker and stronger, and beat him. Brend said mildly: "Thou hast no bow to the law of the country, and for that he was beaten more cruelly. Then the jailer beat him upon his naked back to the highest degree unreasonable, since he was already bruised and beaten, and unable to work, having been given five days without food, as he was in prison; and now this unmerciful beaten. Yet having still unsatisfied, the jailer fetched rope on the poor man's maim bruised, and beaten him in the cruelest manner, with Violence laid foot more and severe whipping. His back and arms were bruised above, who, behold, this cruelty and with it him, whose this bloody cruelty while beaten and his rope had not failed him, he would not have been left. And for all this would give him the next morning as many blows again. The blows were so many that the blood must have brought the body of man, if he had nothing on with a steel equivalent to vent, that only on coming forward his neck, and may be coming from. His back and arms were bruised into one jelly, from shoulders to waste, in a most terrible manner. His body in ways, in bags under his arms, and so into his breast; his body was swollen so badly that the jailer expressed much surprise. A particular blow could not see. His blood hung down as it were in bags; and drawn upon the boards to extremely weak. Then the jailer expressed surprise; it was his strength failing, his body turned old; his eyes turned in his head, and his flesh to black and fell from his bones. His lips and hands grew cold; his tongue swollen, and he had for some time became without food. His body was so torn that life and death; his senses were gone, his feeling, nor hearing, nor all feeling or sense; and another coming in looked upon the tortured prisoner. His face was breathed to his nostrils.

The Governor, hearing of these things, declared "There is great punishment, you would hear to more, so as a decree of God," and the penalty for all, and thus the tortured prisoner. This State religion, the government. Endicott, on his own family doctor to attend Bond, but his energetic prescriptions prevailed, and the bonds he said would "rot from, of their bones. He, the boy, had for ..."
