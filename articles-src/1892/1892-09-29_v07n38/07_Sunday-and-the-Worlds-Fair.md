# Sunday and the World's Fair.

THERE is strong evidence of a considerable growing reaction throughout the country against the wave of extreme religious legislation in every exceptional provision that the World's Fair should be closed on Sunday.

> A notable instance of breadth of view was recently demonstrated by the recent action of the New York State Board of Commissioners for the World's Fair. This board, with the good sense for, enthusiastically adopted resolutions recommending that the great Exposition be opened on Sunday, thus enabling the poor of all nations to profit on that day by the unparalleled educational and gilded, uplifting exhibits, which it affords.

We are, perhaps, not strictly accurate in terming this evidence of a "reaction" against the wave of fanaticism. They were rather a symptom of "reaction." More enlightened and careful reasoning, and the evidence that the great mass of the people of this country, regardless of their personal opinions, are merely awakening to the fact that by their reply indicating a relatively small body of well meaning persons were enabled to force upon the citizens of the United States, and of other countries as well, a piece of religious legislation of a partial, sectarian order, by no means in keeping with the finer moral man should be permitted to observe the Sabbath according to his own conscience and not as others directed.

It is to be hoped that the next session of Congress will repeal the Sunday closing proviso, and will leave others of their choice or not attendance at the World's Fair on the Lord's day to be described the individual for himself. Those who consider it a sinful amusement to be thus enlightened and exhorted on that day should stay away by all means. Those who do not should not be forced to accept the independent view of the sabbatarian authorities.

THE NEW YORK *World* has opened a column to women for the expression of their views on the question of the Sunday closing of the World's Fair. At the head of the column it says:

> Twelve out of thirteen of the Board of Women Managers of the World's Columbian Exposition for the World's Fair, have protested against the closing of the Exposition on Sunday. At the same time no one knows how women generally regard this matter. Should the Exposition remain open, or be closed, on Sunday? Shall this woman be or do all the women in the country stand ready to add the force of opinion on the other disposition of the question. Every woman is in this entitled to one vote in this referendum. Each vote will be recorded unless accompanied by the name and address of the voter, but the vote of each will be published showing how each voted, labeled or not, according to the voter's wish.

It is in the hopes of 55 to 10, the *World* records the vote as five to one in favor of Sunday opening. A very large percentage of the women voting give forcible expression of her views any most emphatically. "So far the full attitude will await its church matters." Certainly they will not avail to enforce any.

The following is from a private letter written by a Seventh-day Adventist living in Atlanta, Ga.

> Monday last, two policemen visited the writer at his shoe shop and informed him that he must keep the Sabbath, meaning Sunday. I will not stay all .... He has the right to keep the seventh day, if he wants to; but Sunday is the day. ... We advise you to not violate the law; go to some church or stay in the house. ... Then go to some other country. Again, they often threated to "run him in," but he said he would be "accommodated." They referred to saloons and stores. Then told him that they had an ordinance requiring the closing the saloons every day in the week. ... They said: "Yes, but we don't enforce that. But I'll tell you what it is: you keep Sunday and you will change your doctrine;" but we think we will not.

These expressions show the Atlanta police to be faithful ministers of the National reform doctrine. Have the authorities of Atlanta given their sanction, largely to so suppressed unholy both on Sunday, and the closing of saloons, on Sunday, but it seems they do enforce the one and not the other. And so now they begin to attack those who have a principle to defend in the matter, and who are better men more worthy of their steel.

THE *Washington Post* after telling us in bold a subhead of the issue of September 8, on the movement started in Chicago to have the Fair opened Sunday, reprints President Harrison's original veto:

> Those propositions fairly state the case as viewed from both sides. But it takes two sides to make a contest, they fail to answer the strictly doctrinal views and difficulties of reconciliation interpreted in a most surely independent and discussion the matters more acceptable and more of the doctrine records from the position it has taken. Yet the fact that more of the women wish to see the opening of the major portion of the Exposition on Sunday has a significance which cannot be denied or ignored. It is a fact based upon statistics well calculated to make of them better and more intelligent citizens of this Republic, the sentiment expressed in a resolution adopted by the Woman's Board of Managers of the World's Fair is "for free and unrestricted opening of the Fair on Sunday—for the benefits of all classes."

> Besides failing to answer the strictly doctrinal objections they also fail most strictly to answer the fundamental objection that the civil law has no right to no authority over a religious observance, either to enforce or to abrogate.
