ABOUT as disingenuous a plea for Sunday laws as we have seen for some time, appeared a week or two since in the Baptist Examiner.

The prohibition for one day in the week of all labor save works of necessity and mercy is on the one hand no infringement of any man's liberty, nor on the other is it a recognition of the Church by the State. Nor does the State undertake to say how the day of rest shall be spent.

But what reason has the Examiner for thinking, or rather for saying, that "the prohibition for one day of the week of all labor, save works of necessity and mercy, is on the one hand no infringement of any man's liberty"? This city is strongly Roman Catholic, and tens of thousands of people in it observe Saint Patrick's day by refraining from labor and business. Suppose the aldermen were to pass an ordinance requiring all to rest on Saint Patrick's day, except those who conscientiously and regularly celebrate the battle of the Boyne, what would the Examiner think? and what would it say? Would it not say that the liberty of every Protestant in the city was infringed by the ordinance? It certainly would, and justly so too. But if the civil law may rightly require the observance of Sunday, why may it not do the same thing for other religious festivals? For while the Examiner denies that Sunday laws are a recognition of the Church by the State, the fact remains that Sunday laws exist solely for the reason that Sunday is a religious institution. Were it not so there would be no such thing as a Sunday law.

BUT the sophistry of the Examiner is more apparent when we place side by side two statements which appeared in the same article in its columns, but separated by several paragraphs:

The State does not undertake to say how the day of rest shall be spent.

When the Sunday holiday begins to nullify the Sunday rest day, the State should interfere.

That is, the State does not pretend to say how the day shall be spent, but it does say that it shall be spent neither as a working day nor as a holiday. The State leaves every man perfectly free to do just as he pleases on Sunday, provided he neither works nor plays! Wonderful freedom, which out of a possible three excludes two and leave the subject "free" to "choose" the third! But such is the freedom enjoyed under Sunday laws.
