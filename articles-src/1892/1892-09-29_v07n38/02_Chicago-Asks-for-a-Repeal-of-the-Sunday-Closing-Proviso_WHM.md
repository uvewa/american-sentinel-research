A PETITION, starting from Chicago, is being industriously circulated, asking for the repeal of the congressional action closing the World's Fair on Sunday. The Chicago Herald has announced that it will circulate the petition throughout the entire United States. After citing the paragraphs which it is asked should be repealed, the memorial gives, as reasons why Congress should reverse its previous action in this matter, the educational advantages of the Fair which should be denied to none: and that Sunday closing would inevitably flood the city on that day with an idle crowd which would tend to multiply crime beyond the capacity of the police to meet the situation. The last two clauses of the memorial read thus:—

That the largest opportunity should be given for admission to the grounds and buildings of the Fair on this day, and that some marked distinction should be made so as to have Sunday stand apart as a special day, such as stopping all machinery and labor connected with exhibits and allowing exhibitors who so desired to cover their displays.

That the entire matter of a Sunday as well as a week day Fair should be left by Congress in the hands of the regular World's Fair authorities.

This petition and memorial is nothing but a very superficial plea for the reversal of the Sunday closing action. While it makes that plea, it takes at the same time the position that "some marked distinction should be made so as to have Sunday stand apart as a special day," ignoring the true position that no one has a right in reality to make any distinction in this matter for anyone outside of himself and his own personal exhibit.

If it were possible that this petition could be brought before all those in this country who sympathize with it, and signed by them, it is very certain that on its presentation Congress would repeal the Sunday closing proviso. It is not likely, however, that enough interest will be taken in it to accomplish any such thing. But even if this should be done, on a petition so worded, and for the reasons there related, with the acknowledgment there made, the legislative attitude as regards religion which the central Government has taken would remain unchanged.

The actual and valid reasons upon which this memorial should have been based have been entirely ignored. Has it become a settled conviction, already, in the minds of the people that the First Amendment to the Constitution has been interpreted out of existence by the Supreme Court, and that now it is perfectly proper for Congress to pass laws respecting the establishing of religion? How long since Congress has been constitutionally endowed with the power to pass legislation impairing the obligation of contracts previously entered into, that no mention should be made of such a plea in this memorial? When has Congress purchased the World's Fair site, of the State of Illinois, by the consent of the Legislature of the State, that it should assume to legislate either directly or indirectly as to its municipal control? Why does not this memorial ask these questions and make these pleas? Is it because constitutional government in this country is a thing of the past, and already we are under the rule of an oligarchy? Do these petitioners mean to acknowledge this? or do they wish to protest against it? If this is a protest, why do they not protest? Why not place themselves frankly and intelligently upon the righteous principle, and not tamely yield to the unrighteous enactment, only asking that it be remitted in their individual case to serve their selfish interests?

The Mail and Express reports Mr. Edward F. Crogin, of Chicago, as saying:

No attempt has been made to answer the argument that no opening on Sunday is in accordance with the unanimous opinion of the United States Supreme Court that this is a Christian Nation.

Is this statement true?—It is. Outside of THE AMERICAN SENTINEL and a few of its supporters scarcely a voice has been raised in all this Nation to expose the specious fallacies of that decision. Are there no learned lawyers or judges in the city of Chicago competent to realize the lack of law, of logic, and of Christianity which are the distinguishing features of this decision? If there are, why do they not speak?

Emboldened by their failure to speak in any of these particulars the Mail and Express makes the friends of Sunday closing say that "the Fair will be under the control of the United States Government, and not under the control of the local board, and no judge in Cook County would have any jurisdiction whatever." Do the judges and lawyers of Cook County acknowledge any such oligarchy? If not, why not speak?
