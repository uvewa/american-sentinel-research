[The following article from the Christliche Welt, Leipzig, for which we are, however, indebted to the Literary Digest, shows plainly that the claim that Sunday is the Sabbath by divine authority, is fraudulent. It is for this reason that we publish it. We are not in sympathy with the idea that the original Sabbath was ever abrogated by its Author.]

As far as we can now learn, the Sunday is a creation of Gentile Christianity. . . . Certain it is, however, that the Jewish observance of the Sabbath exercised a material influence on the introduction of the first day of the week in the Christian Church. This is all the more certain because there existed few, if any, congregations composed entirely of Gentile Christians. But of a transference to Sunday of the ideas associated with the Jewish Sabbath, no mention or hint is given in the entire Christian literature of the times. . . . Accordingly, too, there are no signs to show that the early Christians modeled their Sunday observance after the methods and manners of the Jewish Sabbath observance. The conception of Sunday was not so much as a day of rest, but rather as a joyful remembrance of the resurrection of the Lord, as a sacred day of worship and praise (Kultustag), as a day for the assembling of the congregation.

In early post-apostolic times, and in the age of the old Catholic Church, no material changes were made in this regard. Nearly all the Christian authors of this age emphasize the difference and distinction between the Christian Sunday and the Jewish Sabbath. In all the first five centuries of the Christian Church there is not a single Christian author who regards the Christian Sunday as a continuation of the Jewish Sabbath, or declares the former to be a divine ordinance. The data on this point are found in Zahn's Geschichte des Sonntags vornehmlich in der alten Kirche, Hanover, 1878. Occasionally, the writers of this period contrast the two days, but this is always done only to emphasize the difference between them. In the Old Testament command to observe the Sabbath, which in its literal application referred to the Jews as a nation, the Patristic writers recognized a deeper principle of eternal application, namely, the withdrawal from self-work and from sin, for the purpose of serving the Lord in his sanctuary. This moral behest, however, was accepted as applicable not only to one time or place, but as valid for the entire life. Understood in this sense, the Sabbath command finds its fulfillment neither in the Jewish Sabbath nor in the Christian Sunday. The moral principle in the Sabbath command was thus recognized by the early Christians, but not its legal features. As the true motives for the observance of the Lord's day they assign, not the Sabbath of the Jews, but the resurrection of the Lord. It is this great event that gives this day its joyful sanctity.

When Christianity became the State Church in the days of Constantine the Great, a material change took place in motives of Sunday observance. As now organized the Church became also a great political power. This made it all the more natural for the Jewish hierarchical system to look to Old Testament models and methods, especially in exercising its power. In the doctrine of Sunday there was indeed little or no change for three centuries, yet the practice of the Church began to degenerate to a legalistic stage. The famous edict of Constantine on the Sunday question was issued on March 7th, 321. By this document the Christian Sunday became the legal holiday of the empire; at any rate its observance as a day of rest is made obligatory. But nothing is more noteworthy in this rescript than the fact that Constantine in this writing does not with a single word appeal to the Old Testament Sabbath law. It is true that in this innovation of the Emperor, the prime motive was of a political character; but the character and contents of the document are significant as to the idea of the Sunday then current. From this time on, Emperor and Synods began to issue legal ordinances for the observance of Sunday, but never because of the Sabbath command of the Old Testament. Political interests and public morals were the controlling factors in these measures.

The legal observance of the Sunday on the basis of the Decalogue first begins to appear in the Western Church in the times of Gregory II. In connection with this is the other phenomenon that the emphasis in the observance of the Lord's day is no longer sought in the worship and praise of the Christian people, but in strict and stringent abstinence from manual labor. The great dogmatician of the Middle Ages, Thomas Aquinas, gave the scientific-theological formula to the dogma in this view. The law became an edict of the Church as well as of God, and a test of the obedience of the Christians, which obedience was their prime duty. The Church commands attendance at church and mass, promising rich reward for such obedience. *Opera servilia* are prohibited; *opera liberalia* are allowed.

The German Reformation proceeded from the doctrine that we must first seek the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and again established the observance of the Sunday on the basis, not of law, but of the joyful and free worship of God. The Reformers rejected the transfer theory, according to which the legal demands of the Decalogue were regarded as applicable to the Christian Sunday, although recognizing the moral principle underlying the Sabbath observance. Just as little did the Reformers base this observance on any direct command of Jesus Christ. According to the 26th article of the Augsburg Confession, Sunday is an ecclesiastical custom, a venerable traditional rite. Its basis is found chiefly in the words of Christ which promise blessings to those who worship in common, as also in the fact of need of order and system in church work and worship, and in social and political respect to the welfare of neighbors.

This last mentioned item was of leading importance in this connection for the Geneva Reformer. Calvin most emphatically demanded a day of rest, but he bases this demand upon Sabbath law as little as Luther does. He regards it as a fact that the observance of the Lord's day is a human ordinance, no matter how emphatically he insisted upon this period of rest, as an absolute necessity for man and beast. How deeply the Reformers were imbued with this doctrine, can he seem from the fact that they claim for the Church the rights of controlling Sunday. Luther from the beginning made this a prominent point. The Church, he says, "could make Friday her Sunday." For the individual, the Reformers emphasize the duty of not departing from the usages and customs of the Church in this regard.
