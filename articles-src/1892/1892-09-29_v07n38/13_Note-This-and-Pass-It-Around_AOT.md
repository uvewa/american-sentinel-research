In a recent speech, in Topeka, Kan., Rev. W. F. Crafts, said: "The Christian people of this land can have what they will of their legislatures if they will only ask for it;" and, "The legislators are but the servants of the people, and when the people demand laws their servants must enact them: so if we want Sunday laws, all we have to do is to ask for them."

He doubtless was encouraged to make this statement by the action of Congress in its last session, passing the bill requiring that the World's Fair be closed on Sunday at the imperious demand of the churches.

In all the life and teachings of the Man of Nazareth, we find nothing to indicate that it would ever be right for his followers to "demand" that laws be made in favor of the Christian religion. Is it possible that any man who has read the history of those long, dark ages of religious persecution, when it was possible for so-called Christians to secure by their "demand" whatever laws they desired, would ask that the same scenes be enacted over again in the nineteenth century? In itself alone there is power in Christianity to lead men to Christ; but when it is coupled with civil law, it ceases to be Christianity, and has no power for real good.

A. O. TAIT.
