# The Sabbath of Genesis.

BUT it is urged that the Sabbath of Genesis observance is not in the particular day observed, but in observing by rest and worship one consecrated part of time in regular succession; and that the particular day is a matter of indifference. This theory is the theory the practice in that it is a matter of indifference as to the particular day—provided always that Sunday is observed. But to make this particular day the essential element of Sabbath observance is for those who were to examine the institution itself, to not understand its significance and its true history.

THE Sabbath is a memorial of the finished creation. "For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them is and the seventh day; wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed it." It can never be true of any other day, and it must always be true of the seventh day. Says Mr. M. Elliott, in his prize essay, "The Abiding Sabbath," published by the American Tract Society,—"While the creation reason, the law remains. The rest of the Sabbath is; it is the one monument set in human history to that great event, and so long as the truth of creation and the knowledge of a Creator have any value to human, thought, any authority over the human conscience, or make any appeal to human affections, so long the law and the institution of the Sabbath will abide with lasting instruction and all demanded obligation."

IT follows from the statement made by Mr. Elliott, that to change the day necessarily involves a change of reason for observing the day; in short, it is to change the institution; and as we see in the Sabbath and the Sunday, are two phases of the same institution, but two rival institutions. The one commemorating creation, the other, it is claimed, the resurrection, the one sacred to Jehovah, the other, it is claimed, equally sacred to his Son; those designated as "Jewish," the other called "Christian;" the one clearly of divine origin, the other set apart confessedly by the Church, and that in an age when corruption had already permeated the religion of Christ.

To illustrate this matter, let us suppose that the Irish people were in a majority in this country, and that instead of celebrating the Seventeenth of March, the Fourth of July were were to adopt and substitute the Seventeenth of March; I suppose further that they were to call it "Independence day," and celebrate it much as we now do the Fourth of July; and further suppose that their influence was such that they should cause the day to its entirety solely the place of our national holiday; could it ever become the same institution? Could it ever be truthfully said that the American Independence had been transferred to the Seventeenth of March? and could the laws which now make the Fourth of July a legal holiday be made to apply without change to the day which had been introduced to supersede the Fourth of July? In short, under such conditions would not everybody see that the American Independence day had been supplanted by the Irish Saint Patrick Day? Certainly they would. And this is exactly the case of the Sabbath of the Lord. It has been supplanted by a rival institution. Not indeed as he claimed by a day set apart, by the Son of God, but by a heathen festival brought into the Church with other pagan corruptions, and forced upon it by a foreign influence hostile to the spirit and intent of the Sabbath institution, and bent on its destruction.

AT a recent Sunday School Convention meeting at Moralton, Mich., it became necessary because of lack of time to omit one topic wish to have been discussed. The choice lay between two. "Christ's Method of Teaching the Scriptures of the Sunday-school Class" and "Sunday-schools the Hope of the Nation." The latter topic was selected as being the more important theme, and a paper was read on it by Rev. G. H. Hoot, out (Baptist), set forth the proposition inasmuch as this is a Christian Nation all its Christians is a competition to attain the head; and as Christians are developed largely in Sunday-schools, therefore the Sunday-school is the hope of the Nation. That is, upon the Sunday-school devolves the work of training the future presidents of the United States! Truly the politicians of this country are getting ahead of the bishops of Christendom. The bishops only sought to make religion a branch of religion; the preachers are seeking to make religion and politics identical. It matters little about the example of Christ if only the Sunday-school answers the purpose.

NEVER was a disingenuous a plea for Sunday laws as we have seen for some time, appreared a week or two since in the *Baptist Examiner*.

But what reason has the *Examiner* for thinking, or rather for saying, that "the prohibition for one day of the week of all labor, save works of necessity and mercy, on the one hand is an infringement of any man's liberty"? This city is strongly for this. Appeals, indeed, and illustrate the people in it observe Saint Patrick's day by refraining from labor and business. But the difference here is one of compelling and of refusing, it is this not compel him on the other it is a recognition of the Church or religious institution the State. Where the power of the State is from the
