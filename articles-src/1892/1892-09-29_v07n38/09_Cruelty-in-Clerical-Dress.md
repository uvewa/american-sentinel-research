To the person who imagines that the spirit of religious persecution no longer survives in this country, we submit the following conversation which recently passed, in substance, between Rev. McLean, Secretary of the Chicago Branch of the American Sabbath Union, and A. F. Ballenger, Secretary of the National Religious Liberty Association:—

Mr. McLean.—The Seventh-day Adventists are under the protection of the other churches, and yet they oppose us in securing Sunday laws.

Mr. Ballenger.—Under the protection of the churches? Yes, in Henry County, Tenn., they are protected by some of the churches, but the protection consists in working them as criminals on the streets in the chain gang.

Mr. M.—They have violated a law of the State.

Mr. B.—The law is wrong.

Mr. M.—Christians should obey the laws.

Mr. B.—Daniel disobeyed the law forbidding him to pray; the three Hebrews disobeyed the law requiring them to bow down to the image in the plains of Dura. Would you consider the law just that would compel you to rest the seventh day of the week and thus allow you but five days in which to labor in support of your family?

Mr. M.—No, I would not regard such a law as just but would secure its repeal.

Mr. B.—That is just what Seventh-day Adventists are trying to do, and you and your Association are doing all you can to prevent them from accomplishing it.

Mr. M.—Yes we are, and will continue to oppose them.

Mr. B.—Then you are opposed to repealing laws in Tennessee which put Christian men in the chain gang and work them on the streets with common criminals for working on their farms on Sunday?

Mr. M.—Yes sir, we are.

Mr. B.—I am glad I called. I will use your statement. [Starts to leave the office.]

Mr. M.—[Angrily] Come back! I will make it stronger! I will "rub it in"!

But he was too angry to command words with which to make it stronger, and the conversation ended.
