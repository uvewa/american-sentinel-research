# Chicago Asks for a Repeal of the Sunday Closing Proviso.

A PETITION, starting from Chicago, is being extensively circulated, asking that the repeal of the congressional action closing the World's Fair on Sunday. *Chicago Herald* has announced that it will secure the petition throughout the entire United States. After citing the particular advantages of Sunday opening of the fair, the memorial gives, as reasons why Congress should reverse its previous action in this matter, the advanced advantages of the Fair which should be to the people, and the fact it would inevitably flood the city on that day to multiplied crimes beyond the capacity of the police to meet and the churches; but two clauses of the memorial road thus—

Because, the right of free admission to the grounds and buildings of the Exposition on Sunday, set apart as a special day on which no acquiring would and of payment be required to gain an entrance by the exhibitors who so desired to cover their displays. So this provision should be a day of rest in the sense of the regular World's Fair exhibitors'

but a very superficial plan for the reversal and Congress has to be convinced ... it should be made so as to have Sunday shall result as a special day. ...putting the true position that no one has a right really to say what it makes for or in this matter for anyone outside of himself and in any provision entitled to it.

If it were possible that this petition could be brought before all those in this country who sympathize with it and get them signed by them, it is very certain that it would not move Congress to reverse the Sunday closing proviso. It is not that. No paper, regardless of how many names be taken to it to accomplish any such thing. But instead of this in Senate by Mr. S. A. on a petition so worded, and for the report there made, the legislative attitude had been that a religious man, which the Government has taken would remain unaltered.

The actual and valid reason upon which this memorial should have been based have been entirely ignored. It has become a settled conviction, shared by the minds of the people that the Sunday Fair proviso rests upon a false basis, is interpreted out of existence by the Supreme Court, and is in fact a denial of the Constitution. Those who petition Congress for Congress to pass laws respecting religious matters, have by that act solely endowed with the power to pass legislation of this type that the Constitution's tracts previously entered only, that it is unconstitutional for them to do it; and this has been the stand that we have held on this memorial. When has Congress granted any Church the Constitution claim by the right of establishment from the standpoint of a religion? ... It is surely as the present, to legislate either directly or indirectly as so in municipal council? Will people refuse to reconsider? ask those questions and make the Nation stands pledged by the Church government in this country is a thing of the past? Does this petition have the force and rule of an oligarchy? Do these petitions now so advance the full rights of the people protesting that all the world as represented say, why do they not protest? Why do the Churches assert an influence that depends greatly upon the righteous principles, the fact remains, only asking that it be resulted in their roll influence that was more than a petition.

Mail and Express refers to what Edward F. Crogg, of Chicago, as saying:

> That his experience in the work proves that his opening on Sunday is in accordance with the desires of the working people and the interests of all.

Is this statement true?—It is. Outside of "The American Sabbath" there is not a force sufficient on surveys a survey to be a force and sufficient for the American Sabbath, to make specimens fallaness of that decision. Are there no people who are willing in the city of Chicago competent to realize the result of such a decision and judgment? No judge. Do the judges and lawyers of Cook County and of the United States believe in this, why not speak?
