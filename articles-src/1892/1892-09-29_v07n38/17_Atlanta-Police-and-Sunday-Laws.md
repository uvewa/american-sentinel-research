THE following is from a private letter written by a Seventh-day Adventist living in Atlanta, Ga.—

Monday last, two policemen visited the writer and Brother— to talk to us about working on the Sabbath, meaning Sunday. I will not state all they said. Among other things, they said that if Jews and others did not like the laws here, let them go to some other country. Again, they often used the expression, "We can't have the Sabbath desecrated." They referred to saloons and stores, and asked "how it would look to have them open on the Sabbath." We told them we were in favor of closing the saloons every day in the week.

When they were about to leave, we invited them to come back and see us again. They said, "We will, and you will change your doctrine;" but we think not.

These expressions show the Atlanta police to be apt students of National Reform doctrine. Heretofore the authorities of Atlanta have given their attention largely to stopping railroad traffic on Sunday, and the closing of saloons, but it seems that is becoming uninteresting, if not unprofitable; so now they begin to attack those who have a principle to defend in the matter, and who are foemen more worthy of their steel.
