# The Supreme Court Decision and Congress.

THE Government of the United States as our fathers made it, as they intended, and as by the Constitution established, it is now a thing of the past. It is true. Both by the Supreme Court and by Congress the intention of the fathers has been disregarded, the principles of the Government have been subverted, and the Constitution has been overridden.

The action of the Supreme Court has been reviewed, and the words in which the Court did that part have been given in these columns. The action of Congress in which it did its part in this thing has also been referred to and largely discussed in THE SENTINEL. We are asked however to give more fully the actual words and proceedings in which Congress did this thing. With this request we gladly comply, for the evidence is not only important to this country, and should be placed before everybody.

ALTHOUGH Congress is forbidden by the Constitution to make any law in any of the subjects of religion, yet this matter was discussed, and the law was enacted, solely from the standpoint of religion. Senator Hawley, who had the principal part in carrying this thing through the Senate, said plainly:

> Everybody knows what the foundation is. It is founded on religious belief.

And so certainly was the discussion a religious one that Senator Proctor said of it—

> To-day we are engaged in a theological discussion upon the observance of the first day of the week.

And the chaplain of the United States Senate, in reporting the matter to the *New York Independent*, July 28, 1892, said of it these words:—

> While there were differences of opinion as to how the Sabbath should be honored, every man who has protested against any purpose to dishonor the fourth commandment. During the debate one might have imagined yourself in a general assembly of some variety of a religious conference, so prayerfully was one senator after another.

SUCH is the impression received by an official onlooker. And that the impression is not at all strained is evident from the speeches that were made, as any one may see who will read the *Congressional Record* of July 12 and 13, 1892. The three principal advocates of the Sunday closing bill were Senators Colquitt, Hawley and Hiscock. As Senator Colquitt is a National Reformer nothing else was to be expected of him, and he fully sustained this character in his speech, about half of which was made up from extracts from a sermon, by Father Hygeianics, Old Roman Catholic of France. The rest of his argument was National Reformerism of his own manufacture. Altogether it was of such a sort that he himself began to see how incongruous it was in that place, and halted with these words:—

> But I shall continue the debate to-day. Possibly it may to some seem like preaching, as it were; but we have a good many similar counsels in the overthrowing of bailments and protests to be better than other things.—*Congressional Record, 52nd Cong.*, p. 6164.

SENATOR HISCOCK both preceded and followed Colquitt, and the aim and the sum of all his speech is contained in the words of surrender and servitude to the church, to which we have before referred, as follows:—

> It is because of this amendment in the interest of the Columbian Exposition *I would write the proposition for the closure on any form that the religious sentiment of this country demands.*

Mr. Palmer? He and Butler yield to this sentiment and not let it go out to the country that there is negligence in this regard of the people protested; the Exposition will be closed on Sunday.

If I were interested in this measure, as I might be interested if it were to be located in my own State, I should make this closure provision entire relating to those petitions and have substantially it against the observance of the Lord's day ...I would not have it a matter whether the Exposition should be open or should be closed on the Sabbath day. In my judgment, doubt open the proposition of these people. There has been a disposition that is not reconcilable from any other source whatever. I have nothing more to say.—*p. 6172.*

SENATOR HAWLEY told his fellow Senators what he thought of the speeches of Colquitt and Hiscock. And as his speeches were longer than the others, as also were they more purely religious and more refulgent and voluminous. Yet for all this he was not able to reach that height of religious and enthusiastic eloquence to which for this particular occasion his longing soul aspired, and so be very pertinently exclaimed:—

> We must charge the most eloquent of those earnest clergymen, the most eloquent of those earnest Christians, with most keen perception of their citizenship as well as American Christianity, that I might be something more eloquent in the expression of my self in the serious impressions for good.

But as he could not have all his wish, he could do as he could by the more steady and sturdy diligence, "such as John Cotton did in his Harvard," or, better, "such as Cotton Mather would have;" and he practically made up his lack by presenting the views of Archbishop Ireland, Archbishop Gross, and Bernhard Bloedak, of the Catholic Church, and followed this in order with the views of the bishops of the Protestant Episcopal Church and the bishops of the Methodist Episcopal Church, both North and South.

But although Senator Hawley could not have a religion "such as John Cotton, a stately old sturdy divine," he could be a demagogue—and that seemingly without any particular effort. By the session of 1890 and the chaplain of the United States Senate, in reporting the matter to the *New York Independent*, July 28, 1892, said of it these words:—

adding to this number "the people who parishioners, who go to church and send their boys and girls and children and instruct to it, and have a profound respect for it whether they believe in it or not," say this method of counting he got up "from forty to fifty millions of the people of this country who have more or less of respect or reverence for the Christian religion." And upon that calculation he argues thus—

There is no use in attempting to argue as to whether or not this is a Christian land. I will not that Exhibition on Sunday the 64 per cent of the church members and the worshipers and added more than 50,000,000 of petitioners. Of course, these are not all different people; many of them were represented many times.

How do you suppose that a Senator of Rome would have thought it was to do by in the days of the triumvirate and the later Roman Empire and the sway of certain of the people? ... no matter if he thought it was a grand thing. It is not the materialism of the men.

If a gentlemen prejudice this, if they ever consider of our Republic did not play this on the true sense of the word a religious Nation, I should like the word know who they are, and I should like to know! Where, How would you write it? How would you make a constitution and not recognize that the word of God and the Bible is the ground and pillar of all we have? There would not even come back one single Republic! None. I hope. Not at all.

Is, then, the chief duty of a United States Senator in regard to the people to "come back come here again." The height and the audition and in it "not to come back." Then here at its continuation to "not come back" then. It is that in every act it is in the performance of "was statesmanship," to plead into the hands of fanaticism, hypocrisy, and unscrupulous and rapacious purposes, as is at present? "And without that any purpose, that is all." No matter though the thing demanded is positively forbidden by the Constitution of the Government, we must yield; if we say "come back come here again." No matter though the thing demanded is positively forbidden by the Constitution, it must be granted or else we can't "come back come here again." No matter though to yield to the demand we must violate the oaths we take within we undertake the Constitution, the Constitution must be violated: for it is essential to the basis of our liberties are nothing, in the presence of this awful alternative of not being able to "come back." Liberties, and we must bless our liberties rights, that we can't "come back here."

Was there ever on earth a more conceivably wretched reasoning than this? Such is the reasoning of the Senate of the United States, as recorded in the *Congressional Record*, by former Frank S. Hiscock, of New York, and in direct connection: Colquitt Hawley.

And the Church managers. The chaplain of the Senate in the article in the article before referred to says:—

> I have noticed the past two years an increasing indication that many members of the Senate, Congress, for the Congress of the United States never has been very far behind the sentiment of the churches to-day. And never more surely than in the action just taken has Congress shown that it wanted to show consideration for the Christian religion.

This is just what these senators told the churches—that they were afraid of. And as a rule—we do not say in every instance—a religious test, it will be cognized as a religious test; for office since the United States. H. H. George, who labored for months to secure this test national, has this said:

> I have insisted that we hold the United States Senate, in religion.

They would be very dull indeed not to have insisted it, when the Senate openly told them so. Of course they hold it in their hands and are walking around with it. And did not that other preacher, J. D. Sands, B. D. Pittsburg, declare that as the Senate had listened to the voice of the Church. The reason why for or any voice not yet—that same word of his may be false, or may other equally useful things. Let this Church manage public matters much more often than in the past.

But the writers as committee had a report that the convention, that the Government of the United States is a Christian government, and as it was intended to remain is so regarded now, as a Union of all the churches of the combined churches, and it then follows as stated by the Supreme Court decrees upon all the decrees of the Church and its spiritual decrees. And since there stands in the United States to-day the living image of the Papacy, instead of the glorious Government which our fathers established and hoped ever would stand, the "new order of things" to which the Nation stands pledged by the Church-State of the United States is reversed; and all order of things which has always been a curse to the world is restored.
