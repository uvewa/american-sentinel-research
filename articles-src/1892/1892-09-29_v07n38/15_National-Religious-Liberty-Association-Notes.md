## NATIONAL RELIGIOUS LIBERTY ASSOCIATION.

The Grand Jury at Fort Worth, Texas, has instructed the officials in regard to the Sunday law, and as a consequence it is being rigidly enforced, at that place.

A correspondent from New Port, Benton Co., Oreg., reports that the Sunday law has lately been enforced at that place, closing all places of business on Sunday, with the exception of hotels and restaurants.

It is reported that the Supreme Court of North Carolina will not sit hereafter on Mondays. The purpose of this regulation is that the lawyers may not travel on Sundays to be present at the call of their cases on Monday.

The Congregational Church at Antigo, Wis., recently passed some resolutions calling on the mayor of the town to stop the violation of the Sunday laws there. The pastor of the church and the editor of the local paper have indulged in a little discussion over the merits of such resolutions, and the editor seems to be ahead in the argument.

At Chicago the Trades and Labor Assembly has, by a vote of 119 to 40, declined the invitation of the World's Fair directors to take part in the parade during the dedication exercises next month. Several hot speeches were made for and against the acceptance of the invitation. It was finally declined on the ground that workingmen could not endorse the Fair as long as its gates were closed on Sunday.

This department acknowledges with much satisfaction the receipt of marked copies of newspapers containing local matter in reference to the enforcement of religious laws in different parts of the country. All matter of this description together with accounts of public meetings held to favor or oppose religious legislation, as well as newspaper discussions of the question, and the utterances from the pulpit in regard to it, are of much interest and value, and gladly received.

A correspondent, from Selma, Cal., details an interesting conversation with a chance acquaintance, who proved to be a Roman Catholic in belief, upon the union of Church and State now accorded in legal and legislative proceedings. At the close of the conversation the Roman Catholic said, "Well, I will not pretend to say how it will be done, but our priests tell us that the Government of the United States will soon be in the hands of the Catholic Church, for nearly all the higher courts are controlled by them now; and I guess they know pretty well what they are talking about." Such instances as this have their significance.

"The Rev. W. W. Boyd, Pastor of the Peddle Memorial Baptist Church, of Newark, N. J.," says the New York Sun, "has resigned from the Law and Order League of that city. It is said that the league is on the verge of disruption. A year ago the league brought Captain Wishart, from Pittsburg, Pa., to assume the office of general director of its affairs. Great things were expected of the Captain. When he arrived he visited the different churches and told the spellbound congregations how he had redeemed Pittsburg from the lowest depths of vice. The Captain and the league laid elaborate plans for the redemption of Newark. Sunday was to be made a day of puritanical severity. Somehow their plans went astray. There was any amount of speech making and planning, but the Sunday beer gardens and Sunday sacred concerts went on without hindrance, and saloon keepers laughed at Captain Wishart. The Rev. W. W. Boyd was one of the enthusiasts in the beginning. He said, 'I believe the majority of people are willing to let the Sunday question rest as it is. I got tired of fighting a dead issue. My time and strength were wasted in the league. Hereafter I will give my entire time and attention to the educational lines marked out in the church of which I am pastor.'"
