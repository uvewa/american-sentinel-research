# The Foundation of Obedience to Civil Government.

OBEDIENCE is to be rendered to all human governments to the extent that they are of the will of God. These governments are a recognition of the nature and necessity of the case, and their existence is manifestly in accordance with the divine will. Hence the duty to obey them within the bounds of authority of civil law; and any refusal to obey when within the proper sphere of action, that obedience will be sin. The one who refuses to obey a civil law may be fully persuaded in his own mind that it, say in religious matters, is not the law of God. It is too obvious to need discussion, that the law of God, the great standard of lawmaking, is superior, and that, "we ought to obey God rather than men," in any case of conflict between human law and the divine.

It is the province and the duty of government to administer the law, to government the duty to refuse obedience, and to restrain and punish every violation that has arisen. In a case of this kind, where a citizen sincerely believes he has kept the law, and resists the government in its attempt to exercise it, the courts and justify suffer the penalty. The first is revolutionary, and can be justified only when the cause is flagrant, and affects such numbers that a revolution government is well established. Sometime a decided attitude, on the part of a large number, in opposition to a statute, will serve to set it aside, and make it inoperative. Such cases, however, are not cases of revolution. But these cases are rare. The last resort of a conscientious citizen is to yield to constituted authorities and consent. It is a suffering against the law as a misjudgment, at the same time, a recognition of government as a given to humanity.

It is often urged that the right of private judgment, as now maintained, its reference to obedience to its laws of the land, will subvert government, and independence and distress. The example is corrupting, that a bad man will violate a good law. Because the plea and refuse to obey a wicked law. The cases are just as unlike as right and wrong. The attempt to justify the one by the other is dangerous in the extreme. Emphatically, the principle can be abused by the wicked; and so can any principle whatever, but the principles of requiring obedience to human law, of faith, and needs no pretext to make a man irreverent. Practically, the cases are few, if well established government does not violate as a private judgment, as now maintained, the rights of conscience; but if the government does violate them, the duty to disobey is clearly above the duty to obey.

The proper province of all governments is the administration of the law to secure the just and good ends; injustices and oppressions are not made tolerable, by being in strict accordance with the law. Nothing is surer, in the end, than the reaction of such wrong to break down the most honorable and good government.—*Morrill's Moral Philosophy.*
