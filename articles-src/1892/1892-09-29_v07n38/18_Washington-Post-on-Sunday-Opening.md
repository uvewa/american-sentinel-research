THE WASHINGTON Post after telling in its leading editorial of the issue of September 9, on the new movement started in Chicago to have the Fair opened Sunday, reprints President Highbotham's reasons for signing the petition, and adds:—

Those propositions fairly state the case as viewed from a moral and sympathetic standpoint, but, of course, they fail to answer the strictly doctrinal objections to Sunday opening. Between these two views are difficulties of reconciliation interposed that seem apparently insuperable, and there is grave doubt whether Congress can be induced to recede from the position it has taken. Yet the dominant sentiment of the American people, if it could be ascertained, would doubtless favor the opening of the major portion of the Exposition on Sundays as an object lesson to the people the most valuable of its kind in all their lives, and calculated to make of them better and more intelligent citizens. This feeling has just been expressed in a resolution adopted by the Women's Board of Managers of the State of New York to the effect that the Exposition be opened on Sundays "for the benefit of all classes."

Besides failing to answer the strictly doctrinal objections they also fail most utterly to answer the fundamental objection that the civil law by right has no authority over a religious observance, either to enforce or to abrogate.
