# The Sunday Question—An Historical Survey.

Being for which we are, however, indebted to the Jewish observance of the Sabbath. And this Sunday is the Sabbath by divine authority, or we must depend for its observance upon the original Sabbath was ever displaced by so doing.

As far as we can now learn, the Jewish observance of the Sabbath has never been displaced. 

Certain it is, however, that the Jewish observance of the Sabbath, so soon as the Christian Church was separated from the Jewish faith, the introduction of the first day of the week is not only uncertain, but purely a work of the more certain because there existed at the time of a Gentile Christians. But of a transference to Sunday of the close connection with the Jewish Sabbath, no mention of it is given in the earliest two or three literatures of the times.

Curiously, there are now signs to suggest that the early Christians modified their Sunday observance after the methods of the Jewish Sabbath, by rest and religious worship. The conception of Sunday was merely as a joyful remembrance of the resurrection of the Lord, and for meeting worship and praise (Collation), as a day for the assembling of the congregation.

In early post-apostolic times, and in the age of the old Catholic Church, no material changes were made in the religious observances. Nearly all the Christian nations of this age emphasize the difference and distinction between the Christian Sunday and the Jewish Sabbath. In all the rest of the world there existed no thought that there is not a single Christian author who has regarded Sunday as a continuation or imitation of the Jewish Sabbath, or defended the former to be a displacement of the Sabbath by the authority of the Church. The data on this point are found in Zahn's *Geschichte des Sonntags*, pp. 180, 184, and *for allen Krchn, History, 1878. Oesetreicher, etc.* In writing on this subject, it says that the two days, but this is always done from the standpoint of contrast.

In the Old Testament concerning the Sabbath to the observance of the Sabbath, which in the Old Testament has the application referred to the Jews as a nation, the Patristic writers recognize as an allegorical or spiritual meaning, a spiritual truth, the withdrawal from all work of serving applied to every day, and to the Lord in his sanctuary. This moral duty, however, was acknowledged also to apply not only to one time or place, but as a spiritual obligation upon all days. For this reason, the Sabbath was not associated, not in the Christian Sunday. The rest specifically to the Sabbath in connection with their recognized by the early Christians, is not the Jewish Sabbath but the eternal, that is God, not human. At the end time motives for the observance of the Lord's day worship, and thus the Sabbath is to be understood as a great event that gives this day its particular significance.

When Christianity became the State religion under Constantine and Theodosius the Great, a material change took place in the observance of Sunday. The State organized the Church became also a State institution, and it now gradually became more natural for the Jewish homiletical appeal to work, to Testamental Sabbath and methods, especially in exercising its rest, to be used also to establish Sunday rest.

But nothing can be discerned that Christ committed, yet the practice of the Church.

The famous edict of Constantine on the Lord's day occurs in the Codex Justinian, iii., 12, 3. By this document the Christian day of worship was recognized as a day of rest, at any rate its observance as a festival day is more noteworthy since its most notable characterization in the mind of this writing does not agree with a single word of the New Testament. "We learn that on this true in this inscription the veneration of the day of the sun," *Dies Solis*, the Emperor, the prime motive was, at the very least, by no means a purely religious one. The contents of the document are significant on the side against a Christian character alone. From this time on, Emperor and Synods continued to recognize more and more the observance of Sunday, but never because all the Sabbath commands of the Old Testament. Political interests and public motives were the determining factors in these measures.

The legal observance of the Sunday was on the basis of the Decalogue did not appear until the Waldenses, in the twelfth century. From that day to this day, this is the other phenomena that the requirement of rest for the worship and service is no longer rooted in the worship and for Sunday observance in a more definite strict and stringent abstinence from exercise. The great ecclesiastic of the Middle Ages, Thomas Aquinas, gave the standard-doctrinal formula to the dogma in this view. Not merely to render for the sake of the Church as well as of God, but a test of the obedience of the Christians, which obedience was the same as as well furnished as the State within. Every State in those days further more than had religious constructions, and we are under strict compulsion to observe. And we are under strict religious law as a State within. Every State within about two consecutive weeks without reasonable excuse, was not only to be excluded from the Church but to be liable for punishment in civil and to life herein. Each city had the right to fix its own amount of fine.

If a boy is unable to do this, the church will be turned into a schoolhouse. The State was to buy the guns and provide for instruction and as we are confident you will continue their subscription to this paper. Sabbath observance and Sabbath sanctity were founded on the remarkable instances of a boy's reverence.

I plainly it can not be fail in stimulating schools teachers to more vigorous efforts in the human heart. It is an easy matter to teach boys to be explosive and teach to enforce for it; but it is quite another thing to the State in all—. If only a flock of sheep sit to another with brotherly love; in honor preferring one another. The Germans we feel also the lesson that Christ would have all, both old and young to learn; and it is the lesson that the Church should teach. Any amount of cultivating will produce a brigade in gardens in a marked success, as well we know; And doubtless the same may be said of boys; it must even be a demand all round.

The German Reformation proceeded from the doctrine that we must first seek the kingdom of God, his righteousness, and again established the observance of the Sunday on the basis, not of law, but of the joyful and free worship of God. The Reformers rejected the reason for theory, according to which the legal demands of the Decalogue were regarded as applicable to the Christian Sunday, although recognizing the moral principal of the Sabbath of Genesis, as well. And how little did the Reformers base this observance on the Sabbath of Genesis, as well, Christ. According to the 28th article of the Augsburg Confession, a symbolic tradition, a symbolic confessional codification, the words. Then is found clearly in the words of Church which promise blessings to those who would its command, as also in the fact of need of order and appointed by the church work; and owing its social and political respect to the welfare of the Church.

This last mentioned item was of leading importance. It is noteworthy that among the Geneva Reformers, Calvin most emphatically demanded a day of rest, though he repudiates the idea of a Sabbath transfer little as Luther does. He regards it as a spiritual ordinance. It is also, in a measure, as a human ordinance, no matter how establishing a day of rest; but that, in this respect, as an absolute necessity for man and therefore in the deeply the Reformers were imbued with this doctrine, can be seen clearly from the fact of the leaving to the Church the rights of constituting Sunday, a most important question and the most prominent point. The Church, he says, should select its own day. For Catholics the Infallible, the distinction seemed only a duty of not departing from the usages and customs of the Church in this regard.
