A gentleman in Nebraska sends us the following, evidently for publication:—

### WHICH IS IT?

With respect to what are called denominations of religion, if every one is left free to judge of his own religion, there is no such a thing as a religion that is wrong. But if they are to judge of each other's religion, there is no such a thing as a religion that is right. These principles being admitted, it will follow as a matter of fact all the world is right or all the world is wrong. Which is it?

J. L. WAGNER.

Waco, Neb.

But "these principles" will not be admitted by any one who gives the matter serious thought. Man is a moral being, and consequently has a moral responsibility. So far as his fellow man is concerned, every man is the judge of his own religion; but this instead of militating in the least degree against his accountability to God for the choice which he makes in religion, only emphasizes it; for being absolutely free to choose the right he is the more responsible for choosing the wrong. Those who choose the service of God, ordered according to his revealed will, are right. All others are wrong. But they are accountable only to God for being wrong. Man is not the judge of his fellow man in religious things.
