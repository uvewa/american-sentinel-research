The following quotation from the Ashley (Mich.) News shows how easily people may be disturbed in an enlightened land:—

A number of the good citizens of Bannister, Mich., who have been molested for the past two months with the Seventh-day Adventists' doctrine, and especially the Jewish Sabbath, felt it their duty to send for help, etc.

They, of course, need help; but what has caused this "molestation"? Simply this. Two young men came there with a tent and invited the people to investigate the teachings of the Bible, and many responded to the invitation. The respective merits of the so-called "Jewish Sabbath" and the "American Sabbath" received its share of attention, and a number decided in favor of the Bible Sabbath. This so disturbed some that they attempted to remove the tent and drive the "impostors" from town, thus demonstrating the fact that the spirit of persecution is at the bottom of the whole thing, and is only waiting for a chance to use the strong arm of the law in defense of religious bigotry.
