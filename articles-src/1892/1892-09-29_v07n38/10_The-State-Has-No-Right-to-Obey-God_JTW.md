# The State Has No Right to Obey God.

A GENTLEMAN in Nebraska sends us the following, evidently for publication—

> With respect to what are called denominations, they all, Baptists, Methodists, Presbyterians, etc., are parts of the church of Christ. That some of them are wrong, is no question. But if they are to judge of rights every man in the ledger of the law, civil government. So far as his fellow man is concerned, every man in the ledger of the law, civil government; but that instead of militating is the least degree against his accountability to the religion, only emphasises it; for being absolutely uncontrolled by his fellow men, he is the more responsible for choosing the wrong way, and he is only under the one law of God, who can call him to account for the way ordered according to his revealed will, are right. All others are wrong. But the State is accountable only to God for being right, and not to any judge of the law as a fellow man in religious things.

*J. T. Wanless.*

But "these principles" will not be admitted by any one who goes the matter through straighth. Man is a moral being. So far as his fellow man is concerned, every man in the ledger of the law, civil government; but that instead of militating in the least degree against his accountability to the religion, only emphasises it; for being absolutely uncontrolled by his fellow men, he is the more responsible for choosing the wrong way.

*Wash. Neb.*

J. T. WANLESS.
