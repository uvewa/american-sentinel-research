# National Religious Liberty.

THE Grand Jury at Fort Worth, Texas has in its charge declared the Sunday law valid, and as a consequence it is being rigidly enforced.

\*\*\*

A CORRESPONDENT, from Dallas, Tex., reports that the Sunday law has now been extended to cover the city, and that one man has been arrested on Sunday, with the exception of druggists.

\*\*\*

IT is reported that the Supreme Court of North Carolina has declared that the purpose of this regulation is that the law imposes no penalty on those who conscientiously observe their rest-same on Monday.

\*\*\*

The Congregational Church at Antigo, Wis. At the instigation of the evangelical churches, the mayor of the town is to stop the stores from keeping open on Sunday. The arrangement between the dry goods and the matter, and the editor of the local paper have their say as to how, and the editor seems to be ahead in the argument.

\*\*\*

THE State Trades and Labor Assembly of New York recently adopted a resolution calling upon World's Fair directors to take part in its panels on Sunday closing of the World's Fair. Strong and red speeches were made for and against the proposition of opening on Sunday. It was determined on the ground that workingmen could not attend the Fair on the six working days, and it was resolved to open the Fair on Sunday.

\*\*\*

A CORRESPONDENT, from Salem, Ore., details an interview with a woman of his acquaintance, who, proved to be a Roman Catholic to be firmly convinced that it was wrong to work on Sunday. It was further discovered that the idea of the conversation the Roman Catholic her answer, being: "Oh, I know all about that," and she asserts it belongs the practice of the Catholic Church, for nearly all the higher clergy have repeatedly acknowledged it. They say: "The Bible says, keep the Sabbath day," they know pretty well what they are talking about; and they mean Saturday, and not Sunday.

"THE Rev. W. F. Reed of *Pastor of the Presbyterian Church at Prince Street, New York,* New York," has "managed" from the East and League of the city of New York is at present devoted to the organization of an immense mass meeting to be held for, and has brought Captain Wishart, from Prince Edward Island, to address the meeting. Some of the greatest churches of are the churches. Great things were expected of the joint meetings of Parkhurst and Rev. B. Fay Mills churches and held the spellbound congregations that he had addresses! Fishing the first week's depots of vice. The Captain and the league had advance for the endorsement of Sunday. In Sunday was to be made a day of patrimonial entertainment to correct a bad day. There had been any amount of speech making and planning, but the Sunday beer gardens and Sunday sacred concerts went on without hindrance; and saloons keep on tapped as Captain Wishart. The Rev. W.

at all, or to so preach in informations or in their name, the Church goes on. The Church Leroy, and for this plain reason, that the law of Turkey, as of this country protects its people, Sentinel's and yet and even the pages of the American Sentinel; and not upon the newspaper of these.

\*\*\*

In its speaking the Supreme Court declares that Christianity the religion of Jesus Christ is the term, or orthodox, or such for those two false religions that are of the same as the one that is to be distinguished as false religions as distinguished from Christianity. But further, the Court also declares that if the workingmen of any of these systems shall be attached to protection, for their religion is an equally perfect religion.

\*\*\*

Now it is happened that, not from the time that Christianity all this was declaring through its highest also Sectional and still entitled to protection, was declared with the very same sentiment emitted.

\*\*\*

In Turkey the Church and the State institutions. In Turkey the Church in the national religion, just as this Church has been declared to be the national religion of the United States, with also these doctrines their peoples, Mohamets, previously imposse, but even in respect to be found in the law of Turkey a large body, fidelity of decency and good order. Yet the Jewish and the Christians in the United States of America are there, telling them that it has as Christianity are not taken, been deceived, that Mahomed was no prophet. It is not at the same thing in the court for any religious teacher or for; While the Ecclesiastical power of the State is from the organization of the Church by the State, the fact remains that this Sunday exists on civil form the reason that Sunday is a religious institution. Where it not so there would be no such thing as a Sunday law.

Encouraged by the sophistry of the *Examiner* is more apparent when we place side by side two statements which appeared in its ... this article in its column, but separated only by less than:

> The State does not undertake to say how the day shall be kept.

> Who the Sunday holiday keeping to the public.

That is, the State does not pretend to say how the day shall be kept, but it does say that it shall be spent neither as a working nor as a pleasure day. The State leaves every man perfectly free to do just as he pleases—if he plays no work! Wonderful freedom, which out of a possible three courses (rest and work and play) leaves him a choice "to choose" the third! But such is the absurdity that religious teachers try to press upon intelligent thinking people.
