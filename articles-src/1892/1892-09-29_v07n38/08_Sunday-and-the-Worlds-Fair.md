THERE is strong evidence of a constantly growing reaction throughout the country against the wave of extreme sabbatarianism which resulted in a congressional provision that the World's Columbian Exposition should be closed on Sunday.

A notable instance of breadth of view in this particular is furnished by the recent action of the New York State Board of Women managers of the World's Fair. This board, with the good sense and liberal minds that were to be looked for, enthusiastically adopted resolutions recommending that the great Exposition be opened on Sunday, thus enabling the people of all nations to profit on that day by the unparalleled educational and generally elevating facilities which it will offer.

We are, perhaps, not strictly accurate in terming this action of the New York women a symptom of "reaction." More strictly speaking, it is but one of many evidences that the great mass of the people of the country, instead of changing their opinions, are merely awakening to the fact that by their early indifference a relatively small body of well meaning persons were enabled to force upon the citizens of the United States, and of other countries as well, a piece of religious legislation of a paternal, sectarian order, by no means in keeping with the idea that a man should be permitted to observe the Sabbath as his own conscience dictated, and not as others directed.

It is to be hoped that the next session of Congress will repeal the Sunday closing provision referred to, and leave attendance or non-attendance at the World's Fair on the Lord's day to be decided by the individual for himself. Those who consider it a sinful desecration to be enlightened and educated on that day should stay away by all means. Those who do not should not be forced to accept the intolerant views of the sabbatarians.—Boston Herald.
