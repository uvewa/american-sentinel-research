"ACTIVE and powerful agencies," says the "Pearl of Days," "are constantly at work in Great Britain, as well as in America, to break down the Sabbath." However this may be in England, it is certainly true in this country. And among these agencies none are more active or more powerful than is the so-called American Sabbath Union whose sole mission is to exalt a pagan holiday at the expense of the Sabbath of the Lord.
