JUST now there is considerable agitation in the city of Chicago over the question of closing all places of business and secular amusement on Sunday, and several of the leading denominations have told mass meetings for the purpose of laying plans for organizing a general movement in the interest of Sunday closing. The rides of the clothing houses have been induced to form an association, and the dry goods business houses have been organized, have been solicited to join the fold. Resolutions have been proposed calling upon all the proprietors of stores, many of whom are of mixed foreign birth and origin, that keep open all, or a part of the day on Sunday, requesting them to close. The clergy has advised the boycott for all who have refused to close on Sunday.

It was proposed on one occasion, that all those favoring closing, enter into a pledge not to buy any articles at any store that is kept open on that day; and finally it was moved by a lady, who said she was a member of the Methodist church, a resolution that was as follows:—

*Resolved*, That it is the sense of this meeting, that we will not patronize any establishment which keeps its doors open for the transaction of business on the Sabbath day.

At a meeting of the World's Fair Commission in Chicago, on October 13, the resolution, passed at a former meeting, granting a special bearing on the Sunday closing question, October 18 was rescinded.

The following resolution was offered, and laid on the table:

*Resolved*, By the World's Columbian Commission, that while the Congress of the United States has taken the matter of closing the Exposition, through the Sunday closing of the Commission is not directly concerned, and mindful of the right of petition, as sacred to American citizenship, and recognizing that the toiling millions of America are determined to be allowed one day of the week to see the wonders of the World, that day being the one commonly called Sunday; that the Commission petition Congress to rescind its action on this question."

In order to obtain an official expression from the management of the World's Columbian Exposition, a resolution was adopted asking the management if it had decided to accept the act of Congress making the appropriation with a Sunday closing proviso.

In reference to this, a commissioner said that the management had verbally accepted it when it began starving the doorway costs, and that it really did not concern the Commission what the management's Sunday closing rules for the Exposition, whether it elected to or not, because that was now its legal matter.

This meeting was presided over by Father Fallows of the Reformed Church, and other clergymen of more or less note were present, and aided the meeting with their presence and influence.

At the time of this mass-meeting another mass-meeting was called, to be held at the Armory Hall, October 18. At this meeting a similar resolution to the one previously mentioned was passed. Also at this meeting, which was attended by about two hundred, some five hundred people, the business of those men who, close their doors on Sunday, was advertised, and they were commended to the people.

The object of this meeting, as stated by its managers, is to encourage those who are in favor of Sunday work on the part of the clerks in the different lines of trade, a majority of whom being Jews and liberals, and is arraying by their employers. But the minority propose to influence the purchasing public so that the business of the majority, in order to concede to the minority, it is best to do the thing that they desire.
