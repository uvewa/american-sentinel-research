THE leaders and managers of the Sunday-law races, evidently, take great pride in advertising themselves as "the best people of the land," "the most prominent people of the country." This is evident from the fact that they take occasion to announce these as such by resolutions and recitals, and speeches, in their mass-meetings. They never lose any opportunity to exalt themselves as "the best land," and "the law-abiding portion" of the community or the whole country over.

That fact is, however, that this claim of theirs is but one of the main points at the rear of their bustle. It is absolutely fraudulent. The fact is that these very men are the best law-breaking people in the United States. They have no respect for any law but such as their own individual desires shall approve. Without the slightest hesitation, they disregard and trample upon the law of the Government of the United States and the government of the States.

The supreme law of the Government of the United States, the Constitution, positively prohibits any legislation on the subject of religion. Yet, in spite of this, in utter disregard of the supreme law of this land, these men by threats of forfeiture of the loss of votes, the only force at their command—obliged Congress to legislate upon a religious subject, to decide a religious question, and to take sides in this they have plainly overridden the Constitution, and violated the supreme law of the land. And they know it.

THEY know it, and we know that they know it.

The National Reform Association is the ring leader in this whole religious combination for political purposes. This Association has been working for nearly thirty years for national Sunday legislation. But knowing that Sunday is religious, and religion only, they argued the first that such legislation would be unconstitutional as the Constitution stands; and therefore they, for more than twenty years, advocated and demanded an amendment to the Constitution which should declare this to be "a Christian Nation," and so open the way for "Christian legislation" on "the Christian Sabbath."

Yet, by their own arguments of more than twenty years, we know that they know that Sunday legislation by Congress is unconstitutional. Yet, in conflict with their own continued arguments, these men take the lead in petitioning and thronging the Congress for Sunday legislation. One of their own number, who had argued for years the unconstitutionality of such legislation, spent the whole of the last Congress at the Capitol as the chief "a Christian lobbyist" to secure this very unconstitutional legislation. And now, having secured this legislation which they know to be unconstitutional, having thus knowingly violated the supreme law, having thus subverted the Constitution, these very men take the lead in getting up and managing mass-meetings to enforce their unconstitutional action, and vote themselves the law-abiding people of the Nation!

Why, their action is as much worse than that of the average law-breaker, as the supreme law of the land is greater and more important than the local statutes. The average law-breaker damages the individual; these supreme law-breakers damage the whole Nation. The average law-breaker invades the rights of the individual; these supreme law-breakers have invaded, and even swept away, the rights of all the people. The average law-breaker disregards social order only in the locality where he is; while these supreme law-breakers strike at the very existence of social order by breaking down the chief governmental safeguard. For the average law-breaker, there is always a ready remedy in the regular forms of governmental order; but for these supreme law-breakers who have broken down the established safeguards of governmental order itself, where is the remedy?

Ah! there is a remedy for this. It is in the hands of God, the Author of governmental order. Against all their attempts to do this great evil, we have appealed to the Constitution, the grand charter and safeguard of the rights of mankind—the embodiment of the true principles of governmental order. And now that they have done the evil, and in doing it have broken down the Constitution and its safeguards of the individual rights of mankind, and nulled the very shield of governmental order—now we appeal to the Author of governmental order itself. And our appeal is heard. We wait in perfect confidence. The just judgment will be rendered in due time.

THESE facts demonstrate that instead of their being truly the law-abiding portion of the people, these are not the chiefest law-breakers in the richest lawless of all the Nation. Nor is that all to be wondered at. For in order to accomplish this their bad purpose, they "gladly joined hands" and hearts with the Papacy—that power which the Lord designates as "the lawless one" and as the very "mystery of lawlessness" itself. 2 Thess. 2:3, [revised version.] For eight years continuously, the National Reform advertisers have advertised these very Roman Catholics as "the best people of the land," and have publicly declared that they may be willing to exhibit it. After eight years of such flattery, their wishes were rewarded by the following pronouncement of the Catholic Lay Congress in Baltimore, Nov. 12, 1893, which, as it passed the inspection of the hierarchy, before it was presented to the public, is the official utterance of the Papacy of the United States, to the National Reform overtures:—

There are many important issues in which citizens of all religious beliefs may properly combine and act in concert. Philanthropic or benevolent purposes demand it. We agree that in some measure citizens should seek an alliance with non-Catholics for the purpose of urging the passage of just laws, and especially the promotion of the social and moral welfare of those who seek over to the maintenance of the Christian Sunday.

Just so; as the *American Sentinel* Union branch of the National Reform combination announced, and the pope's dates "offer correspondence and conference with the American Sabbath Union." The whole statement is in these words:—

The National Lay Congress at Baltimore, after correspondence and conferences with the American Sabbath Union, adopted the following resolution, pledging its attention to the Sabbath reform.

Then in the same connection, this view goes out "as a proposal of courtship." Plainview at this Aristocratic League public meeting in this city, in May, 1892, thanked God that "Protestantism Catholics" "stand together in demanding the better observance of the Sabbath"—and the "advances," "the proposal," and "the courtship" from the papacy, all to secure "civil legislation" for the faithful observance of Sunday, the danger for union of the Protestants and Roman Catholics succeeded in forcing the Fifty-second Congress to pass the now well-known and famous Sunday legislation.

Now it is to be considered at all strange that these "law-abiding" people are heartless to disregard and override the entire supremest law of the land and to be so servile to the very "mystery of lawlessness" to accomplish this end of lawlessness. For all these years they have openly, by all the actions and words, despised and overrides the supreme law of the universe the law of God which he has proclaimed with a voice that shook the earth and wrote with his own finger on the tables of stone—and they have followed the preaching the principles and the subjects of the mystery of lawlessness the doing of it.

ALL these years they and the people have been taught from the Scriptures that "the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God," yet the churches have been allowing the people to believe it, they have disregarded it and declared it, yet it is not so. They have taught the people that it is not so. They have put no difference between the holy and the profane (Eze. 22:26) by telling the people that there is no difference what day they keep. Thus they discarded the law of the living God, and teach the people to disregard it. Then after teaching the people to disregard the law of God, they turn upon the man who believes it and rigidly conforms to the observance of the day which he has actually designated and call him a criminal for refusing to keep the day of the heathen sun; they join hands with the mystery of lawlessness which has established Sunday instead of the Sabbath of the Lord and set its own word and heathen custom above the law of the living God; it is not at all to be wondered at that they would despise the supreme law of the Government of the United States, nor that they should compel Congress to violation of its clear provisions, to join to their high-handed enterprise and establish their beloved Papacy by the surrender of the power of the civil Government into their hands to be used in enforcing all of their lawless decrees.

Having thus forsaken the Lord, and all true allegiance to his law and gone over boldly and honestly and "gladly" to the papacy of lawlessness—having gone to such lengths as this in despising the law of the living God, it is not at all, at all, to be wondered at that they despise the supreme law of the Government of the United States, not that they should compel Congress to violation of its clear provisions, to join to their high-handed enterprise and establish their beloved Papacy by the surrender of the power of the civil Government into their hands to be used in enforcing all of their lawless decrees.

Are those are they who you before the American people as "the best people" and "the law-abiding people" of the land? Such self-trumpeters *do* come pretty becoming. Such modesty fits them admirably.
