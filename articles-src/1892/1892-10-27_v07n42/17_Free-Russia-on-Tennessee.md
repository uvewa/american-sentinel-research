In its October number, *Free Russia*, the organ of the Society of Friends of Russian Freedom, says:—

Although Alaska was abandoned by the Tsar some decades ago, a little corner of Russia still remains in the United States; it is no other than the State of Tennessee, where, as the National Religious Liberty Association informs us, men are fined and imprisoned for working in the fields on Sunday. This is a bad state of things, yet it is considerably easier to live in Tennessee than in Russia. A good many of Russia's persecuted sects, in fact, would hail with joy the opportunity of residing in a State where their religious belief was called into question only one day in the week. All the same Tennessee is in a bad way, and while it remains un-Americanized the friends of Russian freedom in this country can not hope for much effective aid from that State in the work which they have at heart.

It is small difference whether the State assumes control of the conscience one day in the week or seven days; the conscientious Christian must be loyal to God every day alike. Nor is there so very much difference between Russia and Tennessee in respect to the penalty for refusing to surrender soul liberty. In Russia banishment is the penalty for persistent refusal to conform to the dominant creed; in Henry County, Tenn., the authorities say that "the Adventists must yield or leave the State." Of course the Tennessee courts can not banish them directly, but the authorities have declared that they will prosecute them until they—either yield or get out of the State. There is indeed small difference between Russian and Tennessee methods when it comes to the matter of religious persecution.
