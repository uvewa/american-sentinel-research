[This earnest and breezy presentation of sound legislative principles and religious truth is published under the above title by the *New York World* of October 3, in the column devoted to the views of women as to the Sunday closing of the World's Fair.]

The following writer shows her free American spirit and attacks the action of Congress:—

**To the Editor of The World:**

The Government has no right at all to legislate upon religious matters. Religious subjects are entirely between man and his God. Christ, our great lawgiver, said, "Render therefore unto Caesar [civil powers] the things that be Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's."

The World's Fair has to do with civil powers decidedly, religious subjects with God. When first the Sunday closing movement was agitated it was spoken of as a civil rest day; now it blooms out as the sacred "American Sabbath." It (Sunday) may be the American Sabbath—for it certainly is not the day set apart as sacred in Eden, nor the day the Israelites in the wilderness were bid to keep holy, nor the day Christ and each of the apostles kept holy "according to the commandment," and, therefore, the American Nation can not make it holy or sacred. Only God can do that. He says,

"Remember the seventh day to keep it holy." He never said, "The first day is the American Sabbath, therefore keep it holy." The Americans who wish to make unto themselves a day of rest, not appointed by the Creator of days, can do so if they wish, but they have no right by legislation to selfishly deprive those who will not think as they do of the pleasure and recreation which would be theirs on the first day of the week if the World's Fair was open to all who wished to attend.

What or who will prevent those who choose from staying indoors or attending church on Sundays? As well may a law be made to enforce their attendance at the Fair on Sundays as one to prevent those who wish to attend! The treaty with Tripoli, under George Washington, made in 1797, read as follows: "The Government of the United States of America is not in any sense founded on the Christian religion," and yet not one century has passed before the Government is asked to make a law affecting the very thing that that treaty was intended to prevent. When once civil government takes to legislating upon any one religious subject there will be no limit to the power it may exercise, and the result will be the union of Church and State that has so long cursed Europe. Therefore, I protest most energetically against closing the Fair on any day by law. Let the Managers of the Fair settle that matter, but let the Government confine itself to the secular matters of the State, which is its proper function.

ELEANOR BEAVAN.
