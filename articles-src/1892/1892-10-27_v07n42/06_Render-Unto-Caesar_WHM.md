[THIS earnest and timely presentation of sound American principles was recently published under the above title by the New York *World* and is well worthy of reproduction in our columns.]

The following writer shows the true American spirit and attacks the action of Congress:—

*To the Editor of The World:*

The Government has no right to legislate upon religious matters. Religion is between man and his conscience, and his God. Christ, our great lawgiver, clearly and distinctly separated (two powers) the things that be Caesar's, and the things that be God's.

The World's Fair has to do with civil events and civil progress. The Sunday closing movement was agitated; it was spoken of from pulpits. Petitions were made to close the sacred "American Sabbath," it (Sunday); it certainly is not the day set apart as a Sabbath, a rest day, not the day the Israelites in the wilderness were bid to keep holy; yet the day Christ and each of the apostles kept holy "according to the commandment." And, therefore, the American Nation can not make it holy or sacred. Those who have observance of the American Sabbath, therefore, keep it for reasons the American people who do not make themselves a day of rest, not appointed by the Creator of days, do keep it as if they wish, but they have no right by legislation to solicitly deprive those who will not think as they doof the pleasure and recreation which would be offered on the first day of the week if the World's Fair be open to all on that day.

What or who will prevent those who please from buying tobacco or attending base-ball games, or pursuing any other avocations on Sundays? As well may a law be passed to prevent people from going to the park on Sundays as to prevent the Fair on Sundays as one to prevent those from going to the Fair. In 1797, the Treaty of peace between the United States and Tripoli, under George Washington, made in 1797, read as follows: "The Government of the United States of America is not in any sense founded on the Christian religion," and yet not one century later, and less than a decade before the Government is to make a law affecting the very thing that it had always was innocent of meddling with! Once civil government takes to legislating upon any one religious subject there will never be an end to its doing so, and the result will be the union of Church and State—our greatest national danger. Therefore, I protest most energetically against the Sunday-closing legislation. Let the Managers of the Fair settle that question, and let the management confine itself to the secular matters of the Government.
