REV. J. H. Lattera, one of the district secretaries of the Sabbath Association, has been spending some time in western Pennsylvania, in the interest of the progress in the Christian Statesman says:—

Quite a large number of business places, a number of cigar stores and barber shops, that heretofore have been running on Sunday, have been closed on the occasion, while the Sunday closing cases are now before the courts. In some cases we have had partial success, and in others we have had none whatever, the courts not seeming to look with much favor on the prosecution. This is one of the places where the laws are especially lax, and the enforcement of the Sunday law is one of the most difficult problems we have to deal with. In the cities there is quite a sentiment in favor of letting the law take its course, but in the country districts the people are indifferent.

Most in this city. Most was not important for breaking the law himself but for inciting others to lawlessness. And now it is said that in some cases things should be done in the cases of the Sunday papers: those who print them should be punished for inviting others to break the Sunday laws. How long will it be before the terror of speech will be taken away in the interest of religious laws in this country? How long before it will be held to be seditious language to deny the propriety of Sunday laws or the sacredness of the day? Certainly not long if such men as Mr. Leiper have their way.
