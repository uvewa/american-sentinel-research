THOSE who imagine that in every State and Territory of this great so-called free America, perfect religious freedom exists, are wofully mistaken. Men and women are, by statute, forced to make an outward semblance of worshiping God according to the dictates of their neighbors, or subjected to a fine and imprisonment. The sentiment which prevailed with those who founded the Inquisition and inflicted the most horrible cruelties on dissenters and those who burned witches and banished Roger Williams and his little band of Baptists to Rhode Island, still prevails to an extent not imagined by many who believe this to be a land of liberty.

As an excuse for religious persecution, we are often told that this is a Christian country. Those who argue thus would, if their own religious denomination were in the majority, make this a Methodist country or a Presbyterian country; and there are a few who would make it a Baptist country. If the Catholics or the Jews should get to be a majority, they would, according to the arguments of these narrow-minded fanatics, have a perfect right to make this a papal or a Hebrew country. Their idea seems to be that might is right, but if the Jews or the Seventh-day Adventists constituted the majority in the State or Nation, and were to pass an act requiring the religious observance of the real Sabbath of the Bible—Saturday—the shoe would be on the wrong foot, there would be a great howl against religious persecution, and the oppressed would go on worshiping Sunday and worshiping on Sunday as now, and glory in being persecuted for Jesus' sake. But to the facts:

In a certain section of Tennessee reside a number of Seventh-day Adventists, whose distinguishing characteristic is that they keep holy as the Sabbath the original Sabbath of the Bible—Saturday. There is a Sunday law in Tennessee, which forbids work being done on Sunday. Some Seventh-day Adventists were arrested, charged with working on Sunday. They plead in defense that Saturday was the Sabbath of the Bible, and the day observed by them was the Christian Sabbath. They proved that they rested on Saturday; that the railroads, livery stables, hotels, and other lines of business did business on Sunday, and that even the State's witnesses were transacting business, one going after a cow and another on some other business errand, when they saw one of the defendants quietly plowing in his field some 200 yards from the public road, and disturbing no one. Yet these witnesses swore that their consciences were shocked. What a shocking lie! These Adventists were convicted by the justice, under most infamous rulings; the case was affirmed by the higher courts, even including the highest State court of Tennessee, and the defendants were, at last accounts, appealing to the United States courts for relief from this most infamous religious persecution. In one case the Adventists were found guilty, and notwithstanding the fact that they were men of excellent character, were worked on the roads like common felons, solely for exercising the right guaranteed them by the Constitution of the United States—to worship God according to the dictates of their own consciences. And this is so-called free America. Now, had these poor Adventists been Baptists and in a small minority, their persecutors would just as soon have had them arrested, convicted and made to work on the streets, or roads, like felons of the lowest class, on the ground that they disturbed the peace of the community by engaging in the indecent practice of immersing men and women, or on some other trumped-up charge. The Star always regrets to see Baptists—degenerate Baptists—depart from the old and honored landmarks of the ancient church, by engaging in these persecutions for opinions' sake, and violating that honored principle incorporated by Baptists into the Constitution of the United States, that Church and State must be separate.
