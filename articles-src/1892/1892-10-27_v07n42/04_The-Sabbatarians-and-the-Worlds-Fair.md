In the following paragraph the *Chronicle* gives a very fair statement of the controversy concerning the opening of the World's Fair on Sunday:—

The battle which is now being fought in the congressional districts of the United States to secure the election of men pledged to allow the opening of the World's Fair on Sundays will not be a fair battle between the advocates of an "open" and a "closed" Sunday, for many people who believe in a strict, even puritanical, observance of the first day of the week, are now in favor of opening the gates of the Exhibition on Sunday. On the other hand, the very worst classes in Chicago are working with the Sabbatarians. The reason for this strange combination is that the proprietors of the theatres, gambling houses, public houses, and racetracks located in or near Chicago want to have the great crowd of visitors all in their hands to "pluck" on this one day of the week. They will all keep open house on Sunday, of course, and they don't want the World's Fair as a rival. The religious element will vote, at least a section of them, to open the Fair on the broad ground of choosing the lesser of two evils.

But the *Chronicle* has unintentionally made a great mistake. It says that "the very worst classes are working with the Sabbatarians." Now, while it is true that the very worst classes, as the proprietors of theatres, gambling-houses, etc., are in favor of Sunday closing, since that would mean a better chance for them, it is in no wise true that Sabbatarians are in favor of Sunday closing. As a matter of fact, the Sabbatarians of the United States do not care whether the Fair is opened on Sunday or not. And yet it is a fact that very many church people, especially the ministers, are working for the closing of the Fair on that day, because they know that if it is open on Sunday it will be a rival of the churches as well as of the public houses.

How can this paradox be explained? Very easily; Sabbatarians are people who keep the Sabbath, and the Sabbath is not Sunday, but the seventh day of the week. The commandment says, "Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work; but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God." Sabbath is the name of the seventh day; and no other day has ever been called the Sabbath by divine authority. Sunday has no more right to the title "Sabbath" than Monday has. Consequently only those who keep the seventh day are Sabbatarians; and it is evident that they care not whether the Fair is opened on Sunday or not. They take no interest in the discussion of the question, except to show the people that even if Sunday were a Christian institution, instead of a pagan holiday, enforced Sunday observance would be contrary to the gospel.

We are glad to be able to say, however, that there are many of the people in the United States who keep Sunday, who do not believe that the liberty of the gospel consists in forcing other people to do just as they do.
