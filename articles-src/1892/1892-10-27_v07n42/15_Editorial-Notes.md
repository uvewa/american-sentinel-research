THE *Commercial Advertiser* notes the fact that "Colonel Shepard asserts that nearly four hundred thousand Rhode Islanders have signed petitions demanding the closing of the Columbian Exhibition on the Sunday." The *Advertiser's* only comment is that "Mr. Porter's census gives Rhode Island a population of only 345,506." But everybody ought to understand by this time that the number of inhabitants has nothing to do with the number of petitioners for Sunday closing. The "new method" of petitioning by which the same persons are counted again and again as often as is thought necessary, enables even the smaller States to make as good a showing as the more populous ones.

In his sermon on Sunday evening, October 9, Rev. Charles Parsons, D. D. Pastor of the Hanson Place Methodist Church, Brooklyn, said that at the World's Fair next summer "there is to be a world's congress of Baptists, a world's congress of Presbyterians, and an ecumenical council of the Methodists in Chicago at that time. They will also have a union meeting; not to see what points they disagree upon, but to find how they can unite their forces to work together for the conversion of the people;" and then he added slowly and impressively: "When that time [the uniting of the forces] arrives I hardly dare think what the result will be." And one who was present and heard him, suggests that "he would have said it still more solemnly if he had had any adequate idea of the result."

THE *Christian Cynosure* remarks that "the opposition to the temporal authority of the Pope has hitherto promised little hope of its ever being restored; but a recent change in the sentiment of the people of Italy, it is said, has taken place, and, under the sanction of the Vatican, republicanism is advocated with increasing interest. The alleged admiration felt for republican institutions by the Pope was made public several months ago. Its first fruits threaten to be a revolution in Italy, and the restoration, if possible, of the Pope to the rule of the people. It is very difficult to believe that he really admires the self-rule of a people by the people, for the benefit of the people. That is not a Vatican idea."

It is true that self-rule "is not a Vatican idea," nor is it the idea of any ecclesiastical organization, ambitious for political power. Even in "Protestant" America, the American Sabbath Union and its allies, of which the *Cynosure* is one, are determined that in some things the people shall not rule, but that the churches shall have sway. A political church will either rule or ruin whether in Europe or America. The Pope is no worse than the political preachers in the United States.
