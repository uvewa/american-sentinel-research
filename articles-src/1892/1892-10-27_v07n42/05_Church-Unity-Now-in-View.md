THIS legislative and judicial union of religion with the State, which has taken place in this country, will demonstrate its unique, source or later, an expression of views from the different denominations similar to political platforms. This will so measure its real scope that all may know what the opinions of the different religious bodies are.

It has been proved to congressmen, who have investigated the matter, that financial and political profit is to be had in looking up church interests. The churches have learned that their voice has reached Congress through the secular fact. Congressmen have been scared, wheedled, or blinded, no matter which way we have referred to it with pride. They have learned to know that the Church has achieved its power in the halls of legislation. Now that we have the fact, is it not plain now that they have begun to control legislation that they will inevitably seek to extend that influence? Is it not a fact that the Church, to exercise that power in full, must have a united voice? Is it not a fact that Congress, much oftener and much louder than President Harrison, will deplore the sad condition of denominational division, and will begin to exert its influence, its great influence, to unite the churches? To speak with any single certain voice. To remedy this—

The *Catholic Review* says:—

"That the Church to be heard as one body must have a head. The Church is either or nothing. The assumption that any large number of individuals then no head is necessary, and that every man has a right to believe what he pleases, and be a church unto himself, and have no one to accounts for his belief, and it really does not matter what he believes, can only end in anarchy and another; he has just as much right to his opinions as anyone else—these are propositions which are as false in theology as they would be in politics or the affairs of every-day life."

At a great conference, on the theme "Unity of Christianity," lately held at Springfield, Massachusetts, Bishop O'Reilly, of Worcester said, "How can we ascertain the truth? Not by piling Bible texts on top of each other. We must find a living voice—into the form of a creed? He supported "the conception of Church of a living, divine, society—an authoritative organization of God." But Mr. Hugh Price Hughes, of London, at the Ecumenical Council, held in Washington last fall said: "The only way in which Church and State can be brought about is by surrender." And he pointed out to the Bishop how practically the union of the whole Christian World, and he pointed out to the Bishop how practically the union of the whole Church, and by Christian law and by the force of Christian law.

This thought of unity was apparently the predominating thought at the great conference on church unity recently held at Minneapolis, Minn. It was said:—

The fact that a delegate from the Church of Rome is noted as one of the most manifest and gratifying features of the conference, showing that the Christian union must begin from within.

It was further said that all churches must have the opportunities to co-operate with its members, says the result of such conference:—

Church unity is recognized by them all
