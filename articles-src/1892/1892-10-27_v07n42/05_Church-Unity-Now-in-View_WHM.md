The legislative and judicial union of religion with the State, which has taken place in this country, will necessarily require, sooner or later, an expression of views from the different denominations similar to a political platform. This will be necessary in order that it may be known what the opinions of the different religious organizations are upon public issues.

It has been proved to congressmen, legislators, and public officers in general, that financial and political profit is to be found by an alliance with the churches. The churches have boasted that this would become the case. It is now an assured fact. Congressmen have openly acknowledged it to be so. Popular preachers have referred to it with pride. They have said that the Church had not before realized its power in the halls of legislation; and they have not hesitated to say, now that they have begun to comprehend the control which it is in the power of the Church to exercise over legislative matters, that the voice of the Church will hereafter be heard in legislatures, and in Congress, much oftener and much louder than heretofore. However, in the present condition of denominational division, the Church would not be able to speak with any single certain voice. To remedy this, church unity is necessary.

## The Catholic Review says:—

It is a dictate of reason that every organized body must have a head. The Church is either an organized body or it is not. If it is not an organized body, if it is a mere heterogeneous conglomeration of individuals then no head is necessary, and it is "every man for himself and the devil take the hindoust." No man has a right to call any other man to account for his belief, and it really does not matter what a man believes, for one man is as good as another; he has just as much right to his opinion and is just as likely to be right as another, for no man can tell absolutely whether he has the truth or not.

At the great conference, on the "Reunion of Christendom," lately held at Grindelwald, Switzerland, the Bishop of Worcester said, "How can we ascertain what 'one faith' is unless we put it into words—into the form of a creed?" He supported "the connection of Church and State that there might be a national recognition of God." But Mr. Hugh Price Hughes, who attended the Methodist Ecumenical Council, held in Washington last year, had learned there how a union of Church and State can be brought about according to the new methods of the New World, and he pointed out to the Bishop that "that could be secured by a united church, and by Christian laws and by a Christian home and foreign policy."

This same thought of unity was uppermost at the conference of the National Council of Congregational Churches just held at Minneapolis, Minn. It was said:—

The growing interest in the cause of Christian union is noted as one of the most manifest and most auspicious signs of the times. The promotion of Christian union must begin from within. The Roman Catholic body is recognized as a branch of the Church of Christ, and the report welcomes the opportunities to co-operate with its members, clergy or laity, in the advancement of the cause of Christian truth and Christian morals. The attitude of the Episcopal Church coming forward in England and America, bearing an olive branch, is heartily commended.

Church unity is recognized by them all to be the immediate need, that the different denominations may be preserved from each other. Organization is necessary. Religion must be syndicated. Thus only can the Church gain and hold the civil and political power which its leaders covet. To become a political factor, and unite for the enforcement of religious laws and foreign policy, it must enter into politics. That its political faith may be ascertained, it must be put into words—into the form of a political creed—a political platform. A writer for the *Christian Advocate*, of New York, has done this for one denomination. He has presented the "political platform of the Methodist Episcopal Church," with twelve planks, on "Questions of Policy;" "Prohibition;" "Corrupt Elections;" "City Government;" "Civil Service Reform;" "Protection of the Negro;" "Capitol and Labor;" "The Chinese;" "The American Sabbath;" "Church and State;" "Romanism;" "Public Schools."

Is this the way in which church unity is to be brought about? Will the different denominations formulate their political creeds, and these be accommodated together until one religio-political platform is the result? Then will all the churches take their stand upon this,—a unit as regards religious laws and State policy?

But when organized church unity is secured after this pattern, that which the *Catholic Review* says of it will be true:—

If the Church is an organized body which we know it is, then it must have a head and centre of unity. That head must be the mouthpiece of the body through which all its principles and teachings are communicated. In a word it must have just a head as our Lord established in his Church and as she always has had from the very beginning—from St. Peter to Leo XIII. now happily reigning. Hence there is no assumption in inserting that the Catholic Church is the only true exponent and embodiment of orthodox Christianity at the present time.

That which the *Catholic Review* here says is necessarily true of a political church organized to be a factor in politics. So they are all of one mind, and church unity is even now in view.
