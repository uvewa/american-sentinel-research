At the late meeting of the Tennessee River Conference of Seventh-day Adventists, at Nashville, Elder C. L. Boyd, President of the Conference, thus referred to the persecutions of his people in Henry County:—

Productive of both joy and sorrow may be mentioned the blows which have fallen upon our people at the hands of the good State of Tennessee. Four of our brethren of the Springville church, of the county of Henry, and the State of Tennessee, were arrested on the charge of laboring on the first day of the week.

These men were convicted on the evidence of being members of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, a church which teaches that it is vain to worship God, while breaking his commandments, and teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.

We are sorry that the good people of Tennessee are so blinded as to think it their duty to govern the conscience and control the religion of their fellow-men, and so deceived that they think that the truth of God can be bound by the imprisonment of its advocates. But we rejoice that God has accounted us worthy to be a "kind of first-fruite" of that which is to follow among those who remain loyal to the God of heaven. We rejoice that those thus arrested, dragged from their homes, and shut up in jail, remained faithful to their Master, thus setting a worthy example to those who may hereafter be accounted worthy to suffer affliction for his name.

There is in this no spirit of bitterness; and why should there be since the position of the Adventists is infinitely to be preferred to that of those who are persecuting them. "Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness" sake."
