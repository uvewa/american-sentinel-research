In a recent address at Coin, Iowa, Rev. W. F. Crafts claimed that forty millions of the people of this Nation were in favor of closing the World's Fair on Sunday; but in the same speech he stated that "western Pennsylvania sent in one-fourth of all the petitions."

The entire State of Pennsylvania has in round numbers a population of only 5,000,000. The eastern portion of the State has more inhabitants than the western part. One-fourth of 40,000,000 is 10,000,000. Will Mr. Crafts explain how petitions representing ten millions of petitioners could come from a territory having a population of less than 2,500,000 people?

We have repeatedly pointed out the fraudulent character of the petitions presented by the American Sabbath Union, showing that the same persons were counted over and over again many times. The statement made by Mr. Crafts is simply a confirmation of what we have often said.
