THE *Commercial Advertiser* notes the fact that "Colonel Shepard asserts that nearly four hundred thousand Richmond ladies have signed petitions demanding the closing of the Columbian Exhibition on the days of rest." The *Advertiser's* only comment is that "Mr. Foster's congregation Rhode Island" is population of only 318,500." But everybody ought to know that no amount of personal signing of inhabitants has nothing to do with the "tenor of petitions for Sunday closing; the same persons are canvased again and again, as often as is thought necessary, even the smallest States to make as good a show as the others who are entitled to all votes whatever."

THE *Christian Cynosure* remarks that "the opposition to the temporal authority of the Pope has hitherto presented little hope of its ever being removed; but a recent change in the attitude of the principle of Italy, it is said, has taken place; that is, the assertion of the Vatican, republicanism is advocated with increasing interest. The alleged advantageous bill for republican institutions by the Pope has made public several months ago. Its first fruits threaten to be a revolution in Italy. and the restoration, if possible, of the Pope to the rule of the people. It is very difficult to believe that he really admires the rule of a people by the people, for the benefit of the people. That is not a Vatican idea."

It is true that real reform "is not a Vatican idea," nor is it the idea of any ecclesiastical organization, ambitious for political power. Even in "Protestant" America, the American Sabbath Union and its allies of which the *Cynosure* observes, are determined in some things the people shall not rule, but that the churches shall have sway. A political church will either rule or ruin whether in Europe or America. The Pope is no worse than the political preachers in the United States.

THE May term of court in Henry County, Tenn., one case on the calendar was a charge against a man for plowing on a Sunday. The accused was a young man, that when the weapon was drawn one of his sons, a boy of some fourteen years, was present. The boy was not, however, put on the witness stand. This scandalous means was referred to by the attorney of the defense, who asked: "If this boy of tender years was not put on the stand to testify to his father's guilt." The only excuse offered by the attorney was that the Attorney General who originally had a bill for man's credit that he had not caused his boy to be brought into court to be subjected to cross examination, etc. Yet this Attorney General, who was so very tender of their boy, does not scruple to summon boys of no more mature years before the Grand Jury, and there require them to testify against their own fathers and mothers, telling what is done in the privacy of the home on Sunday!

In its October number, *Free Russia*, the organ of the Society of Friends of Russia Freedom, says:—

Although Alaska was abandoned by the Tsar some decades ago, a border of Russia has surrounded the United States; it is no other than the State of Tennessee, or at the National Sabbath Union's very American Association in men are fined and imprisoned for working to the devil might on Sunday.

This is a bad state of things, yet it is scarcely to be expected to have Tennessee like Russia, a good deal that a Russian visiting Tennessee would have had with joy the opportunity of reading in a newspaper an article about religious liberty; whereas he could only one day in the week. All the same *Free Russia* and the earnest people who are at its head, American the Friends of Russia freedom in this country are not doing not be quite sure that there should some day, be persecution against conscientious objectors of that form in the work which they have now had no cause to fear.

It is still different whether the State statutes control of the conscience one day in the week or seven days; the conscientious Christian must be kept the bold to exercise day alike. Nor is there so very much difference between Russia and Tennessee in respect to the penalty for refusing to surrender soul liberty. In Russia banishment is the penalty for persistant refusal to conform to the dominant creed; in Henry County, Tenn., the authorities say that "the Adventists must yield or leave the State." Of course the Tennessee courts cannot banish them directly, but the authorities have declared that they will prosecute them until they either yield or get out of the State. There is indeed small difference between Russia and Tennessee methods when it comes to the matter of religious persecution.

IN a recent address at Coin, Iowa, Rev. W. F. Crafts claimed that forty millions of the people of this Nation were in favor of closing the World's Fair on Sunday; in the same speech he stated that "western Pennsylvania" sent in one-fourth of all the petitions.

The entire State of Pennsylvania has a population approximately a population of only 5,000,000. The eastern portion of the State has more inhabitants than the western part. One-fourth of 40,000,000 is 10,000,000, — that is more than the whole population representing ten millions of petitioners could come from a territory having a population of less than 3,000,000 of people.

We have repeatedly pointed out the fraudulent character of the petitions circulated by the American Sabbath Union; but the fact is so patent that it bears being covered over and over again many times. The statement made by Mr. Crafts is either a confirmation of what we have said before, or it is a confession that he is a manufacturer of figures.

THE New York *Independent* of September 29 very incorrectly gives the whole Sunday-law movement, and says: "And what shall it say of leaders of Sunday-closing, and Sunday legislation for rest for the purpose of giving the laboring classes rest at least one day in seven—if Sunday closing of the Chicago Exposition is defeated? Would it not be well, for them, that the Sunday rest services would not suffer, it should be remembered that where the Fair Sunday school attendance may not be affected." When the Church begins to apply the principles which it has applied, until it seeks to obtain favors from this source, it does nothing which it does not already do, nothing which it ought not to do. And when it ceases to appeal to the civil power, until it assigns the whole civil authority for religion.
