In the book of the Revelation we have two great symbols presented, the Lamb (Rev. 5:6) representing Christ, and the dragon (Rev. 12:9) symbolizing the devil. Under the figure of a beast which meets all of its thus far developed specifications in this country (see Rev. 13:11), we have both of these symbols reproduced. The beast had two horns like a lamb, and it spake as a dragon. In other words, the two leading principles in the government, that which would naturally exalt it in the eyes of the world, would be identical with the two leading principles of Christianity, which, apart from its supernatural power, would naturally exalt it above other religions on the face of the earth. These principles are the absolute equality of all men (Acts 17:24,26), and the privilege of all men to accept or reject religion (John 3:16; Rev. 22:17). All men considered equals, and no man or set of men having any right to coerce the religious convictions of a single soul, are two great principles which gave Christianity power among the masses wherever its pure doctrine was preached. No other religion ever so spake.

## WILL SPEAK AS A DRAGON.

These two principles, embodied in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States, are what have exalted this country above all other nations of earth in the eyes of the masses. No other government of which history has left a record ever presented both of these admirable principles. But the prophecy declares that the government presenting to the world these two Christ-like principles is to speak with the voice of a dragon. A government can speak only through its laws and decrees. The dragon was a persecutor. Rev. 12:13. The dragon voice of this Government will be the utterance of laws which will result in religious persecution, or persecution for conscience' sake. Occasional utterances from State governments have all along been heard, but more frequently in later years. Massachusetts has prosecuted and imprisoned those who have preached on Boston Common, while brass bands and open-air concerts have been allowed to perform at will. Arkansas has prosecuted, fined, and imprisoned good citizens for working on Sunday to the disturbance of no one, those who keep the seventh-day Sabbath, while some of the very informants, together with railways, saloons, and men of all classes who observed no day, have been allowed to go scot-free. More recently still, Tennessee has been doing similar work to Arkansas. Men have been arrested, fined, and imprisoned for working quietly on their own farms, disturbing no one, not even in sight of the public highway, condemned by the unwilling testimony of neighbors; and in some instances the only criminating testimony which could be obtained was that of members of their own faith. One of these cases was carried to the Supreme Court of Tennessee, and that court affirmed the decision of the lower court and the prisoner was remanded back to serve sentence for the crime of gaining, by quiet, unobtrusive work on the first day of the week, an honest livelihood, after having kept the seventh day according to the fourth commandment of the Decalogue, a document which the prosecutors professed to revere. It was but recently that four men were released from jail and chain-gang in Paris, Tennessee.

Yet we are told that this is free America, and that men may worship God here as conscience dictates; that the battle of religious liberty has been fought once for all, and that this age is too enlightened, too liberal, to ever endeavor to place gyves or shackles on religious thought or convictions again so long as such convictions do not militate against the equal rights of others, so long as life, property, chastity, and reputation are not injured. And the prospects are that men will dream over these good legends of old till every branch of our Government is drunken with the wine of Babylon's fornication, and are ready blindly to do her bidding. For the general Government is now implicated.

## APPEALED TO THE U. S. COURTS.

Appeal was made to the circuit court of the United States in one of the Tennessee cases, and the decision of the State court was affirmed by a decision which is a disgrace to the principles upon which our Government was founded. Appeal was then made to the United States Supreme Court, but pending the argument in that case the appellant died, and his case was remanded by Providence to the Supreme Judge of all. But we are not left in darkness as to what the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States would have been; for on February 29, 1892, a unanimous decision was rendered by the court in the case of Trinity Church, New York, under the Contract Labor law, in which decision it was affirmed that "this is a Christian Nation," and Sunday laws, and religious legislation, with all the logical wickedness contained in it, are justified in principle, as they will be in fact when the plant has borne its legitimate fruit.

## PERSECUTION THE LOGICAL OUTCOME.

Religious persecution is the logical outcome of all this. If this is a "Christian" Nation, logic demands that it should have "Christian" laws, and that those laws should recognize "Christian" institutions. Prominent among the so-called Christian institutions in this country is the "American Sabbath" or "Christian Sabbath,"—the great papal Sunday, a fraud and usuryer from its beginning. And, to be consistently logical, one of the last acts of the last session of Congress was to enact a law, immediately signed by the President, that the gates of the World's Fair should be closed on the Sunday, the chief arguments for which was the holiness of the Sunday and the fear of the churches. We do not care an iota whether the World's Fair is closed or not, let the directors see to that, but Congress has no business to legislate in this matter. And yet Congress has only logically followed in the line of the Supreme Court decision.

WILL BE LED ON STEP BY STEP.

And now as the Supreme Court has decided that the religion of this Nation is the "Christian" religion, and as there are energetic rival claimants to this particular brand, logic will inevitably demand that the Government shall decide as to which among them are sponsors for that religion. And thus the Government will be led on step by step, forced on by the inevitable logic of the path she has chosen and by the religious demagogues and howling hypocrites, who will seek to fatten at the public crib by pandering to the wishes of a church so backslidden that she has lost all hold upon God, and has turned to political Egypt for support. This is what lies before us, unless there is a mightier revolution in religious sentiment than this world has ever seen. Said the United States Senate in 1829:—

All religious despotism begins by combination and influence; and when that influence begins to operate upon the political institutions of a country, the civil power soon bends under it; and the catastrophe of other nations furnishes us an awful warning of the consequence.

We have the "combination" of religious bodies for political purposes, we have seen its influence on our recent Congress, of which our lobbying clergymen boasted that the religious people hold Congress in their hand. The civil power has bent under the influence. The despotism, the persecution, the awful ruin, and yet the triumph of the true and tried, are just ahead. May God open the eyes of the blind.
