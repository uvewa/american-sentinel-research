In a lecture recently delivered at Atalissa, Iowa, the speaker made use of the following language:—

The first political meeting ever held was held on Mt. Sinai. Jehovah was chairman, and Moses secretary. The first four commandments relate to our duty to God, and the last six our duty to politics. Religion and politics were married on Mt. Sinai never to be divorced. A man whose religion will not mix with his politics, has a most miserable kind of politics.

Notwithstanding the experience of all past ages, this spirit seems to be taking hold of the people nowadays in a very marked manner, to mix religion and politics in one common mass so that there would be scarcely any difference discernable between the two. It is generally admitted by all that the politics of this country is in a bad shape, and being in such a condition, it would not certainly be a very good ingredient for a man to mix with his religion. It would certainly be a good thing for the country if all our politicians were true Christian men, but they can not be made such by means of the plans in the minds of those who are so anxious to mix politics and religion. Their idea of mixing politics and religion is to set up a standard of belief and invite the people to accept it if they will, and compel them to accept it if they won't. May the Lord deliver us from such a mixture.

A. O. TAIT.
