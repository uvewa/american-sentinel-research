THE New York *Independent* of September 29, very innocently gives the whole Sunday-law movement away, and shows that all this clamor for Sunday closing and Sunday legislation is not for the purpose of giving the laboring man a rest, but to increase church attendance. It says: "If the Chicago Exposition should be closed Sunday morning so that church services would not suffer, it should be closed Sunday afternoon so that Sunday-school attendance may not be affected." This also serves to illustrate the fact that when the Church begins to make encroachments upon the Government and to obtain favors from this source, it does not cease in its demands in this direction, until it usurps the whole civil authority for the furtherance of its ends.
