IN the book of the Revelation we have, in the thirteenth chapter, a prophetic outline of the history of our own Nation. The beast (Rev. 13:1) representing Christ, and the Beast (Rev. 13:11) symbolizing this country. Under the figure of a beast which meets out in the lamb-like developed specifications of it in that country (see Rev. 13:11), we have both of these symbolized in the form of the lamb, the symbol of Christ, and the voice of a dragon. In other words, the laws of that which would naturally exist in the form of that which would, namely civil liberty in the two leading principles of Christianity, which would be the expressed word; every word would naturally exist it above other religions on the face of the earth. These principles are the absolute equality of all men (Acts 17:26), and the privilege of all men to accept or reject religious truth (2d Rev. 3:17-21). All men considered equals, and no man or set of men having a right to coerce the religious conscience of a single soul—are the two great principles which gave *Christianity* power in the world. No other religion or religious doctrine was preached. No other religion triumphed.

WILL SPEAK AS A DRAGON.

These two principles, embodied in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States, are what have exalted this country above all other countries on the face of the earth. No other government of which history gives us any knowledge has ever practiced these admirable principles. But the prophecy also teaches that the government presenting to the world these two Christian principles is to speak the voice, the word of a dragon. A government can speak only through its laws and enactments; the dragon was a persecutor. Rev. 13:1-10. Therefore the voice of the Government will be the utterance of laws which will result in religious persecution, or permitted religious persecution. That such intolerance from State governments have all along prevailed, in greater or less degree, is well known. In years gone by, and even in later years, Massachusetts has prosecuted, and Tennessee also have been prosecuted on Boston Common, who have been preached and others have been fined and imprisoned for things which all men are allowed to perform at will. Arkansas has prosecuted, fined, and imprisoned good citizens for working on Sunday to the disturbance of no one; those who observe the seventh-day Sabbath, while some of the very informers, together with many citizens and officers and men of all classes who observe no day, have been allowed to go unrebuked. More recently still, Christian men and women in the State of Tennessee have been arrested, fined, and imprisoned for crime, disturbing no one, not even at their labors from a public highway, conducting in the unwilling testimony of neighbors who were to nine instances out the only people who were aware of the work being done, was that of members of their own faith. The case was taken to the Supreme Court of Tennessee, and that court affirmed the decision of the lower court, and the prisoner was remanded back and sentenced for the crime of getting in jail, furthermore, work on the first day that nobody could, as has been said, having kept the seventh day according to the commandment of God, they were judged not to have the right to work on the first day—is a judgment, a document which the prosecution introduced against them. This is the same doctrine that is used to persecute those who dissent, the chain-gang in Faris, Tennessee and elsewhere in the same State. Now we know, and that too many worship God would for the sake of humanity, as we had believed, these men have been fought once for all in this country. Civil liberty has been declared. Yes, to every endeavor to place government power over religious conscience, the rights of all are equal so long as such rights are exercised in a manner that does not infringe upon the rights of others, so long as life, property, and reputation are not invaded. But a man has a right to his own religious opinions. And the prospects are that men still unborn will dream that they have lived in the days before this country was agitated and troubled with my Babylon's foundations, the great National Government was for Imperial Government to say—

Appeal was made to the circuit court of the United States but it seems to be in vain. The States have control of the question except in some cases, and the decision of the State court, offered to give standing which it lodges to the disproving the principles upon which our Government was founded. Appeal was made from the circuit court to the Supreme Court, but pending the argument the prisoners served out their time.

This thing was permitted by Providence to be for a purpose. And when the same thing breaks out in darkness so as to what the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States would have been; on February 29, 1892, the Supreme Court of the United States decided, in the case of Trinity Church, in the city of New York, that "this is a religious people. This is a Christian Nation," and with the legal wickedness that followed that decision will follow naturally at last—that it will in fact when the plant has borne fruit.

Religious persecution is the logical outcome of all of it. If this is a "Christian" Nation, it must have "Christian" laws. "Christian" laws, and that these will include Sunday laws is only a question of time. Prominent among the so-called Christian laws that it is intended to bring to the "American Sabbath" or "Lord's day," as the result, great religious reform, a fraud and usurper from its beginning. And, to be constantly logical, the next step
