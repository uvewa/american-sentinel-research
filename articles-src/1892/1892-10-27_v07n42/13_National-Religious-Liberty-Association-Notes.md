NATIONAL RELIGIOUS LIBERTY ASSOCIATION.

At the regular term of the criminal court of Lexington, Missouri, not long since, Judge Ryland said, in his instruction to the Grand Jury, that it is a crime to sell on Sunday, and urged the Grand Jury to indict all persons who had kept their stores open on Sunday; also all barbers who had done Sunday work.

A HEBREW clothier has been arrested in Battle Creek, Mich., for selling goods on Sunday. His trial has been postponed in order to give the prosecuting attorney time to study up the law in the case. An agent of the Association will be present and report any items of interest that may come up in connection with the trial.

THE Washington *Post* comments editorially on Bishop Potter's article in the *Forum* for the current month, and says that the article "should contribute to a revision by Congress of its short-sighted policy, which, if not counteracted, will do much, it is believed, to cripple the Exposition and warp the usefulness of Sunday as a rest day."

THE Young Women's Christian Associations of Albany, Buffalo, and Jamestown, N. Y., have passed and sent to the secretary of the American Sabbath Union, for use, resolutions condemning the action of the New York State Board of Women Managers in regard to the Sunday opening of the World's Fair, and expressing their opposition to every movement for Sunday opening.

THE Wisconsin Synod of the Presbyterian Church lately in session at Eau Claire, Wis., adopted this resolution:—

*Resolved*, That, appreciating the action of Congress in regard to closing the World's Fair on the Sabbath, this synod hereby expresses its profound conviction that it is both the privilege and duty of Congress to hold firm to its decision as expressed last spring, and we do hereby pledge to it the cordial support and sympathy of the patriotic, intelligent and Christian sentiment of our State.

Thus it is that every effort is being made to clinch the nail already driven.

AN Illinois exchange has this item: "The ladies of New Boston will demand the enforcement of the Sunday laws. All who violate the ordinances hereafter will be prosecuted."

Thus it is that the seeds of persecution sown by the Woman's Christian Temperance Union begin to germinate. These women should know that the sorrow and suffering and blood of the persecuted will be upon their heads in proportion as they have taken the responsibility of advocating and enforcing religious laws. The Sabbath Observance Department of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union will have much to answer for.

AT a meeting of the lady managers of the World's Fair, held at Philadelphia some time ago, it was given out that the voice and vote of the lady managers were for Sunday closing. Mrs. John A. Logan is now in Chicago and has been called upon to explain her vote, which she does as follows:—

Mrs. Lucas, who presided at the meeting, put the question in this way: "All who are against dishonoring the Sabbath say are." Naturally none of us were in favor of dishonoring a day, and so we voted against the proposition. I think that if the machinery be not allowed to run on Sunday the exhibition should be open so that the masses could have all the greater opportunity of being benefited by its elevating and refining influence.

This, read between the lines, shows the same peculiar idiosyncrasies which have marked the whole movement, in almost all its phases. The question was put uncardially and unfairly, or else ignorantly with a mistaken religious bias, to the lady managers; those among them who realized that, evidently shrank from seeming to favor in the least the unpopular side by even suggesting the proper statement of the question. To Mrs. Lucas there was no doubt but one interpretation to the question as she stated it. Sunday, to her mind, was the Sabbath, and to permit any one to view the Exposition on Sunday was to dishonor the Sabbath. In fact, of course, Sunday is not the Sabbath, and a person voting upon the proposition as put could construe it to mean the Sabbath, literally, and not Sunday. Again, the Sunday keeper, who reveres Sunday as the Sabbath, should know, and some do, that to compel its observance by civil law dishonors the day from a religious point of view.

Mrs. Logan now acknowledges that each put their own interpretation upon the question, as put, and voted with a mental reservation. It would not have been politic to have brought this to light then directly under the eyes of the American Sabbath Union of Philadelphia, and the Pittsburg preachers so near, but in Chicago where they want the Fair open Sunday it is different.

A CORRESPONDENT from Kilbourn City, Wis., writes of a systematic effort of the Young People's Christian Endesvor Society of that place in reference to securing the carrying out of the Sunday closing proviso attached by Congress to the World's Fair appropriation. It seems that in this case a petition was actually signed by the members, and they were instructed to secure the bona fide signatures of business and professional men of the place. In the meantime it is well to remember that all these have no doubt been several times counted already in the different churches and organizations to which they belong in petitioning for the Sunday closing of the World's Fair.

THE article on "Sunday and the Columbian Exposition," by Bishop Potter, in the *Forum* for October, has roused the Philadelphia branch of the American Sabbath Union to pass resolutions that the state of things on Sunday in Philadelphia during the Centennial was quite different from what the Bishop states. After speaking of the efforts to ridicule the idea that keepers of saloons and brothels in Chicago are favorable to the Sunday closing of the World's Fair, the Bishop says:—

But such ridicule is very ill-timed in view of facts that are abundantly well known as to the use that people shut out from the Exposition made of their Sunday afternoons in Philadelphia.

As a good and sufficient answer to Bishop Potter the Philadelphians have "Resolved":—

That we refer with gratitude to the fact that the closing of the Centennial Exposition in 1876 on the Sabbath was attended with the most beneficial results, as the closed gates of the Exposition filled the churches of all denominations with those who otherwise would have spent their time elsewhere.

In addition to this a number of Philadelphia gentlemen have signed their names to a statement that,—

In order that the exact facts may be known as to the results of Sunday closing at the Centennial Exhibition, the undersigned . . . desire earnestly to protest against the misleading statements contained in Bishop Potter's article in the *Forum*. The city of Philadelphia throughout the entire period of the Exposition did not witness any notable increase of desecration of the Sabbath as the result of closing the gates of the Exposition.

The one thing noticeable about these statements of the Philadelphia gentlemen and ministers is that, without disproving Bishop Potter's asserted facts, they give a clearer understanding of what Sundays in Philadelphia had customarily been.

A COMMUNICATION from the province of Quebec states that the St. Lawrence system of canals is now open for traffic on Sunday, and will be until the close of navigation. This it seems is the usual custom at this season when there is a rush of grain to get through and our correspondent pertinently asks who it is, if Sunday be a sacred day, and its civil enforcement proper, that has the authority to grant a dispensation to the Government to suspend its Sunday laws, and to the canal owners and laborers to take advantage of it to prosecute Sunday labor. While such wholesale Sunday work as this goes without comment, and Protestant churches omit their Sunday evening meetings that their members may attend a dramatic performance given in benefit of the Roman Catholic church of the place, a poor artist is publicly censured in the village press for making pictures on Sunday. Such inconsistencies as these follow this movement everywhere, and are in themselves sufficient to show its impropriety.

The "Pearl of Days" quotes a member of the Central Labor Union of Indianapolis, Ind., in reference to the Sunday closing of barbers' shops, that, "the authorities should be required to do their duty in the enforcement of the law. The law should prevail." The main reasons given why it should prevail are that the Sunday closing employers should be protected from the injurious competition of those who open on Sunday. Thus it is that selfish purposes are to be furthered by religious laws. And the remarkable thing about it is that they are openly and unblushingly advocated as valid and sufficient, while the "Pearl of Days," and its compeers sees no incongruity. Is it because the things are not incongruous and they know it?

Under the title "Sunday Law in Germany," the Chicago *Tribune* has the following item:

"The new Sunday laws in Germany went partly into effect July 1st, and do not appear to be giving satisfaction. Their intention was to reduce the hours of labor Sunday to a minimum, and to secure a larger church attendance of working people. They provided that in no case should Sunday work extend beyond five hours, while from 10 to 12 in the morning and after 2 o'clock in the afternoon there should be no work whatever. In actual operation the effect seems to be to keep those workingmen who used to do a half-day's work Sunday in their shops, until 2 o'clock, instead of merely until noon as before, while they spend the time from 10 to 12 not in church, but in beer gardens and cabarets, till the embargoed hours pass and they can finish their work and go home. The church authorities in Berlin are already admitting that the laws have not increased the number of Sunday worshipers, though they have the number of Sunday tipplers."

At a meeting of the World's Fair Commission in Chicago, on October 18, the resolution, passed at a former meeting, granting a special hearing on the Sunday closing question, October 19, was rescinded.

The following resolution was offered, and laid on the table:

"*Resolved*, By the World's Columbian Commission, that while the Congress of the United States has taken the matter of closing the Exposition, Sunday, out of the hands of the Commission during the present, the right of petition, so sacred to American citizens, will remain, and realizing fully that the toiling millions of America are determined to be allowed one day of the week to see the wonders of the World, that day being the one commonly called Sunday, that the Commission petition Congress to rescind its action on this question."

In order to obtain an official expression from the management of the World's Columbian Exposition, a resolution was adopted asking the management if it had decided to accept the act of Congress making the appropriation with a Sunday closing proviso.

In reference to this, a commissioner said that the management had virtually accepted it when it began stamping the souvenir coins, and that it only remained for the National Commission to make Sunday closing rules for the Exposition, whether it wished to or not, because that was now its legal duty.
