"In the Chain-gang."

Reader, have you done anything to assist in circulating that excellent tract, "In the Chain-gang for Conscience Sake," noticed in this paper three weeks ago? If not, be sure to send at once to the National Religious Liberty Association, Battle Creek, Mich., for a good supply, and then scatter them among your neighbors. This tract is a brief history of the persecution of Seventh-day Adventists in Tennessee; it costs only fifty cents per hundred, and will surely be read by everyone who sees it.
