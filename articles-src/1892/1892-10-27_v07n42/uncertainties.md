## General OCR Quality
- **Overall quality:** Good. The Mistral OCR transcription was generally clear and readable.
- **Challenges:** Some minor issues with special characters, formatting of advertisements, and occasional word breaks.

## Specific Uncertainties

### Page 2, Article "The Best People"
- **Issue:** The date "1893" appears on page 8 in the metadata line, but this is issue 42 of volume 7 published October 27, 1892
- **Transcribed as:** 1892-10-27
- **Confidence:** HIGH - confirmed by masthead date on page 1
- **Reason:** The year 1893 is clearly a typographical error in the page 8 footer

### Page 7, Advertisement Section
- **Issue:** Table formatting for subscription prices was unclear in OCR
- **Resolution:** Preserved the table structure as presented in OCR with pipe characters
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM - table may need verification against original

### Page 7, Author "Allen Moon"
- **Issue:** First occurrence of this author signature "ALLEN MOON" in the project
- **Transcribed as:** Allen Moon (author_short: AM)
- **Confidence:** HIGH - name is clearly printed
- **Note:** Added to known authors list

### Various Articles
- **Issue:** Some reprinted articles had sources in italics (e.g., "—*Morning Star*")
- **Resolution:** Preserved italic formatting with asterisks
- **Confidence:** HIGH

### Page 4, Article "Church Unity Now in View"
- **Issue:** The word "Christine" appeared in "Christine Advocate"
- **Transcribed as:** "Christian Advocate"
- **Confidence:** HIGH - context makes clear this is the well-known publication "Christian Advocate"
- **Reason:** OCR error, likely due to scan quality

### Page 7, Railroad Advertisement
- **Issue:** "SINDS" in "THE LINK THAT SINDS TWO GREAT NATIONS"
- **Transcribed as:** SINDS (preserved as printed)
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM - likely should be "BINDS" but preserved original spelling
- **Reason:** Possible printing error or OCR misread, but left as transcribed in OCR

## Advertisement and Non-Article Content
- **Skipped:** Multiple book advertisements, railroad advertisements, subscription information, and publisher boilerplate per instructions
- **Created files for:** Only substantive articles with arguments and content

## Notes
- No instances of text obscured by stamps, stains, or damage
- All article boundaries were clear
- Author attributions were straightforward
