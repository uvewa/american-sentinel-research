AT the regular term of the criminal court of Lancaster, Missouri and Iowa, Judge Ward, in his instructions to the Grand Jury, had said, in his instructions to the Grand Jury, said as a charge is to sit on Sunday, and urged that the Jury to indict all persons who had kept their stores open on Sunday, and also all who did Sunday work.

The Washington Post comments editorially on Bishop Potter's articles in the *Forum* for the current month, and says that the article should be referred to a revision by Congress of its short-sighted policy, which, if not reconsidered, will smash, it is believed, to cripple the Exposition and warp the usefulness of Sunday's observance.

The Young Women's Christian Association of Albany, before a committee, has had the matter power and sent to the secretary of the Association, a protest against the management and the action of the New York State Board of Women Managers of the World's Fair in securing an exhibit at the World's Fair, and expressing their opposition to Sunday opening.

The Wisconsin Synod of the Presbyterian Church lately in session at Eau Claire, Wisconsin, said:

*Resolved*, That appreciating the action of Congress in closing the Columbian Exposition on Sunday, this synod is impressed with the deep conviction that it is both the privilege and duty of the Christian people and churches of this land to continue the agitation of this question so well last spring; and we do hereby pledge ourselves, in the interest of Sabbath observance, to our influence and our power to sustain Congress in this matter.

This is that every effort is being made to keep the Fair closed on Sundays.

An Illinois exchange has this item: "The ladies of New Brunn will demand the enforcement of the Sunday law, at all who violate the ordinance hereafter will be prosecuted."

It is felt that to send off a presentment such as the Women's Christian Temperance Union begin to persecute. These women should think that the sorrow and suffering and blood of the people which will be upon their hands hereafter as to make the women of the United States largely culpable in enforcing religious laws. The Sabbath Observance department of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union will have much to answer for.

At a meeting of the lady managers of the Columbian Exposition, held on October 13, it was given out that the voice and vote of Mrs. John A. Logan was against Sunday opening. John A. Logan is now in Chicago, and has been quoted as having said she was opposed to Sunday opening.

Mrs. Logan, who presided at the meeting, read a paper on that the Sabbath was a matter of duty dishonoring the Sabbath any way." Naturally none of these good, well-meaning ladies see that we voted against the proposition. I also know, from long acquaintance with Mrs. Palmer, that she is a most accomplished lady and that she could have all the greatest opportunity of being made President of the United States.

The read between the lines, shows the strangely disloyal element, who have made the whole movement, is almost all its phases. The question was put generally and readily or otherwise; for it was well known there was "validity" ignorantly with a mistaken religious bias, to the extent that was known there was "validity" established from entering in earnest to what is regarded as the more especially righteous, the proper statement of the question. To Mrs. Logan we doubt she had not used interpretations in the question as she stated. In Sunday, we her belief, was the Sabbath; therefore, Sunday the view the Exposition on Sunday was to dishonor the Sabbath. In fact, courtesy being given her station, and a person voting upon does not have as good a reason to suspect the innocence of the proposal.

And yet, important, as surely to the point; those who do observe the Sabbath, the Sabbath should be let alone. The question of what day by civil law dishonors the day from a religious point of view.

Mrs. Logan now acknowledges that such act was not authorized and asks the press not to connect her official position as president with her own personal act which was personal and done and voiced with a mental reservation. It would seem that this should have been made some thirty indeed under the ayes of the American Sabbath Union. There were about 150 guests, many of whom were Americans at least, four in Chicago since the last week of the Fair was opened by the machinery of the association.

A correspondent writes from City, giving an extract of a representative effort of the Church, a Christian Endeavor Society of that organization. Another says "The effort to close the Fair on Sunday is an organized plot by a few to destroy the glorious provision attached by Congress to the World's Columbian Exposition. Religious and commercial interest have combined to throttle the enterprise which was originally signed by the members, and which the Constitution of the United States places in the hands of the People. Many men of business and professional men of the community are among the lists. Many of them are clergymen of the various denominations, and all these have no doubt been several times canvassed by the agents of the American Sabbath Union, who have not been able to answer the questions to which they belong in petitioning the government to enforce their religious belief."

The article on "Sunday and the Columbian Exposition," by Bishop Potter, in the *Forum* is worthy of thoughtful attention.

Bishop Potter not only says that the present state of things on Sunday in Philadelphia the case is by no means so black as it is painted in the Bible states. After speaking of the effect of the working-men's half holiday upon Sunday, and the statement that people having all Saturday afternoon in Chicago are favorable to the Sunday opening, and the change in public sentiment, he says:—

But such ridicule is very ill timed in view of evidence on every hand, not to say notorious, that people shut out from the churches on Sunday in Philadelphia have "nowhere to go."

This statement and sufficient answers it to Bishop Potter's satisfaction and sufficiency is attested by Bishop Potter.
