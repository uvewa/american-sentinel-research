REV. J. H. LEIPER, one of the district secretaries of the National Reform Association, has been spending some time in the oil regions of Pennsylvania, and reports progress in the *Christian Statesman* of October 15. Mr. Leiper says:—

Quite a large number of farmers receive a steady monthly income from the "royalty" of wells operated by various oil companies. No class of men better deserve the oil episode. To know farmers you must be among them. As a rule no more generous set of men exist. Occasionally you will meet a mean, narrow-minded, hard-twisted Lord of the Soil, but this is the exception. They have proved themselves practical Christians in regard to the law of the Sabbath.

A sharp contest was carried through to a successful issue in favor of letting the wells take care of themselves on the Sabbath. It was necessary to use the "arm of the law" and it was done firmly and vigorously. The companies paid the fines and gave orders to superintendents to "go ahead." The farmers were men who had been educated in the John Knox school of theology; they believed in the Sabbath of the fathers, and had the courage of their convictions, so they gave their orders, too, that is, to the officers of the law, "go ahead." One transgressor was brought face to face before the court to the tune of sixteen indictments. He could only "fess up" and pay his fines and costs of suit and return to his work a wiser if not a better man. If the officers of the law everywhere had the proper regard for their oath of office, and the law abiding people promptly reported all and every infraction of law known to them, and demanded its just punishment, the honor of the law would be maintained and its violations be very rare. This of itself would solve the Sabbath problem of this land.

It seems from this that "the Sabbath of the fathers" is the Sunday enforced by civil law! But that is not the Sabbath of the Bible; the Bible Sabbath is an institution which those who observe it call "honorable," and "a delight." (See Isa. 58:13.)

Another point worthy of notice in the paragraph quoted from Mr. Leiper, is the statement that if the officers of the law would only do their duty "this of itself would solve the Sabbath problem of this land." Then all there is to the "Sabbath question" is simply to secure cessation from labor such as could be secured by civil law rigidly enforced! This does not agree very well with the following utterance by Rev. S. M. Bell, of Butler, Pa., in the Pittsburg Sunday convention, on the 29th of last March. Mr. Bell said:—

We have not so much to fear from foe as from friend. The great foe of the Sabbath is the corruption and apathy of the individual conscience. It has come upon us little by little. We have gone through the years until the individual conscience—I will not say the public conscience, for the public has no conscience—has become weak. I want to say that the great peril of the Sabbath is the corruption and the apathy of the individual conscience. I would have no fear for the Sabbath if the individual conscience were right. I have no hope of saving the Sabbath except as we revive the individual conscience.

Mr. Leiper has no hope for Sunday except in the enforcement of civil law. Mr. Bell thinks the only hope is in educating the individual conscience. Is not Mr. Bell's the better plan? Or does Mr. Leiper think to revive the individual conscience by means of civil penalties?—Scarcely.

But not only does Mr. Leiper fail to comprehend the real idea of a Sabbath and of Sabbath observance, but he evidently has no proper conception of the nature of a failure to observe a Sabbath. He says:—

Because Sabbath-breaking does not, as stealing, take money directly from the pockets of the people, the perpetrators are mostly allowed to escape just punishment, while the thieving of a peck of potatoes from the crowded grocery pavement or a coat from the rack of the clothier, will call to faithful duty a half dozen of "blue coats" who hunt to find the half-starved, shivering offender, who must lie thirty days in jail for his crime. All this may occur on the one and the same Sabbath, the grocery and clothing house being open. Any violation of law should be met by its proper punishment; but the thief in the above case, if he is suffering from want, may be at heart a patriot while every intentional Sabbath-breaker is at heart an anarchist: (If an exclamation point here would give sufficient emphasis, I would place one after anarchist) and we are taught that the anarchist, because of the danger he is to society, should be met with the rigor of the law. So thought and acted the authorities of Chicago a few years ago. Under this same conviction the administrators of law in New York incarcerated the German agitator, Most, Most spoke openly—but who are the proprietors of these Sabbath-breaking sheets? Echo answers, Who? One thing in favor of these Sunday Newspaper men is thus made apparent; their hiding from public view as they perpetrate this wickedness proves that they are not lost to all shame. In the meantime let the friends of the Sabbath in every county in Pennsylvania see to it that the candidates for the legislature for whom they vote this fall are pledged to preserve the law of 1784 intact, and if any change should be made let the penalty be raised all over the State to $25 for each and every violation of it. If the mails on the Sabbath were everywhere discontinued, the Sunday newspaper business would be settled. Can this be done?

This requires little comment, as it shows as plainly as words can show the bitter spirit that is back of the present Sunday-law movement. The reference to the action of Chicago in dealing with the anarchists a few years ago shows what Mr. Leiper thinks would be proper punishment for the violator of a Sunday law. They hanged anarchists in Chicago, and this is not the first time that the pious (?) Sunday advocates have intimated that hanging would be none too severe a punishment for those who refuse to observe the "American Sabbath."

Another thought in connection with Mr. Leiper's words is this: He appeals to the precedent set in the case of Anarchist Most in this city. Most was not imprisoned for breaking the law himself but for inciting others to lawlessness. And now it is said that the same thing should be done in the cases of the Sunday papers; those who print them should be punished for inciting others to break the Sunday laws. How long will it be before freedom of speech will be taken away in the interests of religious laws in this country? How long before it will be held to be incendiary language to deny the propriety of Sunday laws or the sacredness of the day? Certainly not long if such men as Mr. Leiper have their way.
