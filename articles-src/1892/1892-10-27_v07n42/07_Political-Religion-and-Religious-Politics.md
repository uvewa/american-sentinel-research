The London dailies publish the following among their cable news from this city:—

The question of the Sunday opening or closing of the Chicago World's Fair is destined to play no inconsiderable part in the coming political campaign in the United States. The advocates of the open Sunday propose to leave no stone unturned to undo the work of the Sunday closers in the last session of the Congress. The movement in fact is in the hands of old campaigners of both political faiths, and from present indications the fight will be made before election.

Petitions by the thousand are already being circulated. The various trade and labor organizations have suspended hostilities, where hostilities existed, to join hands in favor of a repeal of the connotious clause in the appropriation bill which requires that the World's Fair should be closed on the first day of the week. German societies by the hundred have signified their intention to work to the same end; and many of the more liberal Christian denominations have promised their support. The *modus operandi* of the anti-Sunday closers is a simple one. In every congressional district from Maine to California petitions will be circulated for signatures. It is the intention to obtain a majority of the voters in each district as signers of these petitions, and before election day the fact of this expression of opinion will be made forcibly apparent to the rival candidates for congressional honors. According to the statements of the leaders of the labor organizations, there appears to be no question that a majority of the voters will sign these petitions.

Such a demonstration of their theories of political religion, and religion in politics, as this, would be more than the advocates of Sunday closing by legislative trickery and political influence, have bargained for. Nevertheless they should have realized that it would be the necessary result of the course upon which they have entered. They have authority which they can not gainsay for the truth that "they who take the sword shall perish with the sword." It would seem that if they believed this assertion of the Master they would hesitate to invoke the aid of the sword of the civil law. In this political combat over the enforcement of religious forms the spirit of true religion is sure to be entirely blotted from the hearts of the combatants. This is certain. Political religion will triumph, but only for a time. This also is certain; and then the end comes.
