THE London dailies publish the following from an American source:—

The idea of the World's Fair is destined to play an important part in American politics. The Sunday closure brought a strong force to bear upon Congress, the character of which it is best that this country should know, as no honest elector can fail to see that in the present state of things, although the Sunday closers propose to have no stone unturned in their effort to secure the Sunday closing, the character of the Congress. The movement is in fact a political factor, but owing to the excitement on this issue, events are being set in motion that were never before anticipated.

Various religious denominations are already being cited for various political purposes. Several denominations have suspended hostilities, where hostilities had previously existed, in order to unite against a common enemy, and one of the most serious conscious clause in the appropriation bill which one hundred and fifty members of the House pledged to insert, a strong force of over five hundred have signified their intention to work for the same policy at the next session of Congress. The modus operandi of the anti-Sunday closers has been quite novel. The clergymen, acting as a unit, have sent emissaries from district from Maine to California politics will be vitally affected, and these emissaries are the active politicians of the country, and have the signatures of those petitions, and before election call upon each of the congressional candidates, and pledged them to vote against this obnoxious personal insurer. According to the statements of these political religionists from the country, and on so so confident that a majority of Congress will be of their way of thinking.

Such a demonstration of their theories of political religion, and religion in politics, has, of course, by no means secured the victory of Sunday closing by legislative action. That this would mean that it should be finally gained for. Nevertheless they should have realized that it would be far from accomplished and that the course upon which they have entered. They have entered, they have learned that which they can not gainday for the truth that "they only take the sword shall perish with the sword." It would seem that if they have followed the example of the Master they would hesitate to invoke the aid of a single sword. They certainly will have no textual comfort over the enforcement of religious laws because the government is said to be entirely blinded from the religion of the continence. There is no doubt that religion will triumph, but only on its merits. This also was verified on its merits.

The American Unitarian Association has signally an appeal to, yet it does not look upon the right as all being one-sided. There was this right, "upon the right to close the Columbian Exposition. Without entering into a discussion of the right or proper decision of that question, the Association would have had to give its opinion, and they decided that there is no right whatever to pass special laws for the closing of the Fair, in violation of the law and Constitution of the United States and, above other things, Unitarianism. This is a simple thing that is to say that it takes it as a simple fact that civil and not ecclesiastical law is concerned in the matter. It is a civil action at the time. It is decided when the nation was divided as to what should be done with the question of Congress, no one was wise enough to arise, since one side might yield to the pressure of the religious and the other to the secular; one yielded to the temper of Unitarianism and the other to the temper of some who have been inconsistent heretofore in our opposition of them. These people go back immediately into the Constitution of the United States, and see by the amendments therein, and fall into the trap set by the advocacy of religion through legislation. The appeal to Congress that it shall take action in regard to that question, on whichever side, appears to them an invasion. And when we say that the mere mention of religion in a political debate is an invasion we might have taken higher ground the moment that was allowed, because it was the precedent for all the troubles that have come in our autumnal meetings.

"We therefore respectfully but earnestly protest against any legislation upon, and say that all such beyond legislation being contrary to fundamental principles, and say that all beyond legislation adverse to, or in favor of Christianity or any of its institutions, being contrary to the principles of equal rights and impartial liberty to all citizens and all men, is foreign to the spirit of our institutions, and opposed to the genius of our government, we view with alarm and apprehension the actual realization of habits which would naturally lead to religious legislation not only for the present, but which are on record, for political purposes, as being sought by some of the religious bodies.

"The precedent is a dangerous one. It is a religious consideration which has come before Congress; and who does not see that it opens a door through which a majority of senators and representatives may soon make special religious law of the land, that this is a Christian Nation," and that what we want in this land is Christian principles and to forbid un-Christian practices?"

There can be no doubt that wise men away from our well-defended post, led on by mistaken zeal, have gone astray. There can be no doubt that every advantage taken, of this success of this closing, they taken courage at his success in vindicating the cause of the "Christian Sabbath" by a getting a restriction on the loan money to the Columbus Exposition.

There can be no doubt that the best step
