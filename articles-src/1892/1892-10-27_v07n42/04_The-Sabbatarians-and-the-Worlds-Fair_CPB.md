IN the following paragraph the *Chron.* gives a very fair statement of the controversy concerning the opening of the Fair on Sunday:—

The schism which is now being fought in the courts and in Congress, on the question of the election of men pledged to allow the opening of the World's Fair on Sunday, has led to a sharp battle between the advocates of an "open" and a "closed" Sunday for many people of all religious beliefs, who, while not in favor of the religious observance of the day of the week, are in favor of opening the Fair on Sunday for the reason of not interfering with the Sabbatarians. The reason for the difference of opinion is found in the fact that the Sabbatarians are naturally opposed to the idea of meddling with the Sabbatarians. The reason for the interested in or near Chicago want to have the Fair open on Sunday for selfish reasons. They "pluck" on this one day of the week. They will wield a great influence with the management; and it is not impossible that the Fair opened on Sunday will ruin, at least a section of them. It has long been conceded by those who have studied this question, that an open Fair on Sunday would draw from the churches.

But the *Chronicle* has unintentionally made a great mistake. It says that "the body must have a head. The Church is either or Sabbatarians." Now, while it is true that those who observe the seventh day are Sabbatarians, the Sabbatarians do not want Sunday closed, they are not in favor of Sunday closing, since to close a secular institution because of Sunday would establish Sunday as a sacred day by law. Hence, it is in no wise true that Sabbath-keepers are in favor of closing the Fair; as a matter of fact, the Sabbatarians of the country are most emphatically opposed to closing the Fair on Sunday. The World's Fair is opened on Sunday or not. And yet it is a fact that very many church people, especially the ministers, are working most vigorously to have the Fair closed on Sunday, because they know that if it opens on Sunday it will be a rival of the churches on that day.

How can this paradox be explained? Simply on the ground that the churches have lost the Sabbath, and the Sabbath is not in Sunday. This is shown by the fourth commandment says: "Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy." "Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work; but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God." Sabbath is the name of the seventh day and not the first. Sunday has never been called the Sabbath by divine authority. Sunday has no more right to that name than has Monday or Thursday. Consequently only those who keep the seventh day really keep the Sabbath. It is evident that they care not whether the World's Fair is open on Sunday or not, and take no interest in the discussion of the question, except to show the people that even if Sunday were a Christian institution, instead of a pagan holiday, enforced Sunday observance would be contrary to Christianity.

We are glad to be able to say, however, that there are many of the people in the United States who keep Sunday, who are not of the class of the defenders, quietly plowing in his field some 100 yards from his neighbor's place of worship. But the inconsistency of those who profess to be followers of Christ and yet invoke the civil law to punish those who differ from them in their views of the Sabbath, and that too when they themselves admittedly do not keep any Sabbath at all, for they admit that the seventh day is the only Sabbath and they do not keep the seventh day,—is apparent to all honest, thinking people.
