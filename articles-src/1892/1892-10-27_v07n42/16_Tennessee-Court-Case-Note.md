At the May term of court in Henry County, Tenn., one case on the calendar was a charge against a man for drawing a pistol. The accusing witness testified that when the weapon was drawn one of his sons, a boy of some fourteen years, was present. The boy was not, however, put on the witness stand. This circumstance was referred to by the attorney for the defense, who asked, "If this boy saw this pistol drawn why was he not called to testify to the fact?" This pertinent inquiry was met by the Attorney General who declared that it was greatly to the man's credit that he had not caused his boy to be brought into court to be subjected to cross examination, etc. Yet this same Attorney General, who was so very tender of that boy, does not scruple to summon boys of no more mature years before the Grand Jury, and there require them to testify against their own fathers and mothers, telling what is done in the privacy of the home on Sunday!
