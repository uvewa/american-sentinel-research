All religious despotism begins by combination of religious bodies, and the movement to impose upon the political institutions of a country, and the peculiar doctrines and customs of the Church. That is what the "combination" of religious bodies for political purposes, we see in the country in our recent Congress, of which our lobbying clergymen and their political managers have grown in their hand. The civil power has been under the hands of the religious, the persecution, the awful ruin, and yet the triumph of the Lord is the end just as surely.

At the late meeting of the Tennessee River Conference of Seventh-day Adventists, at Nashville, Elder C. L. Boyd, President of the conference, this referred to the persecutions of his people in Henry County, Tennessee:—

Producers of both joy and sorrow may be seen. The world being over-run with trouble, our own people have been called to endure sufferings that one of our brothers of the Springfield church, of the church of Henry County, Tennessee, was arrested. The cases were proceeded on the evidence of church members of the Seventh-day Adventist Church by members of a rival church, were found guilty of doing the innocent act of teaching and teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.

Some of these so-called Christian people are so blinded as to think it their duty to govern the conscience of their neighbor, their fellow-citizens, and so distorted that by they have now become satisfied to see the persecutors come. For they have persecuted according to its works: "a kind of first installment" on their account. It must be remembered that Alore Hutchinson's fruit was banished to a shivering camp on account of creed," which puts the spirit and letter of religious liberty into the Massachusetts Bill of Rights and the Constitution of the Commonwealth.
