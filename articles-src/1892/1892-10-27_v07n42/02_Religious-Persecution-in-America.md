THOSE who imagine that in every State and Territory of this great so-called free America, perfect religious freedom exists, are wofully mistaken. Men and women, by statute, forced to make or abstain from making certain observances according to the dictates of their neighbors instead of their own individual judgment. The sentiment which prevailed in the Puritan colonies of New England and inflicted the most horrible cruelties on Quakers and other dissenters from the established religion, has not yet died out, and banished Roger Williams and his little band of Baptists to Rhode Island, still prevails to an extent not imagined by most of the people of the country.

As an excuse for religious persecution, we are often told that this is a Christian country. Those who argue thus would make it appear that those who believe in the majority, making this a Methodist country. But on the other hand there are a few who would make it a Baptist country, and so, if any of these denominations should get to be a majority, they would, according to the conclusions of those narrow-minded fanatics, have a perfect right to compel all others to conform to their ways. Their idea seems to be that might is right, but the laws of this country are against them, it is in no wise true that Sabbath-keeping is a crime in any State, and, as a matter of fact, the Sabbatarians of the country are most quiet, peaceable people.

As an excuse for religious persecution, we are often told that this is a Christian country. Those who argue thus would make it appear that the unbelievers are in the majority, making this a Methodist country. Then those who argue that would would be a great howl against religious persecution and Sabbatarians as criminals on worshipping Sunday and worshipping on the very day that they conscientiously inclined for Jesus' sake. But to the facts.

There is a certain section of Tennessee in which there are settled a large number of Seventh-day Adventists. Their distinguishing characteristic is that they keep holy as the Sabbath the seventh day of the week, Saturday. There is a Stanky law in Tennessee, which forbids work during that State on Sunday. Some Seventh-day Adventists were arrested, charged with working on Sunday. It was proven that they were observers of the Sabbath of the Bible, and the day observed by them was the Christian Sabbath. They proved that they rested on Saturday; that the railroad, every station, hotels, and other lines of business did business on Sunday, and that even the State's witnesses were transacting their business on the law on some other on some of that business, openly plowing in his field some 100 yards from the place of religious services or attending to his other business on Sunday, are not the same as those witnesses even that all is not at all to be religious persecution even here. What a startling thing! These Adventists were convicted to work on Sunday by the testimony of men who claimed to be Christians! In the case was affirmed by the higher court of Tennessee, and the defendants not being able to prove that the United States courts for relief from a most infamous religious persecution. In these Tennessee cases no pretense was made of any disturbance by the Adventists, and notwithstanding the fact that they were never seen by anyone unless the latter worked on the roads this common fence, those poor Adventists were Baptists and had a most excellent character, were convicted by their neighbors, and sentenced these by the Constitution of the United States to worship God according to the dictates of their own conscience, and sentenced to pay fines, and upon failure to pay these poor Adventists were Baptists and had a most excellent character, would just as soon kick such people with their feet as to try them before a court, or roads, the fishes of the lowest class, and the ground that they disturbed the peace of the community by engaging in the innocent practice of cultivating their ground. The Star always regrets to see anything of this nature, but turning away from the old and honored landmarks of Puritan intolerance, people are now bringing persecution for opinions' sake, and violating the guarantees of civil liberty which our fathers placed through principles in the Bill of Rights into the Constitution of the State of Tennessee and which cannot be separate.—*Morning Star, Marshall, Mich.*
