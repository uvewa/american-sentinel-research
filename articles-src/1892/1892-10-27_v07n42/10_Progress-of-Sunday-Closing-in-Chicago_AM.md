Just now there is considerable agitation in the city of Chicago over the question of closing all places of business and amusement on Sunday. The clergy of several of the leading denominations have held meetings for the purpose of laying plans for organizing a general movement in the interest of Sunday closing. The clerks of the clothing houses have been induced to form an association, and the clerks in other lines that had already organized, have been solicited to join the movement. Committees have been sent to all the proprietors of stores, many of whom are Jews and employ Jewish clerks, that keep open all, or a part of the day Sunday, requesting them to close. The clergy have advised the boycott for all dealers who refuse to close on Sunday.

It was proposed on one occasion, that all those favoring closing, enter into a pledge not to buy any article of any store that is kept open on that day; and finally on Sept. 25, at a mass-meeting held in one of the Methodist churches, a resolution was passed, which read as follows:—

*Resolved*, That it is the sense of this meeting, that we, the purchasing public of this West Side, do agree not to purchase any goods sold by any store that may keep open its doors on the Sabbath, and do further agree to exert our influence in every way practicable for the closing of stores on the Sabbath [Sunday].

This meeting was presided over by Bishop Fallows of the Episcopal Church, and other clergymen of more or less note were present, and aided the meeting with their speeches and influence.

At the time of this mass-meeting another mass-meeting was called, to be held at the Armory Hall, October 11. At this meeting a similar resolution to the one above mentioned, was passed. Also at this meeting, which was attended by about one thousand five hundred people, the business of those men who close their doors on Sunday, was advertised, and they themselves were applauded.

The object of this meeting, as stated by its projectors, was to create a sentiment in favor of no Sunday work on the part of the clerks in the different lines of trade, a majority of whom being Jews and liberals, and in sympathy with their employers. But the minority propose to influence the purchasing public to ruin the business of the majority, in order to create the sentiment in favor of Sunday closing that they desire.

ALLEN MOON.
