IN a lecture recently delivered at Atlantic, Iowa, the speaker made use of the following language:—

Mr. Sinai  ——— was chairman, and Moses was secretary; the Lord dictated, and Moses was recorder; the day we live is our duty to God, and the last era our duty to God. The man who says religion has nothing to do with politics, and who will not mix politics with his religion, has a most convenient religion, and one that will not with his politics, has a most convenient politics.

This is just the kind of sentiment that is held up to the hold of the people nowadays in a very marked manner, to mix religion and politics into one common mass that these men would be exorcise any difference between that of religion and that of politics committed by all the politics of the community, a condition, it would not be a bad thing after all, a condition, it would not certainly be a very good standard for a man to mix with his religion. It would certainly be a good standard if they were true Christian men, but they can be made to be the most dangerous weapons in the minds of those who are so anxious to mix politics and religion, that their aim of making politics and religion is to set up a standard of belief and invite the people to accept it if they will, and compel them to accept it if they won't. May the Lord deliver us from such a mixture!
