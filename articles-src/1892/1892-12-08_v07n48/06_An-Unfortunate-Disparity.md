# An Unfortunate Disparity.

We know from of the examples of history, from all the long horrible record of bigotry and intolerance, that any union of Church and State is fatal to public freedom; any governmental interference with the natural rights of conscience is an unjust and unjustifiable offence against our rights and an impertinence that any man who is thoroughly American than that every man shall profess and profess what ever religion or no religion that he shall choose. There can be no principle more barbaric and intolerant, more thoroughly un-American, than that of regulating the religious opinions or membership by the civil power. It is a relic of a brutal and fearful past. It invades the sanctuary of the soul. It conjures up visions of the fires of Smithfield, and the dungeons and tortures of the persecutions of Salem. It is revolting alone to all sentiment of public, political justice and governmental equity; but that a sweet spirit of gentleness and love in which he appeal in the heart of Christianity. Surely all these would make an action to utterly unconstitutional. As far as the law of Tennessee are concerned there is no constitution to be reached, as the Constitution reads: "All men have a natural and inalienable right to worship Almighty God according to the dictates of their own conscience," — "that no human authority can, in any case whatever, control or interfere with the rights of conscience," and "that no preference shall be given to any religious establishment or mode of worship."

Now that if any citizen, tradesman, farmer, or other person, shall be guilty of doing or performing any worldly business or work, or a common labor on the 13th, the adult children or servants, acts of real necessity or charity excepted, being convicted thereof before any Justice of the Peace of the County, shall forfeit and pay to said County — for the use of the common school fund."

*The Sunday Times* would respectfully direct the attention of all good men to this law; we make no farther or stammer comments; and would further respectfully call for a fair ballot or balance statesmen at our candidature for the Legislature.—*Sun-day Mercury.*
