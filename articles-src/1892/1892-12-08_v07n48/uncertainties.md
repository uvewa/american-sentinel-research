## Specific Uncertainties

### Page 2, Line 102
- **Text:** "And he was clothed with a venture dipped in blood"
- **Expected:** "vesture" (as in Revelation 19:13)
- **Confidence:** HIGH - this is clearly an OCR error; "venture" should be "vesture"
- **Reason:** Biblical quotation; checked against standard text

### Page 5, Author Attribution
- **Text:** "AMY A. NEFF" signed the article "Organizing in Virginia"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM - unusual author not in known list
- **Reason:** Clear signature at end of article; assuming accurate transcription

## Resolution Notes
- Most text was clear and well-preserved in the OCR
- Standard author initials matched known editors (ATJ, CPB, WHM, WAC, AFB)
- Multiple reprint attributions clearly marked with source publications
