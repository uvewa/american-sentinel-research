# Persecution in Russia and America.

Of the persecution of Seventh-day Adventists in Tennessee with the savored this.

Of the persecution of the Stundists, as they are called, in Russia we have the following in an article from what has been regarded as a minister, its not the first attempt that been made to suppress by law the Christians in Russia:

The persecutions they endure are incredible, or would be incredible to the Americans of to-day, which we heard in the nineteenth century. Families are broken up, property confiscated, men and women, guilty of nothing but religious worship of their convictions, draftmanship, men are hauled to jails and courts; children and minors, their bodies visited with fire loaded with chains, their bodies visited with fire and hot irons, some of them are cruelly beaten, others are killed, and their blood is shed like water for very sport. Words fail me to express a tithe of their suffering; yet they remain steadfast.

The gentleman styles these people "innocents," and yet they are violated of the civil law, and are punished under the color and form of civil law, just as surely as are the Adventists here in America. They are not charged with any offence against the civil law. They are charged with violating the precepts of the Orthodox Church, and if the precepts of that religion and to the customs of the country which are so intimately related to it that they can not be separated. And so it is that the Russian the Russian authorities reason, just as do the authorities in Henry County, Tenn., reason concerning the Adventists. Yet the cases are essentially different in Russia and America. In both countries the real question is where, and bigotry and intolerance and religious tyranny are the real motives, whether in the Old or in the New World.

But the Orthodox Church in Russia wants no revival of religion. A revival of genuine religion would be the best ally to priestcraft, and the utter destruction of the priest state and the entire overthrow of the Russian State religion.

About thirty five years ago the work began in Russia is told thus briefly by Mr. George:—
