# "The Constitution and Religion."

SAYS the *Union Signal* of November 10:

> The great congress of all religions to be held at the World's Columbian Exposition at Chicago, which is sure to rehite the light of knowledge, and the broadness of the brotherhood of man.

And further remarks that:

> Whatever contributes to a single moment to such a broad, fraternal exchange of views between nations on a theme that has also tried, and does still try in many parts of the world, separate the groups in political or church life into hostile and murderous camps, has a mission indeed.

Thus it was in the days of Constantine that Christianity was the religion of the State. Constantine himself stated it as his deliberate opinion that the "bond of union" of the members formed by all nations respecting the Deity to a condition, as it were, of one creed.

But let Mr. Wannamaker take courage, for if politics is religion, he has had a religion which he may yet be able to exercise.

# "The Constitution and Religion."

Bitter attacks and counter attacks have lately been made on our national Constitution. Perhaps the most striking case of this was a sermon by the Rev. S. E. Gilbert, of the Western Church, which is a fashionable church of this city. Rev. Mr. Gilbert was the chairman, who looked upon the missions from which now proceed the principal advocates of those who held to the most liberal interpretation of the one those others who exist in the hearts of the members of the National Reform. He was pastor of this "church," in this so-called "Christian Nation," and against the declaration of the highest court of the land that this is a "Christian Nation."

Called by this there appeared in the *Chicago Tribune* of Sunday evening's issue—"The Constitution and Religion"—from an entirely different standpoint, but true to life, representing the majority of Protestant Christians in their thinking and feeling. As it truthfully says:—

> There is no danger of any church, Roman Catholic or member of Protestant, gaining direct control of this country. The Constitution is safe; and the clerical thumb that the several individual gods that the Constitution is built of them.

> These are the real dangers. The danger is that the United States will mingle with all sorts of religious legislation, "Protestant and Catholic alike," and subsequently other present knowledge of ecclesiastical party contentions than the does of the Constitution of the United States and recent federal court decisions. The Constitution does speak of religion by law, and law and more say:

His optimistic view is based, in the light of recent decisions, in what he concludes to be the distancing problems as seen from the settling of religious controversies. Judge Hammond, of the United States District Court, for western Tennessee, recently declared, in passing sentence on several of the citizens of Tennessee, that "the founders of Government (of the) State (do not) have absolute power on the subject of religion), and any of them might (if they choose) establish a creed and a church and maintain it."

Again, the United States Supreme Court recently decided that "this is a Christian Nation." The Supreme Court is above the Constitution since the Constitution was adopted, and having been decided that this is a Christian Nation, who are the Christians? Protestants claim that they exclusively are the Christians, and the Catholics just as vehemently make this claim for themselves. Just so sure as Constantine was compiled in the fourth century, after adopting Christian as the religion of the empire, to decide which of the contending factions was the "legitimate and most holy Catholic Church," so now the most logical and inevitable step for the nation is to settle what is to be called Christian. Having done this, all who dissent will become dissenters. A dissenter is a person who does not agree. Dissent is a religious controversy, and will thereby set the power to keep by the power which your correspondent, after presenting a most forbidding date of the facts, fall back upon for safety.

Already Congress is beginning to act upon this Supreme Court decision. Congressmen with this decision in their hands argued in the floor of Congress that since this Nation had been decided by its supreme Court to be a Christian Nation, it was the duty of Congress to protect the World's Fair on Sunday. Congress accordingly voted $5,000,000 to the management of the United States on one side of a religious controversy, and to hit on which is the "Christian Sabbath," but also as to the proper way of observing it. The trouble has only just begun, and the legislative and judicial branches of the Government tergiversations given it, to keep the peace.
