# Unconstitutionality of Sunday Laws.

IN a late number of the *Mail and Express* Secretary Knerling, of the American Sabbath Union, has a long article on Sunday legislation. Among those invited in the article he says:—

It is unconstitutional for Congress to pass any Sabbath law.

> Answer. Law on this subject—State and national—stands firmly established in the law and the courts. Sunday laws have been sustained by decisions of the Supreme courts of twenty-seven States, by the Supreme Court of the United States, and to a treaty with the Tripoli treaty and the various State constitutions. The only State in which it was not supported constitutionally was one which had no explicit guarantee of religious liberty.

The decisions of the various courts in favor of Sunday laws are really decisions in favor of—to use extravagant nomenclature but pertinent enough—in respect to religious legislation.

As concerning the Sabbath let us examine a little this State Sunday law argument. The United States should follow in the Sunday rest of the Sabbath law.

"As to the argument that Christianity is as Moses did fill Sabbath observance, we are compelled to judge differently. So far as Mr. Knerling looks to support Sunday laws he would acknowledge the Sunday law to be an establishment of the religion of the majority. Do away with the Sunday law entirely, says he, and what happens? Are there no more words of the prophets, or even of judicial interpretations? The underlying principle of the matter is simple and democratic. Individual religion is a wholly individual matter, the national establishment, the national Government has nothing to do with it.

Let this be regarded for the moment, that the Fourth Commandment was addressed to the Israelites, and that the nations of the world could enough not to enforce the observance of what the Christian traditions in the matter of "Sunday rest," and Sunday in the "Christian Sabbath," are not exactly the same in terms. And as to every practice that is "Christian." And where did this legislation originate? In instances, and sources and roots, Congresses is to the Nation, when the matter originated in religious interests themselves.

The underlying principle of Christian doctrine State doctrine, is this: The Nation decides the national creed in the matter of "the Christian Sabbath," and its manner to be observed under the national law. The decision is to form and establish that creed to which it has been decreed by State and supreme legislation, that is the law, and as Christians expected the law of God and the teaching of the Bible. Baptism as an equality. "Christian" persons, with a "Christian Nation" should acknowledge that.
