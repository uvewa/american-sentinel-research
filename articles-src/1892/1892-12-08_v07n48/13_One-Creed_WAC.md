# One Creed.

SAYS the *Union Signal* of November 10:

> The great congress of all religions to be held at the World's Columbian Exposition at Chicago, which is sure to rehite the light of knowledge, the broadness of the brotherhood of man.

And further remarks that:

> Whatever contributes to a single moment to such a broad, fraternal exchange has tried, and does still try in many parts of the world, separate the groups in political or church life into hostile and murderous camps, has a mission indeed.

Thus it was in the days of Constantine that Christianity was the religion of the State. Constantine himself stated it as his deliberate opinion that the "bond of union" of the members formed by all nations respecting the Deity to a condition, as it were, of one creed.

W. A. C.
