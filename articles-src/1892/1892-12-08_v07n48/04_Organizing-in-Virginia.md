# Organizing in Virginia.

REV. MR. GEORGE, of the American Sabbath Union, has been visiting Winchester, Va., recently in the interests of the American Sabbath Union. Mr. George told the story of his failure to entime the town.

The meeting was held in the Presbyterian church in Winchester, Thursday, November 3, 1892. On the same evening the Louisa College Christian Association met at the Court Room Hall. Mr. George in his remarks he had met, a number of towns in which it would have been useless to call his meeting if it had only been held in a church. It is easy to see which was appreciated most of the two, the old-time class mass-meeting.

"The population of Winchester is between six and eight thousand. I am sure there are not more than one hundred and twenty-five present."

The resolution may be: "We, the citizens of Winchester, Va., assembled, have over one hundred and twenty-five citizens who attend divine worship, and eight thousand, and not more than one-fourth of them are here tonight."

Mr. George, Secretary of the American Sabbath Union, had been to Richmond, Va., and affected a city organization of the American Sabbath Union. His object was to affect a State organization. In this he was unsuccessful, but thinks they may still have a State organization.

In his address here Mr. George said that "God dealt with Israel and punished them as a Nation." He insisted that "American people are called to rally and preserve the holy Sabbath." "There is no one hand the divine against, or the other the evil." He also said of the World's Fair gates not being opened on Sunday that more men would be required to work on the other six days and that this would be a mighty filip to the Exposition. "We do believe," he said, "this question is settled in Congress, and will be."

The resolutions adopted were as follows:

Inasmuch as the ancient deciples clearly teach it is essential to preserve the glory of our American institutions to preserve the glory of our American Sabbath institutions and protect the moral and religious interests of the State, the association earnestly reaffirms its moral convictions and calls upon all lovers and advocates the best interests of morals and religion and civil government in Virginia, to preserve and maintain its claims.

At that we are especially pleased to hear that the work of organizations and local associations throughout Virginia to make an impact on the public and the World's Columbian Exposition at Chicago on the 13th day of June, 1892.

It is our privilege to be present at this meeting, and now I can better realize the views of these people and the work they are and have been doing for the people in accomplishing their aims through local organizations.
