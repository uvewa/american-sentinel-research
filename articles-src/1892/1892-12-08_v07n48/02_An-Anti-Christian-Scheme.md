# An Anti-Christian Scheme.

THE Rev. Dr. Charles H. Parkhurst has started what he calls "a canvass of the Sun, of this city," "are going to commence an inquiry into the moral condition and character of every house within the municipal limits, together with the names and social status of the occupants."

This enterprise is to be preceded under the auspices of the city Vigilance League, a branch of the Society for the Prevention of Crime. Dr. Parkhurst is President of this Society. The meeting was held in Judson Memorial Hall in South Washington Square, on Friday evening, November 25, that Dr. Parkhurst on this occasion would speak "after the names and social status of the occupants."

On this occasion the Doctor is reported as follows:

> One immediate need is of 1,197 men of honest purpose and good parts, for there are 1,197 election districts respectively each of the election districts in this city, for one superintendent, and the responsibility of each one of these 1,197 men is to be responsible for the conduct of his district. One duty of the district supervisor will be to prepare a complete list of every building and every room in the district, stating accurately and definitely what they are expected to show. Every building will be listed as to its character, its particular frontages and its street number. There will be a tabulated list of the occupants of the residential portions of the district, with their nationalities and nativity. The tabulation will include a statement as to all matters of ill repute; pool rooms and so on; policy shops, and gambling houses in the district.

"In this connection," added Dr. Parkhurst, "I want the general idea to be inculcated that no district supervisor should be expected to do anything that can be occasionally accomplished by a specially detailed detective."

It was probably the memory of his own experiences, a few months ago, which led the Doctor to give this caution. It shows that Dr. Parkhurst is not totally oblivious that his beer-drinking with lewd women at a mission that was five or seven in judging rather than to personal moral corruption. But having made such an error he is a safe guide for the 1,197 young men that he has plans of yet placing in control of this country. The Constitution is amended to understand. Can anything be further from following Christ and obey the divine injunction, "Enter not into the path of evil men. Avoid it, pass not by it, turn from it, and pass away." In short, is not the whole scheme exactly contrary to the spirit of the gospel of Christ, which exhorts us thus:—

> Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.

The Christian might well distrust this scheme, and preserve the morals of the town by the carry out his detective operations on a large scale, and his scheme does not provide for it.

His scheme is to appoint young men, one as superintendent of the each election district in New York City, to find out all about the citizens at spying about their neighborhoods to find out who does wrong. The superintendents will have to go up the wickedness themselves. They will hardly be protected against the evils attending the performance of this duty. They must expose them to gain situation as described above.

Any town will report this new and easy task and new industry in another matter. Under Dark conditions the names, residences, nationality, and politics of all the inhabitants will be set up in the record. As a matter of course, the examining eye will be turned in a given direction, keeping an eye on all the doings of the citizens as reported through the spy system. And the national and political conditions will be noted as the ominous and scrutinize every house and room in district.

No doubt Dr. Parkhurst imagines that he is doing God and his fellow-men a service, but he is in reality corrupting more than a thousand young men and is perpetuating an engine of espionage which in due time can and will be used, in many cases is now used, not only against vice but for the suppression of the liberty so long and so fully enjoyed by the American people.
