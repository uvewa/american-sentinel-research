# Persecution of Methodists.

TWICE we published, the fact concerning the persecution of Methodists in Austria, and called attention to the fact that whilst Romanists are persecuting Methodists in Austria, Methodists are persecuting Adventists in Maryland and Tennessee. But while this is so, and is not true as stated by some that Christians are persecuting Christians—it is "professed" persecuting "professed." This is plainly shown in the following admirable article from *Person,* of Vienna:—

Everybody who reads the account of what is going on among the Methodists in Vienna must feel sympathy for the sufferers who are enduring such cruelly unjustifiable proceedings. Such a cause can not be extenuated on any just grounds. We would have it understood by all who may feel sufficiently to Christianity, and who may cite such instances of persecution as evidence against it, that there is no Christianity in it. Men who professed to be Christians have often persecuted other men. But persecuting any person for Christianity is from Christ, the Lamb of God, who taketh away the sin of the world. Christianity to persecute for any cause whatsoever is as revolt for as far as a light a favor a welt. In so saying, we are passing no sentence upon men who at any time past have engaged in persecution. God alone knows the motives that governed them. Many of the men were doubtless sincere. But if they thought that they were acting in accordance with the principles of Christianity, they were simply ignorant of those principles. We can simply say that persecution is not of Christ, but of the Devil. When those who persecuted, we must say, nothing to do; they are in the hands of that just Judge, whose we are.

It may further be said, that the evil of persecution is not confined to religion. The fact that those who are persecuted may sometimes be in error, does not justify persecution. No man was ever persecuted who did not thought by his persecutors to be in error. To say that it is wrong to persecute a man who is right, but that it is justifiable when people are in error, is to justify persecution in every case for that appears to be in error is in every case what is truth. That is popery. And so every sect that has obtained the ascendancy in Congress, to that degree is a pope. It will be seen by that popery has not always been a distinguishing characteristic of the Catholic Church. We repeat, that it is un-Christian to persecute for any cause. The religious opinions and practices of all persons of men may be; they are not to be interfered with by government for their religious opinions and practices. A man should enjoy the fullest liberty before any tribunal, whether religious or secular, civil or ecclesiastical, for interfering with people for their religion. In this matter the Christian and political questions are united. The civil government has nothing to do with the rights of the majority to rule, for the matters of the individual in religion to the right of the majority to rule, for in matters of religious belief, each individual must decide for himself.

When absolute authority does not assert it is not wanting. Jesus said, "If any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not; for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world." John 12:47. "The servant is not greater than his lord." John 15:20. "Therefore Christ did not persecute. Therefore Christ said to any man who refused to believe his true, not according to his judgement and teachings, to any man who refused to believe him, not, any man, that liberty was his; not in this earth, a liberty was himself above the earth, but for the liberty which was all. "As my Father hath sent me, even so send I you." John 20:21. And what purpose did the Father send him? "For God sent not his Son into the world to judge the world; but that the world through him should be saved." "As my Father hath sent me, even so send I you." These are the great motives and instruction that should govern the attitude of Christians in this matter of persecuting crimes against person or property. So long as a person is guilty of no crime, he should be unmolested.

When Peter, in his zeal for the Master, drew a sword to defend him against those who were about to seize the Lord, Jesus said: "Put up thy sword into his place." Matt. 26:52. And does he who truly follows, and try not coercion to Christianity, and why not coercion such if it is right for the sword to be used for the purpose of bringing a person to Jesus Christ? As readily as that wielded the sword; but the Master rebuked him and said, "Put up thy sword." And indeed the thought of it is absurd. The weapons which Christianity is to use in its warfare are distinctly stated. They are "not carnal," not physical, not civil, but spiritual. It is never to be used on them. We are reminded of the fact that at a recent mass meeting held in this city by a group of citizens, where the Methodist clergymen, among others, were reminded one of the boycott laid upon all who did not join with them in Sunday resting, yet no one was able to show that it is inconsistent to say that the boycott is one of the meanest forms of persecution. Now we do not say that our justifies the persecution of Methodists in Vienna or anywhere else, for no one should
