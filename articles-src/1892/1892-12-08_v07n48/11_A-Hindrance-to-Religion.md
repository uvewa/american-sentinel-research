# A Hindrance to Religion.

THE Christian says: "It is surely a favorable symptom that a brief of colonial dismantled and equal to the the world of different religions has been opened at Lisbon. What good influence may come from this congress to which Sunday is devoted to such a debating ground?"

Indeed it is not a favorable symptom. There is nothing good about it. But what about the question that is asked,— What good influence can be expected for religion event when the Sunday is devoted to such debating, special interest? The answer must be, *None.* The national religion can do no good for various reasons: because national religion is not true religion. It is favorable to such things, and another can do any good. Individual religion the world would be good to think about, if the religion were of the right kind, and if there were enough sincerely engaged in the sort it could be said that the world can need it. But national religion means religion by law, and law and more say:

National religion fosters such things, because national religion is necessary at the assurance of individual religion of the individual to the law of God. Under national religion, people naturally come to think that all that is necessary is conformity to law of the land demanded, which is merely outward nothing but form, and conformity and so they do not realize the necessity of a change of heart. But when the heart is unchanged, the evil that is in it, will make itself felt.

But leaving the question of national religion aside, think of the objections to the one proposed at Lisbon. The congress shows a growing fraternity of the ages. The idea is growing among the churches that a union of the different religions of the world must be done by the secular power; that Christianity must be one of the most evangelist itself. The State is required to prohibit Sunday amusement in order that the religion may make more effectively. Popery the popery to the complaint that they could do nothing because the Roman Government for so many amusements to keep the people from church work. Now they want ahead and preached the gospel, and its power turned the people away from the vanities. A gospel that can not do that to-day and has not done that power as it had to be preached. It was only when men lost confidence in the power of the gospel that they sought the aid of the civil power, and civil power took the weight and force of the civil power.

The interference of government is not the hindrance to the progress of religion presented, the early reformers, as well as the resistance to India and China, have demonstrated. That through this the true gospel has the progress of true religion is the hands of it at the hearts of those who profess it and whose duty it is to proclaim it.—*Powell, Tenn. Landmark.*
