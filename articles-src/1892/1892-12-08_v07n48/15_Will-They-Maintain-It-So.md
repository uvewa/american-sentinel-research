# Will They Maintain It So?

An exchange has the following commentary on the position of the Secretary of the American Sabbath Union, which has reference to an article that was made reference some time ago. It is now a matter of lively interest, since the organization of active opposition to the Sunday opening of the World's Fair, whether or not Mr. George and the Sabbath Union will maintain the extreme position that has been established.

"In a speech at Paterson, N. J., recently, Mr. Beach of the General Secretary of the American Sabbath Union, stated that in the Sunday closing of the World's Fair, and that of the other business on that the advocacy of Sunday opening has any standing, and the Sabbath Union would espouse such blockholding sentiments."

Mr. George is armed not so much with the views of his opposition, as with those of the forward and himself. It ought to be to our interest to call attention to the fact that this Sunday question, anywhere and everywhere this Sunday question the facts of any era or conventions of any day or time, all the questions of religious liberty and the whole scope of principle on which they stand, is also a favor and recognition of all the rights and the full recognition of all the rights of religious liberty and the principles of the government supposed to exist equally for all? Is it not rather the part of Christian duty the right to make and enforce religious the observance as law? Shall Church and State be united here? That is the proposition, and the people would not long remain in doubt as to the result. It is scarcely a question. But Mr. George and his followers could be compelled, with the support of the government, to lay it is not up to Congress to be requested, and, with the support of his friends, to urge that Sunday closing is an unimportant matter. It is one to be settled by the very principles of religious and give earnest text. There is danger in this direction that our liberty is in peril.
