# The Churches and Civil Power.

THAT the "evangelical" churches of the United States have taken possession of the governmental authority of the United States, is plain to every one who will candidly consider the subject. That they purpose to keep the power and use it, they have plainly and repeatedly declared.

We are inquiring what effect this course will have upon the churches, and through them upon the State? So far, we have found that the effect upon the churches has been, stating it briefly, to commit them to open apostasy from the Lord and from his gospel; to make them the chiefest leaders in the Nation, and to form them into the grandest system of trickery that this Nation ever saw, in its politics, history or business, and not trickery is surmounted. And all this, that they may be confirmed in their effort to make law of the Most High.

The churches profess that the course which they have taken is essential to the preservation of the State, and in this salvation of the Nation. What effect, then, can such a course have, and only have upon the Nation? We have already seen it has to help her bear an oversight of worldliness and worldly influences, that she grasped the arm of the State and forced this illicit connection with worldly power. We then pointed out the utter inanity of seeking deliverance from an evil, by a positive alliance with the chiefest source of that evil; and how the only effect this could have upon the churches would be infinitely to increase the burden which they already found themselves unable to bear alone. How can that save the Nation?

The Church of Christ is the divinely appointed means through which God would call the nations to seek the Lord that they might find him and be delivered from this present evil world; what, then, when these professed churches of Christ themselves seek to the power of this present evil world, into themselves to it, and put their dependence upon it? How can that save the Nation?

The Church of Christ is the divinely appointed agency to "persuade men" to be Christians, to recommend the Lord, and his dominion to the lord; what, then, when these professed churches of Christ threaten congressmen in order that they themselves may succeed in joining themselves to the Government? How can that preserve the State or save the Nation?

The Church of Christ is the divinely appointed agency to persuade men to send up their petitions to the Lord for help, and for deliverance from every burden, and from every form of evil; what, then, when these professed churches of Christ themselves send up their petitions for men, even through the men be congressmen, and though the petitions be backed up with threats? How can that save the Nation?

Both society and the State are already cursed with the insatiable demand for office, or position, of trust, to enter upon political service revoked; what, then, when the professed churches of Christ make this the very chosen channel through which they would make successful their aims upon the State? What effect, then, can this have upon society and the State, other than to increase this curse even to ruinous depths?

BRIBERY is already become so common as nearly to frustrate the will of the people; what, then, when these churches take the lead "bribing with a monopoly of power" both buying and selling? all whom they can seduce to compliance with their arbitrary will, regardless of the will of the people whose expressed in the supreme law in the direct voice of the people? What can be the effect of this upon the State, other than to increase in untold ratio the already too general corruption.

By the enactment of wholesome laws, the people have been doing their best to prevent and put down the boycott; the tyrannical spirit of the boycott. But how can the people protect themselves from its despotism, when the churches control the law-making power for the general government, and make the boycott in all business relations their chosen means by which to force submission to their will in the local community. What, then, can be the effect of this, other than so to cultivate the spirit of spying and treachery as to destroy mutual confidence and individual integrity; set every man's hand against his neighbor; and fill the land with dread lawlessness.

LAWLESSNESS is already so prevalent as almost to threaten the existence of a republican form of government; what, then, when the professed churches of Christ can lead themselves in the lead in this, by disregarding the supreme law overriding the Constitution, and taking the governmental authority out of the hands of the people and into their own lawless hands? In this they have accomplished their long-announced "object;" the attainment of that "desire" of their "national law" which declares that "governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed." But how can this preserve the State? How can this save the Nation? What effect indeed can it possibly have other than to produce here that condition of lawlessness and confusion, yet of ecclesiastical despotism, which is always produced by attempts of the Church to rule?

Not only is this evident from what has already been said, but this same thing has been demonstrated in fact, among the instruction of all people and nations; showing clearly enough just what its nature must be. In the original apostasy, the Church included in joining herself to the State, promising life thus to save the State. That same line was employed, Constitution and the bishops, in establishing the "Christian" religion and making a "Christian State" were the same as was employed, and were rich in exact proportion. Yet the hypocrisy was enough in itself, yet the hypocrisy was made simply enough to be universal. In the enforcement of the Sunday laws the Church then, as now, compelled all who were not church members to come all who were not church members to attend as though a hypocrite, hypocrisy was made compulsory; and everybody who was not voluntarily a Christian, and yet a forced one, was a hypocrite; and he and a hypocrite, was compelled either to be a hypocrite, unjust or averse. And as in addition to this, all were required to change into favor chief offices held by the majority in the countries changed to dishonesty; all moral standards were lost, decency and integrity were abandoned; habitual, dissimulation and fraud became a second nature of all people; and the ruin of men and society was visited.

This pagan superstition, the pagans destroyed, said the pages then, which had been brought into the Church by the apostasy, and clothed with a form of godliness, had wrought such ruin that old pagan superstition itself could sustain it no longer exist. From it no more good could be derived. It was only "a dead weight to carry away." The uncontrollable progress of luxury, selfishness, extravagance, heartlessness, intemperance, lewdness, and all the elements of human depravity, which Christianity had come to emulate, still with its Roman form and its Roman name, gave it at last into the hands of the rude, savage but hardy barbarians of the north. "Nothing but the divine judgment could reach a people so morally Christian, but essentially heathen, world, and open the way for the moral renovation of society. There must be new fresh nations." Centuries thus passed away in the dissolution of one empire and the formation of another, as represented in the old Roman Empire, to make the ruin and recovery on their part.

And over toward those barbarians came, early enough in a military era, a few hundred years the dark cloud had been hanging over the eastern frontiers of the empire, encroaching slightly upon the border but being held in check. Down at last at the close of the fourth century the barriers burst in all its fury and the flood was flowing resistlessly. And finally, A.D. 476, Odoacer, king of the Heruli, became king of Italy, the last vestige of the Western Empire of Rome was gone, and was divided among the barbarous nations of the Northern tribes.

Wherever these savages went, they conquered, by fire and slaughter, and whenever they departed, they left desolation and ruin in their track, and carried away multitudes of captive. Thus was the proud empire of Western Rome swept from the earth; and that which Constitution and law could not do, that which patriotism and every other should be the everlasting salvation of this Nation.

In that case the Lord sent the destruction of the North the destruction of his judgment in sweeping away the mass of corruption of which the professed Church and State had built up there. But in this case the Lord has made no such arrangement. There are no fierce and no threatening forces. Civilization has so far covered all the earth. Not only that, all in this case as all thus our civilization in the corruption. Where then the Lord has directly put his hand to the corruption. Where the professed churches then joined in the judgment and sweep away this mass of corruption, that grand sweeping desolation can not be found upon this earth. A perusal of a few passages will show the Lord's description of its results.

"Therefore ye shepherds hear the word of the Lord. As I live, saith the Lord God, surely because my flock became a meat to every beast of the field...." Eze. 34:7-10.

> "Blow ye the trumpet in Zion, and sound an alarm in my holy mountain; let all the inhabitants of the land tremble: for the day of the Lord cometh, for it is nigh at hand; a day of darkness and of gloominess, a day of clouds and of thick dark darkness." Joel 2:1, 2.

"For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God; and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God?" 1 Peter 4:17. "Therefore shall her plagues come in one day, death and mourning and famine; and she shall be utterly burned with fire; for strong is the Lord God who judgeth her." Rev. 18:8.

"I will also gather all nations, and will bring them down into the valley of Jehoshaphat." Joel 3:2.

> "Put ye in the sickle for the harvest is ripe; come, get you down, for the press is full, the fats overflow; for their wickedness is great. Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision; for the day of the Lord is near in the valley of decision." Joel 3:13, 14.

"The great day of the Lord is near, it is near, and hasteth greatly." "That day is a day of wrath, a day of trouble and distress, a day of wasteness and desolation, a day of darkness and gloominess, a day of clouds and thick darkness, a day of the trumpet and alarm against the fenced cities, and against the high towers." Zeph. 1:14-16.

> "And I will bring distress upon men, that they shall walk like blind men, because they have sinned against the Lord: and their blood shall be poured out as dust, and their flesh as the dung." Zeph. 1:17.

"And the slain of the Lord shall be at that day from one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth: they shall not be lamented, neither gathered, nor buried; they shall be dung upon the ground." Jer. 25:33.

"And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat upon him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he doth judge and make war. His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself. And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood: and his name is called The Word of God. And the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean. And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God." Rev. 19:11-15.

"He shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other." Matt. 24:31. "And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire: and them that had gotten the victory over the beast ... stand on the sea of glass, having the harps of God. And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great and marvelous are thy works, Lord God Almighty; just and true are thy ways thou King of saints." Rev. 15:2, 3.
