ONE of the most misleading claims set up by the National Reformers is that Israel was in reality a republic, and that therefore a theocracy is not inconsistent with popular government. The fallacy of this claim is fully shown in the tract, "THE REPUBLIC OF ISRAEL," 8 pages; price, one cent; fifty cents per hundred.
