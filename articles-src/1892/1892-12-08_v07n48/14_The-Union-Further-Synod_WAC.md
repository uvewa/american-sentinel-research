# The Union Further Synod.

In this we have a sufficient rule of faith and practice. Christianity is not a legal system. If he did not stop at every opening in the world's commerce for an opportunity of proselytizing, he did seize every available opportunity. For all accept the truth that religion is an affair of the heart and not of the civil law.

But after this great religious congress at the World's Fair is over, Catholics and Protestants, in this country will still stop fighting amongst themselves and begin the real "contentions" and begin the contest that "contentions" and strife between the two will in all probability be all the more emphasized, for by the hands of one single decision of the Supreme Court of the United States, the Supreme Court of the United States has now been declared a "Christian Nation," religions has been compelled and the nation to take sides in the controversy, and the question ending to be set of the rest. Which body of profession can really occupy the seat? This seal will not be easily vacated, we say not easily removed; for there are already too many aspirants for it; and when the question is once settled as to which Christianity is the "national church," by court decision, legislative enactment, or otherwise (the "otherwise" is our own "version") will commence in good earnest, differences will be magnified, and strife and bickering become mountains.

Thus, instead of the suaved and long desired unity and tranquility in religious matters, an attempt has been reached with, and passed it, "old controversies which have apparently been hushed for a long time will be revived, and new ones not yet thought of, new and old will come upon us with freshened vigor."

W. A. C.
