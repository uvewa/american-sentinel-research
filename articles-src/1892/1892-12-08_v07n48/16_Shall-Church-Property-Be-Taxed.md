# Shall Church Property Be Taxed?

"SHALL Church Property Be Taxed?" is a live question, and one fully answered in a pamphlet bearing this title issued by the "Sentinel." The author of the pamphlet is Mr. Henry M. Stanley, of Brooklyn, and has shown himself to be a thorough master of the subject. Forty cents; one dollar per hundred.
