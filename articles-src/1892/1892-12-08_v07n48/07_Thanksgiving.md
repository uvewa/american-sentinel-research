# Thanksgiving.

One of the leading papers of this city has this to say about Thanksgiving:

No one came to day for the communal Thanks-giving, that is, as it is too commonly observed, but the day was given up in houses of worship, for its rigid customs and observance.

The essential spirit of Thanksgiving is too apt to be lost in formal observance. The form has come to be far more to most of the day than the fact that it is the Thanksgiving of a heart giving to God its thanks for the blessings and mercies of the year. The holiday side of it has been growing and smoothing change, that the local has become of much more public interest than the spiritual significance of the occasion. As a religious expression it is no longer exists, but as a holiday it is a great success.

It is a day for memor, for meetings after long separation, for the renewal of family ties. It is a day for sports and games and children's parties. It is not a fast, but a feast. It is purely for devoted devotions.

In fact Thanksgiving Day stands and more and more stands for home and happiness, for gratitude and good cheer, for family reunion and social intercourse, and solemn commercial has become a feast and for social commerce and social enjoyment.

Everybody knows that this is true, and being true it is high time that it was in the category of setting apart a day, professedly for the worship of God, which is in reality being devoted to gluttony should end. It is grossly corrupting to character, that so many do and the things Almighty hates strongly end.
