# The Gloomiest View Yet.

THE *Washington Post* thinks Mr. Wannamaker should explain something that he has said at one of his recently established Sunday-schools. He told a meeting of the Philadelphia Sunday-school, on the 13th inst. Post says:—

"The strife between God's people and his enemies has never been so marked and keen as it is between the people and his enemies to-day. On the one side are the righteous, on the other the unrighteous; on the one side those who hold the Lord and his Word in reverence, on the other those who do not. Every man stands either with or against God."

The Post, however, names Mr. Wannamaker's Sunday-school remark as "one of the gloomiest views of the situation," the thought of which is "at variance with the general impression of an ever improving world," and says that Mr. Crafts, "the foremost Sunday agitator, has suggested that religion had gone to seed in this country."

The Post, however, answers his Philadelphia Sunday-school speech with this: "The dispute is purely the strife between God's people and his enemies is somewhat exaggerated and the wickedness on the other. We know, of course, which side Mr. Wannamaker considers himself to be on and which side, if pressed, he would have us to guess as regards the political party which failed to continue him in office."

That Mr. Wannamaker's side was evidently not the Lord's side at the last election was made quite plain by that election event; and the fact that the wicked triumphed on Tuesday of last week over the party which Mr. Wannamaker adorned was not such entirely persuasive of Wannamaker, that is for him to determine his enemies are also the enemies of the Lord.

Of course Mr. Wannamaker had no intention of lacking irreligious petition or imputing the religious to the other side, but in the political situation at that day, he probably wished something more for his Sunday-school, that would be quite consistent with the assertion. As to what he said, as to editor Shepard, "politics is religion," there is not much to dispute about it. Yet, as remarked by other leading authorities on the subject of politics in religion, as Mr. Cleveland's election is undoubtedly a triumph of politics over religion, we must say that not be used to advantage.
