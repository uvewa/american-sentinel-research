An extract from church history in the days of Constantine's rise, placed beside an item of political news of to-day, presents a scene strikingly similar.

Eusebius says of the bishops in Constantine's day, that it was their ambition "to assert the government as a kind of sovereignty for themselves." Nor was it alone government in the churches they were so anxious to wield, but government in the State, which they expected to use in the interest of the church when once obtained. For "there had in fact," he says, "arisen in the church . . . a false theoretical theory, originating not in the essence of the gospel, but in the confusion of the religious constitutions of the Old and New Testaments."—Neander.

These bishops, it will be seen, were anxiously laboring to obtain an influence in political circles, which thing they did, and which in itself proved the union of a fallen church with the State.

In the daily Cincinnati Post, of September 1, under the heading "Republicans Thoroughly Organizing in West Virginia," the following appears:—

In this (Cabel) and in Lincoln County they [Republicans] have fused with the People's Party, and the opposition confesses that there is no walk-over in November, as it stands now. Hon. John K. Thompson, one of the shrewdest politicians in the State, is in charge of the work, and it is in this region where most of the battle for supremacy will be fought. Rev. Charles Caldwell, the preacher-lawyer-politician, of Parkersburg, the Republican candidate for Congress, is a splendid stumper, and he is making a great canvass.

Certainly the tide of political religion is rising when "shrewd politicians" see that the popular sentiment is calling for professedly religious men as candidates. And why not? If congressmen, to become popular, must put on some religious garb, should we not expect religious profession be made an evidence of the fitness of candidates for office? "Shrewd politicians," and even ministers, have not been slow in catching this idea. Congressmen are longing to remain in politics, and the ministers are longing to get into politics, and both are striving to achieve their desires through religio-political measures which are nothing more nor less than a "union of Church and State." How smoothly, subtly, blended is the title given Mr. Caldwell, "Preacher-lawyer-politician"! Already it is a "condition and not a theory which confronts us," and this hyphenated title marks the condition even now attained. These things are not happening by chance, and who can not see in the two bits of history a "striking similarity"?

T. E. BOWEN.
