It is urged by certain writers in favor of Sunday legislation, that the Sunday laws have nothing to do with the day as a religious institution; that they deal with the "civil Sabbath" only, etc. While it is true that great diversity is shown in the various "decisions" by which the courts make more law than the statutes do, it is also true that much of this court-made law upholds Sunday on the most positively religious grounds, as the following will show. The Sunday laws of the United States grew out of the English laws. In 1834, an English judge rendered his decision in the following words:—

It seems to me that the object of the statute was to prevent persons keeping open shop and disregarding the decency of the Lord's day by the public show of their ordinary trades and occupations. Littledale J., in Blossoms vs. Williams, 5 D. & R., 82.

A similar decision was made in the State of New York, in 1811, in which Judge Kent said of the Sunday law:

The statute has, for over a century, recognized the sanctity of the obligation and punished its violators. Ruggis's case, 8 Johns 390. In 1834 a learned judge in the same State spoke of "the public order and solemnity of the day." Boynton vs. Page, 12 Wend., N. Y., 57.

Still later and stronger were the words of a judge in 1859, who declared that the Sunday law of New York "explicitly recognizes the first day of the week as holy time; and, thus, it has brought us back to the full, enlarged and absolute rule of interdiction, which we find prevailed in the earliest laws of Christian States, and which the construction of the statute of Charles II, has tended somewhat to narrow and impair." Campbell vs. International Soc., 4 Bos., N. Y., 298.

Another court, in 1882 recognized the religious characters of the laws as follows:—

Is it not obvious that, by reason of keeping a store open for business, a temptation is presented to those who have no regard for Sunday as holy time, to violate the law? Anonymous, 12 Abb. N. C. (N. Y.), 455.

Pennsylvania has always held to the religious character of her Sunday law, and has always refused to recognize the rights of those who keep the Sabbath to be free from its penalties; hence it is not surprising to read in the reports of Jeandelle's case (3 Phil. 509) the decision of a Pennsylvania judge that "the day [Sunday] is clothed with peculiar sanctity." In the case of Moore vs. Hagan, 2 Duv. 437 (1866), two statutes of Kentucky are contrasted, the decision stating that "one applied to Sunday as sacred, and the other to holidays as secular." The same idea is set forth in Iowa, Davis vs. Fish, Green 406, (1848), when it is stated that Sunday is "sacred, set apart for rest by the voice of wisdom, experience and necessity."

In a North Carolina decision the Sunday law is alluded to as follows: "All religious and moral codes permit works of necessity and charity on their sacred days." Rickets case, 74 N. C., 184, (1876). Stronger still is the statement of a decision in the State of Georgia, Gholston vs. Gholston, 31 Ga., 625, (1860), wherein it is said: "All courts should abstain from the transaction of ordinary business on this holy day," and again: "In every form, by all the different authorities in this State, by its organic laws, its civil and criminal code, and by every judicial decision upon the question,—the Sabbath is regarded as the Lord's day, and it is protected from violation by so many guards, that the courts should not be allowed to invade its sanctity, and in so doing make a record to be read by all men, in all time." Bass vs. Irwin, 49 Ga., 436. In the case of Weldon, (62 Ga., 449) Sunday as the Lord's day is declared to be a holy day.

One class of decisions recognizes the power of the State to consecrate Sunday, thus enunciating the doctrine of a union of religion and the State, and essentially of Church and State. Speaking on this point, Ringgold says:—

There are cases which hold that its sanctification was accomplished by statute. Thus, one reason given for "separating" the day as a "holy" one in Massachusetts is the fact that the legislative power has exacted the observance of it as such. Pearce vs. Atwood, 13 Mass., 324.

And Judge Kent assures us that, in New York, "the statute for preventing immorality consecrates the first day of the week as holy time." People vs. Ruggles, 8 Johns, 290, (1811). Judge Robertson of Kentucky, speaks of the law in his State as "the statute consecrating the Sabbath," (Moore vs. Hagan, 2 Duv., 437), and so in Georgia courts and magistrates are to regard Sunday as the Lord's day "as a matter of mere law, irrespective of religious obligation and duty." Weldon's case, 62 Ga., 449 (1879). (Sunday, Legal Aspects, etc., p. 34.)

If this power of the State be conceded, the full doctrine of the union of Church and State is established. If the State can "consecrate" a day, it can a place, or a person, a building, or an altar. If statute law can make one thing holy and require men thus to consider it, we have returned to the original pagan conception that religion is a department of the civil government, and any disregard of the State regulations concerning sacred things must be punished under the civil law as other crimes against person or property are. This is civil religion in extenso.

But we have also another class of decisions which declare that Sunday is sacred by divine authority. These conflicting views sometimes appear in decisions under the same statute, and in the same commonwealth. Instance: Judge Allen, of New York, holds that the province of the statute is to recognize and enforce regard for a holiness which already exists. These are his words:—

It does not detract from the moral or legal sanction of the law of the State that it conforms to the law of God, as that law is recognized by the great majority of the people. Linden Muller's case, 33 Barb., 548 (1881).

The same ground is taken in a case under the statute of Pennsylvania. Eyre's case, S. & R. 347, (1815), in which it is said: "Sabbath-breaking is the violation of a divine as well as a human law." In a still later case in Pennsylvania we find the following: "The learned council for the plaintiff has entered largely into the question of the origin and sanction of the Christian Sabbath. It may not be essential, but it is far from being irrelevant, to the decision of the present case, to sustain the divine authority of its institution," the day has been "set apart by divine command and human legislation as a day of rest," and "we have no right to give up this institution. It has come down to us with the most solemn sanctions both of man and God, and if we do not appreciate it as we ought, we are at least bound to preserve it." Johnston's case, 22 Pa., 102 (1853).

The foregoing statements concerning the divine origin and authority of Sunday observance are incorrect whether considered in the light of the Bible or of history; nevertheless they constitute a part of the Sunday law of Pennsylvania as created by judicial decisions. Arkansas strikes the same strain, and informs her citizens who play cards on Sunday that the day "is set apart by divine appointment, as well as by the law of the land, for other and better engagements." Stockden's case, 18 Ark., 186 (1856).

Iowa is not far behind Arkansas, for in the case of Davis vs. Fish 1 Green, 406, (1848), her court declares that Sunday observance has been "established by laws both human and divine, for public worship and private devotion—a time honored and heaven-appointed institution." Maryland is not less distinct in her testimony; her courts declare that "the Sabbath is emphatically the day of rest, and the day of rest here is the Lord's day or Christian Sunday. Ours is a Christian community, and the day set apart as a day of rest is the day consecrated by the resurrection of our Saviour, and embraces the twenty-four hours next ensuing the midnight of Saturday." Kilgour vs. Mills, 6 O. & J. 268 (1844).

Georgia has taken the most ultra ground in the following words:—

The law fixes the day recognized as the Sabbath day all over Christendom, and that day by divine injunction is to be kept holy, on it thou shalt do no work. The Christian Sabbath is a civil institution older than our Government, and respected as a day of rest by our Constitution, and the regulation of its observance as a civil institution has always been considered to be, and is, within the power of the Legislature, as much as any regulations and laws having for their object the preservation of good morals, and the peace and good order of society. Karwisch's case, 44 Ga., 204 (1871).

In another decision under the statutes of Georgia it is declared still more at length that—

Independently of the moral obligation, resting upon all men, to obey the law of the Lord, and to observe by abstaining from all secular business on the day set apart for his worship, throughout Christendom, the rest of one day in seven from all physical and mental labor is a great conservative, refreshing, invigorating means, designed by Almighty wisdom for the preservation of health and the re-creation of our mental and bodily faculties. But neither the law of God nor the law of man forbids us to do good on the Sabbath day. The Saviour rebuked the Pharisees who questioned his divinity, because he healed the impotent man on the Sabbath and bade him take up his bed and walk; and he who spake as never man spake said that the Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath, and that it was lawful to do good on the Sabbath day, and his own pure and perfect life illustrates his teaching by deeds of constant kindness and beneficence on the Sabbath day. When the statute of Georgia, therefore, excepts works of benevolence and charity from the operation of this penal statute, it but re-reacts the law of the Almighty as announced by the Saviour and beautified by his example. Salter vs. Smith, 55 Ga., 244 (1875).

In the presence of such decisions it is useless for men to assert that the laws do not deal with Sunday as a sacred day and on religious grounds. Men would not make such assertions were they not anxious to avoid the opposition and the odium which this age attaches to religious legislation. Let it not be forgotten that the decisions quoted above openly state what the friends of Sunday really seek, namely, that Sunday shall be upheld and guarded as a sacred day, a religious institution, by civil law. There are those who say this openly, and make the issue fairly and without equivocation. We do not believe in such legislation, but we respect those who do and have the honesty to say so; on the contrary, those who "juggle with words," declaring for the "civil Sabbath" only, forfeit their claims to straightforwardness and honest purposes. As is shown elsewhere, the late action of Congress concerning the Sunday closing of the Fair was based on the demands of religion, and the wish of religious people. If that action continues in force it will do much to fortify the doctrine that the Nation may interfere in religious matters whenever religious people urge their views in sufficient numbers and with sufficient vehemence. Let this policy be settled, and in spite of our national Constitution all forms of religious practice will be proper subjects for national law and congressional interference. The friends of Sunday closing of the Fair have unsheathed a double-edged sword, which may yet find the heart of religious liberty in the United States.—Sabbath Outlook.
