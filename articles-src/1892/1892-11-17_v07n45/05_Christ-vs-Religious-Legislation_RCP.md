The Church and the State were both ordained of God. The Church to teach the gospel and be the light of the world, while the State was commissioned to exercise authority in civil affairs. God is a God of order and not of confusion. He made no mistake when he called both of these organizations into being, and assigned to each its work. And he did not assign to both the same work. There was to be no occasion for coercion in accomplishing the work assigned to the Church and in her commission she was authorized to use none. She was to present Jesus as the world's Redeemer and the sinner's only hope and say, Come! The power through which her work was to be performed was in Christ and not in the civil government. The weapons of her warfare were not to be carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds.

The civil government was to use carnal weapons in the protection of those who acted civilly and in the administration of justice upon the uncivil. The judging of civil questions has been committed to the hands of men in this life and it is proper for them to sit in judgment upon such cases; but of religious matters it was said, "Judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts; and then shall every man have praise of God." Paul was here speaking of the treatment the Christian church was receiving at the hands of her persecutors on account of her faith in Christ. He further adds: "But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you or of man's judgment: . . . But he that judges the time is the Lord." Hence, judging in matters of religion before the Lord comes, who will judge the living and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom, is called by Paul judging before the time, and denounced as all out of place for the civil government, and very wrong.

Even Jesus told his disciples that if any one heard his words and believed not, he would not judge him, but that the word which he had spoken should judge him in the last day. Certainly the disciple is not greater than his Lord, and if the Master would not judge those who did not accept his teaching, his followers are not authorized to judge and to imprison their fellow-men because they do not accept their religious views.

We have many examples in the Scriptures where the civil government has legislated upon religion. But in the instances given, Jesus has ever identified himself with those who were condemned because they would not sacrifice their conscientious convictions in religious matters, in order to be in harmony with the State. With the three Hebrew worthies in the fiery furnace, there was seen the form of the fourth which was like the Son of God. He sent his angel and closed the lions' mouths when Daniel was condemned, and cast into their den on account of his faith. In like manner he manifested himself to Paul and Silas, and to Peter, when they were imprisoned for preaching Jesus. The angel also tells them that they should ignore the command of the State in this and go right on preaching the gospel in its simplicity, though they were few in number and the State was legislating against their religious beliefs. When Stephen was being stoned on account of his faith, and he cast his eyes about him to catch a glance from some sympathizing friend, he was greatly encouraged by seeing the heavens opened and beholding Jesus standing at the right hand of God. So now those who may see the power of the State arrayed against them because they follow the Master, keeping the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus, have the comforting assurance, "Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world." As the Saviour said to Saul when he was persecuting the church, "Why persecutest thou me?" so now he says to those who persecute his followers, "Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren ye have done it unto me."

True religion never seeks to enforce its observance upon others. It seeks only voluntary adherents. Enforced religion is always the result of apostasy. Let those who contemplate lending their influence in support of religious legislation, beware lest imply they be found to fight against God.
