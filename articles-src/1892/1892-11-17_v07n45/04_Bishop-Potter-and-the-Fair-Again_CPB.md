In the current number of the Century Magazine is an article from Bishop Potter, in which he enlarges somewhat upon the views set forth by him in the October Forum. As will be remembered, the Bishop favored only partial Sunday opening of the Fair—a silent Fair—open grounds and buildings, but motionless machinery and closed bazars.

But Bishop Potter has been severely criticised by the more ultra Sunday-closing element, and his article in the Century is doubtless for the purpose of explaining his former utterance. After a number of platitudes, the Bishop assures his readers that of the danger of any substantial surrender of the benefits of Sunday he is "profoundly impressed," and continues:

> If it is to be a question between the complete closing of the Exposition, and such surrender of it to secular uses on Sundays as to make no discrimination between Sundays and week-days, then, for one, I should be in favor of the most rigid closing of every door.

With the Bishop then, the question is not one of principle but of policy. He agrees that the Fair must be so manipulated as to exalt Sunday; the only question with him is, How can Sunday best be honored? He says:

> To most of us that day stands supremely as an institution of religion. But for what is religion, if it be not for the revelation and the inculcation of moral ideals? It may have, most surely it has, other uses, but this, no less surely, is pre-eminent among them. And so if, when Sunday came to the Exposition in Chicago, it could be assumed that in some great hall in the midst of it there would be some worthy and impressive presentation of these—if the Nation should summon its ablest and most eloquent teachers and bid them do for us the prophet's work amid such profoundly interesting and suggestive surroundings, it would hardly summon them in vain.

And this he would have the Nation do! Nor would the good Bishop stop here; he would have "on Sunday afternoons and evenings the multitudes assembled in Chicago from hamlet and village and prairie that rarely or never hear the great works of the great masters," "lifted on the mighty wings of grand and majestic harmonies;" and he enthusiastically adds, "Surely that, too, would be no unworthy use of a day consecrated to lofty visions and unuttered aspirations." "And finally," says the Bishop,—

if, in addition to all this, there could be, not alone in immediate connection with the Exposition itself, but in every sanctuary and pulpit of the great city, thronged and vibrant with a great and keen curiosity, some elect and chosen voices to speak for God and Duty and Patriotism and Self-sacrifice and the Eternal Verities, that, too, would be an undertaking worthy of the best energies of those who might give themselves to it, and worthy no less of the great religious ideals of a great people.

Thus Bishop Potter would not only have the Government still more fully committed, if that were possible, to the patronage of the Sunday as a religious institution, but he would have the Fair so used and manipulated as to destroy, in the minds of thousands of individual Christians, all their previous ideas of its proper observance. Sunday is not the Sabbath, but Congress has decided that it is, and Bishop Potter would have this action followed up by the Nation summoning its "ablest and most eloquent teachers" and bidding "them do for us the prophet's work"! That is, he would not only have the Nation adhere to its championship of Sunday as the Sabbath, but he would have it continue its assumption of control over its observance in such a manner as to still farther strengthen in the minds of the people the idea of governmental authority in religion and governmental patronage in the practice of its forms. Congress having assumed the guardianship of the consciences of the people so far as the Sabbath is concerned, by deciding that Sunday is the Sabbath, the Bishop would have it further debauch those consciences by giving them another standard of Sabbath observance than that laid down by the Author of the Sabbath. Not only would he assent to the action of Congress in construing the fourth commandment as meaning the first day and not the seventh, but he would also have that body set aside the inspired commentary upon the fourth commandment given in Isa. 58:13.

But such must ever be the result of governmental interference in religious things. Had the Fair been opened on Sunday by the action of the Directors, and had Congress kept its hands off from the question entirely, leaving the whole matter to the individual conscience, little harm would have come to anybody by an open Fair. Those who had conscientious convictions upon the subject would have remained away on Sunday; those who had no such convictions would have gone to the Fair, but they would have been no worse morally for so doing. But, by the scheme now proposed, Congress is to assume all responsibility not only of saying that Sunday is the Sabbath, but of defining proper Sabbath observance. Thus the innate wickedness of this thing becomes more apparent at each step in its development.
