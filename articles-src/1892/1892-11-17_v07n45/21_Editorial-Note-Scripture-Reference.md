A CRITICAL reader calls our attention to the fact that on page 330 of the current volume, in the last paragraph in the first column, a wrong scripture reference is given. The error was in the proof-reading; for in the copy the reference was properly given, Eze. 22:26. No one who felt interest enough in the matter to look up the text would be at a loss to find it; and the application was so apt that none could fail to see it. Those who substitute Sunday for the Sabbath have all Scriptures against them. The Sabbath "question" so-called is a "question" with only one side, so far as the Scriptures are concerned. Sunday as a holy day is absolutely unknown to Holy Writ.
