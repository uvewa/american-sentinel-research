**THE MAIL AND EXPRESS** speaks of the action of the Association organized in Chicago to secure the reversal of the Sunday closing provision attached to the World's Fair appropriation as "an aggressive movement by the Chicago Sabbath breaking organization," and prints the following "special" in regard to it:—

The organization formed here a few weeks ago to secure the opening of the Exposition on Sundays has been doing a good deal of quiet work and will, in a few days, begin an aggressive movement throughout the country.

This organization, composed as it is, not only of Chicago business men, but including in its membership several widely known preachers, realizes fully that the Christian sentiment of the country is against its purposes. Still thousands of Chicago citizens demand that the Fair shall be open on Sundays, regardless of the moral or civil law.

The curious anomaly is presented by a movement headed by preachers that is opposed by church-goers throughout the country. The latter class here find much gratification in the fact that Bishop Potter, of New York, is the only prominent clergyman of any orthodox church who is conspicuous in the Sunday opening movement.

In Chicago the newspapers have generally advocated Sunday opening. The Herald has led in this way the campaign of the Sunday breaking organization is practically under its management. The leaders in this movement fully realize that they must secure action by Congress before they can legally open the gates of Jackson Park on the Sabbath.

The vote of $2,500,000 last spring by Congress in aid of the Exposition carried the express condition that the Fair should be closed on Sundays. It is to secure the amendment of this act of Congress that the Chicago organization is now at work manufacturing public sentiment.

The plan of campaign is to make Congress believe when it meets next month that there is a popular feeling throughout the country in favor of Sunday opening. To secure this a young newspaper man of Chicago is now making a tour of the large cities of the country seeking to secure the co-operation of a leading journal in each city.

The newspaper approached will be asked to present a petition to Congress to rescind the Sunday closing act. Readers of these papers will be asked to sign the petition and the paper will support the movement editorially. It is expected that hundreds of thousands of names will be signed to the petitions which will be forwarded to the Washington office of the organization and presented to Congress with much ceremony on the same day.

The Chicago people are convinced that the petitions presented to Congress by the American Sabbath Union when the appropriation bill was pending was the influence that secured the passage of the Sunday closing measure. They think the same tactics will secure its repeal.

If this Association would work on the correct principles of governmental non-interference in religious matters the good done by it might be very great; but if it acknowledges the authority of Congress, legislature and courts, in such matters and only seeks for a paltry compromise, its action will only rivet the chains of religious law, and emphasize still further the theory of the authority of men over the religious views and observance of their neighbors.
