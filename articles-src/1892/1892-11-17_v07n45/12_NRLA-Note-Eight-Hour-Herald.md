The Eight-Hour Herald says in reference to workingmen and the Sunday closing of the World's Fair.

"There is no question but that there exists a deep-rooted and insurmountable opposition in the minds of the working classes of this country to the Sunday closing provision. Our experience teaches us that this is one question upon which workingmen can unite bodily, to all intents and purposes."
