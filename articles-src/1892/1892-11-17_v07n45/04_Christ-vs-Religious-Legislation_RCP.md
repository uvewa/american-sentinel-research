# Christ vs. Religious Legislation.

THE proper Sabbath observance. Thus the innate wickedness of this thing becomes more apparent at each step in its career.

Christ and the State were both ordained of God. The Church, to teach the principles of righteousness, while the State was commissioned to enforce order and not of confusion. He is God of order and not of confusion. He made no mistake when he called both of these organizations into being, and assigned to each its work. And he did not assign to both the same work. There is to be no compost for coercion in accomplishing the work assigned to the Church and in her constitution law was authorized to use none. She was to present Jesus as the world's Redeemer, and the sinner's only hope and say, Come! The power through which her work was to be performed was in Christ and not in the civil government. The weapons of her warfare were not carnal but were mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds.

The civil government was to use carnal force in the maintenance of order in accepted civil and in the administration of justice. And in the judging of civil questions has been committed to the hands of men in this life. It is not for men to sit in judgment upon each man's case of religious matters; it was said, a Judge other before him, shall "Judge nothing before the time," to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts; and then shall every man have praise of God." Paul was here speaking of the judgment day of the Lord and he was reasoning at the hands of his personal experience that of his sufferings. He further adds: "But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you or of man's judgment."

But in that regard, in the Lord. Hence, judging in matters of religion belongs to the Lord, come, who will judge the living and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom, to each as Paul judging before the time, and denounced as all out of order in the things of the Lord.

Even Jesus told his disciples that if any man heard his words and believed not, he would not judge him, that that the word which he had spoken should judge in the last day. Certainly the disciple is not above his Lord, nor the servant above his Master would not judge those who did not assent to his teachings in fellowship of the Master. Master would not judge those who did not assent to his teachings, followers are not authorized to judge and to imprison their fellow citizens because they do not accept their religious views.

We have many examples in the Scriptures where the civil government has legislated upon religious subjects, and in every instance, even in the most favorable instance, gems has been condemned because they would not sacrifice their constitutional conscience in religious matters, in obedience to the requirements of the State. With the three Hebrew worthies and the fourth which was like the Son of God. He met his angels and closed the lions' mouths when Daniel was condemned, and cast him then did so on account of his faith. In like manner he manifested his power in that also and to Peter, when they were imprisoned for preaching Jesus. The angel also told them that they should ignore the command of the State in this act and right, preaching the gospel, in its simplicity, though they were far in useless and the State was legislating against their religion or belief. When Phillip was called on the way the question of his faith, not to cast his heart about him to catch a glance of the temple of his kingdom, but was greatly encouraged by seeing the heavens opened and the SON OF MAN standing at the right hand of God. So now only one may use one of the means of his arrayal against them because they follow the Master, keeping the commandments, and confessing the Son of the living God and the faith of Jesus, have the confiding assurance, "Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world." As the Saviour said to Shah he was not persecuting the church, "Why persecutest thou me?" so now at the power who persecute his followers, "Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren ye have done it unto me."

A religious legislation, and its civil observance upon others. It seeks only to enforce its belief. The result of coercion is always the result of apostasy. Let those who trust in the God of righteousness and their civil duty, refuse all confidence in support of religious legislation, beware ye, have God to keep you to faith against God.
