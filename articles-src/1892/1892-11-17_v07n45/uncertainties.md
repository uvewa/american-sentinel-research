# Uncertainties — American Sentinel, November 17, 1892 (v07n45)

## General Note

This issue was transcribed from 300 DPI PNG scans. The scan quality varies across pages. Pages 5-8 in particular have areas where text is somewhat blurred or difficult to read at the edges of columns. The articles on pages 1-4 (articles 01-07) were transcribed by a previous agent.

## Articles 08-11 (New Transcriptions)

### Article 08: "Christian Partisan not Established" (page 5 right col, page 6 left col)

- **Page 5, right column, opening paragraphs**
  - **Obstruction:** Text at edges of column is somewhat blurred
  - **Second pass completed:** Yes
  - **Confidence:** LOW — Several phrases in the opening paragraphs are difficult to parse; the scan quality makes it hard to distinguish individual words. The general argument about political parties and religious liberty principles is clear, but specific wording may have errors.
  - **Reason:** Column edge blur and small type size

- **Page 6, left column, final paragraphs**
  - **Second pass completed:** Yes
  - **Confidence:** MEDIUM — The closing paragraphs about the Christian man as citizen are clearer but some phrases remain uncertain.

### Article 09: "National Religious Liberty Association" (pages 6-7)

- **Page 6, multiple NRLA items**
  - **Obstruction:** Small type, dense column layout
  - **Second pass completed:** Yes
  - **Confidence:** LOW to MEDIUM — This section contains many short items in small type. Several names and specific references may have OCR errors. The item about "Daniel Minc" — the name may be "Mine" or "Minch." The reference to "M. D. K. Riango" is uncertain — could be a different name.
  - **Reason:** Very small type in NRLA section

- **Page 6, right column, Alice Buckner petition item**
  - **Second pass completed:** Yes
  - **Transcribed as:** "MRS. ALICE BUCKNER, one of the board of Leahy Managers"
  - **Confidence:** LOW — "Leahy" may be "Lady" or another word. The context suggests it could be "Lady Managers" which was the common term for female managers of the World's Fair.
  - **Reason:** Blurred text

- **Page 6-7, items about Chicago Sunday closing organization**
  - **Second pass completed:** Yes
  - **Confidence:** MEDIUM — General content is clear but specific dollar amounts and organizational names may have minor errors.

### Article 10: "Vermont Sunday Law" (page 7)

- **Page 7, left column, law text**
  - **Second pass completed:** Yes
  - **Transcribed as:** Full text of the Vermont Sunday law statute
  - **Confidence:** MEDIUM — The statute text is generally legible, but some legal phrasings may have minor word-level errors. The chapter and section numbers (Chap. 202, Sec. 4001) are clear.
  - **Reason:** Legal text in small type

### Article 11: "Editorial Notes" (page 8)

- **Page 8, left column, Bishop Korum item**
  - **Second pass completed:** Yes
  - **Confidence:** MEDIUM — The name "Bishop Korum" is clear. Details about the case are readable.

- **Page 8, correction notice**
  - **Second pass completed:** Yes
  - **Confidence:** LOW — The page reference "350" and the context about a scripture reference correction are clear, but the specific corrected reference is hard to read.

  - **Second pass completed:** Yes
  - **Confidence:** MEDIUM — The proclamation text from Benjamin Harrison is mostly legible. Some phrases in the flowing prose are uncertain.

- **Page 8, "Christian Nation" commentary**

  - **Confidence:** MEDIUM — The editorial argument about the pagan character of the proclamation is clear in substance, though some specific word choices may be off.

- **Page 8, Ohio State University item**
  - **Second pass completed:** Yes
  - **Transcribed as:** Reference to "Dr. Moore" and "Rev. W. H. Scott"
  - **Confidence:** LOW — The names and specific details about the university president's resignation are somewhat blurred. The Catholic Review quotation contains some uncertain phrasings.
