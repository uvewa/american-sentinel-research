On November 1, a bill was introduced in the Legislature of Vermont to amend the statute of that State prohibiting Sunday work, hunting, etc.

The present Sunday law of Vermont as given in the Revised laws of Vermont, 1881, Chap. 202, Sec. 4315, reads:—

Any person who between twelve o'clock Saturday night and sunset on the following Sunday exercises any business or employment except such only as works of necessity and charity, or is present at any public assembly except such as is held for social and religious worship and moral instruction, or travels, except from necessity or charity, or visits from house to house, except from motives of humanity or charity, or for moral or religious edification, or holds or resorts to any ball or dance, or uses or exercises any game, sport or play, or resorts to any tavern, inn or house of entertainment for amusement or recreation, shall be fined not more than two dollars.

The proposed amendment to this section increases the fine from two dollars to twenty dollars.

Another clause in the law is:—

SECTION 4316. A person who hunts, shoots or pursues, takes or kills wild game or other birds or animals, or discharges any fire-arms, except in the just defense of person or property, or in the performance of military or police duty, on Sunday, shall be fined ten dollars, one half to go to the person who makes the complaint and one-half to the State.

The fine in this section is to be increased to twenty-five dollars.

These are the "stakes" that are being driven, while the Sabbath Union and Law and Order League are "getting the ropes ready."
