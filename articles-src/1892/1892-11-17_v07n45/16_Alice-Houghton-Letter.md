**MRS. ALICE HOUGHTON**, one of the board of Lady Managers for the State of Washington, writing to the Spokane Spokesman, says:—

Petitions will this week be placed in prominent business houses of this city, protesting against closing the World's Fair on Sunday. The casual observer, without stopping to investigate just what ground this covers will exclaim, "We must not foreignize our American Sabbath;" and many go even farther and use the word "describes." Now let us pause for a moment and consider whether either word applies to the issue. Let us look at this question fairly and honestly and let us enroll our names among those who have some care and thought for humanity. Let us make this petition of such magnitude that Congress will immediately feel the necessity in their coming session of repealing this law.

Now that an organized effort to secure the Sunday opening of the Fair has been started, it devolves upon those who comprehend the true principle involved in this matter to use special zeal in bringing it to the attention of those who give their names and influence to this Sunday Opening Association.

The fact that they have been ready to do this is evidence that they are more than half way on the road to an understanding of the fact that this is a subject with which Congress has properly nothing whatever to do.
