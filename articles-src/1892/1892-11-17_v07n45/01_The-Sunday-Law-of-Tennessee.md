# The Sunday Law of Tennessee.

THERE is almost an entire misapprehension in the public mind as to the Sunday law of Tennessee.

Since the despotic and persecuting proceedings of the State authorities in Henry County, Tennessee, as regards Sunday work by those who keep Saturday, the public have gathered the idea that the Sunday law of that State is a rigid, forceful, and far-reaching enactment.

Of course all Sunday laws are bad. But as a matter of fact the Sunday law of Tennessee is about as mild and as harmless as any Sunday law could be. And as a matter further the Sunday law of Tennessee is entirely innocuous, in so far as the prosecutions on this subject in that State are concerned.

The truth is that the persecuting prosecutions that have been carried on by the authorities of the State of Tennessee, in Henry County, for the last eight consecutive Sundays, have not been under the statutory authority whatever. The statute in relation to Sunday work is ignored, and has been ignored there for years, and all these cases, and extra-statutory measures have been applied and carried through. This the public should know.

The Sunday law of Tennessee, the only statute on this subject in that State, provides for prosecution "before any justice of the peace of the county," and provides there, only that the person duly convicted of performing any of the common vocations of life on Sunday, "before any justice of the peace of the county, shall forfeit and pay three dollars, one half to the person who shall sue for the same, the other half for the use of the county."

This is the only provision of law on this subject in the State of Tennessee. It is clear as words can say it, that there is in that State no provision of law for any prosecution for Sunday work, in any court but that of a "justice of the peace;" and no provision of law for any penalty or fine, but "three dollars." Yet every case of prosecution for Sunday work in that State for the last eight years, has been before the Circuit Court, and the fines placed at whatever figure the jury or the Circuit Judge has chosen to levy.

True, the proceedings, instead of being an enforcement of the law, are simply an indictment for an arbitrary will of the court. And each proceeding has been solemnly prosecuted to the Circuit Court of the United States, to be "due process of law."

This lawless course was begun in the Parker case. Parker was first tried before the Circuit Court, and duly convicted and imprisoned. Then nothing more was done in this line until the case of R. M. King in the summer of 1889. King was first prosecuted according to the law, and the fine provided in the law, was assessed and collected. A simple fine of three dollars, however, was not sufficient to satisfy the religious zeal of those who would punish the observance of any day but Sunday. Accordingly, these extra-statutory proceedings were adopted; the law was ignored; and Parker, King, and all others since, have been prosecuted before the Circuit Court, for the crime of "public nuisance," whereby the jury can assess any fine they see fit above fifty dollars, under that sum the amount being left to the discretion of the judge.

By this——not simply setting aside of the law, but the positive repeal of the only law on this subject—two extra-statutory proceedings are adopted. First, the prosecution is removed from the court of the justice of the peace to the Circuit Court. Secondly, the limit of the fine is removed and the amount is left to the mercy of the jury or the judge.

Of course, as we have shown, there is no law in Tennessee making work on Sunday a public or any other kind of nuisance. That law was made in this way: That State set forth the doctrine that "Christianity is part of the common law" of Tennessee, and that offenses against Christianity were properly indictable and punishable as the common offenses. This is the doctrine that was confirmed by the Circuit Court of the United States, which said that though there is no "any foundation for the ruling that it is a common law offense, per se, to work on Sunday," yet "that Christianity is part of the common law of Tennessee, and that Sunday, the Christian Sabbath, is one of the institutions of that religion."

By this, and not by any law of the State, is every man who works on Sunday, or keeps open his shop or place of business, in the State of Tennessee, liable to be assessed at any amount, but the court can convict without any evidence. This is precisely what was done last May in the cases of Dortch, Moon, Stem, and Lowry. They were prosecuted for the crime of public nuisance committed by working on Sunday. And though not a soul had made any complaint against any one of them, and though not a single witness testified that anybody in the community had been disturbed by any one of the accused, they were convicted and found guilty on the penalty of having done that which "was not a disturbance in the community in which done, was offensive to the moral sense of the public, and was not a public nuisance." And the fines were such as to keep them in jail from forty to sixty days.

It is a mistake therefore to speak, as some have, of Tennessee's "rigid Sunday law." On the contrary she has a very mild law for a Sunday law, and even that is not enforced. It is amazing what she does make able to call, as some papers have, for Tennessee to repeal her Sunday law, that being repealed, it is not Tennessee's Sunday law is not hurting those who keep another day. Don't you know? Isn't that is doing the mischief——and that is what should be repealed.

What is urgently needed just now in Tennessee is a rigid reform of law-work. There needs to be secured a set of judges who will have some respect for the law, both constitutional and statutory; and who will be content to set forth the law as it is written, and not take it upon themselves to set forth their own arbitrary will for the law. Judges are wanted there who will stay within the bounds set by the Constitution for the judiciary, and who will not attempt to exercise also the prerogative of the legislative branch of the State government. This is a reform, both as to men and as to measures, that needs but from the Circuit Courts of Tennessee to the Circuit Court and Supreme Court of the United States. But this is the very fact of the exigency, and its deep seated need, lest the hopelessness of any reformation, remedy never being successfully applied.

Tennessee also needs attorneys-general who will be content to be prosecuting attorneys, without presuming also to be persecuting attorneys after the manner of one of that county. As Henry county attorney-general and not inquisitor-general.
