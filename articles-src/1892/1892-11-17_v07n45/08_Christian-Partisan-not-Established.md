# Christian Partisan not Established.

This political campaign is just in the nature of things and has offered a most excellent opportunity to present to the people everywhere the great primary principles of religious liberty. The decisive presidential campaign has made itself appreciably effect upon the conscience of the country. The political campaign, with its eventual and certain results, need it, the free field by which the issue of its best presented. It is a free field of peaceful presentation of the great primary principles of Christ that religious issues are not the issues of human government. It stands among the planks of the universal platform. The truth, and it is a self-evident truth, can not be stifled by any political party; neither has it any alliance with any matching which they most of necessity to the requirements of human imperfection political principles and apply them to those portions of the divine moral code of duty toward our fellow men that have been taken. No political party has a mortgage on the universal principles of human rights. No right is partisan. No ownership or ownership of any of the universal principles of humanity, or inalienable right, can be attributed to, or claimed by, any political party. Each and all of them are amenable to all these principles, not by right depend in the least degree upon any political party for their establishment in them to vogue. They exist independently of all political parties, and all parties owe equal allegiance. All men of all parties are equally amenable to the principles irrespective of their party affiliations. These are the principles in the management of civil affairs. The course of a conscientious citizen is to be governed by the universal principles of right. They are, as universal principles, above all and independent of all parties. They can not be depended upon by political parties but only upon principle and justice. They can only be depended upon as the universal and inalienable principles of civil right and civil freedom in religious matters, wherever they appear, and champions exact justice and equal rights to all men.

The fealty of the just man is to justice. He can serve, on the other hand, be just and live up to his profession. Therefore the civil allegiance of the Christian, is a law-abiding government, is to civil justice, first, and to no party except as the party of his choice may be to him embody justice.

A Christian can not be a politician, as the terms of political affairs are applied, but that is not saying that the Christian man will not be a patriot, for he will be in the highest sense. If he be a Christian, he will love his neighbor as himself and will take all his civil rights and privileges for the benefit of his neighbor and for himself. That he may do this, it is requisite that he should be acquainted with the science with civil affairs, and be capable of exercising a just discrimination and employ every moral resource. To be an intelligent and worthy Christian, a man must be a good citizen; and such a man is. Such a man will not be unmindful of the fact that principle is greater than party. Be he no part of them for selfish ends, but for justice; furthermore of all how it works.
