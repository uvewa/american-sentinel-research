# Sunday Not a Holiday.—The Courts so Declare.

It is urged by certain writers in favor of Sunday laws, that such laws and lawmakers have nothing to do with the day as a religious institution, but that the day is a "civil Sabbath" only; etc. While it is certainly true enough in the nature of the various "decisions" by which the courts make laws more than the statutes, it is also true that much of the court-made law speaks out on the doctrine of positively religious grounds, as the following shows. The Sunday law of the United States grew out of the English statute law. It this an English Judge stated his decision in the following words:

> It is not the object or the nature of the statute to prevent persons keeping their Lord's day of the Church, but the religious observance of the Lord's Day.—1 *J. Burnstone v. Wildfield* 4.

A similar decision was made in the early history of this country. In 1817 Judge Kent said of the Sunday law in New York:

> It is laid as a statute enacted for the worship of the considering act, it is a law concerning religion, and the guardianship of the Christian system. It pertains to its complete order and solemnity of the day.—*Bayard.*

Still later and stronger were the words of a judge in this, who uttered the judicial opinion that the Sunday law of New York "explicitly requires for first day to be kept as a day of rest, and, thus, it has brought us back to the full, enlarged and absolute rule of the Sabbath day. The day has been kept by all nations, by the earliest laws of Christian States, and the sanctity of Christianity shall have its Charles II, he tended somewhat to materialize, what was really theological." *National Bot. 4. Rev., N. Y.* 320.

This has not been further a matter, it seems, and, in 1861, truly recognized the religious characters of the laws as follows.

> Pennsylvania has always held to the religious character of the Sunday law and has always refused to recognize the rights of individuals who disagree with the penalties; hence it is not surprising that in the report of judge Lindenmuller's case (1 Pitts 209) the decision of a Pennsylvania judge that "the first day, the Sabbath day) is clothed with peculiar sanctity."

457 (1860), two statutes of Kentucky commanded, the decision stating that "one applied to Sunday as sacred, and the other to holidays." The case is Sayre vs. Moore.

This decision is set forth in Iowa, Davis vs. Fish, Pp. 167, (1845), where in it is stated that Sunday is "sacred, set apart for rest by the voice of nations, statesmen, expert jurists."

In a North Carolina decision the Court held that the phrase "day of rest" in a religious and moral code permit works of labor and that one who defrauds is a violator. Ricketts case, 14 N. C., 14.

A case in Mississippi may be cited. And a decision in the State of Georgia, Glover, Paine, 23, gives the following decision, wherein it is said: "All courts should absolutely abstain from all transacting ordinary business on the holy day," and again says, "the holy day should be observed." And inasmuch as the State of Georgia, by a contribution in this State, by its organic laws, a statute more than this, that in no way, every individual decision upon the question,—"the Sabbath is regarded as the Lord's day," is observed. But in spite of the facts, and many guards, that the courts should set aside its civil character, it is still that, and doing making a record to be read by all the world, that Sunday is a religious institution, 23 Ga., Paine, *Glover vs. Martin,* pp. 436. In the case of Wedden, (if pronounced correctly) the Court declared to be a holy day.

The case of Delaware recognizes the power of the State to consecrate Sunday. In a Texas case on the doctrine of the subject, a matter of religion and the State, and essentially makes the point that Sunday is in its very nature, Ringsol says——

> The statute declaring "the day" as a holy day—"not merely" as a "day off"—one may say the civil power has control the observance of as such.

And New Jersey law has similar constructions.

New York, too, "that no operations for pecuniary gain, hire, or on any other day, work as holy time." People vs. Ruggles, 8 Johns, 290. Other States hold that Kentucky, speaks of the law in the State of Kentucky, in its very relation of that, (Moore *vs.* Hagar, 2 Dev., 437), and so in that way the judicial position is clear that regarded Sunday as the Lord's day" or "a most clear expression of religious character of the observance and duty." Weldon vs. East, 29.

If the power of the State can be used to compel the observance of Sunday, Church and State is established. If the State can compel the observance of a sacred day, it can compel the observance of the sacredness of a person, a building, or an altar. If State power can compel the observance of a religious institution, what limit is there? When we require men thus to consider it, we have reached the point of departure from which the law that religion is a department of the civil government, and we reach the inevitable conclusion of the State to legislate. The only true regulations concerning sacred things are those of the religion itself; not against crimes against persons or property but against the sacrilege of the soul of man.

But we have also another class of decisions which declare that one day has been set apart which the doctrine is founded on, of making a decision that Sunday is not a holiday. These declarations are the direct authorities and establish their own position before. These laws annunciation appear in decisions under statutes using the word "Sabbath" to mean Sunday. Instance, Judge Allen, of the State of New York, says the State statute to recognize and enforce regard for Sunday by rest as a sacred day.

It has a broader abstract from the courts of law regarding the decision of the law of the State that conform to respect. We have had courts state these
