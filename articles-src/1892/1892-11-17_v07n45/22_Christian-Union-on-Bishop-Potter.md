COMMENTING upon Bishop Potter's article in the November Century, the Christian Union says:—

The American Sunday stands supremely as a religious institution, and Bishop Potter asks with great force, For what is religion, if it be not for the revelation of moral ideas? and he proposes that on Sunday there should be in some great hall in the Exposition a noble presentation of these greater themes suggested by the glory of mechanism and art; and, in addition to this direct teaching, he suggests the rendering of the works of the great masters of music on Sunday afternoons or evenings. This is an admirable practical illustration of Paul's direction to overcome the evil with the good. If every Sunday afternoon could be devoted to such addresses, the Exposition could be made a means of both broadening the Church's conception of Sunday and of commending the day to many who now disregard, if they do not positively resent it.

And why not? If it is the province of Congress to recognize Sunday at all as an institution of the Church and to legislate concerning it, why not carry the matter further and order the day to be observed in that way which in the judgment of our law-makers would best redound to the benefit of the Church and to the glorification of Sunday?

Bishop Potter and the Christian Union may be woefully mistaken in thinking that an open Sunday Fair would be a "means of broadening the Church's conception of Sunday and of commending the day to many who now disregard it," but now that Sunday and the manner of its observance have by the action of Congress, and that with the consent of the churches, become a political question, they are logical in demanding that the measure and manner of Sunday observance shall likewise be settled by political methods.
