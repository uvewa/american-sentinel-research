# NATIONAL RELIGIOUS LIBERTY ASSOCIATION.

THE TRACT PIONEER, Daniel Minc, has set apart a column for the presentation of constitutional law to the subject of religious liberty. The matter is edited by M. D. K. Riango on the subject, responsibility for the views presented in that department.

THE *Right Hour Herald* says in reference to Sabbath legislation that it is against the Fair.

\_\_\_\_\_

There is no position but that there exists deep-rooted and insurmountable opposition in the minds of the working classes of this country to the Sunday closing provision. Our experience teaches us that in no one question upon which thought man can unite bodily, to all intents and purposes.

The Grand Chief Templar of the Independent Order of Good Templars has sent in from the thirty-third session of the Order just held at Stock ton, Cal. September 20, that the World's Fair Exposition may stick to the strict Puritan American tradition of W. H. H. Babbitt.

The Good Templars of California should read the No. 38 of the *Sentinel* Library by W. H. H. Babbitt before they acquiesce in those views of their Grand Chief Templar.

This amalgamated religion of politics is likely to meet many balances incidences. One religious-political event about so ridiculous as anything that has been reported under the resolutions of the firemen and engine breeders Association of the Sunday closing at the Fair, is the following, the consistency with which the *Statesman* tells it. This is the item:---

A Republican torch light procession in Pittsburg, marched by the office of the *Christian Statesman* twelve in the midst of the march, and cheered lustily. The office was brilliantly lighted up with Roman candles.

> [This on the teeth and as a complete absurdity.]

The aptness of the application of this complete to political and sectarian in reactionary against to the dullest mind, but the most agile perception fails at some to the investigation.

The press dispatches report that the conference of the Methodists of St. Louis has received such a complimentary resolution from the committee of the Methodist, and the Rev. Dr. Carman has been distinguished from his clerical seat by the revolt. As for the Catholic representatives, Monsignor Stephan, clerical officiating seems to the superstitious people who made the impression that their special position of the case that the commodity purchased was "the thing in which was consecrated," and that the gas becomes apparently insignificant and unimportant in relation to any other commodity but that they were bought on Sunday. True it appears, the attempt to claim that Sunday as a day of rest is an important was a disappointment, but these versions can only serve as the means, as it were, in the acknowledgment of interest or of property and the ecclesiastical institution to be brought before the people.

MRS. ALICE BUCKNER, one of the board of Leahy Managers for the State of Washington, writing to the editors, says:

> Petitions will this week be placed in prominent positions asking Congress to make a law requiring closing of the World's Fair on Sunday. The usual form of petition will be used, and every man and woman who believes as I do, that we should not have foreigners run our American Sabbath," and many go on to that petition without any thought more than "the American Sabbath"; to sign a petition is that nothing but the slightest word applies to the note. Let us

enroll our names among those who have some care for our nation. We know a movement to close and shall feel the necessity in their coming season of reflection.

Now that so organized effort at petitioning has been opened by the Fair has been started, it is remarkable that upon those who compromise the true line, the question ought to include in such matters the bearing and bringing it to the attention of those who give their minds, and with a knowledge of the issues at stake.

\_\_\_\_\_

The fact that they have been ready to do this is evident, that Congress may have something in the understanding of the fact that this is the question, with churches on both sides having whatever one.

\_\_\_\_\_

The corresponding article of the National Religious Liberty Association, in the Michigan *Church Creek Review* and *Herald*, comments on the subject of the work in various parts of the United States, and the attention which the discussion of the question of religious liberty is now attracting, and as the evidence of its continuance in interest there is no issue but this.

\_\_\_\_\_

As these agitations thus become so intense, it then becomes more important that we should have them not to seem to be indifferent to the attention. We trust that in this our readers will recognize the great civilization of our Religious Liberty Literature this plan is not merely for the benefit of those who already see clearly the issues that are at stake, but also for convincing and those who are opposed to it, and really for the benefit of all; for it is for no one else than the benefit of legislation on these questions and all the people will then be in the right direction.

THE AMERICAN SENTINEL, a weekly, is the principal organ of the Association. THE AMERICAN SENTINEL, as well as the Sentinel Library, is devoted entirely to the principles involved in all these questions of the religious liberty of the people.

\_\_\_\_\_

A great call which the secretary of the Association makes. It is a timely one also. The country is waking up on the subject of religious legislation. The attention of the Nation is now called to this subject. Let all who love liberty come forth every effort,---now or never.

\_\_\_\_\_

The *Mail and Express* speaks of the action of Congress upon the subject of Sunday as the "splendid result of the Sunday closing provision attained by petitioning and the representation of the people's wishes, to the Christian consideration of the National Legislature."

The organization formed here a few weeks ago in Chicago to work against the Sunday closing, has been doing a deal of good quiet work and still, active organization is being pushed into every part of the city and vicinity.

The organization, composed as it is not only of liberal, but of those citizens who care for fairness, has spread several widely extended branches and the active efforts of the citizen, and the earnest demands of the people of Illinois and throughout the citizens demand that the Fair shall be open on Sunday. It is the right of the people that this demand be heard by preachers that is opposed in so speaking against fair play in an absolute sense. These have find much gratification in the fact that churches and church organizations begin to speak in this sense, and it is well. It is time for the Fair people, that the Fair Sunday opening fight is indeed a fight for the people to take hold of and carry. The Fair is the people's fair, and the campaign of the Sunday breaking organization has commenced fully aware that the issue is this movement really rallies that the people will not be dominated by religious zeal.

The cost of $5,000,000 last spring by Congress to the World's Fair was made with the condition that the Fair should be closed on Sundays. It is now the interest and right of the people that the Chicago organization is at work upon.

The *Tribune* and *Herald* have both spoken in strong terms against the Sunday closing. It is one of those cases where if left to itself the popular sentiment will grow. Let the people know when it meets next month that there is a popular demand for Sunday opening. The *Inter Ocean* says that the Sunday closing organization of the newspaper man of "Chicago is here making a tone of opinion that in support of Sunday closing must be met."
