"The president of the Ohio State University, a public institution, located at Columbus, Ohio," remarks the Catholic Review, "is a Methodist clergyman, the Rev. W. H. Scott. Is, did we say? No, was; for the other day he assembled the students in the chapel and announced to them that he had resigned from the ministry of that denomination in order to enter the 'freer and larger religious life' of Pantheism. But his presence at the head of a State school, the chapel that was built on the grounds with public funds for the use of himself and his brother preachers, the last baccalaureate sermon preached there by a Presbyterian clergyman, the Rev. Dr. Moore, and the general management of the whole place as a Protestant college, show what our friends mean when they insist that all our public institutions must be non-sectarian. Put a priest as president of that university, erect a chapel for the celebration of the mass, let all the professors be Catholics, invite other priests to come occasionally to address the students, and you will have the reverse of the picture of the non-sectarian Ohio State University as at present conducted."

And the same thing might be said of other State institutions both in Ohio and elsewhere; they are non-sectarian only in the sense that in management and curriculum they are in harmony with the ideas of the so-called orthodox churches; Catholics, Jews, Freethinkers, and the smaller Protestant bodies which dissent from some of the doctrines of the dominant churches, are not considered at all. They are not regarded as having any rights that ought to be respected.
