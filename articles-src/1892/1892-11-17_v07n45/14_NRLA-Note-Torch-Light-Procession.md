The amalgamated religion of politics is likely to breed many ludicrous incidents. One religio-political event about as ridiculous as anything that has been reported since the resolutions of the Swine and Cattle breeders' Associations for the Sunday closing of the World's Fair, has been narrated by the Christims Statesman. The comicality of the situation is heightened by the self-satisfied gravity with which the Statesman tells it. This is the item:—

A Republican torch-light procession in Pittsburg, on a recent Saturday night, when the clock struck twelve in the midst of the march, and ushered in the Sabbath, turned itself at once into a sacred "concert" and the hands struck up.—

Here on the earth as a stranger I roam,
Here is no rest, here is no rest.

The aptness of the application of this couplet to peripatetic politicians is certainly apparent to the dullest mind, but the most agile perception fails to seize the devotional idea.
