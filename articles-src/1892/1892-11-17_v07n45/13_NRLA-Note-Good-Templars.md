The Grand Chief Templar of the Independent Order of Good Templars of California, at the thirty-third session of the Order just held at Stockton, Cal., said: "We pray that our Columbian Exposition may stick to the strict Puritan-American ideas of a sacred Sabbath."

The Good Templars of California should read the history of the enforcement of the "strict Puritan Sabbath" before they acquiesce in these views of their Grand Chief.
