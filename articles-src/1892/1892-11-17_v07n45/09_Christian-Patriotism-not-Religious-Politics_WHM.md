The presidential campaign is past. A political revolution has taken place. It is proper to ask whether this bodes anything, one way or the other, to the cause of religious liberty. The decisive answer to that question is to be found in prophecy. That which is to be, is to be. The fluctuation of party politics can have no appreciable effect upon the conclusion of the whole matter. But, irrespective of the eventual and certain result, or the channel by which the comprehension of what it is that is to be is reached, it is clear to all intelligent and faithful preachers, teachers, and believers of the gospel of Christ that religious issues are not the issues upon which to organize political campaigns. The planks of the universal platform of natural right, and religious truth, can not be filched by any political platform. The sawing, and hewing, and matching which they must of necessity undergo that they may be accommodated to the requirements of human imperfection will inevitably destroy in them all likeness to those portions of the divine moral law from which it may be claimed that they have been taken. No political party has a mortgage on the universal platform of natural right, or upon any part of it. No authorship or ownership of any of the principles of civil liberty, or any inalienable right, can be attributed to, or claimed by, any political party. These principles do not by right depend in the least degree upon the supremacy of any party to establish them in vogue. They exist independently of all parties. To them all parties owe equal allegiance. All men of all parties are equally subject to these principles irrespective of their party affiliations, or their personal views as to the management of civil affairs. The course of all conscientious men, as citizens, is governed by the universal principles of civil right. They are, in consequence, necessarily independent of party politics. They can not be depended upon by politicians for assistance in any selfish measures. They can only be depended upon to protest against all encroachments upon civil right and civil freedom in religious matters, wherever they appear, and to champion exact justice and equal rights to all men everywhere.

The fealty of the just man is to justice. No Christian can be other than just and live up to his profession. Therefore the civil allegiance of the Christian, in a representative government, is to civil justice first, and to no party except as the party of his choice may be the embodiment of civil justice.

Politics and religion will not mix. The Christian can not be a politician, as the word politician is now understood. But this is not saying that the Christian man will not be a patriot, for he will be in the highest sense. If he be a Christian, he will love his neighbor as himself and will use all his civil rights and privileges for the benefit of his neighbor as for himself. That he may do this, it is requisite that he should have an intelligent acquaintance with civil affairs, and be capable of exercising a just discrimination as regards every civil measure. To be an intelligent and worthy Christian, a man must be an intelligent and worthy citizen. Such a man will not be unmindful of political revolutions, but he will himself be no part of them for selfish ends, but only for the furtherance of abstract right and justice.
