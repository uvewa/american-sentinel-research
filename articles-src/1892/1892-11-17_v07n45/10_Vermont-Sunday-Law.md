# Vermont Sunday Law.

On November 1, a bill was introduced in the Legislature of the State of Vermont, to make a law to abolish prohibiting Sunday work, hunting, etc. The present Sunday law is Chap. 202, Sec. 4001, the Revised laws of Vermont, 1891, Chap. 202, Sec. 4001, and reads:

Any person who between twelve o'clock Saturday night and sunset on the following Sunday exercises any business or employment except upon a works of necessity and humanity, or is at any place of public resort for amusement, and on said day, for social and religious worship and moral instruction, or travels, except from necessity or charity, for the purpose of humanity or charity, or for moral or religious edification, or any other purposes than these, or takes part in any exercise, sport, game, or play or recreation on the Lord's day, commonly called Sunday, on or uses of exercises any game, sport of play, or recreation on the first day of the week shall be fined not more than two dollars.

The person amendated to this section is to raise the fine from two dollars to twenty dollars. Another clause in the law is:

SECTION 4011. A person who hunts, shoots or pursues on what kills with guns or other device, or shoots, or discharges any fire-arms, except in the just defence of himself or property, or in the performance of duty on the first day of the week, shall be fined ten dollars, one half to go to the person. We have marked the proposed Sunday law revision.

The fine in this section is to be increased to twenty dollars.

These are the "stakes" that are being driven, these are the links of the chain of Sunday religious legislation——getting the ropes ready.
