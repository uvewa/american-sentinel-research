---

Some months ago a Protestant student in Germany, published a brochure criticising the Holy Coat crusade at Treves. Bishop Korum, under whose auspices the crusade was carried on, brought suit against the author of the pamphlet with the result that he was sentenced to six week's imprisonment and his publisher to three. The case has been appealed, and will doubtless be carried to the Supreme Court of the Empire at Leipzig.
