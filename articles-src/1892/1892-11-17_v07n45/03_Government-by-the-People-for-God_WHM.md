The Supreme Court of the United States has seen fit to decree that the divine law of Jehovah is the civil law of this land; and the Congress of the United States has interpreted that law, and made actual application of its interpretation, in reference to one point of belief and practice. This is no less than the assumption of the vicegervancy of the kingdom of God on earth.

To assume to be the vicar of God and to speak and to rule by divine right is no new thing upon the earth. Heretofore, however, it has been an expression of the blasphemous error of religious absolutism exercised by a one man power, a despotism of one. But monarchial form of government is not positively necessary to support a religious despotism.

The ruling classes of the United States, and perhaps of the leading nations of the world, have now reached that stage of development that they are able to subject themselves and their vassals to the despotism of an idea; and the sway of that idea may be more despotic, enforced by the methods they can bring to bear, than the personal rule of any one man could possibly be. The despotism of an idea is sure to be imperative, coercive, relentless. The despotism of a religious idea, misdirected into channels of civil legislation, is certain to be unqualified tyranny. This has been demonstrated in the history of the Papacy. When the ruling majority in this country shall establish the civil authority of a religious idea and compel, or assume to compel, the citizens and residents of the United States to yield obedience to it, then a theoretical papacy will have been established. A perfect similitude of a papal despotism will be enthroned.

A papacy established after a monarchial theory is concrete, necessarily, in its form. A papacy constituted in, and according to the theory of, a republican form of government must conform to the necessities of representative expression. The one then is the concrete tyranny of an individual will; the other is the elusive, but no less real, despotism of an abstract idea enforced by the will, or the permission, of majorities. The latter is the complete similitude of the former, but on a higher plane of intellectual and governmental development. Humanly speaking, only, is it on a higher plane. It is an advanced development; a more subtle manifestation of the direst and most fatal error into which the mind of man has ever fallen.

This image to the Papacy is the highest refinement of governmental wickedness possible. By it the people, in and through the regular procedure of self-government, assume to themselves, each and separately, the divine prerogative, and attempt to usurp, individually and collectively, the authority of God. In just that degree to which this is a government of the people, by the people, for the people, in just that degree is each sovereign citizen responsible for the establishment of this similitude to the Papacy.

It may be said that this is but the expression of a fine drawn theory which can never be realized. It is already realized, as shown by the initial facts which were used as stepping stones to these thoughts. This Government has then declared itself to be a government of the people, by the people, for God. The result will be a similitude of the Papacy worthy of the intellectual development and moral degradation of the nineteenth century.
