# Editorial Notes.

SOME months ago a Protestant student in Germany, published a brochure criticizing the Holy Cross crusade at the instance of Bishop Korum, under whose auspices the crusade was carried on, brought suit against the author of the pamphlet with the result that he was sentenced to six weeks' imprisonment and his publication seized to shew. The case has been appealed, and will doubtless be carried to the Supreme Court of the Empire at Leipzig.

A careful reader calls our attention to the fact that in page 350 of the current volume, in the last paragraph in the first column, a wrong scripture reference is given. It was given as was in the proof-reading; for in the copy the reference was properly given, No. 29. But we know that we have taken enough in the matter lack of the text world be at a loss to find it; and the application was so plain that it would not readily fail to see it. Those who substitute Sunday for the Sabbath have of Scripture against them. The Sabbath "copyrighted" and none else, as the Scriptures now stand, one side, as far as the Scriptures are concerned, only as the Scriptures are concerned. Sunday as a holy day is absolutely unknown to Holy Writ.

COMMENTING upon Bishop Potter's article in the November *Century,* the *Christian Union* says:---

The American Sunday stands superbly as a time of rest. But what is religion, if it is not for the revelation of moral ideals and for the service of mankind? We agree with Bishop Potter that of the Respectful there should be in some great fair a memorial of the best that has been attained in the themes suggested by the glory of nominations and art, and, in addition to the direct teaching, the suggestion, the resistance of the works of the great masters of art made on Sunday afternoon at various points in the grounds and buildings of the Fair; and Bishop Potter's direction to conserve the evil will the good will be greater still. Once it is agreed to organize such addresses, the Exposition could be made a most powerful instrument for the edification of Sunday and of commending the day to many who now disregard it; that do not appreciate the privilege.

And why not? If it is the province of Congress to recognize Sunday at all as an institution of the Church and to legislate concerning it, why not carry the matter further and order the day be observed in that way which in the judgment of our law-makers would best redound to the benefit of the Church and to the glorification of Sunday?

\_\_\_\_\_

Bishop Potter and the Christian Union may be worldly unitarian in thinking that an open Sunday Fair would be a "means of broadening the Church's conception of Sunday" and of commending the day to many who now disregard it, but now that Sunday and the master of its observance have by the action of Congress, and that with the consent of the churches, become a political question, they are logical in demanding that the measure so as regards of Sunday observance shall likewise be settled by political methods.

THE PRESIDENT, in his role of official high priest of this "Christian Nation," has issued the following proclamation.

The gifts of God to our people during the past year have been so abundant as to revive the spirit of devout thanksgiving even unto a call, but the appointment as a time set to a minister of the religious expression. He has stayed the practice as one that he has given us never love for the civil institutions, in the creation of which his predecessors, of whom the late service gave and sustained a deeper reverence for law, to be has withered our philosophy to a call to secure the distance as other lands, in his finest court of schools and is bringing forward a patriotic and God-fearing generation to exercise the great and benevolent designs for our country; he has given us an open continent and a free pathway of commerce and of comfortable abundance, and comfort in the homes of our people, contentment and comfort in the homes of our people.

Wherefore, I, Benjamin Harrison, President of the United States, do call upon all our people to observe, as we have been wont, Thursday, the twenty-fourth of this month of November, as a day of thanksgiving to God for his mercies and a suppliance for his continued care and grace.

In testimony whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.

Done at the city of Washington this 4th day of November, in the year of our Lord eighteen hundred and ninety-two, and of the independence of the United States the one hundred and seventeenth.

BENJAMIN HARRISON.

*By the President.*

*W. F. Wharton, Secretary of State.*

It is a little strange that while such rich and rare words are employed, and the proclamation seeks to clothe its action with this name, it is "Christian" Nation, this particular proclamation, this very same act before, it bears no internal evidence of having been conceived, much less written, or issued by a Christian ruler. The veriast pagan might be the author of such a proclamation. Because of Cyaxare might have lent a proclamation in the exact words of this one issued by the President of this "Christian" Nation, and nobody would have even suspected that it was not designed to honor the god of Persia.

If this is, as the Supreme Court has said that it is, a "Christian" Nation, the President certainly ought to issue Christian proclamation; if it is a pagan Nation, the proclamation in question will answer every purpose; but if the Nation is simply a civil government, organized for civil purposes, and as President Washington asserted, "is in no sense founded upon the Christian religion," we should at once and forever be done with the farce of professing something which only a small per centage of the people really feel,

and which causes a professedly Christian man, as elder in a Christian church, to deny his Lord by issuing as a Christian, a proclamation which never mentions our Lord even in the date which it bears.

"The president of the Ohio State University, a public institution, located at Columbus, Ohio," remarks the *Catholic Review,* "a Methodist clergyman, the Rev. W. H. Scott, *A little way's* off," was, for the other day he assembled the student body and solemnly announced to them that he had resigned from the ministry of the denomination" and told in life after the "tree of nearer and larger relation to the church" of Pantheism. But the presence was built on of State action, the chapel that was built on the grounds with public funds from the tax of sinful and of his faithful preachers, the last baccalaureate sermons before the Presbyterian has been offered to the university. But Dr. Moore, and the general management of the whole places a free Race edition, calling to the attention of all classes. Attention when they insist that all such tax paid institutions must be institutions for the public, a priest as president of that university, or an infidel should be as acceptable as any man, let all the professors be Catholics, invite other priests to come occasionally to address the students, and you will have the reverse of the pictures of the non-sectarian Ohio State University and at present confiscated.

We are requested to say that Mr. F. M. Bennett, been the editor of the *Truth Seeker,* the organ of the Free-thought movement, has become the business as well as the editorial manager. Brethren and Sisters who wish to deal with the *Truth Seeker* should address Mr. Bennett at 28 Lafayette Place, N. Y.
