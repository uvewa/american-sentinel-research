The press dispatches report that the Methodists of St. Louis have experienced a painful shock. In fact, the Methodism of St. Louis has received such a concussion that a reverend culprit is likely to be dislodged from his clerical seat by the recoil. As stated in the dispatch the head and front of the clerical offending seems to be the unpardonable sin of buying on Sunday. It appears upon investigation of the case that the commodity purchased was cigars, but the fact that a minister should use cigars becomes apparently insignificant and unnoticeable under the stress of the scandalous fact that they were bought on Sunday. True it appears, too, that the ministerial smoker also used profane language and was a bigamist, but these venial errors only serve as side issues, as it were, in the indictment for Sunday breaking under which this ecclesiastical sinner is to be brought before his conference.
