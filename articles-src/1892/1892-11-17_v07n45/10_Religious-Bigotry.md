When one reads of the cruel religious persecutions in Tennessee under the laws of that State and contrary to the Constitution of the United States, he is forcibly reminded of the days and old scenes enacted under the Spanish Inquisition. To know of conscientious men being thrust into prison in this country, there to lie until the uttermost farthing be paid as a penalty for violation of what the wise legislators of that State deem good law on the Sunday question, is indeed horrible. Four men in said State are reported to have lain in jail some months because of acting in accordance with their religious convictions, believing that the seventh day is the Sabbath and keeping that day, and further believing in the command that "six days shall thou labor and do all thy work," as well as the command, "but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God; in it thou shalt not do any work," etc. They were arrested for working on one of the six days, and although acknowledged to be good citizens otherwise, were thrust into prison to pay the penalty for what the statute books of Tennessee denominate a crime, no matter what his religious views may be regarding the Sabbath question. Such a law appears to be a kind of Church and State affair. A keeper of the seventh day has the same moral right to his convictions as the man who thinks he has it right when he observes the first day of the week as the Sabbath and keeps it. Old Tennessee should call a halt and retrace her steps in that which she seems to have entirely ignored, the Constitution of the United States, which guarantees to every citizen the right to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience. The act of imprisoning men in this age for simply working on Sunday, at the same time they holding to the doctrine that the seventh day is the Sabbath, and keeping that day, savors too much of heathenism.—Palmyra, (Wisconsin) Enterprise.
