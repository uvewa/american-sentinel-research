It is a mistake therefore to speak as some have of Tennessee's "rigid Sunday law." Tennessee has no rigid Sunday law. On the contrary she has a very mild law for a Sunday law, and even that is not enforced. It is somewhat wide of the mark also to call, as some papers have, for Tennessee to repeal her Sunday law. This is not the need just now; for Tennessee's Sunday law is not hurting anybody. It is the Sunday law that she hasn't that is doing the mischief—and that can't be repealed.

What is urgently needed just now in that State is a rigid reform of her courts. There needs to be secured a set of judges who will have some respect for the laws, both constitutional and statutory; and who will be content to set forth the law as it is written, and not take it upon themselves to set forth their own arbitrary will for the law. Judges are wanted there who will keep within the bounds set by the Constitution for the judiciary, and who will not attempt to exercise also the prerogative of the legislative branch of the State government. This is a reform, too, that is sadly needed not only in Tennessee but clear from the Circuit Courts of that State all the way up to the Supreme Court of the United States. But lo! in this very fact of the widespread and deep-seated need, lies the hopelessness of any reformatory remedy ever being successfully applied.

Tennessee also needs attorneys-general who will be content to be prosecuting attorneys, without turning themselves into persecuting attorneys after the manner of that one down in Henry County—attorneys-general and not inquisitors-general.
