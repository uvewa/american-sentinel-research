# Christianity and the Common Law.

In another place in this paper it has been pointed out how that in Tennessee the statute is ignored in the Sunday prosecution. "Christianity as the common law" is used as the authority for the prosecution of Christianity as the common law is stated as the authority of the prosecution. "Christianity as the Common law" is stated; and so this Tennessee history furnishes in a living way an admirable opportunity to show what the doctrine means.

It is an undeniable principle of the law that the common law is superseded by the written law. A statute repeals the common law on the same subject. Written legislation supplants the common law on which the statute is written.

1. As a statute takes the place of the common law on the same subject, and the State of Tennessee has a statute on the subject of Sunday observance, it follows that any indictment or prosecution, at common law on the subject of Sunday observance, is void.

2. As a Constitution supersedes the common law in all points which the Constitution, against any or all law on this subject, Tennessee expressly declares that "no preference shall ever be given by law to any religious establishment or mode of worship." And this provision of the Constitution extends to every intent and purpose a mode of worship. Court of Tennessee recognized and established Christianity as a part of the common law, yet this is fully superseded, and thereby positively give preference by law to the Christian religion and its mode of worship. But this, being in violation of the express provision of the Constitution, is clearly void.

It may be well to give some attention upon this point. The Constitution of Tennessee is a part of the constitution, "Bill of Rights" that "no human authority can in any case whatever control or interfere with the rights of conscience; and no preference shall ever be given by law to any religious establishment or mode of worship?"

Then it is demonstrated by living illustration of it as a fact and not merely a principle, that the proceedings of the Tennessee courts are not only in violation of this provision, and without the shadow of being of absolute authority, as the United States courts have pronounced them, are void and of no valid authority at all. And the demonstration is according to the cases of the United States Circuit Court decisions, constituting, sustaining that, King, and Dortch, and Moon, and Stem and Lowry, were deprived of their liberty and property "without due process of law."

Christianity is the religion established by law, the divinity to which we relate as in our body unto, the doctrine of the nation's most holy purpose of our Christian which is sought; but with it as our noediv which it has to be, the very substance of the thing, which if we accept and adopt.

Ppp. 101, 102.

All of this Judge Cooley confirms in the law of the land.

> But this does not authorize us to maintain that the law now controls that, upon the ground of their sacred character or divine origin, the civil government, upon recognition of the principles of Christianity, shall enforce recognition as being inseparable and not dissoluble; so that when we come right to the matter of duty of the Government to protect, we must admit is too elevated to be brought to the field of discussion. What we who judge the conduct of the citizens; and under existing law be impeached in this as in any other ground, may be within the range of duty. There, we shall he find something short of the good banner Constitution to rest upon, while if we effect the bond and address themselves to the conclusion, which the law allows, that they take on themselves the guardianship of others in this matter, they will report that no consideration can reasonably be made to assume Christianity is not a part of the law of the land so as far as we can find on its precepts and principles and doctrines whatever, a substantial constituted, and established part of the positive law of the land.

3. This provision of the State constitution, "Bill of Rights" that "no human authority can" and principles of law and government, is that——

> The marks that Christianity is in part and parcel of the common law of the land can be accepted out of the general powers of government. It is not correct.—*Judge Cooley.*

As, therefore, the "Declaration of Rights" of the State of Tennessee has provided that no preference shall ever be given by law to any religious establishment or mode of worship; and as all matters of conscience, religion, and worship are by the Constitution of Tennessee, excepted out of the general powers of government and "no" "all have said no" human authority can said to control, it follows that the claim of Christianity as by common law in the State of Tennessee is absurd.

There is yet another defect in this theory that Christianity is part of the common law. The theory is drawn from English "law." But even in England, Christianity was never considered a part of the law, to be a law for Sunday work. And that a mere violation of the injunctions, is independent of the designated laws, and without the sanctions of any particular act of Parliament made to observe that subject, it may result no doubt to deserve to answer in a common law court," as one said further, Hawkins himself goes even further than this, and in a communication to the *National Review* of London, Aug. 19, 1891, shows that "in one of the best cases in England the Lord Chief Justice pronounced former expressions that Christianity is part of the law of the land, as dicta, and not true now."

And in yet another field, it was not and it never was true by any principle of justice or right. It has to set in our place as a thing that has "been set." And we shall here suffice here simply to observe that it was never anything but judicial dictum, inspired by falsehood, and it has been perpetuated by being set forth for an existing truth as true now "in England that Christianity is part of the law of the land, has never been true in England. And further and doubly, how can it be true law in Tennessee in
