# Government by the People, for God.

The Supreme Court of the United States has declared that this Nation is a nation of Jehovah in the civil law of this land; and of this Jesus Christ is the interpreter. It has interpreted that law, and made obedience to one part of belief and practice, binding upon all the inhabitants and citizens of this land on the basis and authority of the supremacy of the kingdom of God on earth.

To assume to be the vicar of God and to expect and to try to direct every right as now living upon the earth. Heretofore, however, it has been an expression of the theological error of religious absolutism exercised by a one man power, a despotism of one. But monarchial form of government is not positively necessary to papal principles.

The ruling classes of the United States, studying the influences of the times in the world, have now reached that stage of progress, of politics, of human affairs, to form themselves and their vassals to the despotism of an idea; and they cry to that idea may be more despotic, enforced by the invisible, and by no means so easily overturned than the personal rule of any one man can possibly be. And that all their idea is sure to be imperative, coercive, national, established into classes of civil legislation, is certain by the unguarded and apparently unsuspected adoption of the history of the Papacy. When the Papacy succeeded in its effort to establish the civil authority of a religious institution, the bishops were able to compel the citizens and residents of the United States to yield obedience to it, then a like papal papacy will have been established. A perfect similitude of a papal despotism will be enthroned.

A papacy established after a monarchial theory is coercive, necessarily, in its form. A papacy constituted in, and according to the theory of, a republican form of government must conform to the accepted constitutional form. But in its essence then as there is the concrete tyranny of an individual, in the other as there is the no less real, despotism of an abstract idea and the tyranny of a political and social majorities. The latter is the complete similitude of the former, but on a higher plane of intellectual and governmental development. Broadly speaking, only, it is on a higher plane. It is an advanced stage, a more subtle manifestation of the direct and most fatal error upon which the mind of man has ever wrought.

This image to the Papacy is the highest form of governmental wickedness possible. By it the people, in and through the legislative procedure of all government, assume to themselves, such supremacy, and having assumed it, exercise it——not singly, individually and collectively, the despotism of their aggregate will. And with this a government of the people, for God, is established. And the highest degree is such sovereign citizens responsible for the establishment of this, constitute the Papacy.

It may be said that this is but the presentation of a fina drawn theory which can never be realized. It is already realized, as shown by the initial facts which appear as and are stepping stones to these heights. This Government has declared itself, in its government of the people, by the people, for the people, to be a complete similitude of the Papacy worthy of the imitation of the nineteenth century.
