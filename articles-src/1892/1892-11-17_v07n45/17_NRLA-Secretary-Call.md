The corresponding secretary of the National Religious Liberty Association, in an article in the Battle Creek Review and Herald, comments on the rapid progress of legislation upon religious questions, and the attention which the discussion of the impropriety of such legislation is now receiving, as well as the evidence of its continuance in increasing ratio, and says:—

As these agitations thus become so intense, it furnishes us great opportunities to present the truth before the people, and we should not allow ourselves to be indifferent to the situation. We trust that all are planning for an active campaign in the circulation of our Religious Liberty literature this winter. This discussion will reach a high degree of earnestness with both advocates of the Sunday-closing and those who are opposed to it, and while the opening or closing of the Fair in itself may not be of much consequence, it brings up the whole subject of legislation on these questions and all should be ready to step in and give the word of truth. THE AMERICAN SENTINEL, as well as other important reading matter, should be placed in the homes of many thousands of people where it has not gone as yet.

It is an earnest call which the secretary of the Association makes. It is a timely one also. The daily evidences that it is being heeded are most encouraging. The attention of the Nation is now attracted to these questions. It is the time to put forth every effort.—now or never.
