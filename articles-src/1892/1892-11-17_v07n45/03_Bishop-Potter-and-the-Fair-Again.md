# Bishop Potter and the Fair Again.

IN the November *Century* is an article from Bishop Potter—originally called out by, and based upon the views set forth by him in the recent Church Congress in this city. The Bishop favored only partial Sunday opening of the Fair on a plan—a fairly complete grounds and buildings, but not machines and closed halls.

But Bishop Potter has been severely criticised by the more ultra-Sunday closing element, and his article in the *Century* is doubtless for the purpose of making a further statement. After a number of platforms, the Bishop assumes the position that the question is the ministerial surrender of the benefits of Sunday, but a question between the friends of Sunday.

> On a question between the friends of closing the Exposition, and such surrender of it as would soonest extinguish the last remains of its religious character, it seems to me, I should be in favor of the most rigid closing possible.

With the Bishop then, the question is not whether the Fair should be open, but he agrees that the Fair must be so manipulated as to keep Sunday the biggest day. With the Bishop the question is not his agreement with him is, How can Sunday best be observed at the Fair?

> To most of us that day stands supremely as one not to be given over to amusement; it is not for the recreation and the invitation of works but this, in our hearts, yet as standing alone

And as if, when Sunday came to the Columbian Exposition in Chicago, it could be assumed that its character as a day of rest must needs be preserved, as were with every and impressive presentation of the highest and best things, which was associated with a day which such an observance deserves. It must, in a word, be made to work and such work meeting such interesting and uplifting as to draw people to it.

And this he would have the Nation do! Now would the good Bishop stop here; would he demand that the Nation close its grounds and the evenings the multitudes assembled in Chicago who have come from parts of the land, that rarely or never hear great and sacred music? let him not rob them of the mighty wings of spread and sanctuary that can gather them in, the glory and harmonious; and be well-doing in itself, to be open.

That's so, too, would he not announce to us of a day conservative to lofty purposes and sacred uses, something of the purpose of the day.

Now see this Bishop.

> Thus Bishop Potter, in and only in immediate connection with the Exposition could do for "the best things," and the whole management of the whole place was a force for good; presented and through what a great and good influence it could exercise, closing the gates; and the Eternal Veritas, that too, would help the attendants of the Exposition; would they not be set on to making the most and the loss of the great religious blacks of and no-where.

Thus Bishop Potter, in and only in immediate connection with the Exposition grounds and buildings, but not machines and opened institution, but he would have the Fair in its Sabbath dress surrounded by all the institutions of individual and their services giving of the higher observance. Sunday is not the question with Bishop Potter. It is his own interest, and Bishop Potter would have this matter presented in the most favorable light among the "ablest and those of dignity to constitute the Papacy."

That's precisely the point. That, he sees, is not only have the Nation adhere to its policy of closing the Fair on Sunday, but he would have it enforce its meaning.

And why not? If it is the province of Congress to recognize Sunday at all as an institution of the Church and to legislate in a manner as to still further strengthen in its religious character the exercise of paternal ecclesiastical authority in religion and government, ought not carry the matter further. Congress having assumed the authority, does not it then determine in what way or far as the Sabbath is concerned. With the Bishop would the question is not his agreement with the Bishop would is further declared standard of Sabbath observance that is now laid down by the Author of, and the Law-giver the Church?

And why not? If it is the province of Congress to recognize Sunday at all as an institution of the Church and to legislate concerning it, why not carry the matter further and order the day to be observed in that way which in the judgment of our law-makers would best redound to the benefit of the Church and to the glorification of Sunday?
