CONGRESSMAN HENDERSON, of Iowa, is one of the considerable number of well-meaning people in this country who grow impatient at the apparently tardy results of attempts at making the world better, and finding the laws indifferently enforced, hurry off to seek a remedy in more laws. The particular evil which troubles Mr. Henderson is the illegal use of the mails for the circulation of improper literature. He seems to overlook the fact that such use is already illegal and the laws can be and probably are enforced as strictly as it is possible for any law not aimed at the direct preservation of life and property to be. He thinks the remedy is to be found in creating a censorship and has introduced a bill which in effect gives the Postmaster General authority to suppress a newspaper or other periodical altogether by denying it the use of the mails. The bill will hardly become a law, and certainly ought not to. It is not enough to urge in its support that the Postmaster General would probably use his power with moderation and discretion. The objection lies in the principle of the thing, which is wrong altogether. The proper place to settle questions of violation of law is in the courts, and the inquiry should be conducted under fixed rules of procedure, to the end that impartial justice may be the result. Short cuts in attempts to enforce the laws by clothing some man or body of men with dictatorial powers are sure to result disastrously in the end, and are directly contrary to the spirit of our institutions as established by the founders. There are publications, undoubtedly, which should be suppressed in the interest of good morals, but they should be restrained by the punishment of the offenders as provided by law rather than by a censorship such as is permitted in no civilized country outside of Russia.
