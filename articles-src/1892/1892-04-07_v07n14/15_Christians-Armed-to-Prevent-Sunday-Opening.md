A CORRESPONDENT says that a leading lawyer of Cincinnati recently stated to him that, if the World's Fair is opened on Sunday, the church to which he belonged would go armed and prevent the opening by force. If this is the proper thing for Christians to do, why did not Christ tell Peter to fight away, rather than to put up his sword, with the statement that they who take the sword must perish with the sword? Christians must persuade, but where is the authority from the great Author of Christianity for them to take up arms to fight for their principles?
