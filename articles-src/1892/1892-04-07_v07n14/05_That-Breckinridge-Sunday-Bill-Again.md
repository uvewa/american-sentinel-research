In the Breckinridge Sunday bill, now before Congress for the second time, the use of any designation, or name, for Sunday, that could mark the measure as religious, is studiously avoided; but such a character is indelibly stamped upon the bill by the use of the word "secular," which is of necessity contrasted with spiritual or holy. The bill provides—

that it shall be unlawful for any person or corporation, or employe of any person or corporation in the District of Columbia, to perform any secular labor or business, or to cause the same to be performed by any person in their employment on Sunday, except works of necessity or mercy.

"Secular" is defined thus by Webster: "Of or pertaining to this present world, or to things not spiritual or holy; relating to temporal as distinguished from eternal interests; not immediately or primarily respecting the soul, but the body; worldly." The bill would mean precisely the same thing if, instead of prohibiting "secular labor or business," on Sunday, it prohibited all labor or business "of, or pertaining to this present world, or to things not spiritual or holy." That is just what it means as it reads, but it is not so plain to be seen as it would be were the definition of the word "secular" made a part of the bill itself.

Were this bill to become a law, it would give the civil courts of the District of Columbia jurisdiction to decide what does pertain to "eternal interests;" for by prohibiting the pursuit of secular affairs on Sunday, it just as distinctly enjoins spiritual pursuits, for it is impossible for human beings to be absolutely idle. Indeed, by excluding everything secular, this bill proposes to give spiritual things a monopoly of Sunday. Hence, should the bill become a law, the courts would of necessity have to adjudicate between secular and spiritual things; which is only another way of saying that men would, by the passage of the Breckinridge Sunday bill, be made judges of the consciences of their fellow-men.

This is true also of another feature of this bill, namely, of the clause which says—

that the provisions of this act shall not be construed to apply to any person or persons who conscientiously believe in and observe any other day of the week than Sunday as a day of rest.

Why specify those who "conscientiously believe in and observe another day of the week than Sunday as a day of rest"? If rest is all that is aimed at in the bill, why not exempt from its operation all who rest upon any other day of the week than Sunday, whether they conscientiously believe in it or not? Why introduce this element of conscientious belief at all? Simply because that while a law, such as this bill would be if the words "conscientiously believe in" were omitted, would secure to every man, if enforced, a purely civil rest day, it would not secure general and uniform suspension of all secular labor and business on Sunday; and that is what the bill is for. It singles out that particular day, and requires all to rest upon it, except the few who "conscientiously believe in and keep" another day. If, then, any question arises as to who are entitled to the exemption, the courts must sit in judgment upon the conscientious convictions of those who claim the exemption. How they are to determine the secret thoughts of the heart (without knowing which they can know nothing of the conscience), is left for the friends of the bill to explain. Under the Inquisition such information was extorted by the rack and the thumb-screw; and it is doubtful if even the nineteenth century could devise anything much more effective for that purpose.

The fact of the exemption of "those who conscientiously believe in and observe any other day of the week than Sunday," marks this bill as a religious measure. Men conscientiously believe in and practice moral or religious duties. Apart from religious obligation, a man would have no more conscience in resting regularly, than in bathing at stated intervals, or in taking just so many hours' sleep each night. He would, in fact, make the taking of his weekly rest somewhat a matter of personal convenience, just as people do eating, sleeping, bathing, etc. But this proposed law for the District of Columbia, contemplates more than this; it proposes to require of all men either the conscientious observance of some day other than Sunday, or such an outward observance of Sunday as, in the absence of counter evidence, would indicate conscientious regard for that day. The bill is wholly and designedly in the interests of Sunday as a sacred day, and would never have been thought of had it not been for the regard in which that day is held by many. It should be defeated as a much-needed and fitting rebuke to those misguided religionists who imagine that men can be spiritually regenerated and made moral by act of Congress.
