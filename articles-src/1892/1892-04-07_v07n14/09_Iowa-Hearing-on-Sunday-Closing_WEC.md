# Iowa Hearing on Sunday-Closing.

In harmony with the concurrent effort put forth in every State Legislature to close the means of transportation, the friends of Sunday, were active in bringing their influence to bear on the Iowa Legislature to place that body in a position of sympathy with the effort to secure the closing of the World's Columbian Exposition on Sunday.

As a result the following was offered by a member of the House:—

> Whereas, It has been proposed to open the doors of the World's Columbian Exposition on the Sabbath day, contrary to the honorable custom of the country; and whereas, the exposition was made possible by an act of Congress, whose authority holds good, and also in violation of the laws of almost every State in the Union; now therefore be it resolved, by the House of Representatives, State of Iowa, that the opening of the Exposition on the day of rest, is necessary, not only for the well being of the workingmen employed, but in violation of the Christian Nation; but, also for the stability of the religious institutions of our country; and be it further resolved, that a copy of these resolutions be transmitted to the citizens consulting with the officers of the World's Columbian Exposition.

The enforcement of Sunday laws is to secure the supposed panacea for all social and political ills. But it is true that the enforcement of the law will establish for no deeper a man a more failure by an observance of the law for a single day.

The World's Fair—"Department of Religion" as a portion of the World's Congress Auxiliary has been placed in the hands of C. C. Bonney, who is President of the International Law and Order League. It is Frederick Douglas, World's Congress Auxiliary. Mr. Bonney says he has an arrangement with the Directory of Departments at the World's Fair, which says that it would seem inappropriate, not to say impossible, to make the Golden Rule the ground of the Department of Religion. As this committee is to be held in connection with the Columbian Exposition of 1892, the sub-committee of the council on religious congresses has this for its platform: "A Religion of a thing to which by its own excellence and promise may be set forth, and the marvelous religious history of America be commemorated, by its to facilitate separate and independent presentation of every form of religious achievement through active officers, in which statements may be effectively made of the systems presented, and their plans for the future given." A committee of the Department of Religion a committee has been appointed representing all the religious denominations, with which is the Roman Catholic, the Jewish, and many other organizations. The Congress hopes to be able to make a long and significant step forward in the movement towards the unification of popular religion as the bond of a universal brotherhood that is not a movement; not the Golden Rule the basis of the department but the basis of a practical League and the American Sabbath Union the principal actors, to have Sunday closing through about the World's Exposition on Sunday throughout the world. This will make a significant step forward.

A Sabbath bill has again been submitted and a hearing on this bill took place, March 8. At that of last year in that there are not more than half a dozen persons present, on the 8th of March, through the word "Sabbath," is carefully concealed in the bill, the real object of the law is not in "the interests of religion." It will be noticed that while the word "Sabbath" is concealed throughout it admits, also that the exemption clause extends only to those "who conscientiously observe the seventh day."

The following is the text of the bill:

MEMORIAL TO CONGRESS CALLED STREAM BY THE MEMBERS OF THE TWENTY-FOURTH GENERAL ASSEMBLY IN THE STATE OF IOWA.

WHEREAS, the interests of social order, religion, morality, and the public welfare, that better all demand that one day in each week he observed as the Lord's day, as a day of rest. Therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:—

1. It is not lawful for any merchant, tradesman, farmer, artificer, mechanic, workman, laborer, or other person whatsoever, on the Lord's day, to sell or publicly show forth, or expose or offer for sale, or to purchase any goods, chattels, or other personal property, or any real estate whatsoever, or to do or exercise any worldly labor, business, or work of his ordinary calling (conveying travelers or Her Majesty's mail by land or by water, selling drugs and medicines, and other works of necessity and works of charity only excepted).

W. E. CORNELL.
