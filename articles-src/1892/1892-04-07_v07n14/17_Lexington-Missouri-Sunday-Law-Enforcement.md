THE St. Louis Globe-Democrat, of March 21, contains the following special dispatch from Lexington, Missouri:--

In the report of the Grand Jury it was stated that the jurors had agreed individually, and as a body, to notify violators of the Sunday law in their respective towns and neighborhoods, that if they did not desist it would be the duty of the jurors to report them to the next Grand Jury. To-day, for the first Sunday in years, business was almost entirely suspended; drug stores were opened, but the sales were confined to medicines. The restaurants refused to sell cigars, and the lobby of the post-office, which is occupied as a news stand, was not opened until the regular hour for opening the delivery window. Heretofore, clothing and tobacco stores have been opened, but to-day closing was the rule. Speaking of the violation of the Sunday and liquor laws, the Grand Jury says:

"In an official capacity we have been shocked at the corruption of the morality of youth, and heard of the want and misery of the home circles, caused by the use of intoxicating liquors. This crime is appalling, and points with anxious finger to the responsibility of citizenship. In only two instances out of a very large number were we satisfied in indicting. We concluded such crime can only be abated by the citizens combining with the officers of the law to obtain positive evidence to present to grand jurors."

The enforcement of Sunday laws is coming to be the supposed panacea for all social and political ills. But is it true that the cause and cure of these troubles lie no deeper than a mere failure to enforce a religious holiday once a week by civil law?
