THE Christian Statesman has discovered what it is pleased to term "a pious fraud, indeed." The following "ad" which has appeared in several of the leading religious papers is that which has excited its ire:—

The Sabbath Outlook; a 16-page monthly, devoted to Sabbath Reform. Price fifty cents a year. Send for specimen copy, and examine valuable list of premiums. Free to all Reading Rooms. Room 100, Bible House, New York City.

"This notice," says the Statesman, "is a clear case of getting money, and space, and readers through false pretenses."

The trouble is that the Outlook is a Seventh-day Baptist publication, devoted to the advocacy of the Bible Sabbath, the seventh day of the week, the day, which even the Statesman must admit, is in the Scriptures called "the Sabbath."
