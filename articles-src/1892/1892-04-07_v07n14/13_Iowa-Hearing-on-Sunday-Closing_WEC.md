In harmony with the concerted effort put forth in every State Legislature in session this season, the friends of Sunday-closing began almost on the opening day to influence the Iowa Legislature to place itself on record, in some way, as in sympathy with the effort to secure the closing of the World's Fair on Sunday.

As a result the following was offered by Representative Wilson:—

WHEREAS, It has been proposed to open the doors of the Columbian Exposition, in 1893, upon the Sabbath day, contrary to the honorable custom of our Nation and in direct violation of the statutes of the State of Illinois, within the borders of which it is held, and also in violation of the laws of almost every other State in the Union, and

WHEREAS, The preservation of the Sabbath, as a day of rest, is necessary, not only for the well-being of the church, which gives us our prized name of a Christian Nation; but also for the stability of the State, for the physical welfare of the people, and for the preservation of the rights and interests of the workingmen, and

WHEREAS The proposed action would be a long step toward permanent disregard of the Sabbath as a day of rest, therefore,

Be it resolved by the General Assembly of the State of Iowa.

SECTION 1, That we respectfully petition the Commissioners of the Exposition to keep the doors closed upon the first day of the week, commonly called the Sabbath.

SEC. 2, That a copy of these resolutions be sent to the commissioners.

These resolutions and accompanying petitions were referred to a committee of nine members of the Legislature, appointed to consider them.

A hearing was appointed for March 22. The committee were all present. Quite a little time was taken up in transacting routine work before the hearing was reached. A half hour was allotted to A. T. Jones, representing the National Religious Liberty Association, in which time he showed conclusively that the proposed action was wholly beyond the jurisdiction of the Legislature; as according to the first article of the State Constitution, the Iowa Legislature had no right to pass any laws or take any steps that would favor, or in any way interfere with religion; that this same reason applied with equal force to similar action by any State Legislature, for every State Constitution had a like clause, all of which were derived from that clause in the National Constitution, prohibiting Congress from making any law respecting the establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof. Then to make the statements more clear the speaker reviewed the history of that clause, showed how it happened to be placed in the National Constitution and what was the real intent of its framers.

The hearing was cut short before the full development of the points which the speaker designed to get before the committee, but the speech was listened to with apparently much interest and elicited frequent questions, so much so that at one time the chairman rapped on the table and said, "Here, gentlemen, we gave this man a half hour, but we are taking all the time," whereupon one of the members immediately spoke up, "We'll give him more time, then,—we want to know about this matter."

One member asked the question whether he did not think that the interests of the Church demanded legislative action in closing the gates of the Exposition on Sunday? "No, said the speaker, Christ says the gates of hell shall not prevail against the Church, how then can the gates of the Columbian Exposition effect it?" The question was asked whether the commissioners had any right to shut away those who want to go to the Fair on Sunday in response to a petition from those who did not want to go, and the answer was, "Assuredly not." That those who did not care to go could stay away, and those who wanted to go might do so without any interference with those who didn't want to go, for the going or remaining away was wholly an individual matter. Then it was suggested, by one of the committee, that in view of the fact that the Exposition was an international affair not a State or even a national thing, it would certainly be unjust to foreign exhibitors, who do not regard the day as they would thus be required to do, as long as they were in part, at least, contributory to its success.

Another query was raised as to whether or not the seventh-day people were petitioning for the opening of the gates and was replied to that they were not; but that their opposition was to the gates being closed by legislative action, which was wholly on religious grounds; that that was wholly outside the jurisdiction of civil law, as it was contrary to the Constitution of the United States and of every State in the Union. The idea was also developed that to close the gates on Sunday and compel the people to remain away, would not advance the interests of Sabbath-keeping, for if the day was not regarded to the Lord, it was not regarded at all.

A friend of the bill soberly enquired whether it was not right to have laws to compel people to keep the Sabbath, and the answer was that it was not right in any sense; that it was simply to compel religious observance, and the State has no right to enact laws with respect to religion and the enforcement of religious observances. Upon this it was observed by certain of the committee that if the State could not legislate upon religion, then we might as well abolish all our moral laws. Quite a number of other interesting points were brought out, but these are sufficient to show the drift of the minds of the committee.

After the hearing was over several of the members remained to talk further concerning the question. One of them purchased a copy of "Two Republics," and promised to bring it to the notice of other members. Another one said, as we were leaving the room, "That committee has something to think over now that they have never had before." Another one said, "I don't believe that this question of Sunday-closing of the World's Fair will be called up at all at this session now." And in further conversation he said: "The facts are, we have been besieged by the religious element of our constituency to close the capitol building on Sunday, to shut off the Sunday pay of the employees, and to take action against Sunday newspapers, until life is pretty near a burden."

The question of the State appropriation to the World's Fair was called up the following Friday, and passed, but the Sunday clause was left entirely out, and we are also told that the Sunday-rest resolutions and petitions are forever killed; so take it all in all the friends of the National Religious Liberty Association feel that the hearing had its effect and are glad for the effort.
