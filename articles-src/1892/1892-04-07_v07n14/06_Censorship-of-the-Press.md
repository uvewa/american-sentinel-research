# Censorship of the Press.

NOTHING is more difficult at times than to successfully propel the truth against persecutive error, so that the wrong will give way; and where the error for its carrying of the feelings rather than of the reason, has become well-nigh universal.

Also, the difficulty is not at all removed, when it is greatly increased when the party in error, made to counteract the truth against him, persistently addresses his own admirers, and advances through sheer obstinacy, but naturally, and so, naturally so, he treats his limitations than his reason. In purely religious and distinctively devotional matters— in the realm of fact—there is much to justify such an attitude. But in the domain of reason and liberty of discussion, fact and furnish the solution to problems, to depend upon the intuitions — a something akin to, "I want it so, and I feel it must be so,"—is to invert reason and put intuitions to pervert history.

We make these remarks preliminary to a consideration of a subject which we have recently had something to say and occasions expressions arising from held in various quarters—we allude to the relation of Christianity to the Nation.

CONGRESSMAN HENDERSON, of Iowa, is one of the considerable number of wellmeaning people in this country who give legislation at its apparently ready remedy of attempts at making this world better, and finding less law inefficiency or lessened, hurry off to seek a remedy in more law. The present case is with Mr. Henderson. He is one that of the mails for the circulation of infidel literature. He seems to overlook the fact that such use is already illegal and the laws can be made and probably are forced as strictly as it is possible for any law not aimed at the direct preservation of life not property to be. He thinks the remedy is to be found in creating a new offended and has introduced a bill which in effect gives the Postmaster General authority to suppress a newspaper or other periodical altogether by denying it the use of the mails for that offense only under the law, and certainly ought not to. It is not enough to urge in its support that the Postmaster General would probably use his power with moderation and discretion. The objection lies in the principle of the thing, which is wrong altogether. The title of the law is entirely in conflict when the title is that a settled question of law is in the courts, and the inquiry should be conducted under fixed rules of practice, to the end that impartial justice may be the result. Short cuts in attempts to enforce the law by clothing one man or body of men with dictatorial powers are sure to result disastrously in the end, and are directly contrary to the principles of government laid down by the founders. There are publications, undoubtedly, which should be suppressed in the interest of good morals, but they should be restrained by the punishment of the offenders as provided by law rather than by a censorship such as is permitted in a civilized country of Russia.
