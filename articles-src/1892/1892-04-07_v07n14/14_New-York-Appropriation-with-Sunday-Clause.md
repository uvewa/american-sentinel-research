ON March 22, in the New York Legislature, the Senate passed the bill appropriating three hundred thousand dollars for the World's Fair, with a clause prohibiting the opening of the State exhibit on Sunday, just as it came from the Assembly. The text of this clause of the bill reads: "The exhibit of the State of New York at such exhibition shall not be opened to the public on Sunday, and the general managers herein provided for shall take such steps as may be necessary to carry this provision into effect."
