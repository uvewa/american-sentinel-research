THE editor of the Statesman knows that Sunday is in the Bible never called "the Sabbath;" and that it was not by the early Church called by that name; but that for centuries of the Christian era, the term, "the Sabbath" was always and everywhere understood to mean the seventh day, the day now commonly called Saturday. Then how is it that it is a fraud for Seventh-day Baptists, who are laboring to bring all men, or at least all Christians, to again observe the seventh day, to call their work, "Sabbath reform"?

THERE can be but one answer to the question raised in the preceding paragraph, namely, that the editor of the Statesman has dubbed his efforts to force all men to keep Sunday, "Sabbath reform," and that for a purpose; and he wants a monopoly of the name. Wonderful transformation, that while the Bible always and everywhere calls the seventh day "the Sabbath," it is now a fraud to so use the term! There is no possible reason why Seventh-day Baptists should abandon the use of the name Sabbath when speaking of the seventh day, or qualify it in any way whatever. The "fraud, indeed," is all in applying that name to the first day of the week.
