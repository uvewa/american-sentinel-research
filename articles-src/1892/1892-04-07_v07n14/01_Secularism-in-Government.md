SECULARISM in government is not, as some have supposed, akin to infidelity, but is, on the contrary, perfectly in harmony with the gospel of Christ.

God in the beginning created man a free moral agent; as it has been beautifully expressed:

"God doth ne'er compel our spirits
All may choose the good or ill.
'Tis the willing heart he loveth, but
He never chained the will."

Neither has he commissioned men, either in their individual or aggregate capacity to compel by physical force obedience to the divine law. His word is, "Choose ye whom ye will serve."

In the very nature of the case man can not administer the divine law, for he "judgeth by the outward appearance;" while "God looketh upon the heart." The divine law is a "discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart," and the Judge who administers it must be able to read the most secret thoughts of the soul and weigh in the scales of perfect justice the motives, which are the mainspring of action. The folly of man in attempting to administer the law of God is equalled only by his wickedness in usurping a prerogative of the Author of that law.

As man was in the beginning left free to choose or to refuse the service of God, so now God would have him to be free. The Lord orders no drafts for his army. His soldiers are not slaves, but the Lord's free men. They serve not from fear, but love; not from constraint, but of a willing mind; and to make it otherwise, if that were possible, would be to thwart the purpose of God and defeat his plan, which is to people this sphere with created intelligencies, every individual of whom has, of his own free will, chosen the service of the King of kings. National Reformers should beware of presuming to stay the ark of God's immutable purpose.
