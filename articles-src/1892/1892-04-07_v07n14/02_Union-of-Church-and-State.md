HOWEVER pure and disinterested the motives of National Reformers, and others who are demanding religious legislation may be, the fact can not be denied that in all the past the union of Church and State has resulted most disastrously to both. Such a union is contrary to nature. The contracting parties are of different species.

But it is denied that anybody seeks a union of Church and State; we demand, they say, only a union of religion and the State. This is, however, only a distinction without a difference. Churches, or sects, crystallize around certain articles of faith; and the Church, that is the whole body of believers, is simply a larger crystallization around those articles of faith held in common by the various sects of Christians. To unite the State with the whole body is not less, but rather more, a union of Church and State than to unite it with a part of that body, a sect, or denomination, merely.

When Constantine made Christianity the religion of the Roman Empire, he only united religion and the State; but out of it grew naturally and necessarily a State Church. When Christianity had been made the religion of the empire it became necessary to secure an authoritative definition, or statement, of what constituted Christianity; hence the council of Nicea and the Nicene creed. Christianity, or religion, as a sentiment locked in the bosom of individuals, can not be united with the State; it must and will, sooner or later, if fostered by the State, resolve itself into a creed, and a State Church will crystallize around that creed. It has been so in the past, and history repeats itself.
