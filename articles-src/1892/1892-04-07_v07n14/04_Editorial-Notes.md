THIS discussion of the educational measures before the German Parliament shows that in that country the accepted religion of the State is politics. The late differences between France and the Vatican show, also, by the manner in which the questions at dispute have been taken up, that not only is "the religious question rapidly coming to the front in French politics," but that also religion in politics France. This has always been true, only in varying degree; and in proportion to the degree in which it has been true has the history of France been filled with events resembling Samaria in their inhumanly and bloody terror. The religion of politics, and the politics of religion, is Jesus Christ in France.

The religion of the Vatican is the religion of politics, and there is it ever more true that any where else in the world, not even excepting Constantinople or the mired of the action of the Afar and desert, that religion is politics. From out the Vatican political religion has poured for generations, like burning lava from it means fervently the convulsion into politics throughout the whole earth. There is no country or people of the world that has not felt its seething influence. The very names, "Rome," and "The Vatican," have become synonymous with political religion. The religion of politics, and the politics of religion.

COLONEL SHEPARD'S editorial says of the religion of the Vatican in this country, "It has allied itself with the Democratic Party and it is even now the ruling Party in New York, the Middle, the Western, and the North Western States. It has taken possession of the city governments of Boston, New York, Chicago, New Orleans, Troy, Detroit, Buffalo, and many another. It keeps just enough of its adherents in the Republican Party to weaken their counsels and mask their designs. But it is noticeable that whenever the interests of the Roman Catholic Church clash with those of the Republican Party, all those Roman Republicans always vote for their own country, like. . . . In its times every patrol should have the Democrat's Party and unite against the Romans. They are still a minority. The majority can stop their giving money and property, stop their alteration of our school books to suit anti-American and papal superstitions, stop their holding public office that subjecting the State to govern the Church, stop their growth, and preserve our liberties. *Rome delenda est.*"

Yes, "Rome must be destroyed," for that must is in the eternal purposes of God, and not in the political majority have called upon to destroy it by stopping the appropriation of money for its behalf, depriving Roman Catholics of their right to hold public office, and stopping the grants of the Church by an edict of the majority. Destruction must come upon Rome, but it must come also from all political religion. Those who cry that the majority must stop the Roman Catholics "subjecting the State to their church" in order that the majority may subject it instead to their church, will in the end meet with the same confusion, for the same reason, and by the same divine hand, as part of the same mystery of iniquity.
