# That Breckinridge Sunday Bill Again.

THE Breckinridge Sunday bill, now before Congress for the second time, the use of any designation, or name, for Sunday, that could mark the measure as religious, is studiously avoided; but such a character is indelibly stamped upon the bill by the use of the word "secular," which is not consistent with secular or spiritual or holy. The bill provides—

That it shall be unlawful for any person or persons or corporation, or for any employee of any person or corporation in the District of Columbia, to perform any secular labor or business, or to cause the same to be performed by any person in their employment on Sunday, except works of necessity or mercy.

"Secular" is defined thus by Webster: "of or pertaining to this present world, or to things not spiritual or holy; relating to temporal as distinguished from eternal interests; not immediately or primarily religious." Not used in this secondary, worldly sense. The bill would mean precisely the same thing if, instead of prohibiting "secular labor or business," on Sunday, it prohibited all labor or business "of, or pertaining to this present world," or to things not spiritual or holy." That is just what it means in its results, but it is not so plain to be seen as it would be were the definition of the word "secular" made a part of the bill.

Were this bill to become a law, it would give the civil courts of the District of Columbia jurisdiction to decide what is secular, to permit "secular interests" for a day. Now the pursuit of secular affairs on Sunday, is just as distinctly secular spiritual pursuits, for it is impossible for human beings to be absolutely idle. A day, to do, by excluding everything secular, this bill proposes to give spiritual a monopoly of Sunday. Hence, should the bill become a law, the courts would of necessity have to adjudicate between secular and spiritual things; for which the only source of authority or any court or body that would, by the passage of the Breckinridge Sunday bill, be made judges of the conscience of their fellow men.

That is true also of another feature of this bill, namely, of the clause which says—

the provisions of this act shall not be construed to apply to any person or persons who conscientiously believe in and observe any other day of the week than Sunday as a day of rest.

We gravely issue those "conscientiously believe in and observe another day of the week than Sunday as a day of rest?" If read all that is stated in the bill not exempt from the operation all who must upon any other day of the week than Sunday, whether they conscientiously believe in it or not? Why introduce this element of conscientious belief at all? Simply because that while a law, such as this bill would be if the test of "conscientiously believe in" were omitted, would secure to every one, if enforced, a purely civil rest day, it would not secure general and uniform expressions of religious labor and business on Sunday; and that is what the bill is for. It singles out that particular day, and requires all to rest upon it, *except the few who* "conscientiously believe in and keep" "another" day. If then, any question arises as to who are conscientiously entitled to exemption, the civil courts sit in judgment upon the conscientious convictions of those who claim the exemption. How they are to determine the secret thoughts of the heart (without knowing which they can know nothing of the consciences), is left for the friends of the bill to explain. Under the Inquisition such information was extorted by the rack and the thumbscrew; and it is doubtful if, even the nineteenth century could devise anything much more effective to the same end.

The fact is the exemption of "those who conscientiously believe in and observe any other day of the week than Sunday," marks this bill as a religious measure. Men conscientiously believe in and practice moral or religious duties. Apart from religious obligation, a man would have to be more circumspect in resting regularly, than in bathing at stated intervals; or in taking just so many hours' sleep each night. He were determined that nobody can deny is a weekly rest somewhat a matter of personal convenience, just as people do eating, sleeping, bathing, etc. But this proposed law for the District of Columbia, contemplates more than this; it proposes to quite of all not allot the conscientious observance of some day other than Sunday, or such an outward observance of Sunday as is intended by enforced idleness, would indicate conscientious regard for that day. The bill is wholly and dangerously in the interests of the Sunday sacred day, and would never have been thought of had it not been for the regard which that day is had by many. It should be debated as a mostly useful and fitting rebuke to those misguided religionists, who for their own base religious objects, have repeatedly regenerated and made moral by act of Congress.
