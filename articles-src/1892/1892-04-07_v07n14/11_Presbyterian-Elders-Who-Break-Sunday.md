J. M. FOSTER, Secretary of the National Reform Association, writing from Richmond, Indiana, draws a dark picture of the disregard of Christians for Sunday, and of "Presbyterian Elders" who travel with "Masonic excursions" on that day. To correct these evils and make these Christians better, Mr. Foster declares that there is need of a strict Sunday law, the aim of which shall be—to protect the employer against himself. He is often so covetous that he will sin against his own conscience to gain the time of the Sabbath. The superintendent of a leading house in Cincinnati, in order to have his goods arranged for their opening day in a new house, said to those under his direction: "I am a member of the church. I respect any one's scruples. But those who have no conscientious objection to working on the Sabbath will come and help me to morrow. The rest must work Saturday night." That man needs a Sabbath law to protect himself. He has not conscience enough to do it.

What a proposition; create religious conscience for Presbyterian elders, and other church members, by civil law! Think of this scene at the Judgment Seat of Christ: DIALOGUE. Judge.—Why did you disregard Sunday while on earth? Culprit.—Because the civil law of Indiana did not compel me, and create in me a heart clean enough to keep the "Lord's-day holy."—What a travesty!
