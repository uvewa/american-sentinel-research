THE METHOD indicated in the preceding paragraph would be legitimate, were all the "arguments" legitimate and consistent; but unfortunately they are not. For instance when Mr. Crafts exhibits his oriental saw, saying, as he has many times said, that it "was such a saw that Christ used to lay down at the close of his week's work on Saturday evening," he is perpetrating upon his audience not a "pious," but an impious fraud, and he knows it. Therefore the present editor of the Christian Statesman is the last man that should talk about pious frauds. The Sabbath Outlook is not guilty of such frauds, while its accuser is.
