PROBABLY Dr. McArthur would answer that he favors Sunday laws only in the interests of good morals (morals in the common acceptation of the word) and social order. But that is the same argument (?) precisely that has in all the past been used to justify the very measures against which the Doctor inveighs. The apostles, and even Christ himself, were accused of creating social disorder, raising an uproar, forbidding to give tribute unto Caesar, etc.; and similar charges have been brought against "heretics" from that day to this. Religious laws have always been justified (?) by civil reasons. Unless Baptists are prepared to abandon the principles for which they have stood in the past, they must separate from such organizations as the American Sabbath Union. It is opposed to that liberty for which Baptists have died.
