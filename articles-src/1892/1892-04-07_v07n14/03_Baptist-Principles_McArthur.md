Or the Baptists, Rev. Dr. McArthur, of this city, himself a Baptist, says:

They affirmed that only when a man personally made a profession of faith, did he become rightfully a member of the church; and they stoutly affirmed the separation between the ecclesiastical body and the civil community. They have ever stood for the separation between Church and State. When this doctrine is denied, and baptismal regeneration is affirmed, it is logical for the civil power to attempt to make men Christian. If baptizing a person would change his spiritual nature and his relations to God, all that is necessary to make a nation Christian is to compel the people to be baptized. . . This doctrine led to the thumb-screw and the fagot. But Baptists have ever affirmed that a man could become a Christian only by the voluntary action of his own spiritual nature, that religion was a matter between the man and his God, and that the civil magistrate, because he could not reach the heart, had no duty to perform in making men Christians by outward observances. Baptists did not abstain from persecution simply because of pity for the persecuted, nor for lack of religious zeal, but they were restrained by logical deductions, because they affirmed that becoming a Christian was a spiritual act, and not one which outward force could compel.

'Tis passing strange that a man can state so clearly such sound principles and not be able to apply them to current events. Dr. McArthur is a vice-president of the American Sabbath Union, and in favor of enforced Sunday observance. How can he fail to see his own inconsistency?
