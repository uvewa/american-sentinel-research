Nothing is more difficult at times than to successfully project the truth against preconceived error, so that the wrong will give way. And where the error is the offspring of the feelings rather than of reason, the task becomes well-nigh impossible. And the difficulty is not at all lessened but is greatly increased when the party in error, unable to controvert the proof brought against him, persistently adheres to his own opinion, not always through sheer obstinacy, but because, and naturally so, he trusts his intuitions more than his reason. In purely religious and distinctively devotional matters—as in the realm of faith—there is much to justify such an attitude. But in the domain where reason and history determine fact and furnish the solution to problems, to depend upon the intuitions,—a something akin to, "I want it so, and I feel it must be so,"—is to subvert reason and and oftentimes to pervert history.

We make these remarks preliminary to a consideration of a subject upon which we have recently had something to say and concerning which erroneous views are held in various quarters;—we allude to the relation of Christianity to the Nation. It has been affirmed, (1) that Christianity is the common law of the land, and (2) we have recently, and for the first time, met with the proposition that Christianity is part of the constitutional law of the land. Let us consider these propositions.

1. In support of the proposition that Christianity is the common law of the land, it is said (a) that Webster took this position in the famous Girard will case; and (b) that the country was settled and founded by Christian men whose religion became the common law. In reply to this we have to say:—

(a) Webster's deliverance was that of an attorney for the contestants of the will; and he claimed that the clause prohibiting clergymen from entering the college buildings was unconstitutional. The United States Supreme Court held the clause to be constitutional and sustained the will. Webster's tentative position, therefore, fell to the ground. There is nothing in all Webster's speeches and pleas, as a jurist familiar with them tells us, where the position is ever advanced a second time.

(b) It is claimed that the country was settled and founded by Christian men whose religion became the common law of the land. To this the reply is (1) that the States were settled separately and by different nationalities, each supreme in its own sphere, and that there was no law common to them all, nor from the nature of the case could be; that Massachusetts and Connecticut made Congregationalism the established law of those States; that Virginia made Episcopacy the law of the State; that New York made no law on the subject; evidently the practices of the States differed; and not only so, but they differed as to the meaning of the term "Christian"; for the Baptists and Friends were driven out of one State; what kind of Christianity was that, and how could it to-day be the common law of the land, which denied recognition to two branches of the Church of Christ?

Again, (2) to the claim that Christianity is the common law of the land, we reply that the courts have decided otherwise, e. g., the Supreme Court of Ohio has expressly declared that "neither Christianity nor any other system of religion is a part of the law of the State." This decision was reaffirmed afterwards; and still after the same Court said, "If Christianity is a law of the State, like every law, it must have a sanction; adequate penalties must be provided. . . . No one seriously contends for any such doctrine in this country, or I might almost say in this age of the world." (23 Ohio State Reports.) Again, Judge Welch, of the Ohio Supreme Court, said that the teaching of the Christian religion in the public schools "violates the spirit of our constitutional guarantees"; that "if we have no right to tax the citizen to support worship, we have no right to tax him to support religious instruction." (Granger O. S. R. 250, Board of Education vs. Miner et al.)

And Chief Justice Cooley, of Michigan, declares, "all support of religious instruction must be entirely voluntary." What kind of common law is that which can only be enforced by voluntary agreement and not at all by process of law?

Still further, the Supreme Court of Maine, as we mentioned recently, has decided that "Christianity as a system is unknown to our laws." (Maine R. 38 p. 379.) To this we could add decisions from other States, but these must suffice. And here the question naturally arises, how can Christianity be the common law of the land when some States distinctly repudiate it? To this the reply is made that "a State can not nullify or prescribe matters within the domain of the whole Nation." The obvious rejoinder to this is the Xth Article of the Constitution, which declares that "the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution nor prohibited by it to the States are reserved to the States respectively or to the people." Now the Constitution not only has not delegated to Congress the power to enforce Christianity as a national religion based on common law, but in the First Amendment it explicitly prohibits Congress from making any law "respecting an establishment of religion." The matter, therefore, under the Xth Article of the Constitution, already cited, is relegated to the States, who may declare, as States have authoritatively declared themselves upon the matter, some making the Christian religion part of the common law of the State,—as Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, and Connecticut,—others declaring Christianity to be no part of the law of the State,—as Maine and Ohio. Obviously, that which is not common law of all the States is not common law of the whole country.

2. To the proposition that Christianity is part of the constitutional law of the land, we reply, the Constitution is directly against the proposition. First, we have the declaration of the Constitution itself in the First Amendment, denying to Congress the right "to make any law respecting the establishment of religion." Think of Congress being prohibited from enforcing the common law of the land! Yet such would be the absurd situation were Christianity part of the common law. Again, the negative evidence points to the same conclusion; for we find no mention of God in the Constitution—not even in the oath required of the President.

Does this make the Constitution atheistic? Not at all. To be an atheist is to explicitly deny the existence of God, as to be a theist is to affirm his existence. The Constitution neither affirms nor denies the existence of God, and is consequently neither theistic nor atheistic; it is a purely secular instrument.

Lastly, the historical evidence sustains the proposition that Christianity is not the law of the land. In support of this we reproduce one citation from the XIth Article of the treaty with Tripoli, which contains the declaration, "As the Government of the United States is not in any sense founded on the Christian religion . . . it has no enmity against Mussulmans," etc. This affirmation was made by Washington, then President, and his Cabinet—in which were Jefferson and Hamilton—and by the United States Senate, many of whose members assisted in founding the Government and participated in formulating its Constitution. And is it conceivable that such a declaration if false would have passed that illustrious body, our first United States Senate, unchallenged, if it asserted what was not true?—or are we to suppose that Washington and Jefferson, and Hamilton, and Madison, and Adams, and Lee, and Morris, and Ellsworth, and the other illustrious men of those days, did not know whether or not the Government they were instrumental in establishing was founded on the Christian religion?

To sum up the whole matter; against the proposition that Christianity is the common law of the whole country, we have cited the decision of the Supreme Court on the Girard will case; the history of the formation of the States; the decision of the Supreme Courts of Ohio and Maine, and the opinion of Chief Justice Cooley, of Michigan. And lastly, we have drawn testimony from the Constitution itself to show that under its terms no religion can be the common law of the land, while both positively and negatively the evidence is conclusive that Christianity is no part of that which affirms itself to be "the supreme law of the land," and hence can not be part of our constitutional law. This brings us back to the position announced in a recent issue of this journal—that we are not a Christian Nation; that we are a Christian people. And we add that so long as Christianity is inwrought in the hearts and consciences of the people, it is of no concern whether it be in our statutory or common law or not. Putting it there would make us no better; because it is not there, we are none the worse; for it still holds true that error may well be given full liberty where truth is left free to combat it.
