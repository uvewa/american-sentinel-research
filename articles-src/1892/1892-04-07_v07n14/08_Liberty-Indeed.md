"CHRISTIANITY and Patriotism," is the title of an impassioned article in the Christian Statesman, of March 12, in which the question is asked: "Who were the Puritans and Pilgrim fathers that their names should be cherished and held sacred?" The answer given is: "They were the seed of truth, sifted out from superstition by bitter persecution, with which Almighty God planted the New World to preserve civil and religious liberty among men."

And how did the Puritans preserve civil and religious liberty? What are the facts concerning them?—No sooner was the Government of the Colony of Massachusetts organized than a church was established after the Congregational order, and everybody was required to conform to that mode of worship. Two men, however, Samuel and John Browne, adhered to the worship of the Church of England, and argued that the worship of the Colony ought to be according to the ritual of that Church. The Puritans replied: "We came away from the common prayer and ceremonies in our native land, where we suffered much for non-conformity; in this place of liberty we can not, we will not, use them." And not only so, but they were determined that nobody else in Massachusetts should use them, and so the Brownes were banished from that "place of liberty," and sent back to England. Massachusetts was a place of liberty for Puritans only.

But the banishment of the Brownes was only the beginning; in 1631 a law was enacted as follows:—

To the end this body of the commons may be preserved of honest and good men, it is ordered and agreed that, for the time to come, no man shall be admitted to the freedom of this body politic but such as are members of some of the churches within the limits of the same.

"Some of the churches within the limits of the same," meant simply, some of the congregations of the Congregational order, for that was the established church of the Colony and none other was tolerated.

A. D. 1631 witnessed the arrival of Roger Williams in Boston. He was at once called to the pastorate of the church at Salem, left vacant by the death of Francis Higginson; but Governor Winthrop objected and Williams went to Plymouth. Subsequently, however, he accepted the pastorate of the Salem church, and then began a contest which ended in 1635 by a decree of the general court banishing him from the Colony. It was the purpose of his enemies to send him back to England, but being apprised of their design he fled in the dead of winter to Rhode Island, and found refuge among the Indians.

Late in 1637, John Wheelright, a Boston preacher, was banished for saying that it maketh no matter how seemingly holy men be according to the law, if . . . they are such as trust to their own righteousness they shall die, saith the Lord. Do ye not after their works; for they say and do not. "They make broad their phy-lacteries, and enlarge the borders of their garments, and love the uppermost rooms at feasts, and the chief seats in the synagogues, and greetings in the markets, and to be called of men, Rabbi, Rabbi." But believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and ye shall be saved, for being justified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.

As in the case of Roger Williams, Wheelright was driven out in the rigors of a New England winter.

In 1637 Mrs. Anne Hutchinson was banished for the heinous offense of agreeing with Wheelright. The court which "tried" Mrs. Hutchinson was a miniature Inquisition, before which she was repeatedly dragged for examination. "All this time," says Adams in "Charters and Constitutions," "she had been alone; her friends were far away. That no circumstance of horror might be lost, she and one of her most devoted followers, Mary Dyer, were nearing their confinements during this time of misery. Both cases ended in misfortune over whose sickening details Thomas Welde and his reverend brethren gloated with a savage joy, declaring that 'God himself was pleased to step in with his casting vote . . . as clearly as if he had pointed with his finger.' Let posterity draw a veil over the shocking scene." This persecuted woman also found an asylum in Rhode Island, where she and friends were given a home by the Indians.

These outrages against both civil and religious liberty, were followed shortly by bitter persecution of Baptists. In 1644, the general court of the Colony of Massachusetts ordered and agreed that if any person or persons, within this jurisdiction, shall either openly condemn or oppose the baptizing of infants, or go about secretly to seduce others from the approbation or use thereof, and shall appear to the court willfully and obstinately to continue therein, after due time and means of conviction, every such person or persons shall be sentenced to banishment.

It will be observed that the penalty provided by this law was banishment, but in 1646, a Baptist named Painter was sentenced under it to be whipped for refusing to have his child sprinkled. The sentence was carried out to the letter. A few years later, namely, in 1651, three Baptist ministers from Rhode Island, temporarily in Massachusetts visiting an aged Baptist were arrested while holding a private service on Sunday, and were compelled to attend worship at the parish church. They were subsequently tried, and were sentenced to pay fines varying from five to thirty pounds. One of these men, Elder Holmes, refused to pay his fine and was most brutally whipped. Two men who witnessed the whipping shook hands with Holmes, for which they were sentenced to pay a fine of forty shillings each or else receive a whipping. The fines were paid by friends.

As might be supposed, cases of persecution for conscience' sake increased in number until it finally culminated in the brutal whipping of women, and the hanging of Quakers and witches. These facts give us some faint idea of the National Reform conception of "liberty;" and should warn the American people not to trust their liberties in the hands of men who are so blinded by bigotry as to imagine that the Puritans were "the seeds of truth" "with which Almighty God planted the New World to preserve civil and religious liberty." The only thing that can equal this in absurdity is the claim sometimes put forth by Papists, that the Roman Catholic Church is the bulwark of liberty. Instead of the name and memory of the Puritans being "cherished and held sacred," Americans should blush for their wicked deeds of intolerance; and warned by the evil which they did in the name of religion, should see to it that such power be forever kept out of the hands of those who, like the editor of the Statesman, sigh for "a breath of the Puritans."
