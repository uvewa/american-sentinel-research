# "Reform."

The desire to "reform" something or somebody seems to be one of the predominating features of this generation. The *Fremont Advocate,* in its issue of February 4, contains an article, entitled "Reform," from which I clip the following:—

> "Reform" has become a word that every self-seeking demagogue has at his tongue's end, and the word will be used so frequently that in the future, when a genuine reformer has something to advocate, his hearers and the press will "set him down" as a "bat" or "crank," and pass him by. And just so with the word "reform" in religious nomenclature. In the future when honest men of strong conviction in "reform" shall be in a minority in the political arena, the cry of "reform" will carry no weight with the people.

But the pulpit and the religion press are aiding by sermons and announcements through the land, cause a mighty cry for "reform."

And no doubt it is needed. But the trouble is not only if it is needed. But the trouble is not that they are not in want of reformers it is that they are not content with a "reform all of reform" for themselves, but soon forget themselves and with intense desire to rein everybody else up to their standard.

—*Fremont, Neb., Wav.*
