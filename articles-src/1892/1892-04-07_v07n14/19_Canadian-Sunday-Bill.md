A SUNDAY bill has again been submitted to the Canadian Parliament. The present bill differs from that of last year in that there are not more than half as many provisions as in the previous bill. Although the word "Sabbath" is carefully omitted the preamble distinctly declares the measure to be in the "interests of religion." It will be noticed that where penalties are affixed one half goes to the informant, also that the exemption clause extends only to "the people called Indians."

The following is the text of the bill:--

AN ACT
TO SECURE THE BETTER OBSERVANCE OF THE LORD'S
DAY, COMMOSLY CALLED SUNDAY.

WHEREAS it is desirable, in the interests of religion, morality, and the public welfare, that better provision be made for securing the observance of the first day of the week, hereinafter called the Lord's day, as a day of rest; Therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:

1. Whoever shall on the Lord's day, either as proprietor, publisher, or manager, engage in the printing, publication, or delivery of a newspaper, journal, or periodical, and whoever shall on the Lord's day engage in the sale, distribution, or circulation of any newspaper, journal, or periodical printing published on that day, shall be deemed to be guilty of a misdemeanor; provided, however, that necessary office work may be performed after nine o'clock in the evening of the Lord's day, for the purpose of facilitating the publication of the Monday morning issue of any daily newspaper.

2. No canal belonging to Canada shall be open for traffic or business on the Lord's day, between the hours of six in the morning and ten in the evening; but this provision may be set aside by Order in Council after the fifteenth day of October in each year.

3. Any railway superintendent, traffic manager, or person, by virtue of whose authority and command railway cars or trains are on the Lord's day loaded at any railway station in Canada, or despatched from such station when loaded, or permitted to continue a journey (except in the case of live stock and perishable goods) with Canadian local freight,—or any person, as aforesaid, who directs local passenger trains to be run on the Lord's day (except one milk train on each road, and such special trains as are necessary for the purpose of conveying medical aid and means of relief in cases of accident, or to persons injured or afflicted with sickness, or of conveying persons to visit dying relations, or for the purpose of conveying the means for extinguishing fire to places requiring such assistance, or for other acts of necessity and mercy), or directs empty cars to be moved from station to station within the territory of Canada,—shall be deemed to be guilty of a misdemeanor; but through passenger trains each way, with their necessary connections, shall be permitted on any trunk line of Canada.

At such time as the laws of the United States shall make corresponding provision, no through freight in transit from one point on the frontier of the United States to some other point on the said frontier, shall be allowed to pass over Canadian roads on the Lord's day, except live stock and perishable goods.

4. Excursions on the Lord's day by steamboats plying for hire, or by railway, or in part by steamboat and in part by railway, and having for their only or principal object the carriage of passengers for amusement or pleasure, and to go and return the same day by the same steamboat or railway or any other owned by the same person or company, shall not be deemed a lawful conveying of passengers within the meaning of this Act; and the owner, superintendent, or person, by virtue of whose authority and direction such excursion is permitted or ordered on the Lord's day, shall be deemed to be guilty of a misdemeanor; Providing that nothing in this section shall be deemed to prohibit the ordinary carriage of passengers authorized by provincial statute.

5. Any person guilty of any offense declared in section one of this Act to be a misdemeanor, shall, on summary conviction, be liable to a fine not exceeding fifty dollars for the first offense, and not exceeding one hundred dollars for each subsequent offense, together with the costs,—and in default of immediate payment of such fine and costs, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding—months.

6. Any person guilty of any offense declared in sections three and four of this Act to be a misdemeanor, shall, on summary conviction, be liable to a fine not exceeding one hundred dollars for the first offense, and not exceeding two hundred dollars for each subsequent offense, together with the costs,—and in default of immediate payment of such fine and costs, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding—months.

7. All sums of money awarded or imposed as fines or penalties by virtue of this Act shall be paid as follows, that is to say: one moiety thereof shall be paid to the party charging and prosecuting the offense, and the other moiety to the treasurer of the county or city wherein the offense was committed, to be by him accounted for in the same manner as other moneys deposited with, or paid over to him.

8. No prosecution under this Act shall be commenced unless within one month after the commission of the offense charged.

9. This Act shall not extend to the people called Indians, when it conflicts with their tribal customs or rights.
