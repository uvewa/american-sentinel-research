The desire to "reform" something or somebody seems to be one of the predominating features of this generation. The Journal of Education, in its issue of February 11, contains an article, entitled "Reforms," from which I clip the following:—

Reform has become a "fad." It is the rankest kind of a "fad" educationally. . . . And yet the reform craze has not fairly begun. It is in its infancy. Wait, just wait until it gets its growth, and see what will come. Why, it will take a Gatling gun to rattle off the reforms as fast as they are invented!

And the beauty of it is that every man can not only have a reform all his own, but he can have a whole set of reforms for himself. There will be enough to go round with several left over. America is a great country. . . . It is a great thing to live in this day and be a part of the "age," which future geologists will style the "Period of Reforms, Reforming Reformations." In ancient times it required ages to make fossils, now a fossil is made in twenty-four hours if he refrains so long from reforming something.

If the idea of "reform" has become a "fad" in educational matters, it certainly has in religious.

From the pulpit and the religious press aided by numerous associations throughout the land, comes a mighty cry for reform. And no doubt it is needed. But the trouble with many of these would-be-reformers is that they are not content with a "whole set of reforms" for themselves, but seem impregnated with an intense desire to rein everybody else up to their standard of thinking and acting.

Fremont, Nebr.
