SECULAR government is not, as many supposed, asking to be, indifferently, but is, on the contrary, perfectly in harmony with the gospel of Christ.

God in the beginning created man a free moral agent; as it has been beautifully expressed,—

"God doth not compel our spirits any more,

As the willing heart is free to choose, so must it be with man."

Neither has he commissioned men, either in their individual or aggregate capacity to compel by physical force obedience to the divine law. His word is, "Whosoever *will*, let him come."

In the very nature of the case men can not administer the divine law, for he is "judged by the outward appearance" but "God looketh upon the heart." The divine law is a "discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart;" and the judge who administers it must be able to read the most secret thoughts of the soul and weigh in the scales of perfect justice the motives, which are the mainspring of actions. The folly of man in attempting to administer the law of God is equalled only by his wickedness in usurping the prerogative of the Author of that law.

As man was in the beginning left free to choose or to refuse the service of God, so now God would have him to be free. The Lord orders no drafts for his army. His soldiers are not slaves, but the Lord's free men. They start not from fear, but serve and obey from love.

God created man with a free, intelligent mind; and to make it otherwise, if that were possible, would be to thwart the purpose of God and defeat his plan, which is to people this sphere with created intelligences, every individual of whom has, of his own free will, chosen the service of the King of kings. National Reformers should beware of presuming to stay the ark of God's immutable plan.

However pure and disinterested the motives of National Reformers, and others who are demanding religious legislation might be, the facts are not to be denied that in all the past the union of Church and State has wrought most disastrously to both. Such a union is contrary to nature. The contracting parties are of different species.

BUT it is denied that anybody seeks a union of Church and State; we demand, they say, only a union of religion and the State. This is, however, only a distinction without a difference. Churches, or sects, crystallize around certain articles of faith; and the Church, that is the whole by whatever name it is known, is a body of beliefs in certain propositions of doctrine held in common by the various sects of Christians. To unite the State with the whole body is not less, but rather more, a union of church and State than to unite it with a part of that body, a sect, or denomination, merely.

A WARDNER made this argument: "As the religion of the Roman Empire, he only united religion and the State; but out of it grew naturally and necessarily a State Church. When Christianity had been made the religion of the empire it became necessary to secure an authoritative definition, or statement, of what constituted Christianity; hence the council of Nice, and the Nicene creed. Christianity, or religion, as a sentiment locked in the bosom of individuals, can not be united with the State; it must, and will, sooner or later, if fostered by the State, Church will crystallize around that creed. It has been so in the past, and history repeats itself."

Or the Baptists. Rev. Dr. McArthur, of this city, himself a Baptist, says:—

They affirmed that only when a man personally made a profession of faith, did he become rightfully a member of the church, and they most earnestly affirmed the separation between the ecclesiastical body and the civil community. They have ever stood for the separation between Church and State. When this doctrine is denied, and baptismal regeneration is affirmed, it is logical for the civil power to attempt to make men Christians. If baptizing a person makes him a Christian, then the civil power is justified, so that it is necessary to make a person a Christian; it is necessary for the people to be baptized. This doctrine led to the first union of church and state. Dr. Baptist has ever affirmed that a man could become a Christian only by the voluntary action of his own spiritual nature; that religion was a matter between the man and his God, and that the civil magistracy, that the State, could not reach the heart, had no duty to perform in making men Christians; he contended moreover, Baptists did not abstain from persecution simply because of pity for the persecuted, nor for lack of religious zeal, but they were restrained by explicit declarations, because they affirmed that the becoming a Christian was a voluntary act.

"A passing stranger who had a man can state so clearly such sound principles and be able to apply them to current events." Dr. McArthur is a vice-president of the American Sabbath Church, and in favor of enforced Sunday observance. How can he fail to see his own inconsistency?

PROBABLY Dr. McArthur would answer that he favors Sunday laws only in the interests of good morals (morals in the common acceptation of the word) or the social order. But that is the same argument (?) precisely that has all the past been used to justify the very things against which his Doctor inveighs. The apostles, and even Christ himself, were accused of creating disorder, disturbing the social order, breaking established rules, raising an uproar, forbidding to give tribute unto Caesar, etc.; and similar charges have been made against dissenters in all ages.
