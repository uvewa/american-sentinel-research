## DECLARATION OF PRINCIPLES.

We believe in the religion of the Bible.

We believe in the God of the Bible and his right to command and receive worship.

We believe in the separation of Church and State, by which we mean the total disconnection of religion and the civil government, and national, State, and municipal, in all their relations.

We believe that no act of any civil government in legislature or in adjudication is rightful which has respect to any particular religious creed, preference, or denomination.

We believe it is the inalienable right of every man, to worship according to the dictates of his own conscience, free from all civil interference of every kind and degree.

We hold it to be a violation of religious freedom and of the right of conscience, for any civil government to impose or enforce religious observances.
