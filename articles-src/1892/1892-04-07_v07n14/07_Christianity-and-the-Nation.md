# Christianity and the Nation.

And Chief Justice Cooley, of Michigan, declares, "all support of religious instruction must be entirely voluntary." What amount of common law is that which no one can find or establish by written agreement and not at all by present act of law?

Still further, the Supreme Court of Massachusetts, we are instructed recently, has decided a case, in terms as plain as possible, unknown to our laws." (Maine R. 38: 9.)

To this we could add decisions from other States, but these must suffice. And these few quotients naturally attest, one can Christianity is the common law of the land when some State distinctly republishes it? To this the reply is made that "a State can not nullify or prescribe truth on the domain of thought for the Nation." The obvious rejoinder to this is the Xth Article of the Constitution, which declares that "the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution nor prohibited by it to the States respectively, or to the people." Nor can the contrary be truly said that what is not delegated to Congress the power to enforce Christianity as a national religion based on common law, but a title First Amendment is explicitly prohibits Congress from making a law in any way for an establishment of religion. The situation, therefore, under the law and Constitution of the United States, is simply this: the Constitution, already said, is relegated to the States, who may declare, as Massachusetts and Connecticut long since have and characteristically declared themselves, that having settled the matter, they have taken from the religious part of the common law of the State—as Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Connecticut only—"Christianity" is the law.

Christianity to be no part of the law of either State or of the Nation; and the fact remains, which is not common law as the law of the State is not common law of the whole country.

To the proposition that Christianity is a part of constitutional law of the land; we reply, the Constitution, as distinctly warned the proposition. First, we have the declaration of the Constitution, in the First Amendment, denying to Congress the right "to make any law respecting the establishment of religion." Think of Congress being prohibited from enforcing the common law of the land! What would be the absurd situation, were Christianity part of the common law; there, the negative explicitly points to this one constitution; for we find no mention at all of Christianity any where else in the oath required of the President.

Does the state the Constitution at last State? Not at all. To be an atheist is to explicitly deny the existence of God, as to a theist is to affirm his existence. The Constitution neither affirms nor denies the existence of God, and is consequently neither theistic nor atheistic; it is a purely secular instrument.

Lastly, the *Astorical* evidences sustain the proposition that Christianity is not the law of the land. It is impossible that

we reproduce one citation from the Xth Article of the treaty with Tripoli, which contains the declaration, "*As the Government of the United States is not in any sense founded on the Christian religion*," it has no enmity against the laws, religion of Mussulmen." This affirmation was made by Washington, then President, and assented to in the Senate by John Adams, Hamilton—and by the United States Senate, many of whose members assisted in founding the nation and participated in formulating the Constitution. And it is conceivable that such a declaration is false would have passed that illustrious body; nor find United States Senators implore to the public to settle a point challenged, if it asserted what was not true?—or can we to suppose that Washington and Jefferson, and Hamilton, and Madison, and Adams, and Lee, and Morris, and Ellsworth, and the other illustrious men of those days, did not know whether or not the Government they were instrumental in establishing was founded on the Christian religion or not?

To sum up the whole matter; against the proposition that Christianity is the common law of the whole country, we have cited the decision of the Supreme Court on the Circuit will record, the history of the formation of the States; the decision of the Supreme Courts of Ohio and Maine, and the opinion of Chief Justice Cooley, of Michigan. And lastly, we have drawn testimony from the Constitution itself to show that under its terms no religion can be the common law of the land; while both positively and negatively the evidences not positively that Christianity to be "the national" that which affirm itself to be "the entirely" not be part of our constitutional law. This brings us back to the position advanced—that we are not a Christian Nation; that ours is a Christian people. And yet,what then, long as Christianity is interwrought in the hearts and conscience of the people, it bids us no concern whether it is in our statutory or common law or not. Putting it there would make us no better; because it is not there, we are none the worse; for it still holds true that error may not give us graceful liberty where truth is left free to combat it.
