# Liberty, Indeed!

"CHRISTIANITY and Patriotism," is the title of an inspirational article in the *Christian Statesman,* of March 12, in which the question is asked: "Who were the Puritans and Pilgrim Fathers but men in their claims should be cherished and held sacred?" The answer given is: they "bore the seed of truth, rifled out from apostasies by bitter persecution, with which Almighty God planted the New World to preserve civil and religious liberty."

And how did the Puritans preserve civil and religious liberty? What are the facts as related therein? No sooner was the Government of the Colony of Massachusetts organized than a church was established after the Congregational order, and everybody was required in connection, to that mode of worship. Two men, however, in the colony, objected to the worship of the Church of England, and argued that the worship of the Colony ought to be according to the ritual of that Church. The Puritans replied: "We came away from the common prayer ceremonies in our native land, where we suffered much for nonconformity in things; place of liberty we can use, we will not, use them." And not only, but they were determined that nobody else in their settlements should use them, and so the Brewsters were banished from that "land of liberty," and sent back to England. Massachusetts was a place of liberty for Puritans only.

Let us now see how the Breckinridge managed its beginning; in 1631 a law was enacted as follows:—

To the end the body of the commons may be preserved of honest and good men, it is ordered and agreed that, for the time to come, no man shall be admitted to the freedom of this body politic, but such as are members of some church within the limits of the same.

"Some of the churches within the limits of the same," meant simply, some of the congregations of the Congregational order, for that was the established church of the Colony and none other was tolerated.

A. D. 1631 witnessed the arrival of Roger Williams in Boston. He was at once called to the pastorate of the church at Salem, left vacant by the death of Francis Higginson; last Governor Winthrop collected and Williams went to Plymouth. However, subsequently, he accepted the pastorate of the Salem church, and there began a course which ended in 1635 by a decree of the general court banishing him from the Colony. It was the crime for which he suffered, for not only was his person in sentence to send him back to England, but lest being apprised of their design he fled in the dead of winter to Rhode Island, and found refuge among the Indians.

In 1643, 1645, Mr. Winsfield, a Boston preacher, was banished for saying that it makes no matter how somebody may not according to the law; "if one only knows and acknowledges Christ aright, he must be saved. Do ye not after do this; seek for the rest of the story in their ancient collections, and exchange bodies of their doctrines and literature; and what have ye in your midst? Not the exercise of the synagogues, and greetings in the markets, and to be called of men, Rabbi, Rabbi." But before as the Lord Jesus Christ, is his own name to be used for glory and has pass yet through our lives things hereunto."

As in the case of Roger Williams, Wheelwright was driven out in the rigors of a New England winter.

The Baptists were peculiarly most banished for the heinous offence of agreeing with Mr. Hutchinson. There was a miniature Inquisition, before which she was repeatedly dragged for examination. "Mistress," says adamant to "Chairman and Court of Assistants." "You have been here, but friends were far away. That no circumstances of horror might be lost, at the close of her most devoted followers, Mary Dwyer, was this time's penalty. Both cases ended in misfeasance over their religion at the stake. Thomas Walke and his reverend brethren strolled with a gallows at bay, proclaiming that if Dissenters do not step in with his casting vote — see — "Gent, Let no Boston people will now the shocking sounds."

More also found asylum in Rhode Island, where the exiles and friends found a haven by the Indians.

Nor have these incidents civil but civil, and an uncommon type have had any less bitter persecution of Baptists. In 1644, the general court of the Colony of Massachusetts

ordered and agreed that if any person or persons, within this jurisdiction, shall either openly condemn or oppose the baptizing of infants, or go about secretly to seduce others from the approbation or use thereof, and shall appear to the court wilfully and obstinately to continue therein after due time and means of conviction, every such person or persons shall be sentenced to banishment.

It will be observed that this penalty was exactly parallel to that meted out in 1644, a Baptist named Painter was sentenced under it to be whipped "for refusing to have his child sprinkled. The sentence was actually carried out to the letter. A few years later, namely, in 1651, three Baptist ministers from Rhode Island, temporarily in Massachusetts visiting an aged Baptist were arrested while holding a service on Sunday, and were subsequently tried. They were unsurprisingly tried, and were sentenced to pay fines varying from five to thirty pounds. One of them Eliot Holmes, refused to pay his fine and was most brutally birched. Two, who witnessed the whipping of hands with Holmes, for which they were sentenced, to pay a fine of forty shillings each or else receive a whipping. The fines were paid by friends.

As might be supposed, cases of prosecution for conscience' sake increased in number until it finally culminated in the brutal whipping of women, and the banging of Quakers and witches. These facts give us some faint idea of the National Reformed condition of "liberty;" and should warn the American people not to trust their liberties in the hands of those who are so blinded by bigotry to imagine that the Puritans were "the seeds of truth" with which Almighty God planted the New World to preserve civil and religious liberty. There is nothing that can equal this in absurdity in the claim sometimes put forth by Papists, that the Roman Catholic Church is the champion of liberty. Instead of the name and memory of the Puritans' being "cherished and held sacred," Americans should ask for their wicked deeds of intolerance; and warned by the evil which they did in the name of religion, should see to it that such be forever kept out of the hands of those who, like the editor of the *Statesman,* sigh for a "breach of the Puritans."
