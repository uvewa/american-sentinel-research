THE World's Fair is to have a "Department of Religion" as a portion of The World's Congress Auxiliary of the World's Exposition of 1883. C. C. Bonney, who is President of the International Law and Order League, is President also of this World's Congress Auxiliary. Mr. Bonney has sent out a circular in reference to this Department of Religion at the World's Fair, which says that its purpose is "To unite all religion against all irreligion; to make the Golden Rule the basis of union; to present to the world in the religious congresses to be held in connection with the Columbian Exposition of 1883, the substantial unity of many religions in the good deeds of the religious life; to provide for a World's Parliament of Religions, in which their common aims and common ground of unity may be set forth, and the marvelous religious progress of the nineteenth century be reviewed; and to facilitate separate and independent congresses of different religious denominations and organizations, under their own officers, in which their business may be transacted, their achievements presented, and their work for the future presented." To plan the work for this Department of Religion a committee has been appointed representing sixteen different religious denominations among which is the Roman Catholic, the Jewish, and the Unitarian. The Congress is to be held from August 25 to September 28, 1883. If this movement towards the unification of popular religion is in any measure successful it will be a long stride towards making, not "the Golden Rule the basis of this union," but the tenets of the Law and Order League and the American Sabbath Union the basis of a union for the enforcement of religious law throughout the world. The possible outcome of this may be a world-wide propagation of the gospel of legal force.
