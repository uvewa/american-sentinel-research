FURTHERMORE, the "ad" referred to says, "Send for specimen copy." It seeks to gain subscribers only on its merits, and its premiums. Certainly this is legitimate; and only an evil mind would discover evil in it.

It is neither necessary nor right for one believing that he has truth to present to do it in a manner that will close people's hearts and ears against it before they even know what it is. The Saviour exhorted his disciples to be wise as serpents and as harmless as doves; and the apostle wrote to certain of his converts that he had caught them with guile. That is he used wisdom in dealing with them; he gave them truth as they were able to bear it; and the principle is recognized and acted upon by Christians in Christian work everywhere.

WHEN NATHAN CAME TO DAVID TO REDUCE him for his sin against Uriah, he did it by means of a parable which secured the king's attention and brought home to his mind the full force of the principle involved. Had he at once said, "David, I am come to reduce you for a very grave sin, and I warn you not to commit yourself by any expression of opinion until you fully understand all that I am going to say," he would have taken the course which the Statesman seems to think Seventh-day observers should pursue; and the course which Mr. Crafts, the editor of the Statesman, does not pursue.

As one who is constantly endeavoring to influence men, Mr. Crafts necessarily prepares the way for his conclusions by preparing the minds of his hearers for those conclusions. His "arguments" for Sunday laws are adapted to his audience. Before a congregation of church people, he urges religious "reasons" for Sunday legislation; while before a convention of laboring men, who are probably largely non-professors, he urges his "civil" "reasons."
