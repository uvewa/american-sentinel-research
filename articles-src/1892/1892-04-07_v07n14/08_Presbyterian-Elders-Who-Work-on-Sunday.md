# Presbyterian Elders Who Work on Sunday.

I. M. FORREST, Secretary of the National Reform Association, writing from Richmond, Indiana, draws a dark picture of the disregard of Christians for Sunday, and of "Presbyterian Elders" who travel through the country on that day. To correct these evils and make these Christians better, Mr. Foster declares that there is need of a strict Sunday law. The aim of which shall be—

> to protect the employer against himself. He is often as covetous that he will set against his own soul the wages of a hearing home. In Germany, the experimentalists of a leading home in Germany, is set in as a new form, and is done under his directions. "I am a member of the church. I respect Sunday and have always attended church. I make serious objection to working on the Sabbath will mean working Saturday night." That man needs a Sabbath law to break; the employer create religious conscience for Presbyterian elders, and grieve other church members, by civil law! Think of this scene at the Judgment Seat of Christ. Discount, Judge—Why did you disregard Sunday while on earth? Culprit—Because the civil law of Indiana did not compel me, and create in me a heart clean enough to keep the "Lord's-day!" What a travesty!—a Sabbath outlook.
