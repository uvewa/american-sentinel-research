"RELIGION is politics," says Colonel Shepard in the Mail and Express. It is true of a great many, that politics is a religion to them; it is also true of some that their religion is mainly political. This seems to be the case with Colonel Shepard—that his religion is political, or, at least, that he has no higher intellectual conception of religion than that it is "politics." He quotes the statement of the Hon. Solomon Hirsch, American Minister to Constantinople, that of all the capitals throughout the world, that city is the most religious, and on that account "the most political," —that the religion of the moving party in any measure is there the key to the political purpose underlying the measure, and is an unerring evidence as to who will oppose it and who favor. "European politics, as centered on the Bosphorus, is simply a battle of the churches." The Colonel then innocently says, "This is an illustration, on a grand scale, of the truth of our general proposition that religion is politics." The religion of Colonel Shepard and the American Sabbath Union, and the rest of the National Reform party, is politics, there is no doubt of that,—but that religion is not the religion of Jesus Christ. Neither is either European or American politics the religion of Jesus Christ, nor will they ever be. It would not be possible to concentrate into three words a greater misconception of true religion than is embodied in this editorial expression from the millionaire writer of religious editorials,—the President of the American Sabbath Union.

THE discussion of the educational measures before the German Parliament shows that in that country the accepted religion of the State is politics. The late differences between France and the Vatican show, also, by the manner in which the questions in dispute have been taken up, that not only is "the religious question rapidly coming to the front in French politics," but also that religion is politics in France. This has always been true, only in varying degree; and in proportion to the degree in which it has been true has the history of France been filled with events seemingly Satanic in their inhumanity and bloody terror. The religion of politics has not been the religion of Jesus Christ in France.

The religion of the Vatican is the religion of politics, and there it is even more true than any where else in the world, not even excepting Constantinople or the mind of the editor of the Mail and Express, that religion is politics. From out the Vatican political religion has poured for generations, like burning lava from unearthly fires scorching its devious paths throughout the whole earth. There is no country or people of the world which has not felt its searing influence. The very names, "Rome," and "The Vatican," have become synonymous with political religion. The religion of the Vatican is not the religion of Jesus Christ.

COLONEL SHEPARD's editorial says of the religion of the Vatican in this country, "It has allied itself with the Democratic Party until it now rules that party in New England, the Middle, the Western, and the North Western States. . . . It has taken possession of the city governments of Boston, New York, Baltimore, New Orleans, Troy, Detroit, Buffalo, and many another. It keeps just enough of its adherents in the Republican Party to weaken their counsels and mask their designs. But it is noticeable that whenever the interests of the Roman Catholic Church clash with those of the Republican Party, those Roman Republicans always vote for their own church, and let the interests of the country slide. . . . It is time that every patriot should leave the Democratic Party and unite against the Romans. They are still in a minority. The majority can stop giving them money and property, stop their alteration of our school books to suit and advocate their superstitions, stop their holding public office, stop their subjecting the State to their Church, stop their growth, and preserve our liberties. Roma delenda est."

Yes, "Rome must be destroyed," but that must is in the eternal purpose of God, and not in the political majority here called upon to destroy it by stopping the appropriation of money in its behalf, depriving Roman Catholics of the right to hold public office, and stopping the growth of the Church by an edict of the majority. Destruction must come upon Rome, but it must come also upon all political religions. Those who cry that the majority must stop the Roman Catholics "subjecting the State to their church" in order that the majority may subject it instead to their church, will in the end meet with the same destruction, for the same reasons, and by the same divine hand, as part of the same mystery of iniquity.
