THE SYRACUSE SUNDAY TIMES not long ago conceived the idea of publishing an article which should present complete statistics of the growth and progress of all the churches of different denominations in the city of Syracuse. To assist in this a circular letter, with blanks to be filled out and returned, was mailed to every minister having a charge in the city. About two thirds of the ministers refused to fill out the blank, and give the information requested, on the ground that they would not contribute to an article to be published in a Sunday newspaper. If it had been a Monday morning newspaper, which made the request, no doubt they would have been ready to furnish any amount of copy, for the editor to spend his Sunday afternoon over, and the compositors to set up on Sunday night.
