## Four Improved Adventists.

Two four improvised Adventists of using Henry O. Jail, at Paris, Tenn., found themselves in the charges in a just fate. The sheriff who was responsible for their after keeping realized that they were not criminals, and consequently granted them, while in confinement, such privileges as lay within his power. When three of them were sent on the road to work, with either reasons of the prison, the sheriff did not permit them to be chained with the gangs, and unlike or in partial cases of the rest, complained at toil on the Sabbath.

That they did not suffer all the indignities and discomforts of the ordinary criminal, that they were not chained together with the gang to work on the public road; that there was an attempt to compel them, by flogging or starving, to work on the Sabbath, is due to the plain, manly, and individual sense of right and justice of the sheriff of Henry County. It is worthy to be noted that this man had his direction on the side of justice, but it is also well to remember that another sheriff may feel that he does God service by enforcing his full authority over those who are his prisoners for conscience' sake.

An official representative of the American Sabbath Union, who has spent much of his time in Washington during the last months of Congress, and was present at the final vote in which the congressional restrictions on Sunday the last Sunday said, in a public meeting, that he has learned that "we hold the United States Senate in our hands."

The people, then, do not rule in this country. The Congress which they have elected is held in the hands of a religious minority. However, the American Sabbath Union and its confreres would not doubt that "the people do rule in this country, but we are the people.—That is all. They are not the people. They are not only a small minority but a ruling minority."

who form but a mere fragment of the people, this is an inconvenience to them, which they must bear, and which the law can not remove without impinging a much greater inconvenience upon a far larger number of people.

And the Christian (!) tenderness suggested by Sunday laws is thus exhibited by the *Independent*, which, in conclusion, remarks, that, "if they, (the observers of the seventh day,) do not like it [the inconvenience of repeated arrests], we see no remedy for them except withdrawal from the community." Or, in the words of an eminent National Reformer, "if they don't like it they can go to some wild desolate land and in the name of the devil and the exile of the devil and as a government of their own, and if they can stand it, stay on till they die;" that is the Christian (!) spirit of the whole National Reform Sunday law Church and State movement.
