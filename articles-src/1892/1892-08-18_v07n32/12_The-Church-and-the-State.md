## The Church and the State.

THE Church as a leaven has—irresistible—its weigh to bring man to Christ, the Church is commissioned the work of reconciliation. "Ye are not of the world, even as I am not of the world." Christ and Christ's people cannot be equally yoked together with unbelievers."

In her Apostle Christ and the Spirit of God. She was then in her purity; and as she grew in numbers, she declined to the world. As she thrust of the spirit of the world, she lost the power of the Holy Ghost. Many of the leaders became corrupt; and soon it was "Like priest, like people;" the bishops took authority of themselves and self-exaltation, as if it was with Church and State alike. As she had lost the power of God, she secured the power of the civil arm. As she departed from God, and the works and the commandments of God were supplanted by the institutions of the Church. The people were enslaved and chastened and beholden the institutions of the Church. Not content with that, she supposed also she was right, and all others wrong, so the evil-doer must be exterminated. As she could not do this by the power of that Spirit which she had lost, she allied herself to the State, and pleaded for the help of the State. She secured the control of the civil arm, and used it for the interests of the Church. The bishops became political wire-pullers, and the State became but a tool of the Church. Thus was developed the Papacy; and as she was virtually the controlling factor in the church, and everybody else was wrong, and as the State was under her control, instead of correcting the evil-doer, she set about the work of making Christians by force.

The most successful step in this line, as history shows, was the securing of severe Sunday laws. This led to persecution. But Catholics deny that the church ever persecuted; she only sustained the law. But the church was responsible for the law. The law was in the interest of religious institutions; and they invaded the realm of conscience. Therefore the very forefront of the law was religious persecution, and the church did persecute. As she was only a religio-political organization, and controlled the civil arm for the purpose of making Christians by force, she has always been only a persecuting power. Look her history all over, from beginning to end, it is a true picture. Now look at our labor reform, and tell if it is not equally true.
