## They Drop the "Civil."

A MEETING in the interest of the American Sabbath Union was held in the Market St. Methodist Episcopal Church, Paterson, New Jersey, on the night of August 7. The attendance was large, and the speakers were apparently in a militant mood over the passage of the grassy amendment to the bill appropriating funds to the World's Fair.

The speaker of the evening was the Rev. Mr. George, Field Secretary of the American Sabbath Union. He had the air of one commending read in the opening convention, and began his address by reading a clipping from a newspaper, which he took every foot from the Sabbath, from which he read that they had brought the law of God every foot from the Sabbath, from which he read. After repeating with emphasis the words, "One nation under God," he said that this deal in a name, and have ourselves fully fitted. We. Not of the Sabbath. No. Nor is he who would like it what is trying to bolster up a baseless festival with scriptures intended wholly for the seventh day?

During the entire meeting there was not the least mention of the "civil Sabbath," about which we were so much wearied when the "Union" was first organized; not, on the other hand, Mr. George, while talking about the Sabbath train, renounced that "there is no more religion in resting on Sunday than there is in resting and plowing all day." Then in a burst of enthusiasm, which brought forth an audible "Amen!" he told about the greatest victory of the age, the Nation closing the World's Fair in the name of a "holy law." In fact his entire address was devoted to everything pertaining to a civil day. The speaker went farther than to revive what we have been told is now said, "I have learned that . . . we have the United States Senate to thank . . . Behold!" Concerning the future work of themselves as directors, he said, they had "asked every railroad in the United States; quit running those Sunday trains;" also, proposed "to organize in each State element, in opposing the passage of Sunday Fare, by all rail, not per point to meet face to face, . . . and the terms we had but perhaps were the Seventh-day Adventist men the ones I have mentioned." As the name of this denomination, who boldly fenced it through his teeth, and to show he was dismissal from being in the motive of the proposed attempts to repeal the Sunday closing clause, "It can not be. It can not be done."
