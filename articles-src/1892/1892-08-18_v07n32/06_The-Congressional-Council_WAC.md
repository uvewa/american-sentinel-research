REFERRING to the recent discussion in Congress over the closing of the World's Fair on Sunday, the chaplain of the Senate, J. G. Butler, D. D., says, in the New York Independent, of July 28: "During this debate you might have imagined yourself in a general council, or assembly, or synod, or conference." Indeed, for such it virtually was—a religious affair throughout. Such was also the nature of the discussions in certain religio-political assemblies in the days of Constantine, when Church and State were united, and pagan Rome, under the apocalyptic symbol of the dragon, gave to papacy "his power, and his seat, and great authority."

This same Senate chaplain, in the same paper, says: "Never more surely than now would avowed hostility to God, his day (Sunday he means) and word and house and kingdom, remand a public servant to private life." And this is simply to say that this Government is being run upon a religious basis, and that practically religious tests are required as a qualification for offices of public trust under it—a thing distinctly forbidden by the national Constitution.

But a system of government which will remand a citizen to private life because of his attitude toward religion, will also remand a citizen from private life to prison, though he believe in God, his day and word and house and kingdom, if he does not believe in these in accordance with the "orthodox" faith, and conform to the religious customs of the majority. Proof of this is furnished in the recent persecutions in Tennessee. Because certain private citizens, after conscientiously keeping the Sabbath of the Lord, the seventh day, quietly labored on their farms on Sunday, as was their God-given and inalienable right to do, they were taken from their honest toil, prosecuted as criminals, condemned, fined, imprisoned, and compelled to work upon the public streets in payment of the fines and costs imposed. And when, as in one case, appeal was taken from court to court, the closing words of the last decision were, "Romand the prisoner."

Let those religionists who congratulate themselves over the present condition of affairs in this Government, ponder the practical workings and logical outcome of it all. Bitter persecution and certain national ruin is the picture hung at the end of the panorama. And let not those professed Protestants who are joining hands with papacy in order to carry their religious measures through Congress and State Legislatures think there is clear sailing before them. In the end they will find that they will pay dearly for the help they now receive in this way. Romanism well knows what she is doing and where her strength lies.

Another has well stated the case in the following words: "Let the principle once become established in the United States, that the Church may employ or control the power of the State; that religious observances may be enforced by secular laws; in short, that the authority of Church and State is to dominate the conscience, and the triumph of Rome in this country is assured. God's word has given warning of the impending danger; let this be unheeded, and the Protestant world will learn what the purposes of Rome really are, only when it is too late to escape the snare. She is silently growing into power. Her doctrines are exerting their influence in legislative halls, in the churches, and in the hearts of men. She is piling up her lofty and massive structures in the secret recesses of which her former persecutions will be repeated. Stealthily and unsuspectedly she is strengthening her forces to further her own ends when the time shall come for her to strike. All that she desires is vantage-ground, and this is already being given her. We shall soon see and shall feel what the purpose of the Roman element is. Whoever shall believe and obey the word of God will thereby incur reproach and persecution."
