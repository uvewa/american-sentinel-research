## Senate Bill 2177.

ON Tuesday, July 19, the House passed Senate Bill 2177, which had previously passed the Senate, containing the civil police laws and ordinances of the District of Columbia. This is now the law of the District. Section 5 reads:—

That it shall not be lawful for any person to keep open any store, or to sell or dispose of any goods, wares, or merchandise, on Sunday, or to sell or dispose of any liquors in any quantity, on any avenue, span, a road, or highway, or at any railroad station or depot, or upon any wharf, dock, or landing in the District of Columbia, or at any place where men assemble, on that day; nor for any person to engage, upon any avenue, square, road, highway, or in any such place, or within any house or building in any noisy or boisterous amusement on that day, under a penalty of $10 for each and every offense.

Congress has decided that all citizens of the District, including Hebrews and some two hundred congressional delegations of profanity and still Congress affirms this is to a penalty of $10 for that is it perfectly consistent after legislating for Sunday observances, let it be settled that it must of weakness what it does on that account of any one's individual faith.
