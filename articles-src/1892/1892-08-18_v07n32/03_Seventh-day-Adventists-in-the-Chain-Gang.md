# Seventh-day Adventists in the Chain-Gang.

As the readers of THE SENTINEL are aware, the imprisoned Adventists have been set to work on the public roads this week. Their improvement was cut short to the efforts of their comrades to make their punishment heavier. Their lot has been made much harder for the time being, but the term of their imprisonment was shortened by their work.

Their prosecution was instigated by members of other churches who thought in that way to weaken the influence of the Adventist church in this community. It had, however, the opposite effect, and this made their pious persecutors with new and Adventists entered for their boldness; they have more friends to-day than ever, and the more they prosper. In the immutable order of Providence, the attention thus called to them and their doctrines is really an assistance to the church, and people all over the country before whom the facts in the doctrines of the Adventists are now reporting about this affair, will thus demonstrate that "nothing can be said against the truth but for the truth."

At first when the four Adventists were imprisoned they were not compelled to work. But as no magistrate from Springfield, or Springfield, or the church of the Holy Trinity, was always sharpening an instrument of the enemy of Adventists, stirred up inquiry in regard to the matter, and it was then covered that prisoners in the county jail could be required to work on the public road. The prisoners were not put out of the county, but in order to make the lot of the Adventists harder, an old chain-gang was at once organized and all the prisoners in the jail were put at work on the highways in charge of an overseer with a loaded gun.

The next day after the prisoners were put on the road, the wife of the deacon of the Springville church went to visit her husband. She is a little, timid, delicate girl, and had taken to heart a good deal the imprisonment of her husband, but had borne up with commendable fortitude. When, however, she found her aged husband working on the public road, like a common criminal, and watched by an armed overseer, her feelings overcame her, and quite so, no emotion ensues has followed.

The wife of one of the other of the imprisoned men who has been up wonderfully during her husband's imprisonment, is now quite feeble owing to the nervous strain. It is feared unless the matter did not calm with some rest her to health. For families of all the imprisoned men suffered more of less as a direct result of the persecution, but have not been soft by suffer after, for members of the Adventist Church have shared the persecution with them.

Outside of the prosecution and persecution, Quiet Sunday work still continues, as it likely is proposed to. There is no spirit of defiance or of bravado, but there is merely a number of the church here who would not go to jail, or to death for that matter, rather than surrender the civil liberty. So far as can be ascertained there were no new indictments found at Sunday work at the last term of court.

When the September term will bring forth it is impossible to say. But come what may, it is safe to say that the faithful Adventists will meet it in the spirit of the Master and with the trust that God gives all those who put their trust in him.
