Springville, Tenn., Aug. 16, 1892.

As the readers of THE SENTINEL are aware, the imprisoned Adventists have all been at liberty for more than two weeks. Their imprisonment was cut short by the efforts of their enemies to make their punishment heavier. Their lot was made much harder for the time being, but the term of their imprisonment was shortened materially.

Their prosecution was instigated by members of other churches who thought in that way to weaken the influence of the Adventist church in this community. It had, however, the opposite effect, and this filled their pious (?) persecutors with wrath and they determined to make the Adventists sweat for their obstinacy. But the more they do against the Adventists the more they prosper. In the immediate neighborhood there have been several accessions to the church, and people all over the county who before felt no interest in the doctrines of the Adventists are now inquiring about their faith. It is thus demonstrated that "nothing can be done against the truth but for the truth."

At first when the four Adventists were imprisoned they were not compelled to work. But an ex-magistrate from Springville who has always been an inveterate enemy of Adventism, stirred up inquiry in regard to the matter, and it was discovered that prisoners in the county jail could be required to work on the roads. This had never before been done in this county, but in order to make the lot of the Adventists as hard as possible a chain-gang was at once organized and all the prisoners in the jail were put to work on the highways in charge of an overseer armed with a revolver.

The next day after the prisoners were put on the roads the wife of the deacon of the Springville church went to visit her husband. She is a kind, motherly old lady, and had taken to heart a good deal the imprisonment of her husband, but had borne up with commendable fortitude. When, however, she found her aged husband in the chain-gang, treated as a common criminal, and watched by an armed man, she completely broke down. However, no serious results have followed.

The wife of another of the persecuted men who bore up wonderfully during her husband's imprisonment, is now very feeble owing to the nervous strain. It is hoped however that rest and quiet will restore her to health. The families of all the imprisoned men suffered more or less as a direct result of the persecution, but they have not been left to suffer alone, for as far as possible the whole church have shared the persecution with them.

The spirit of the Adventists here is unbroken. Quiet Sunday work still continues, and is likely to continue. There is no spirit of defiance or of bravado, but there is scarcely a member of the church here who would not go to jail, or to death for that matter, rather than surrender his soul-liberty. So far as can be ascertained there were no new indictments found for Sunday work at the last term of court. What the September term will bring forth it is impossible to say. But come what may, it is safe to say that the Springville Adventists will meet it in the spirit of the Master and with the grace that God gives all those who put their trust in him.
