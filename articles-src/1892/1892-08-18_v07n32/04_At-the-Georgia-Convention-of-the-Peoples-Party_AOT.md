"SAM SMALL," so says the Atlanta Constitution, "was a straggler in the convention hall all day, and was called on to speak." In his talk he said:—

> The day has come when the conscientious voice of the people is the voice of God and should be heard from the mountains to the sea.

Where does this clerical gentleman get his information that we have reached a time when we can safely rely on the people as being right. The "conscientious voice of the people" stoned the prophets, crucified Christ, roasted the martyrs, and did a multitude of other wicked things. Is it positively settled that they will never do such a thing again?

In the same speech Mr. Small further said:—

> Grover Cleveland invited that leader of niggerdom, Fred Douglass, to his dinner table. I might excuse him for getting the nigger into his house for supper, but when he invited the low white wife to go there, it is more than I can stomach.

Such language is not very becoming to a third or fourth rate politician; but when a man who poses as a representative of the refined, cultured and sympathetic character of the Lord Jesus Christ, gives expression to such vulgar abuse it is grossly shocking.
