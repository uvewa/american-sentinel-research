[In the course of a trenchant criticism upon the action of Congress in reference to the World's Fair, the Philadelphia North American gives utterance to some plain facts, and tells some truths worth reading and remembering. They are reprinted below.]

We can respect the conscientious scruples of the honest Sabbatarian, and allow for the universal tendency to prescribe rules for the other fellow. But every honest man, if intelligent, knows that Sunday is not the Sabbath, and that it is optional with all to observe it or ignore it as a holy day. When it was decided not to open the Centennial Exhibition on Sunday's some persons thought it a triumph for Sabbatarianism, while every man who kept his eyes open knew that the boasted exclusion was a farce. The fact was that the exhibition was visited by thousands on Sunday, but the class that would have been benefited had the gates been freely opened were not benefited at all. Tens of thousands of dollars were spent in actual desecration of the day, whereas had the exhibition gates been opened as on other days, the money that was worse than flung away would have gone into the till of the exhibition, while the moral gain would have been enormous. But on the merest sentimental technicality the doors of the exhibition were closed and the gates of excess opened wide.

The Chicago Exposition seems likely to rank first among national functions. The people of Chicago are not very hidebound as respects the metes and bounds established by ecclesiastical bodies. But the Columbian affair, though to be located at Chicago, will not be a Chicago, but a national, affair. A vast majority of Americans have no superstitious regard for any day, while yet holding to one day of rest in seven. But rest depends on the constitution of the individual. A man who should be idle six days would find rest in activity on the seventh. The man who works hard six days finds rest in ceasing to labor on the seventh. But on that day he must decide for himself how he will rest, always within the law. He may get drunk on the seventh day and otherwise imbrute himself, but if such is his idea of rest, the law provides for him. If he elects to go to church, very well, and, generally, that goes to his credit. But he may as properly elect to go into the woods and fields and take his revenge on tired nature there. Christianity was intended to make men free, and man must be free in this country. He must have liberty on every day alike and license on none.

If the Columbian Exposition people are wise, they will refuse to accept any favors from the Government on such conditions. They should deny the right of Congress to impose conditions so wholly at war with the spirit of the age. So far as money is involved the Government will be a minority. If a majority of the contributors are opposed to Sunday openings, then they have an indefeasible right to say so, and having said so, to be obeyed. Let the Chicagoans decide how many days they will have in the Exposition period. It is their right to do it. They will probably do it.
