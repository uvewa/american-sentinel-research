[Under the head of "Sabbath Desecration," the Boston Traveller has the following account of the enforcement of the Massachusetts law against selling on Sunday at Lexington, in that State.]

Associate Justice Charles Thompson of the First District Court of Central Middlesex sat all day in the quaint little court room at Concord yesterday, listening to a case of especial interest.

It seems that about a year ago one M. C. Meagher, a speculator in real estate, purchased a tract of about three hundred acres in the town of Lexington and adopted the boom town methods of the South in calling public attention to its eligibility as a residential location.

It is alleged that many hundred lots were disposed of, and there was no particular objection raised by the residents of the town to the enterprise. It is probable that Mr. Meagher and his agents, L. DeVoe and F. W. Ashcroft, would never have figured in a legal contention had they not attempted to make use of the Sabbath in furthering their interests.

It appears, as alleged by Mr. Frederick O. Vialle, who owns a large estate adjoining the property of Mr. Meagher, that the latter was in the habit of bringing excursion parties from Boston on the Lord's day, to have a look at the location and see for themselves the inducements it offered for settlement.

Mr. Vialle asserts that on one occasion the Sunday invaders were accompanied by a brass band. Other attractions were offered the excursionists to make their stay interesting.

Now this is what precipitated the contention.

The selectmen of Lexington were opposed to this desecration of the Sabbath, so they went to Mr. Vialle and urged him to bring a suit against the principals of the land scheme, which he did, and their arrest followed.

It was not shown to the satisfaction of Judge Thompson that Meagher was present on any of these occasions, or if he was he made no attempt to transact business, and he was therefore discharged from custody. The same result was recorded in the case of Agent Ashcroft. But not so with Mr. DeVoe.

It was shown that he was present at the grounds on Sunday, the 10th inst., and had with him about forty excursionists that he had brought from Boston. In his pocket, so Mr. Vialle testified, were a quantity of circulars issued by Mr. Meagher, giving a description of the property and the modus operandi of securing a lot and a building thereon. In addition to these, Mr. Vialle saw what he believed to be a plan of the section in the same pocket.

This evidence settled matters for DeVoe, as Judge Thompson held that it had been shown that he was doing business on the Lord's day. He was not inclined to impose a severe penalty, but thought the law should be vindicated.

Counsel Keyes said that he did not want to persecute Mr. DeVoe, and that if Mr. Meagher would give his word that no more excursions be made similar to those complained of, he would let the case go.

As there was no disposition on the part of Meagher to enter into such an agreement, Judge Thompson fined DeVoe $20.

Counsel Hall entered an appeal, and the defendant was ordered to recognize in the sum of $200.
