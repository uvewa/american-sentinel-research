At the great Christian Endeavor Convention, held in this city, the Endeavors of Ohio, at the time of the taking of the vote for the adoption of resolutions asking Congress to require the Sunday closing of the World's Fair, rose in a body and shouted in chorus this campaign cry:

> O-bi-o,
> We won't go
> To the World's Fair
> If it keeps open Sunday
> Or liquor's sold there.

The convention as a whole refused to commit itself to any such pledge. The Christian Endeavor Society of Ohio has, however, thus publicly put itself on record that it will not attend the World's Fair if it should be open on Sunday. If the managers of the Fair should succeed in persuading Congress to reverse the Sunday closing proviso before the Fair opens, the Ohio Endeavors will be in honor bound to stay away. Such a self-denial would really be but a slight penance for the fraudulent repeated petitions running into millions, which were sent from Ohio, and for which they bear their proportionate responsibility.

However, it appears that the enthusiastic delegates find it difficult to obtain the full support of their constituency to the course to which the delegation has committed itself. This "special" to the Cincinnati Commercial shows a difference of opinion on this matter among the rank and file:—

> Dr. McCauley, of Dayton, Ohio, was present at the convention of the Christian Endeavor Societies, of Ironton, in an effort to organize a boycott against the World's Fair, in case the gates are opened on Sunday, or liquor is sold on the grounds. He has visited several Christian Endeavor conventions, including the national convention in New York, for the same purpose. He introduced his resolution, which practically pledged all members of the Endeavor Societies not to attend the Fair, in case of Sunday opening or liquor selling, and, after an exciting debate, it was decided not to place his resolution to vote. Pastor Marsh, of the First Congregational Church, approved Dr. McCauley's plan in the main, but objected to pledging the society as a whole, to boycott the Fair. He thought the members should be allowed to do as they saw fit in the matter, and objected strenuously to using the religious organizations as a boycott machine, especially since courts and even labor organizations were beginning to frown upon this method of settling disputes.

The boycott is nothing more nor less than conspiracy. Those who organize to boycott the World's Fair are guilty of conspiring together to injure or destroy a great enterprise. It is not the act of a Christian, or of a worthy, law-abiding citizen, in Dr. McCauley, to engineer an organized conspiracy to injure the financial interests of the directors and stockholders of the World's Fair and destroy the business prospects of this corporation.

It is to the credit of the Christian Endeavors that some of them see this fact, and refuse to become a party to any such improper action.
