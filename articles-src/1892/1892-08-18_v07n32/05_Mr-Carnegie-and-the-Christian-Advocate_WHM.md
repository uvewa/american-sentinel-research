THE Pittsburg Christian Advocate makes some very peculiar statements which it seems to think have a bearing on the riot and violence and erroneous views of mutual obligation which have been so rife at Homestead. The Advocate says:—

> Mr. Carnegie wants the right to sneer at religion and all its obligations and restraints. The firm will defy the law of God and of the land in running their works needlessly on the Sabbath; but when a strike occurs they hasten to invoke the protection of the law for themselves and their property. They teach the men to disobey God and man when it is to their interest, but demand that they shall obey both when their interests are on the other side.

What is the intent of this paragraph? Does the Advocate wish to convey the idea that Mr. Carnegie has not the privilege, if he wishes (which by no means appears), to sneer at religion? If he wishes this privilege he has it, and neither the Advocate nor the municipal nor State nor general government can refuse him any civil rights because of such a sneer, or of a denial of religion, its obligations and restraints. Does the Advocate wish to outlaw Mr. Carnegie and the Carnegie Steel and Iron Company, because in the opinion of the Advocate they have broken the law of God? Will the Advocate pull the beam from its own eye? During its entire existence the Advocate has disobeyed the law of God, and taught men so, but because of that shall any one claim that the Advocate and all connected with it are outlawed, and beyond the protection of the law, for themselves and their property? All men, even sinners like Mr. Carnegie and the editor of the Christian Advocate, are under the protection of the law; and even if they should be criminals, as well, still they are not beyond the pale; the law must care for them and protect them and their property.

What is the clue to the logical labyrinth in which the Advocate is so hopelessly lost in this short paragraph? It lies in the assumption of the Advocate that human law can just as properly enforce religious duties as protect civil rights. That is where the Advocate is in error. The Carnegie Steel and Iron Company has the same right to permit its men to labor on Sunday, and to teach them that it is proper they should do so, that the Advocate has to permit its employees to work on the Sabbath of the Bible and teach them that it is proper they should do so. No human law can properly be a restriction upon either. In this matter they stand upon an equality. The Advocate does not do well to suggest the outlawry of a man and his business because of a difference of religious opinion or practice.
