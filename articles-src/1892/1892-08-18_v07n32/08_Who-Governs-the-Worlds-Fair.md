## Who Governs the World's Fair?

[In the course of a memorial praying upon the action of Congress in reference to the World's Fair, recently issued, it briefly gives one statement, the reading and restatement. They are reprinted by us.]

WE must respect the conscientious convictions of the Jewish Sabbatarians, and allow for the universal tendency to prescribe rules for the other fellow. But every honest man, if intelligent, knows that Sunday is not the Sabbath, and that it is virtually and to all observers (or ignore it as a holy day). When it was decided not to open the Centennial Exhibition on Sundays some persons pleaded it a triumph for Sabbatarianism, while every man who kept his eyes open knew that the located exhibition was a farce. The last three days the exhibition was visited by thousands and had the attendance of many, it would have been benefited had the gates been freely and hospitably handed to all. "The vast thousands of dollars were spent in actual desecration of the day, whereas had like admission gates been opened on other days, the money that was worse than flung away would have gone into the till of the exhibition, and... the last three days would have been enormous. But on the most sentimental grounds to the doors of the society section were closed and the gates of excess opened wide.

The Chicago Exposition seems likely to set rank among national institutions. The respect to these times and we very humbly think the questions about any kind of Columbian affair, though to be located at Chicago, will be as a church bake, not a national affair. A vast majority of Americans have no regard especially for one day above another. Our Government does not, while yet holding to one day of rest in seven, rest upon the moral or legal destination of the individual. A man who should be idle six days would find real use in honest activity on the seventh. The man who works hard on a day that rests in coming to labor on the seventh. But on that he must decide for himself how he will keep the seventh day of rest. If he may get drunk on the seventh day and otherwise amuse himself, being financially independent, the law provides for him. If he seeks to go to church, very well; he attends, that goes to his credit. But he may as properly elect to go into the woods and fields and take his revenge on tired nature there. Christianity was meant to make men free, and man must be free in this country. He must have the right on every day alike and license on none.

If the Columbian Exposition people are wise, they will refuse to accept any favors from the Government and keep themselves to impose conditions as wholly at war with our Constitution. Sunday closing, if money is involved the Government will be a dictator. If a majority of the contributors are opposed to Sunday opening, then they have an indeterminate right to say so, and having said, to be observed. Let the Chicagoans decide how many days they will have in the Exposition period. It is their right to do it. They will probably do it.
