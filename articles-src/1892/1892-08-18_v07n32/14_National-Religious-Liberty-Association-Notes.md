The Peoria Transcript thinks that perhaps the reason why Senator Quay strove so zealously to prevent the "desecration" of Sunday at the World's Fair is because he thinks it should be kept sacred to politics.

At a convention of the Brotherhood of Carpenters, just held at St. Louis, Mo., a resolution was adopted protesting against closing the World's Fair on Sunday, and petitioning Congress to reconsider its action on Sunday closing.

At the second annual convention of the Catholic Total Abstinence Union of America, held at Indianapolis, Ind., the committee on resolutions presented a paragraph favoring the opening of the World's Fair on Sunday. The clause met with much opposition and was finally expunged.

Director Lyman Gage, of the World's Fair Directory, says, "We shall doubtless go before Congress next December and ask for the repeal of the Sunday closing clause. I think within the next six months the real feeling of the people will be brought to the surface. Petitions will probably be circulated among those in favor of Sunday opening, and if we can convince Congress that the popular side has not yet been heard, it will doubtless permit us to open the Fair. If, however, it continues to feel that the preponderance of sentiment is still the other way, we will have to abide the result."

The New York Morning Advertiser says of the proviso closing the World's Fair on Sunday: "The restriction against opening the Fair on Sunday must not be taken as an expression of opinion on the part of Congress on the question of Sunday closing. . . . This prohibitory clause was put in the bill as a piece of petty spite and malice. The Democratic majority was opposed to the World's Fair. . . . Its design was to cripple the Fair as much as possible, and if this paltry gift is accepted with the conditions attached, it will indeed prove a serious handicap."

Of the Sunday opening of the Museum of Natural History, in this city, the correspondent of the Chicago Tribune says: "To-day for the first time the American Museum of Natural History was open to the public on Sunday. The opening day was successful in every particular beyond the anticipations of the managers. The doors of the museum were opened at 1 o'clock and the crowd commenced to throng the halls at once. People of all classes were there, but laboring men and women and their families were in the majority. The peculiarity of to-day's crowd was the number of family groups. Few persons came alone. Usually the whole family came in a bunch and strolled for hours in the cool and well-lighted halls. It is eight years since the movement was started which resulted first in Sunday opening of the Museum of Art and recently overcame the strongest kind of opposition in the board of the Museum of Natural History."

Mrs. Marietta M. Bones, who has been prominent in political and social matters in South Dakota, writes thus to the Boston Investigator of Aug. 10:—

> Mr. Editor: Upon reading so many protests in your excellent paper against the action of our good senator (R. F. Pettigrew) upon closing the World's Fair on Sunday, and knowing that he is neither pious nor a bigot, I wrote him my regrets at learning of his stand in this matter; but his answer convinces me that his work in this behalf is simply a case of mistaken kindness on his part to the laborer; for he not only regrets that I am on the wrong side of the subject, but admits: "I favor the closing of the Fair not so much on account of the religious sentiment, but because I thought that if we did not do it the day was liable to be lost to the laboring man as a day of rest. If we once commenced legalizing Sunday contracts to labor seven days, Sunday as a day of rest will be lost to the laboring man very soon."

In Mr. Pettigrew's latest expression on this subject as given by a Mail and Express reporter, he said:—

> I think the battle is won and the American Sabbath saved. . . . The Exposition is just the thing to make the fight on.

If Mrs. Bones is right in her estimate of Mr. Pettigrew, that he is "neither pious nor a bigot," then it is certain that he is a hypocrite.

THE GAZETTEER, of Denison, Texas, publishes a series of resolutions, passed at a public meeting in Denison, ostensibly in the interest of the Sunday closing of saloons, and makes these very pertinent comments:—

> "A casual reading of the above resolutions would leave the impression that this Sunday ordinance movement was directed mainly towards the open saloons, but this feature is evidently given prominence in order to appeal to a popular prejudice to secure indorsement of a far more sweeping infringement of personal liberty. The real object is to as far as possible stop all business and labor, and recreation such as base ball, public concerts, and the like on that day. That is what the framers of these resolutions are really driving at; and if they can persuade the city to step in and relieve the State from the responsibility of its own enactments by assuming them itself, no doubt the next move will be to go before the Legislature and try to get still more stringent laws passed, such as they have in some of the cities in the older States, and notably in Tennessee where a certain class of Christians are imprisoned, fined, and their property levied on and sold, because they observe the Sabbath as a holy day and labor on Sunday in accordance with the teachings of their Bibles. So far as we are personally concerned the enforcement of the present State Sunday law by the city would not interfere with our business or seriously discommode us, but there is a principle involved in this kind of legislation that the Gazetteer can not under any circumstances indorse—a principle far-reaching in its results, of vastly more importance to the public than the question of whether or not the back doors of the saloons shall be left open on Sunday or a tradesman shall sell a pocket handkerchief or a cigar on that particular day."
