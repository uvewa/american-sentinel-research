# Editorial.

THOSE who have sought that the Congress of the United States should legislate in favor of religion have been successful. It was certain that they would succeed, sooner or later. Just how and when this would be accomplished could not have been foretold. Success has come to them more quickly than they themselves ever thought. The character of those men and their movements can be well judged by the way they bear themselves in success.

THOSE who have sought this action from Congress have almost been taken unawares by results favorable to them in all quarters. The decision of United States Judge Hammond, in the R. M. King, of Tennessee; the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States, in the case of the Church of the Holy Trinity *vs.* the United States, that this is a "Christian Nation;" the favorable expression of the Senate and House upon every bill forcing the Sunday-observance brought before them during their last session; and finally, the passage by the Fiftieth Congress provision to the World's Fair appropriation, all mark an unforeseen and steadily progressing line of decisions, and legislation favorable to national religion—religion by law and by decree of the court.

THIS is what they sought. They have gained their desired wish. Success has run to meet them in the way. Who are they that have sought this? They are the religionists; the doctors of divinity; the pastors, and preachers, and deacons, and deacons of the churches; the membership at large of almost all the three-score orthodox denominations; the influential feminine element of the country in the Woman's Christian Temperance Union; the tens of thousands of the youth of the Christian Endeavor Society; and many other organizations for religious purposes: these are they who have sought this. Those whose professing it is that they walk in the footsteps of the meek and lowly Jesus; those who are supposed to be the highest human exponents of the Christian graces. We shall know what to look for, then, as the result of their labors. By their fruits we shall know them. The branches of the vine will bear the fruits of the Spirit.

"These fruits are to all men, long-suffering and kindness, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance, freedom from envy and vainglory, provoking no man, fulfilling the law in loving their neighbors as themselves, bearing their neighbors' burdens, and whose riper judgment is alien to a faith-justified feeling in a spirit of consideration."

Here, then, we can look for the noblest earthly growth of these heavenly fruits in the results of the earnest labors of these religious pastors and masters, and their apt pupils. In this, the moment of their success, the gentle and Christ-like character of them, who have laid their faith and earthly enthusiasm to enthrone Christ upon the earth, will be made manifest. Their success will fill them with the blessed joy of the larger opportunity to do good to all men, and more particularly to spread abroad the blessing of their increased power unto good works among those that are of the household of faith.

ROBERT M. KING, an earnest, single-hearted, God-fearing man, was brought before the justice's court in the State of Tennessee, touching a matter concerning the law of his God. No fault was found to him, but concerning the law of his God he was held and fined. Again he was brought before the Circuit Court as regards the same matter, (fined and imprisoned;) his case appealed, the Supreme Court of the State sustained the conviction; carried to the United States Court, a reversal is denied, and the prisoner is remanded. Remanded! to what charges?—a question touching the law of his God. In other arrests on similar charges are declined, awaiting the passage of this case through the courts. The decision against the prisoner is hailed as authoritative precedent for similar arrests. They are made. Four Christian men are imprisoned, and when they refuse to pay pecuniary fines, and have no property for the sheriff to sell, they are put to labor upon the public road, with common criminals, in a gang driven by an armed overseer. In the meantime, by a decision similar to the decision necessitated by the conditions of the case at last, Justice Brewer, of the United States Supreme Court, has laid down that it would be futile to carry their case to the Supreme Court of the land. And he showed this by deciding that this is a "Christian Nation." Is there not contradiction here, or is there not? Here is a result of the same course of congressional and courts to enact by those who seek legislation and legal decisions in favor of religion.—Are these the fruits of the Spirit? Can we know them by such fruits as these?

IN commenting upon these justification matters, the *Christian at Work* says:

> The Tennessee Sunday law being what it is, the SENTINEL certainly has ground for complaint, and would seem to be right to contribute its share to the shape of forms, and the labor goes well above, etc., and, in this particular, "Let these there matters compose the law of Tennessee."

"This is the Christian advice and brotherly counsel of the *Churchman*, and that of the *Christian Statesman* is like unto it, when it suggests that such persons be "urged to move for more their own advantage."

> In most of the States such private work by those who observe Saturday is protected by law. So long as it is forbidden by law, the judge rightly refuses to set aside his own act. Tennessee has hitherto had has been regarded as at Knoxville in its claims.
