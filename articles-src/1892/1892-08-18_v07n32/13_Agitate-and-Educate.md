As the country at large awakens to the fact that Congress has really assumed to itself the power to close the World's Fair on Sunday, and has passed an act which does accomplish that, there will be a general expression of dissatisfaction with the act, and very likely quite a widespread attempt to secure its reversal. It is not at all likely that this will be gained. Indeed it is very certain that it will not. Such an attempt is advisable, however, from an educational point of view. While it was certain that what has been done, would be done, it is just as certain that much more will be done than has been done. The quickest way to learn what will be done, and to understand how evil a thing it both is and will be, is to be told what has been done and why it should not have been done. Agitate! Educate! Ask Congress to reverse its action, and say why.
