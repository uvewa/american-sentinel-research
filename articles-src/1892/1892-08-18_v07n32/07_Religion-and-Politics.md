## Religion and Politics.

A WORD OF WARNING TO ALL PARTIES.

THE *Washington Advocate*, a prohibition paper, very properly condemns the mixing of religion with civil government and administration. The writer of this communication shows that the fundamental principle of the Temperance Union has fallen, and has stated them to be "all temperance organizations that mixed up politics and religion in politics."

Most. Electing to office delegates, ministers is being nominated for political office because they hold such. Protestants and Catholics, Jew and Gentile, in our scale, etc. These are the very reasons why we should remain in line with the United States Constitution, and keep equal and bold politics, Church and State, forever separate. A man's moral and political qualifications are the only ones that should ever be considered in nominating for office. With an individual's religious belief, or church connection, we should have nothing to do. We should judge them by their works. That is what we require. If ministers possess the proper qualifications, we should favor their nomination; and if Catholic, Jew, or atheist, we should require no more. Now, while being so very emphatic in standing about by, homely compare I the truth, so far, and having said, to be observed. Let the Chicagoans decide how many days they will have in the Exposition period. It is their right to do it. They will probably do it.

Gather one complete Nation from the diverse material by which we are surrounded. And, finally let us have a Prohibition party, and temperance societies, where no wrangling over belief or unbelief shall enter, and where both Catholic and Protestant can vote side by side to abolish the accursed saloon that has been a great curse to both.
