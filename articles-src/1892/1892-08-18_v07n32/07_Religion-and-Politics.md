A MEMBER OF THE W. C. T. U. OBJECTS TO SEVERAL THINGS.

[The Watertown Advocate, a prohibition organ, publishes this practical and able article from a member of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union. The writer of this communication appreciates the errors into which the Woman's Christian Temperance Union has fallen and has stated them frankly. There are other clear sighted women who realize how dangerous a ferment this fatal brew of politics and religion is producing.]

MRS. GOUGAN objects to ministers being nominated for political offices, because we have both Protestant and Catholic, Jew and Gentile, in our ranks, etc. These are the very reasons why we should remain in line with the United States Constitution, and keep creeds and politics, Church and State, forever separate. A man's moral and political qualifications are the only ones that should ever be considered in nominating for office. With an individual's religious belief, or church connections, we should have nothing to do. Integrity and business ability are what we require. If ministers possess these requisites no one should object to their nomination; and if Catholic, Jew, or atheist, we should require no more. Now, while being so very emphatic in stating what should be, honesty compels me to admit that not all things that should be in reality are; and so I shall have to state that, like Mrs. Gough, there has recently come upon me a great fear we may be making some grave mistakes in regard to our methods. Not in regard to nominating ministers for office but in giving women the ballot to vote for them; for there is not an objection which she raises against ministers for office that does not find its application with far greater force in conferring suffrage upon the majority of our Woman's Christian Temperance Union workers. These women have been so long engaged in church work that it has become second nature to them, and from very habit they strive to force everything through those familiar channels.

Thus we find them converting temperance (?) meetings into afternoon prayermeetings, or Bible classes, and their conventions into great religious conferences. The time, money, and talent, that should be employed to rouse the Nation from its drunken lethargy, by means of lectures and literature, is used to spread gospel tracts, and bring souls into the church. Or to use the language of one of our State superintendents, "the trend of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union is more than ever evangelistic and missionary." And so we find department after department tacked on what was originally a temperance organization, until our forces have become so scattered and weakened, that we will soon be a little of everything and no use for anything in the line of temperance. I united with the Woman's Christian Temperance Union because I desired to advance the cause of prohibition; and I have always favored female suffrage as a means to the same end, but while I still cling to prohibition as the only salvation for the Nation, I am becoming very shaky on the suffrage question, and for the reasons which I am giving. If we must relegate ministers to the rear for fear of creeds, then most assuredly the women must stay there to bear them company; for no class is advancing toward the ballot-box with a more settled determination to combine Church and State than the women. The Constitution must be corrected; the Protestant Bible must be placed in the public school; the seventh day people must be compelled to worship on the first day, and work the seventh; and, finally, if the present trend of thought does not materially change, a person's religious belief will most surely be made a test for holding office. With the great wall which has been built between Church and State demolished, the field will be open for conquest. And here upon American soil Jew and Christian, Catholic and Protestant, shall rush upon each other in mortal combat in contending for religious supremacy.

With the blood-red fields of the Old World ever before us, let no one, either minister or woman, dare to go into politics flaunting sectarian colors. Great deeds and great professions command respect and tolerance. If religion of some peculiar kind has greatly perfected your lives, let that same Christian charity first call attention to the fact, and not loud ontcries. Let us cling to our free Government and our free school. Let us demand no privilege for ourselves that we are not willing to concede to others. In school and politics let us ever strive to keep science, morals, and the great principles of government ever at the front, so that we may weave together one complete Nation from the diverse material by which we are surrounded. And, finally let us have a Prohibition party, and temperance societies, where no wrangling over belief or nubeliefs shall enter, and where both Catholic and Protestant can work side by side to abolish the saloon that has been so great a curse to both.
