# The Gospel: What It Is, and Its Mystery.

## As Opposed to the Mystery of Iniquity.

*A sermon delivered by A. T. Jones at Battle Creek, Mich., Sabbath, June 18, 1892.*

IN the field of morals, in the realm of the right of things, knowledge is not power. There is not the difference between the functions and Christians always. In fact, many of the greatest philosophers of Socrates and all the rest of their philosophy, yet as they never did any good they know to be virtuous was virtue. To know the good was all that was necessary in order to do good. To know the pure was all that was necessary in order to be pure. And they laid down first-rate precepts, and gave excellent instruction in the matter of purity, in the matter of right doing—ethics—and in all things then, but they themselves did fail to do the things which they taught to be right and good, and they could not do it; because, although they had the knowledge they had not the power.

Every man on earth knows that the statement is true, that as the field of morals, knowledge is not power, because every man in this world knows better than he does. Every man on earth knows more than he does, and knows better than he did. He knows better than he is able to do; and they that had not the law were able to. These philosophers and men who know more than they have were able to do; and they taught a great deal better than they did; and I can again, every man in the world knows better than he is able of himself to do, and neither is Christ, all of life is made up of efforts and failures to do the good that he knows. Paul describes all men as they are in themselves when he says, "The will is with me; but how to perform that which I, a good I find not. For a good I would do better, then does the evil that I would not. And it always will be so until he finds the remedy for the evil, which is God himself, the power of God which through faith is given to every man.

It is not knowledge that men most greatly need in order to do right. It is power; the gospel reveals it, and the possibility of the gospel makes it known. But yet the excellency of Christ to men is that he brings not only power, but also knowledge far beyond anything that man can ever elsewhere learn. Christ is not only the power of God, but is the wisdom of God. God reveals through beyond anything than man can know, and power in royal measure, when the Almighty God gives power, beyond anything man could ever do, and wisdom in equal measure with the power. "Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God, to them that are called," is offered to men, and in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily. Therefore I say that any faith which stands in the power of argument, or which rests upon the power of logic, or upon the wisdom of man; or believes a certain thing because somebody else believes it; or takes a certain thing because somebody else does—that is what is worth nothing of all; that faith must stand in power alone. And Christ is the power of God. Christ and him crucified; this is the power of God, and the wisdom of God; this is the gospel.

The preaching of this is the preaching of the gospel, and nobody else can preach the gospel. The gospel is not the wisdom of men or the power of argument, the power of logic; it is the power of God; the power of God; this is the gospel.

Now I want to call attention to another point, which indeed is the main one in the Mystery of the morning, and that is another statement of what the gospel is. Christ sent Paul to preach the gospel, and Paul tells us in his letter to the Galatians, that Christ did not tell him just what to do until he two visits at Jerusalem before he started them to preach the gospel. He consulted those who seemed to preach the gospel, "but they that were in reputation, ... but they attempted to, they were to" ... let them have the gospel, to know the power from on which was the Holy Charge. Now Col. Paul's Charge ... before he could preach the gospel ... "It pleased God ... to reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen." Gal. 1:15, 16. In Acts 9:15, we find the Saviour's commission to Paul, and to "I will himself marvely, and

"Delivering him from the people, and from the Gentiles, unto whom now I send thee, to open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and ..." sure are those among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me.

That is what Christ sent Paul to preach to the children of men, and the Gentiles among them. It is the power of God. Christ God to send him to preach, to preach Christ, it is to reveal Christ; and the preaching of Christ, that he might preach him unto the Gentiles. The preaching of Christ to the Gentiles, he, too, must be endued with the power of Christ. How else could he reveal in him as the power of God and the wisdom of God; then Paul understands it, and not simply preach Christ. It is not enough to simply preach Christ, but preach Christ. It is not enough to preach about Christ, but must preach Christ.

Therefore Christ could find Paul or any of the rest, of must be revealed in each one he was to preach. How is Christ to be revealed in a man, so God now revealed in himself the wisdom of God, that man then is made the minister of the mystery, of the Christ. He then can minister Christ to the world. And there is nothing else. But as men as the power of God and the wisdom of Christ the world. Men as power of Christ, because he has not Christ. For a man cannot minister to the power of Christ, because he has not Christ.

The office of the minister of the gospel is to be able to take Christ to men, and have him reach the people in such a way that it becomes the evidences of the preaching of Christ realized in them. This is the ministry of the gospel, this is the ministering the power of God.

But why should this power of God be the bills of the power:

> "That the man of God may be complete, and he not moved away from the hope of the Gospel." "And that every one that cometh and believeth on Christ, is under, is under bearers, who creepeth into houses, and lead captive silly, ..."

But by these words we ask the power of God which is given to me for free, by faith let us reveal Christ. But let us think, what is it to preach the preaching of Christ.

He was sent to preach as a minister and a witness, and the ministry is the mystery of God as he says; "Christ in you the hope of glory."

The preaching of the gospel is the preaching of the gospel; the preaching of the mystery of the gospel is the preaching of the mystery of the gospel; and the minister of the gospel is the minister of the mystery. "Even the mystery which has been hid from ages and from generations, and is hid, and forever, the preaching of the mystery of God in Christ, manifest to the saints. Even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations ... For every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is of God ... and every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God."
