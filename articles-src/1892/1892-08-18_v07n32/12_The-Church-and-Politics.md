The Church is a heaven-born institution. Its work is to bring man to Christ. To the Church is committed the work of reconciliation. Of the Church, Christ said: "Ye are not of the world, even as I am not of the world," and, "Be not ye unequally yoked together with unbelievers." In the days of Christ, his Church was clothed with the power of the Spirit of God. She was then in her purity, but as she grew in numbers, she inclined to the world. As she drank of the spirit of the world, she lost the power of the Holy Ghost. Many of the leaders became corrupt; and soon it was "Like priest, like people;" the bishops each desirous of vainglory and self-exaltation; so it was with the Church. As she had lost the power of the Holy Ghost, she sought the power of the civil arm. As she departed from the living God, the institutions of God were supplanted by the institutions of men. Many pagan institutions were christened and became the institutions of the Church. Not conscious of her fall, she supposed she was right, and all others wrong, so, the evil-doer must be restrained. As she could not do this by the power of that Spirit which she had lost, she allied herself to the State. She secured the control of the civil arm, and used it for the interests of the Church. The bishops became political wire-pullers; and the Church a religio-political organization. Thus was developed the Papacy; and as she was, in her own opinion, the true church, and everybody else was wrong, and, to the Church was committed the work of correcting the evil-doer, she set about the work of making Christians by law.

The most successful step in this line, as history shows, was the securing of severe Sunday laws. This led to persecution. But Catholics deny that the church ever persecuted; she only sustained the law. But the church was responsible for the law. The law was in the interests of religious institutions; and they invaded the realm of conscience. Therefore the enforcement of the law was religious persecution, and the church did persecute. As she was only a religio-political organization, and controlled the civil arm for the enforcement of her own institutions, she has always been only a persecuting power. Now this is one picture. Protestants will say it is a true picture. Now look at another picture, and see if it is not equally true.

The Reformation began. The Reformers protested against the encroachments of the Papacy. A mighty work was accomplished, for it was of God. Protestants multiplied, but a change came in. Popularity, pride, and the love of the world has well nigh crowded out the spirit of true piety. As they have leaned to the world, the spirit of Christ has departed. Having lost the spirit of Christ, they lean to the mother church. The ways of Rome are fast becoming the ways of Protestants. In the mother they now see beauties, where heretofore they only saw deformities. The dross, to them, now shines like the pure gold, and they cater to her wishes. Few there be who any longer protest. With her they have entered the political arena. Like her, unconscious of the loss of holy power, they seek the power of the civil arm, to enforce upon others the institutions of the Church, some of which she borrowed from the mother church. With her, they are becoming intolerant. As she did, so do they. As she was most successful when she secured her Sunday laws; so they are demanding the same Sunday laws, that they, too, may make Christians (?) by law. Can it be that Protestantism is a failure? Are Protestants making an image to the Papacy, and is it to be a living image? Are they setting up an image of worship, which will yet be used by Rome as an aid in becoming mistress of the world? I call upon Protestants to awake. Soon, too soon, it will be too late. Rome has her clutches upon the vitals of this Nation, and Protestants are forging their own chains. Did I say Protestants? It is fallen Protestants that are doing this; the true will never do it. True Protestants still protest.
