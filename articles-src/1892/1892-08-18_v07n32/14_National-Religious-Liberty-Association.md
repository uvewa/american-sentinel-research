## National Religious Liberty Association.

THE *Peoria Transcript* thinks that perhaps the way Sunday's quiet observance of rest why Sunday's quiet observes a rest was a secure the "desecration" of Sunday at the World's Fair is destined to become a lesson in practical politics.

At a meeting of the Brotherhood of Carpenters, just held at St. Louis, Mo., a resolution was passed requesting all the trade and labor unions on Sunday, and petitioning Congress to remember the same.

At the second annual convention of the Catholic Total Abstinence Union of America, held in Baltimore, a paragraph was adopted favoring the setting apart of Sunday in the opening of the World's Fair on Sunday. The question was much mooted upon often and was finally accepted.

EPHRAIM LYMAN GLASS, of the World's Fair Directory. — "We should close Saturday afternoon, open next December and end for the repeat of the Sunday closing clause." He also has to reiterate the sentiment of the reading of the people of this country. Will the people be brought to the surface. Political sentiments and methods do change, and if we can convince Congress that the people are not in favor of the Sunday closing of the World's Fair, on account of the clause we now have a movement to open it. But this, however, is something that will require time, and will have to be done the other way, we will have to do it ourselves.

THE *New York Morning Advertiser* says the agitation about closing the World's Fair on Sunday goes on day and night. The authorities that close upon that day must not be taken as an expression of the opinion of the people. It is only the outgrowth of the churches. This prohibitory clause has its foundation on a plea of great merit on behalf of labor. We ought to accept the conditions attended, it will be a long time before we can do anything about it.

On the Sunday the opening of the National Military Park at Chattanooga, a very large crowd. The *Chattanooga Times*, in its city, the correspondent of the *New York Times* says:—

"To day for the first time the American National Military Park at Chickamauga was opened to the public. The opening day was associated with one of the greatest reunions of the soldiers of the late war. The doors of the museum were opened for the first time, and the commanding point on the battle-field was thrown open. People of all classes were there, few taken the grounds. Arrangements were made to take visitors to the points of interest, but the majority preferred to walk over the field and battle grounds of the battle of Chickamauga. Few persons used the conveyances. There were some that walked about and strolled for homes in the cool and well lighted grounds." All this on Sunday. Did the Government which resulted from the Sunday opening in behalf of this War Monument as a set of religious desecration? Congress simply kneel of opposition to the hand of the Almanac of Wautoma and Oshkosh?
