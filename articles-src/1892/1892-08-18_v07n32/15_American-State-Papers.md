## "American State Papers"

WE have really entered on the downward grade of restricting and curtailing religious liberty literature. We earnestly implore every reader of the SENTINEL to take a close, earnest, and thoughtful interest in this. It must be apparent to all that there can be nothing more important at this time.

It is a book that will be of inestimable value to put in the hands of editors, lawyers, and men of that class. But while it is good for them, it is none the less valuable for all classes. Perhaps we could not emphasize the importance of this book in a better way than by quoting the following letter from Elder A. J. Breed:—

I am very glad to learn that you are making an effort to circulate the "American State Papers." When I first read the book I could not lay it down until the first part of the first copy was issued; and read it carefully, and
