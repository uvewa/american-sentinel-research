# At the Georgia Convention of the Endeavorers.

*Trinity, Fla., Aug. 10, 1892.*

"SAM SMALL," so many the Atlantians call him, "was a stranger in its cause to make him halt, and all things end in a speech." In his talk to the Endeavorers

> he did say a new use for an indication of the people is the voice of God and should be obeyed.

Where does this Christian gentleman get his information that we have reached a time when we can safely rely on the people of this country, for we are of those of the people's "almost the prophets, crusts" that fold, confront the true really and in a multitude of other wicked ruling. But I positively settled that they will never do to exercise the voice of God.

In the same respect Mr. Small further said:

> General Cleveland invited that some of those who are for getting the trigger into his issue on their side, and then, and all of these, can come in.

This language is not very becoming to a third or fourth class politician from the ranks, and yet it comes from a representative of the refined, cultured and accomplished clergy of our country. It is merely another expression to such rulings of respect. At it is a fine thing!
