A MEETING in the interest of the American Sabbath Union was held in the Market St., Methodist Episcopal Church, Paterson, New Jersey, on the night of August 7. The attendance was large, and the speakers were apparently in a jubilant mood over the passage of the Quay amendment to the bill appropriating funds to the World's Fair.

The speaker of the evening was the Rev. Mr. George, Field Secretary of the American Sabbath Union. He had the ten commandments read in the opening exercises, and began his address by reading from Isaiah 58:13: "If thou turn away thy foot from the Sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on my holy day." After repeating with emphasis the words, "the Sabbath," he said, "I believe a great deal in a name, and have never fully liked the name 'Sunday.'" No wonder; who would like it when trying to bolster up a heathen festival with scripture intended wholly for the seventh day?

During the entire meeting there was not the least mention of the "civil Sabbath," about which we heard so much when this "Union" was first organized; but, on the other hand, Mr. George, while talking about the Sunday mails, remarked that, "There is no more religion in such work than in hitching up to the plow, and plowing all day." Then in a burst of oratory in regard to the passage of the Quay amendment, closing the World's Fair on Sunday, he said it was "the grandest victory of the age, the Nation putting itself on the side of God, and his holy law." In fact his entire address was divested of everything pertaining to a civil day. The speaker went farther than to rejoice over what has been done, and said, "I have learned that . . . we hold the United States Senate in our hands." Concerning the future work of themselves as dictators, he said that they should say to Congress, "You are our servants; quit running those Sunday trains."

As usual with such speakers, Mr. George classed all seventh-day observers with the infidel, atheistic, socialistic, and rum element, in opposing the passage of Sunday laws, and said, "We met these men face to face, . . . and the men we had to meet were the Seventh-day Adventists and the men I have mentioned." As he spoke the name of this denomination he fairly hissed it through his teeth, and to show the real demon spirit in the move he said of the proposed attempt to repeal the Sunday closing clause, "It can not be repealed. We mean to maintain it . . . at the point of the bayonet."

It must be very patent to the readers of THE SENTINEL that the "entering wedge" of religious legislation, of which its editors have been telling us, has already done its work.
