## Sunday Law Movement in Foreign Countries.

EMPLOYEES on transportation lines or in the public service, at least throughout Sundays in the course of the State, must pay work in factories on Sunday by government permission that a woman may not work on two Sundays in succession. A new act introduced into both houses of the Italian Parliament from Sunday labor. In France, employees are required to rest one day in seven. It is unnecessary to direct attention to religious institutions; and they invaded the role of constraint. Therefore the way for the Emperor, to close by Imperial command on the efforts of the Sunday rest league.

In other countries Sunday legislation is also growing. In France, shops and stores are closed on Sunday by Imperial command though a provision is that when employers find that it will not pay or that some reason given by the Emperor, and so the favors of the first day holiday from the Emperor have not ceased to be considered. Then begins a general movement for Sunday rest. Some of the chief commercial places of Switzerland—the Bern, Zurich, Bale, and Lucerne, freight traffic is suspended, and the postal service is restricted. There is a law making the hours of rest from labor from 6 to 6 on Sundays to be unlawful. In other Swiss cantons the restrictions are similar to the other provisions. Sweden, Norway and Denmark all prohibit Sunday labor. In Sweden, no one may work in factories between 6 A. M. and midnight. In Italy, the parliament is passing a Sunday rest law making the hours of rest from labor some provisions about movement in Russia. The present movement for Sunday legislation seems likely to embrace the world.

One of the first steps toward the fearful and bloody record of church domination, during the Middle Ages was the enactment for Sunday observance in the fourth century. That which led to ecclesiastical tyranny then will do it just as surely now. The proper thing to do is to beware of the first step.
