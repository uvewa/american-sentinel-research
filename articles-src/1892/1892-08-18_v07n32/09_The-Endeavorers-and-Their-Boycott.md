## The Endeavorers and Their Boycott.

AT the Ohio Christian Endeavor Convention, held in this city, the Endeavorers of Ohio, at the motion of the taking of the vote for the adoption of resolutions asking of Congress to require the Sunday closing of the World's Fair, rose in a body and shouted to other names the resolution.

The convention to the whole as a consuls refused to do so. The Christian Endeavor Society of Ohio, then resolved that it will not attend the World's Fair if it is open on Sunday. The resolutions asked managers of the Fair should intercede in demanding Congress to reverse the recent day closing proviso before the World's Fair. Ohio Endeavorers will be there. Only those bound to stay away. Such a self-denial would really be felt a slight stimulus for the franchised repetitioned petitions running to legislatures, which were usurped from, and for which they bear their proportionate responsibilities.
