THOSE who have sought that the Congress of the United States should legislate in favor of religion have been successful. It was certain that they would succeed, sooner or later. Just how and when this would be accomplished could not have been foretold. Success has come to them even more quickly than they themselves thought. The character of these men and their movements can be well judged by the way they bear themselves in success.

THOSE who have sought this action from Congress have almost been taken unawares by results favorable to them on all quarters. The decision of United States Judge Hammond, in the case of R. M. King, of Tennessee; the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States, in the case of the Church of the Holy Trinity vs. the United States, that this is a "Christian Nation;" the favorable expression of the Senate and House upon every bill touching the observance of Sunday brought before them during their last session; and finally, the passage of the Sunday-closing proviso to the World's Fair appropriation, all mark an unbroken and steadily progressing line of decisions, and legislation favorable to national religion—religion by law and by decree of the court.

THIS is what they sought. They have gained their dearest wish. Success has run to meet them in the way. Who are they that have sought this? They are the theologians; the doctors of divinity; the pastors, and preachers, and elders, and deacons of the churches; the membership at large of almost all the so-called orthodox denominations; the influential feminine element of the country in the Woman's Christian Temperance Union; the tens of thousands of the youth of the Christian Endeavor Society; and many other organizations for religious purposes; these are they who have sought this. Those whose profession it is that they walk in the footsteps of the meek and lowly Jesus; those who are supposed to be the highest human exponents of the Christian graces. We shall know what to look for, then, as the result of their labors. By their fruits we shall know them. The branches of the true vine will bear the fruits of the Spirit.

THESE fruits are love to all men, long-suffering and tender kindness, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance, freedom from envy and vainglory, provoking no man, fulfilling the law in loving their neighbors as themselves, bearing their neighbor's burdens, and where their neighbor is taken in a fault restoring him in a spirit of meekness.

Here, then, we can look for the noblest earthly growth of these heavenly fruits in the results of the earnest labors of these zealous pastors and masters, and their apt pupils. In this, the moment of their success, the gentle and Christ-like character of these, who have told us that their sole earthly enthusiasm is to enthrone Christ upon the earth, will be made manifest. Their success will fill them with the blessed joy of the larger opportunity to do good unto all men, and more particularly to spread abroad the blessing of their increased power unto good works among those that are of the household of faith.

ROBERT M. KING, an earnest, simple-hearted, God-fearing man, was brought before the justice court of his township in the State of Tennessee, touching a matter concerning the law of his God. No fault was found in him, but as concerning the law of his God he was held and fined. Again he was brought before the Circuit Court as regards the same matter, fined and imprisoned; his case appealed, the Supreme Court of the State sustained the conviction; carried to the United States Court, a reversal is denied, and the prisoner remanded. Remanded? On what charge? — A question touching the law of his God.

Other arrests on similar charges are delayed, awaiting the passage of this case through the courts. The decision against the prisoner is hailed as authoritative precedent for further arrests. They are made. Four Christian men are imprisoned, and when they refuse to pay pecuniary fines, and have no property for the sheriff to sell, they are put to labor upon the public road with common criminals, in a gang driven by an armed overseer. In the meantime, by a dictum outside the line of decision necessitated by the conditions of the case at bar, Justice Brewer, of the United States Supreme Court, had shown that it would be futile to carry their cases to the Supreme Court of the land. And he showed this by deciding that this is a "Christian Nation." Is there any contradiction here, or is there not? Here is a result of the success gained in Congress and courts by those who seek legislation and legal decisions in favor of religion. Are these the fruits of the Spirit? Can we know them by such fruits as these.

In commenting upon these particular cases the Churchman, of New York, says:

> The Tennessee Sunday law being what it is, the Sunday earnings of seventh-day Tennesseeans would seem to be liable to confiscation in the shape of fines, and the judge gave good advice, when he said, in this particular, "Let them educate their consciences by the laws of Tennessee."

This is the Christian advice and brotherly counsel of the Churchman, and that of the Christian Statesman is like unto it—when it suggests that such persons be "urged to move for their own emancipation;" and elsewhere says:

> In most of the States such private work by those who observe another day, is not punishable, but so long as it is forbidden by law, the judge rightly insists that it must not be done.—A "Tennessee Sabbath Union" has been organized at Knoxville in that State.

Is there no contradiction here? Of what spirit are these the workings?

Is it a fruit of the Spirit to vaunt itself and to be puffed up? Yet a "Pittsburg preacher" tells us:—

> That the Church has weight with great political or governing bodies has been demonstrated most effectually in the late World's Fair matter, when the United States Senate, the highest body in the country, listened to the voice of religion and passed the World's Fair appropriation bill with the Church instituted proviso that the gates of the great Exposition should not be opened upon Sunday. That grand, good fact suggests to the Christian's mind that if this may be done, so may other equally needful measures. The Church is gaining power continually and its voice will be heard in the future much oftener than in the past.

What voice will be heard oftener? The voice of prayer and praise, of thoughtful charity for the widow and the fatherless, offering food to the hungry and clothing to the naked; the voice of tender sympathy for the erring, of brotherly comfort to those who are in prison, persecuted and reviled for His sake? Is this the voice that is to be heard oftener henceforth, or is it the voice of authority in the halls of Congress and legislative assemblies and courts of law? That voice which senators of the United States have declared it is "not wise statesmanship to disregard." That is the voice, and that is where it is to speak. Is this one of the fruits of the Spirit?

CONGRESS has now heard this voice and obeyed. Of the form of its reply the Mail and Express most felicitously says: The form of the law is happy. It gives a premium of $2,500,000 on doing right. It proves in a concrete way that "godliness hath great gain."

So the World's Fair has two millions five hundred thousand dollars worth of godliness! And is this one of the fruits of the Spirit? Certain it is that those who have secured this godliness for Chicago and the World's Fair are determined to compel its acceptance and retention at any price. The Statesman declares that if the directors should show any such "madness" as an inclination to refuse this financial godliness, the commission would veto such action and the patriotism of the Nation would boycott the Fair. The secretary of the Sabbath Union says that the godliness which the Columbian Exposition is thus paid to receive will be maintained "at the point of the baronet." Is this the fruit of the Spirit? Can we know these men and their movement by their fruits? Can we judge of them by the way they bear themselves in success?
