We have called attention to the importance of circulating religious liberty literature. We trust that our workers throughout the field will take a lively interest in this. It must be apparent to all that there can be nothing more important at this time. We want to circulate our position on this Sunday legislation question just as widely as possible. And as the people learn that our knowledge of the prophecy is really what has urged us out in this line, and as they see that our positions on Sunday laws, and the persecutions that are to follow, are absolutely correct, many will accept the truth, believe and be saved. Hence the great importance of sowing the seed now, that the great harvest may be reaped by and by.

Those who engage in this work should be well informed on the subject. And if we will take the pains to read our literature, we can have a deep understanding of this very important theme. Especially would we urge ministers, directors, and other laborers in the field to read this literature, and then impress upon all with whom they come in contact, the importance of reading and studying it. Then as they enter the field to engage in this important work they will feel that they are not afraid to meet people and talk with them on this subject, and they will also feel the importance of the work more, as they understand it better.

"American State Papers" is one of the best books to give a correct idea of the principles of religious freedom that were in the minds of the founders of our Government, that we have ever published. Every one of our ministers and workers should read it, and circulate it as widely as possible. It is a book that is especially suitable to place in the hands of editors, lawyers, and men of that class. But while it is good for them, it is none the less valuable for all classes. Perhaps we could not emphasize the importance of this book in a better way than by quoting the following letter from Elder Geo. A. Irwin:—

> I am very glad to learn that you are making an effort to bring "American State Papers" more prominently before the people. I purchased one of the first copies issued, and read it carefully, and am free to say that, in my judgment, it is the best work extant, to inform one in regard to the principles of religious liberty as embodied in the Constitution, and sustained by eminent statesmen and jurists, with few exceptions, until the recent past.
>
> The book is a perfect magazine from which to draw arguments against the passage of Sunday laws, or resolutions by legislative bodies, favoring any particular day as a day of religious worship.
>
> The Appendix, giving the "declaration of rights" of the several States, and a "history of Sunday legislation from the famous edict of Constantine to the present time," is worth several times the price of the book.
>
> I shall do what I can to aid in giving the book a general circulation in Ohio, knowing that in so doing I am benefiting both the individual and the cause.

We trust that a lively interest will be everywhere taken in the circulation of this book. Send all your orders to Pacific Press Publishing Co., 43 Bond St., New York, or to the Review and Herald, Battle Creek, Mich.
