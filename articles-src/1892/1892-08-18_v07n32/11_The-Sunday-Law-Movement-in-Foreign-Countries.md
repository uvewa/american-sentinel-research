The following from the Michigan Christian Advocate, of July 16, gives something of an idea of how rapidly the theory is spreading that Sunday observance should be compelled by law:—

> Never has the subject of Sabbath observance attracted such universal attention as at present. Many of the nations have passed laws regulating Sunday work. Some of these show very advanced sentiment in regard to the keeping of the Lord's day. In Austria, women and minors are forbidden to work in factories on Sunday, and a government permit is necessary in order to carry on any manufacturing business on that day. Sunday evening and Monday morning papers are not allowed, as the work of them must be done on Sunday. Switzerland gives all workmen employed in mills, factories or shops, the entire day, and all employees on transportation lines or in the public service, at least seventeen Sundays in the course of the year. In extreme cases, or in the interest of the State, men may work in factories on Sunday by government permission, but must not work two Sundays in succession. A new and important railway has made absolute freedom from Sunday traffic, for twenty-five years, a clause in its charter. In France, employees are required to rest one day in seven, but that is not necessarily the Sabbath. Shopping and public business are decreasing in consequence of the efforts of the Sunday rest league. In Germany, factories, mills and workshops of all kinds are closed on Sunday by imperial command. Bazaars and shops may not remain open more than five hours. Sunday race-meetings are frowned upon by the Emperor, and as the favors of the powers that he is necessary to success, they are very unsatisfactory affairs. In Holland there is a general movement for Sunday rest. Some of the most influential papers have ceased to issue their Sunday numbers, freight traffic is suspended, and laws are passed protecting women and minors from demands for Sunday labor. Hungary has laws making the hours of rest from labor from 6 P. M. on Saturday to midnight on Sunday. The rest movement is gaining ground rapidly in other particulars. Sweden, Norway and Denmark all have restrictive Sunday laws, the latter forbidding work in factories between 9 A. M. and midnight. While the most urgent petitions have been sent to the head of the church, there has been no advance in the Sunday movement in Russia. The utmost disregard for the Sabbath is manifested in many respects, the people seeming to forget that there is any Sabbath to observe. Upon the whole, the situation is most encouraging, and shows marked improvement within a few years as well as evidences of a still further advance in the near future.

One of the first steps toward the fearful and bloody record of church domination, during the Middle Ages was the enactment for Sunday observance in the fourth century. That which led to ecclesiastical tyranny then will do it just as surely now. The proper thing to do is to beware of the first steps.
