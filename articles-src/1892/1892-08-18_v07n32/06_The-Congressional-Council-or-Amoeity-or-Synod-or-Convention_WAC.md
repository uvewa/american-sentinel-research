# The Congressional "Council," or Amoeity, or Synod, or Convention.

REFERRING to the recent discussion in Congress over the closing of the World's Fair on Sunday, the chaplain of the Senate, J. Q. Butler, D.D., says, in the *New York Independent*, of July 7: "During this debate you might have imagined yourself in a general council, or assembly, or synod, or conference," held for religious, not political, purposes. In truth, "it sounded exactly as if it was," a religious "council" throughout. Such was also the nature of the discussion in certain religio-political organizations in the early centuries of our era, when Church and State were united, and when the Roman emperor, assuming the role of the dragon, gave to papacy "his power, and his seat, and great authority." This same Senate chaplain, in the same paper, says: "Never since humanity in the world avowed hostility to God, his day should be unholy and sold, and the Lord's day and kingdom, remain a public servant of private." And I think it is right to say that Government is being laid upon a religious foundation such as those United States are regarded as a qualification for officers of public trust under it—a thing that Thomas Jefferson meant to prohibit forever.

But a system of government which will remand a citizen to private life because of a certain attitude toward religion, will also remand a citizen from private life to prison, though he believe in God, his day and word and home and kingdom, if he does not believe in them in accordance with the "orthodox" faiths, and conform with the religious edicts of the majority. Proof of this is furnished in the recent prosecution in Tennessee. Because Seventh-day Adventists, after conscientiously keeping the Sabbath of the Lord, the seventh day, did some quiet work on their farms on Sunday, as was their God-given right, they were indicted, arrested, and taken from their honest toil, presented as criminals; convicted, fined, tried in a public article in payment of the fine and costs imposed. And when, as in one case special was taken from even the court, the closing words of the last decision were, "Be remanded to the protection."

Let those religionists who congratulate themselves over the present condition of affairs in this Government, ponder the practical workings and logical outcome of it all. Bitter persecution and certain national ruin is the portion hung at the end of the assurance. And let not those professed Protestants who are joining hands with papacy in order to carry their religious measures through Congress and State Legislatures think that there shall be peace before them. In the end they will reap destruction and persecution from what they now receive in this way. Romanism has now entered the way that it is through his law.

An author who stated the case in the following words: "Let the principle once become established in the United States, that the Church may employ or control the power of the State, that religious observance may be enforced by secular law; in short, that the authority of Church must lead is to dominate the conscience, and the territory of Rome in this country will be assured." God's word has given warning of the impending danger; let this be unheeded, the Protestant world will learn what the purposes of Rome really are, only when it is too late to escape. Beware. She is silently growing into power. Her doctrines are exerting their influence in legislative halls, in the churches, and among the people. She is piling up her lofty and massive structures in the secret recesses of which her former persecutions will be repeated. Stealthily and unsuspectedly she is strengthening her forces to fortify her own ends when the time shall come for her to strike. All that she desires is vantage ground, and this is already being given her. We shall soon see and shall what the fortune of the Roman element is. Whatever our Protestants cannot take of it, she will get, and thereby ruin their reproach and persecution.

W. A. COLCORD.
