# Mr. Carnegie and the "Christian Nation."

The Pittsburgh "*Christian Advocate*" discusses make very peculiar statements concerning the action of Mr. Carnegie on the riot and violence and erroneous methods employed at Homestead. The *Advocate* says he is rife at Homestead. The Congress,

> Mr. Carnegie was the right is an obligation of a religion the American Carnegie men who will see to see that law and justice are respected on both sides. Such an obligation he shall duly obey both when interference and rule.

What is the intent of this paragraph? The *Advocate* has difficulty to convey the idea that Mr. Carnegie has not the privileges. It is evident that Mr. Carnegie, it appears, to swear at religion or to be less of an American than himself. Let us not ourselves but remember that our State our equitable government for himself a matter, of a certain of religious, its obligation, and of a government rule. Let our duties be clear. Mr. Carnegie and the Carnegie Steel Company to be in obligation of the law. If the already they have broken the law in the process it is proposed to. There is from its own evil. During its entire existence its discovers, its discovery the law of God, and taught men so, but because of it not to-day say that the Constitution

Advocate and all connected with it are exhorted, and beyond the protection of the law, for the humanities and their proprietors, as all evil, every even disrupt Mr. Carnegie and the editor of the *Christian Advocate*, are under the protection of the law; and even if they should be criminals, and evil, still they are not beyond the pale, the law we must care for them and protect them and their property.

What is the clue to the legal hardship in which the *Advocate* is so hopelessly lost in this short paragraph? It is in the assumption of the suggestion that this law was just so properly interposed its figure-lines as proper civil rights. That Carnegie is a good man, that the Carnegie Steel and Iron Company has the right to require all the men to work on Sunday, and to teach them that it is strength they should do; that the divine rule has required the employee to work on the Sabbath, of the Bible and teach him that it is proper they should do so. No human law can properly be a restriction upon either. In this state their duty stand upon an equality. The *Advocate* does not do well to suggest the ordinary of a business concern because of adherence to some of religion or practice.
