## The Reformation Began.

The Reformation began. The Reformers protested against the encroachments of Papacy. A mighty work was accomplished, for it was of God. Protestantism multiplied, but it has a change lesson.

Vanity, pride, and the love of the world has once again worked, and with the spirit of those from the departed. As they have leased to the world, the spirit of Christ, they had to the mother church. The ways of Rome became her ways. As they left the principles they had, in the mother they now are bemoaning, the spirit of Christ, they lost the power. The dross, to dross, now advise like the beginning and have taken another step. For there be who no longer protest. With her they have entered the political arena. Like her, unconscious of the loss of that power, they seek the power of the civil arm, to enforce upon others the institutions of the Church, some of which she borrowed from the mother church. With her, they are becoming intolerant. As she did, so do they. As she was successful when she secured her Sunday law, so they are threatening the Sunday laws, that they, too, may make Christians by force. "Is Protestantism a failure? Are Protestants becoming more conservative or is it to be a living image?" Are they settling to go on it one for themselves, which will not be used by Rome as she did in becoming mothers of all evil? I call upon Protestantism to awake. Soon, too soon, it will be too late. Rome has laid her claims upon the vitals of this Nation. Protestants are forging their own chains. But I say Protestantism. It is fallen Protestantism that are doing this in the true spirit and works of Rome. Risen Protestantism will keep out of the snare of the Papacy.
