> "Manifestly there is an irreconcilable difference between Papal principles and the fundamental principles of our free institutions. Popular government is self-government. A nation is capable of self-government only so far as the individuals who compose it are capable of self-government. To place one's conscience, therefore, in the keeping of another, and to disavow all personal responsibility in obeying the dictation of another, is as far as possible from self-control, and therefore wholly inconsistent with republican institutions, and, if common, dangerous to their stability."—*Rev. Josiah Strong.*

When we remember that National Reform principles are essentially Papal principles, we see in the above a strong indictment of so-called National Reform.
