# Puritan “Rights.”

Rev. Geo. C. Adams, writing from St. Louis to the *Advance* about the Sunday law, says:—

> “The charge is freely made that it is an effort to make a ‘Puritanical ’ Sunday, and so it is; for the Puritan certainly believed in equal rights for all, and was not willing to allow any privileged classes.”

Yes, indeed! The Puritans of New England “certainly believed in equal rights for *all” Puritans,* but they just as certainly believed in no rights at all for anybody else, not even the right to *live,* in New England. They were indeed “not willing to allow any privileged classes” except Puritans. In them were summed up all rights and privileges, even to the right and privilege of hanging Quakers and witches, whipping Baptists, and banishing dissenters of all kinds, under pain of death. Theirs was the right to compel people to go to church on Sunday and listen to sermons such as, said one of the victims, “was meat to be digested, but only by the heart or stomach of an ostrich.” Theirs was the right to tie women to the tails of carts and drag them through New England towns, at the same time lashing them upon the bare back with heavy two-handed whips made of three thongs “of twisted and knotted cord or catgut,” while one of the “privileged” preachers looked on and laughed at such an infliction as, if suffered to be completed, would have amounted to one hundred and ten lashes each, as the poor women were dragged through dirt and snow half-leg deep, and the weather bitter cold. And all because the women had the impudent presumption to claim the right and privilege of being Quakers. In this case when the poor, tortured women had been lashed through three towns with ten stripes each in each town, the people arose in their righteous indignation and set the “ghastly pilgrims” free.

Oh, yes, the Puritan was indeed “not willing to allow any privileged classes”! But may Heaven protect this dear land from any revival of Puritan rule, or any other rule according to Puritan principles.

We are sure that this nation does not one- half—half! no not one one-hundreth part— appreciate the wonders that National Reform proposes to accomplish for her. Just think of it. When National Reform shall have succeeded in setting its buzzard securely upon the Nation’s Capitol, in place of the American Eagle, then, O then,

No pestilence shall ever croak,

Nor famine flap its wings;

No earthquake e’er shall walk abroad,

Nor cyclone scatter things.

This is not exactly as they express it, but it is the substance of what the Reformed Presbyterians promise the Nation by National Reform, and they know all about it, for Reformed Presbyterianism is the mother of National Reform. And in their late Synod at Newburg, N. Y., their committee on National Reform said that when the nation shall have accepted the National Reform condition, “Revolution will not overturn the Government; pestilence will not spread its wings over the people; famine will not scorch the broad acres, nor blight the waving field; the earthquake will not shake down cities, nor the cyclone tread homes into ruins.”

And these are the men who talk of “folly and fanaticism” in those who oppose National Reform!

Mr. M. A. Gault says in the *Christian Nation:—*

> “Let us say for the thousandth time that we are eternally opposed to uniting Church and State in the sense of compelling men by civil law to observe church regulations as such.”

> “In the sense, etc.,” and “as such,” to be sure. They are opposed to the union of Church and State “i*n the sense*”—but why are they not opposed to it in any sense whatever? Why is it necessary for the National Reformers always to leave themselves a loop-hole through some saving clause or qualifying phrase? The reason is manifest, they are not opposed, either eternally or temporally, to the union of Church and State *in some sense,* and so they always conveniently leave the way open for themselves to explain in just what sense they are opposed to it.
And, too, they are opposed to compelling men by civil law to observe church regulations *“as such.”* Of course. But if only the church regulation can be enforced by the civil law as a “police regulation,” as is proposed with the “Christian Sabbath,” for instance, then it is all right, and anybody who opposes that is a “brazen despot” and a “political atheist.”
