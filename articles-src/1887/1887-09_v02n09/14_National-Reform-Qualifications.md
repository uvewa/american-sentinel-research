Mr. M. A. Gault says in the *Christian Nation:—*

> "Let us say for the thousandth time that we are eternally opposed to uniting Church and State in the sense of compelling men by civil law to observe church regulations as such."

> "In the sense, etc.," and "as such," to be sure. They are opposed to the union of Church and State "i*n the sense*"—but why are they not opposed to it in any sense whatever? Why is it necessary for the National Reformers always to leave themselves a loop-hole through some saving clause or qualifying phrase? The reason is manifest, they are not opposed, either eternally or temporally, to the union of Church and State *in some sense,* and so they always conveniently leave the way open for themselves to explain in just what sense they are opposed to it.
And, too, they are opposed to compelling men by civil law to observe church regulations *"as such."* Of course. But if only the church regulation can be enforced by the civil law as a "police regulation," as is proposed with the "Christian Sabbath," for instance, then it is all right, and anybody who opposes that is a "brazen despot" and a "political atheist."
