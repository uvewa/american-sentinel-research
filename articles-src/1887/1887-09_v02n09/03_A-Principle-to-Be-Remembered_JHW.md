An editorial in the *Christian Nation* of October 27, 1886, on "The Henry George Movement," contained the following sensible remarks:—

> "Let those who feel tempted to vote for George remember that at its commencement the French Revolution was inspired by ideas much more moderate than those of George, and that its early heroes were greater and better men than he. Yet these men could not control the rebellious spirit which they had aroused, and soon fell victims to its fury. A very ordinary person may be the means of stirring up class jealousy and hatred, but no man can control the masses when once saturated with that feeling, or tell what horrors they may commit before their passions are satiated or their power to do evil can be checked."

These words are worthy of careful consideration. In truth, Henry George is an Anarchist under a very flimsy disguise. In a speech recently given near the place of this writing, he disavowed the intention to confiscate the titles now held to lands. He would only confiscate the rent or use of them! The man who has toiled to obtain and improve a farm may be graciously permitted to retain his deed; but others shall be at liberty to use the land at their will, without any recompense to him whose labor made it available and valuable. You may retain the title to the house you built, but you may not claim any special right to its use. But the fact is well known that they who use property for which they never toiled, especially if they have no disposition to toil, use it recklessly. A house which would last many years in the care and use of its builder, who has a freehold right to it, would last but a few years under the care or neglect of one who never toiled for it, and could have no special right to it. He might soon be dispossessed by one stronger than he, and all incentive to preserve property would be taken away. And when it was destroyed—when there was a general wreck of the usable property first confiscated—who would furnish the next supply?

But it is not *the land* that these Anarchists want; it is the avails of other people's labors. There is a vast amount of land in the domain of the United States, open to them to possess if they want it. But they do not want *that land.* It will take labor and pains to make it usable and available, and labor is the very thing which they are determined to avoid. They want that which has been rendered valuable and available by the toil of others. Theirs is the spirit of theft and robbery under another name. But their plan would prove more disastrous than ordinary stealing; it would not only take your property without leave or remuneration, it would prevent your accumulating any more. It would destroy all property rights, upon which society and Governments are established. The first generation of Anarchists might thrive for a while upon their ill-gotten gains, but their children would have to return to honest labor or starve.

But there is another class of Anarchists which we must notice in order to faithfully apply the principle involved in the quotation we have made. They would indignantly reject the name, yet they are easily identified. These are *speculators.* While they fear the ravages of *more violent Anarchists* than themselves, they are yet *practical Anarchists.* They set the bad example of taking the avails of the labors of others without rendering any equivalent. They appropriate means for which they never labored—which they never earned. There are men who roll in wealth, who boast of their millions, who never spent a day in honest toil to accumulate their possessions. They speculated in stocks, or, may be, in the necessaries of life; they manipulated the means for which others labored, without adding one penny to its value, or giving a penny in return for it. What is this but an example to Anarchists, an incentive to the reckless and violent to forcibly take from them the abundance which they have fraudulently taken from others.

These men are so blinded by selfishness that they do not know that they are the instigators of anarchy. Their wrong has been done so quietly, so peacefully, that, to them, it does not seem possible that it should lead to the disruption of society. But they must see that there is a growing restlessness over this state of things, and when it breaks forth the result will be fearful. And they need not think that the cause is not sufficient to produce such a result. These are the very things which arouse the jealousies and the fiercest passions of the reckless—which stir up the spirit of anarchy. One man may start a stone at the top of a mountain, which all the world cannot stay in its progress of destruction. A child may make an opening in a dam, which soon becomes a torrent which no human power can check.

But we would have it distinctly understood that we do not use the word *speculator* as synonymous with *capitalist.* The enterprising, public-spirited capitalist is a boon to any country. In his sphere he is as necessary to the growth and improvement of the country, [66] as he who labors with his hands. True, capital without labor is useless; but labor without capital is inefficient. Ten thousand laborers would never dig a canal nor build a railroad, without skill and capital to direct and keep them in orderly activity. It is as impossible, in a growing, civilized State, to make labor independent of capital as to make capital independent of labor. All combinations professedly having in view the freedom of the laborer from the calls of capital, are sheer deceptions. There is more coerced servility of laborers in the Knights of Labor, trades unions, etc., than can be found in the republic under the dominion of capital. Thousands of men are often compelled to leave positions of profit, without any complaint against their employers, perhaps to lose their situations altogether, at the caprice of some "supreme head" or "grand master."

During the crusade of the misnamed "Workingmen," in San Francisco, a few years since, contracts to the amount of $3,000,000 were canceled because the capitalists were not willing to place their property where it would be subject to the fury of an angry mob, which was threatening destruction to the city. This $3,000,000 ought to have gone into the hands of *bona fide* laborers, and circulated among the trades-people, who, in many cases, suffered for the want of it. At that time the worst enemy of the workingmen was Denis Kearney, the leader of the rabble, who was making money by duping the credulous with hopes of more than the inexorable laws of trade would afford them for their labor. While he was denouncing the capitalists, and encouraging idleness and discontent, the capitalists were giving remunerative employment to thousands, which was a greater benefaction than if they had given their means to the rabble, stopped their public works, and gone to work with their own hands. For surely he who keeps a thousand hands employed is a greater public benefactor than he who only labors with his own two hands.

Thus far on the subject of the *Nation's* comment on Henry George. But the ideas presented by the *Nation* look in another direction and have another application. It truthfully says: "A very ordinary person may stir up class jealousy and hatred, but no man can control the masses when once saturated with that feeling, or tell what horrors they may commit before their passions are satiated, or their power to do evil checked." And it is a fact that no class jealousies have been so bitter, no persecutions so unrelenting, as those which have been raised and carried on in the name of religion, professedly for the glory of God and for the upbuilding of his cause. And it is not to be disputed that the spirit of bigotry and religious intolerance is abroad in the land. The rapid growth of this National Reform movement, is the very strongest proof of this. In the early days of this movement, the *Statesman* ridiculed the fears of the Seventh-day Baptists and the Seventh-day Adventists; it said the Amendment they propose, if carried into effect, would never touch a hair of their heads; and that there was no reason why these parties should not co-operate with the "Reformers," as they were seeking security for the rights of "all classes." But after a season they grew more confident, and a prominent speaker in their National Convention said that the Seventh-day Baptists were to be classed with atheists! only to be "tolerated" while they did not conflict with "my faith." If this is not the spirit of Popery, we do not know where it shall be found.

Let the reader turn again to the April number of the Sentinel, to the speech of Senator Crockett, of Arkansas, and consider what Seventh-day Baptists and others had to suffer in that State, *for keeping the seventh-day Sabbath, *just as the commandment reads. It is useless to say that they were being punished for working on the first day of the week, for there were many citizens working on that day; but the officers, *instigated by professed Christians, *refused to entertain charges against any but those who had kept the seventh day! Read Senator Crockett's speech for the facts, and consider that similar scenes have been enacted in other States, and that in all cases *prominent members of the churches* have opposed such changes in the laws as would make such religious persecutions impossible! Now mark the consistency and liberality of the National Reformers; not a single one of their papers, nor any paper in sympathy with them, nor any officer of their association, as far as we have been able to learn, has spoken a word in condemnation of these persecutions. No; they well understand, and ardently desire, that what has been done in a few States shall be done in all the land, under the authority of Congress, against dissenters from "the characteristic faith of the nation," if they succeed in having their Amendment adopted.

As the *Nation* said, that "the French Revolution was inspired by ideas much more moderate than those of George," so the horrors of the Inquisition were ushered in by professions and reasons as mild and plausible as those of the National Reformers. When we consider the general diffusion of knowledge, both secular and religious, the recognition of civil and religious rights, at the present time, as compared with the time of Loyola, of Justinian, or of Constantine, our National Reformers suffer by comparison with the advocates of "National Christianity" in those days. Well would it be for our country if they would lay to heart the words of the *Christian Nation, *that "no man can control the masses when once saturated with that feeling" of "classjealousy and hatred." The whole bent of the National Reform movement is to lay a solid foundation for "that feeling." Even now they avow the purpose to render ineligible to office in the Government, and to disfranchise, those not "in the faith"—the religious faith— to be adopted by the Government. They coolly talk of "tolerating" other Christians, earnest and consistent Bible believers, but only on condition that they do not come in conflict with the "established religion;" tolerate them as they would tolerate "the insane," only as long as they "did not rave" about their own religion, or publicly advance their own conscious convictions. Surely, perilous times are at hand, when such sentiments grow and spread in the land. We can only contemplate with horror what scenes of relentless persecution will be seen, what bitterness of fury will be manifested, when the masses once become "saturated with that feeling," when a constitutional provision shall set loose their passions, and clothe the bigoted and prejudiced with power over their weaker neighbors. "God to the weaker pity send" in that day. J. H. W.
