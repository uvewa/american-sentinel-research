Rev. Geo. C. Adams, writing from St. Louis to the *Advance* about the Sunday law, says:—

> "The charge is freely made that it is an effort to make a 'Puritanical ' Sunday, and so it is; for the Puritan certainly believed in equal rights for all, and was not willing to allow any privileged classes."

Yes, indeed! The Puritans of New England "certainly believed in equal rights for *all" Puritans,* but they just as certainly believed in no rights at all for anybody else, not even the right to *live,* in New England. They were indeed "not willing to allow any privileged classes" except Puritans. In them were summed up all rights and privileges, even to the right and privilege of hanging Quakers and witches, whipping Baptists, and banishing dissenters of all kinds, under pain of death. Theirs was the right to compel people to go to church on Sunday and listen to sermons such as, said one of the victims, "was meat to be digested, but only by the heart or stomach of an ostrich." Theirs was the right to tie women to the tails of carts and drag them through New England towns, at the same time lashing them upon the bare back with heavy two-handed whips made of three thongs "of twisted and knotted cord or catgut," while one of the "privileged" preachers looked on and laughed at such an infliction as, if suffered to be completed, would have amounted to one hundred and ten lashes each, as the poor women were dragged through dirt and snow half-leg deep, and the weather bitter cold. And all because the women had the impudent presumption to claim the right and privilege of being Quakers. In this case when the poor, tortured women had been lashed through three towns with ten stripes each in each town, the people arose in their righteous indignation and set the "ghastly pilgrims" free.

Oh, yes, the Puritan was indeed "not willing to allow any privileged classes"! But may Heaven protect this dear land from any revival of Puritan rule, or any other rule according to Puritan principles.
