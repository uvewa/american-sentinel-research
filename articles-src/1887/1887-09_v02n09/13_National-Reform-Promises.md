We are sure that this nation does not one-half—half! no not one one-hundreth part—appreciate the wonders that National Reform proposes to accomplish for her. Just think of it. When National Reform shall have succeeded in setting its buzzard securely upon the Nation's Capitol, in place of the American Eagle, then, O then,

No pestilence shall ever croak,

Nor famine flap its wings;

No earthquake e'er shall walk abroad,

Nor cyclone scatter things.

This is not exactly as they express it, but it is the substance of what the Reformed Presbyterians promise the Nation by National Reform, and they know all about it, for Reformed Presbyterianism is the mother of National Reform. And in their late Synod at Newburg, N. Y., their committee on National Reform said that when the nation shall have accepted the National Reform condition, "Revolution will not overturn the Government; pestilence will not spread its wings over the people; famine will not scorch the broad acres, nor blight the waving field; the earthquake will not shake down cities, nor the cyclone tread homes into ruins."

And these are the men who talk of "folly and fanaticism" in those who oppose National Reform!
