In this number of the Sentinel we print in full another letter from a National Reformer, and also the answer to it. We are glad to do so, because we are willing that our readers shall know what the Reformers can say for themselves. The letter we printed before, the *Christian Statesman* took bodily from our columns and gave its readers not so much as a hint that there was ever any reply made to it. We write this note especially to say to the *Christian Statesman* that unless it can print both the letter and the reply to it, we want it to let the letter itself alone. If the *Statesman *cannot afford to be fair, we desire that it shall at least be honest.
