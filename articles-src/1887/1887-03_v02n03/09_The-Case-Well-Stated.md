# The Case Well Stated.

The following letter to one of the workers in (he office of the Sentinel, shows that thinking people realize that the work of the National Reform party seriously threatens the liberty of this country, and makes such a paper as the Sentinel a necessity:—

Louisville, Ky., Jan. 21, 1887.

> “Dear Sir: Yours of the 2d, and the January number of the American Sentinel are received. I have carefully read and considered both, and would say that L fully indorse the sentiments of the Sentinel, as being the only safe doctrine for the people of this nation and the only safe-guard for religious liberty.

> “Our fathers wisely provided in the Constitution that: ‘Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.’ They were quickened in their wisdom by the times in which they lived (a fact which their children seem to have forgotten), and this with the knowledge of the certain fact that history will repeat itself. If the National Reform party could but substitute their proposed amendment for this wise and beneficent provision, the end of the present century would find religious persecution substituted for religious freedom.
> “A State which prescribes religion, prescribes conscience, or a moral sense of duty to God, and here is the end of practical piety, the country’s peace, and the people’s freedom. If the omnipotence of God is not sufficient to demand acknowledgment of himself, as the author of the nation’s existence, and of Jesus ‘Christ as its ruler,’ ‘and the Bible as the supreme rule of its conduct,’ then that religion is a mockery, which proposes a constitutional amendment to supply the imperfections of Deity.
> “It is suggested by the amendment to make this ‘a Christian nation.’ It would hardly be adopted before the question would arise as to who are Christians—and this would result in a fight more bitter than will ever be made to secure the adoption of the proposed amendment—if it ever should be adopted. There is but one conclusion to the National Reform party. They seem to have forgotten the history of every country in the world, and they also seem to have forgotten the causes that lead to the enactment of the constitutional provision before quoted. No king, prince, or potentate ever committed as many depredations upon human rights as have professed Christians under the guise of saving souls. To escape such, our ancestors camo to this land of freedom. Yours respectfully,
James T. Milburn.

The remark recently made by a writer in the *Christian Statesman* that “a Christian is one who in theory is obedient to Christ,” seems to throw considerable light upon the National Reform idea of Christianity, and explains how this can be made a Christian nation by constitutional amendment. If obedience in theory is all that is required, Congress can of course furnish it in any quantity desired.

The following suggestion by the *Catholic Review,* we find adopted into the editorial columns of the *Christian Statesman.* It is an important item in the steadily growing Sunday movement:—

> “The time is near at hand when those who have so warmly advocated eight hours as a workman’s day, will find it necessary to agitato for six days as a workman’s week. If the labor organizations are really anxious for an issue on which they can have the help of the vast majority of the American people, lot them take up this of Sunday labor. They will find enormous obstacles to contend with in the wide-spread avarice of the non-Catholic workingmen as well as of the capitalists. If the limit of a day’s labor to eight hours is calculated to restrain the over-production to which they object, the cessation of Sunday labor, which is now carried on to an extent enormously in excess of what the general public is disposed to believe, would exercise a a still further restraint in this direction. If the labor associations are sincere in their professions, they will find that temperance— if not total abstinence—on all days of the week, and the Christian observance of the Lord’s day, will tend greatly to diminish many of the evils of which they justly complain.”

We have not the least doubt that this thing will be done soon. We fully expect soon to see the labor organizations throughout the country, busily agitating for “six days as a workman’s week,” and the churches and preachers, both Roman Catholic and Protestant Catholic, all loudly cheering on the agitation. The *Christian Statesman* may congratulate itself for that will be a mighty re-enforcement to National Reform [25].
