# "Foundation in Usage."

The *Christian Statesman* of Nov. 11, 1886, contains the first part of an article, by "the Rev. John M'Naugher," entitled, "The State and the Sabbath." Its opening remarks we wish to notice. It opens thus:—

> "In advocating that the body politic should officially acknowledge the Lord's day and secure it against secular uses, one cannot be charged with being a flighty theorist. That doctrine is time-honored and has been in actual operation for fifteen centuries. Ever since the issuing of Constantine's memorable edict, a. d. 321, the Sabbath as a weekly rest-day has been a fixture in the common law of the civilized world."

This reference to the action of Constantine, in this relation, is certainly significant, and very fitting. It is conceded by all that Constantine was the first to attempt to unite the Christian religion with the "body politic;" it is a fact of history that by him was laid the foundation for all the ecclesiastical usurpations of the Roman Papal system, and that his patronage of the church has been a curse to the cause of Christianity, the influence of which is felt even to the present time.

Let us first examine Constantine's "memorable decree," and we will then consider its import, and the relation that this notable emperor sustained to the Christian religion at the time of his issuing this decree. The following is the decree, of date March 7, 321:—

> "Let all the judges and town people, and the occupation of all trades, rest on the venerable day of the sun; but let those who are situated in the country, freely and at full liberty attend to the business of agriculture, because it often happens that no other day is so fit for sowing corn and planting vines; lest the critical moment being let slip, men should lose the commodities granted by Heaven."

Not only by this writer in the *Statesman,* but by a multitude of religious teachers of the present day, this decree of Constantine is recognized as the foundation of all "Sabbath" or "Lord's day" legislation; as the first recognition by the "body politic" of the usages or institutions of Christianity. But nothing, can be more easily shown than that this decree was not made in the interest of Christianity; that it did not respect the Sabbath or Lord's day; and that it was not issued by a Christian ruler.

The reader will notice that the decree was partial; that it related only to certain classes, leaving other classes to still pursue their usual avocations; and that it was respecting "the venerable day of the sun." Now we appeal with confidence to every student and reader of the Bible, that in all the Scriptures there is no such day or institution known as "the venerable day of the sun." And we affirm that, in this decree, Constantine not only did not *mention* any Christian institution, but he had *no reference* to any Christian institution.

On this point let such a reputable writer as Dr. Schaff testify:—

> "He enjoined the civil observance of Sunday, though not as *dies Domini* [Lord's day], but as *dies solis* [day of the sun], *in conformity to his worship of Apollo,* and in company with an ordinance for the regular consulting of the *haruspex* (321)."—*History of the Christian Church, vol. 2.*

The edict of the sun's day was issued March 7; that for consulting the haruspex was issued the day following, March 8. This edict of March 8 concerned the inspection of the entrails of beasts as a means of foretelling future events. It was a heathen practice, and the decree was a heathen edict, made by a heathen ruler. This of itself is sufficient to show in what light we must regard his edict for honoring "the venerable day of the sun."

Dr. Schaff says that Constantine issued his sun's day decree "in conformity to his worship of Apollo." Who was Apollo, and what relation did his worship bear to reverencing "the day of the sun"? Webster says: "A deity among the Greeks and Romans, and worshiped under the name of *Phoebus,* the sun."

On this point Gibbon furnishes decisive evidence:—

> "The devotion of Constantine was more peculiarly directed to the genius of the sun, the Apollo of Greek and Roman mythology; and he was pleased to be represented with the symbols of the god of light and poetry. . . . The altars of Apollo were crowned with the votive offerings of Constantine; and the credulous multitude were taught to believe that the emperor was permitted to behold with mortal eyes the visible majesty of their tutelar deity. . . . The sun was universally celebrated as the invincible guide and protector of Constantine."—*Decline and Fall, vol. 2, chap. 20.*

And again, a note on the same page says:—

> "The panegyric of Eumenius, which was pronounced a few months before the Italian war, abounds with the most unexceptionable evidence of the Pagan superstition of Constantine, and of his particular veneration for Apollo, or the sun."

The Encyclopedia Britannica says:—

> "The notion of conversion in the sense of a real acceptance of the new religion, and a thorough rejection of the old, is inconsistent with the hesitating attitude in which he stood towards both. Much of this may indeed be due to motives of political expediency, but there is a good deal that cannot be so explained. Paganism must still have been an operative belief with the man who, down almost to the close of his life, retained so many heathen superstitions. He was at best only half-heathen, half Christian, who could seek to combine the worship of Christ with the worship of Apollo, having the name of the one and the figure of the other impressed upon his coins."—*Art. Constantine.*

Of the religion of Constantine, and of the sun god, Dr. Schaff thus speaks:—

> "At first, Constantine, like his father, in the spirit of the Neo-Platonic syncretism of dying heathendom, reverenced all the gods as mysterious powers; especially Apollo, the god of the sun, to whom, in the year 308, he presented munificent gifts. Nay, so late as the year 321 he enjoined regular consultation of the soothsayers in public misfortunes, according to ancient heathen usage; even later, he placed his new residence, Byzantium, under the protection of the God of the martyrs and the heathen goddess of fortune; and down to the end of his life he retained the title and dignity of a *Pontifex Maximus,* or high priest of the heathen heirarchy. His coins bore on the one side the letters of the name of Christ, on the other the figure of the sun-god, and the inscription, *Sol invictus."—Church History, vol. 2.*

Once more we hear Dr. Schaff in regard to the life and character of Constantine:—

> "When at last on his death bed he submitted to baptism, with the remark, 'Now let us cast away all duplicity,' he honestly admitted the conflict of two antagonistic principles which swayed his private character and public life."—*Church History, vol. 2.*

Much, very much, historical evidence may be added to show the character of Constantine, of whom the Encyclopedia Britannica says: "Tested by character, indeed, he stands among the lowest of all those to whom the epithet [great] has in ancient or modern times been applied."

But this is the man who gave to the world the legacy of Church and State; who caused the State to "serve the interests of the Church;" and who lent the strength of his empire to "maintain and enforce the true religion;" to whose action the *Statesman* so approvingly refers as a warrant for and example of "Sabbath legislation." But never was a more groundless claim set up than that of ascribing to Constantine the issuing of an edict in favor of the Sabbath. His edict was heathenish—that, and that only, as all reliable history attests.

What was the effect of his patronizing or serving the interests of the church? He elevated the bishops to the dignity of civil magistrates, especially the bishop of Rome, whom he invested with the primacy. An early historian said:—

> "Constantine likewise enacted a law favoring the clergy, permitting judgment to be passed by the bishops when litigants preferred appealing to them rather than to the secular courts; he enacted that their decree should be valid, and as far superior to that of other judges as if pronounced by the emperor himself; that the governor and military officers should see to the execution of these decrees; and that sentence, when passed by them, should be irreversible."—*Sozomen, Ecclesiastical History.*

To such a state of things our National Reformers aspire, when the "final decision" shall be with "the churches and the clergy."

But what was the effect of the State thus "serving the interests of the church," and "upholding and maintaining the true religion"? With all reliable writers there is but one decision on this point. We can only give sample statements:—

> "Passing rapidly from a state of distress and persecution to the summit of prosperity, the church degenerated as rapidly from her ancient purity, and forfeited the respect of future ages in the same proportion as she received the blind veneration of her own. Covetousness, especially, became almost a characteristic vice."—*Hallam, Middle Ages.*

> "This sudden change was followed by an almost total loss of the simplicity and purity of the days of persecution. Magnificent churches were erected by the emperor in Rome, adorned with images and pictures, where the bishop sat on a lofty throne, encircled by inferior priests, and performing rites borrowed from the splendid ceremonial of the pagan temple. The bishop of Rome became a prince of the empire, and lived in a style of luxury and pomp that awakened the envy or the just indignation of the heathen writer, Marcellinus. The church was now enriched by the gifts and bequests of the pious and the timid; the bishop drew great revenues from his farms; . . . the proudest women of Rome loaded him with lavish donations, and followed him with their flatteries and attentions. . . . The bishopric of Rome now became a splendid prize, for which the ambitious and unprincipled contended by force or fraud."—*Eugene Lawrence, Historical Studies, art. Bishops of Rome.*

Want of space forbids our further pursuing this line of evidence. We will give a brief summary of the acts of the life of Constantine which seem to have a bearing on his inconsistent position as a pagan and a professed Christian.

A. D. 312, professed to have a vision of the cross. There is, however, no evidence that he ever spoke of such a thing before the year 322.

313, issued the edict of Milan, stopping persecution on account of religion.

321, March 7, issued a decree that certain classes abstain from labor on "the venerable day of the sun." This was afterwards, by his obsequious bishops, adopted as "the chief festival of the church." See Catechisms of the Catholic Church.

321, March 8, issued a decree for consulting haruspices—a practice purely pagan.

323, according to the opinion of Mosheim, made a profession of Christianity. Other writers give a later date.

324, murdered Licinius, in violation of his solemn oath.

325, convened the council of Nice, and presided over its deliberations.

325, after the council, revoked the edict of Milan, and copied the penal regulations under which Diocletian had persecuted the Christians, and employed them in persecuting those who did not accept the Catholic faith.

326, murdered his son Crispus, and his nephew Licinius, and a great number of their friends.

330, May 11, dedicated Constantinople to the virgin Mary.

337, near the close of his life was baptized into the Christian faith.

Some have endeavored to shield his character as a Christian by placing his conversion subsequent to his atrocious murders in 326; but in so doing they remove it still farther from the date of his Sunday edict, and have him presiding over the council of Nice before he professed Christianity. It is a "mixed case" do the best they can.

They who can confidently decide that Constantine was a genuine Christian at *any time* in his life—anything but a crafty politician and a selfish ruler—must be able to adjust the balances very accurately to show where Christianity predominates over paganism! We believe that paganism may exist and flourish with any amount of *profession* of Christianity; but we do not believe that Christianity can exist with both the *profession* and *practice* of paganism. For this reason we cannot admit that Constantine ever was a Christian.

Our writer in the *Statesman* says:—

> "Our affirmation, therefore, that the State sustains a protective relation to the Sabbath, cannot be made light of as a novelty. It has a foundation in usage even though this has been and is lamentably defective."

He well says that that for which they are laboring "has a foundation in usage," and in nothing higher. And the origin of this usage is traced to Constantine, whose legacy to the church has been a standing curse to the cause of Christianity for fifteen hundred years. J. H. W.
