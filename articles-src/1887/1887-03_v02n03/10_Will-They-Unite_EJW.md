# Will They Unite?

A clergyman, the pastor of a Presbyterian Church, sends us the following appreciative letter:—

"Berwick, Penn., Jan. 27, 1887.

> "American Sentinel, Oakland, Cal.—*Gentlemen:* This afternoon I found the American Sentinel for December, 1886, and part of a copy of the *Signs of the Times.* In the former are several articles which I have read with intense interest; among which are, 'Is It Blindness or Duplicity?' 'Infidel Views of the Logic of Christianity,' 'The American Hierarchy,' and 'The American Papacy.'

> "In one thing you must be mistaken, viz., that 'whenever the Roman Catholics are willing to co-operate in resisting the progress of political atheism, we [Protestants of the Presbyterian denomination] will gladly join hands with them.'
> "Oh, but you reply, the *Christian Statesman *said so in an editorial December 11, 1884. Well, that does not make it true. And what is more to the purpose, the thing cannot possibly ever take place. To entertain the thought for a moment is the very romance of madness. Certain persons may have expressed themselves in these very words to that effect. But [23] that the mass of Protestant Christians have any wish so monstrous and idiotic, yes, impossible, I will not and cannot believe, the Rev. S. F. Scovel, and others, to the contrary, notwithstanding.
> "But go ahead, write, protest, show all the facts upon the subject.
> "I believe you are honest, sincere, in dead earnest, and if you can show mo how to guide my way better than in the past, I will take it well.
> "I am, gentleman, with respect, yours,
"James Dickson."

We heartily believe that our reverend brother is as earnest and sincere as we are. If all professed Protestants were like him, no doubt it would be an impossibility to unite with Catholics. But, unfortunately, instead of looking toward the light, as he is, they are looking away from it. Wo assure our friend that while any sort of a union between Catholics and Protestants is indeed "monstrous," the thought that it will erelong be an accomplished fact is neither "idiotic" nor "the romance of madness." To believe it requires no faith whatever; one has only to observe the signs of the times.

We do not base this belief on a single statement of the *Christian Statesman,* nor indeed upon any statement of that paper, professing a willingness for such union. As a matter of fact, however, that paper is editorially committed to just such a union. These statements in the *Christian Statesman* are, however, only the natural result of the teachings of National Reform. As we have abundantly shown, the principles of National Reform are identical with those of the Papacy. Both believe that the State should support the church. Both believe in the persecution of heretics— those who think and act for themselves contrary to the "established" religion; and both hold in the main to the same points of doctrine. Having these points of similarity, and working for the same object, it is the most natural thing in the world that the two bodies should unite their interests.

When all National Reformers see, what their leaders already see, that they cannot accomplish their purpose without the aid of Catholics, an alliance with that church will be speedily effected.

The name of Dr. A. A. Hodge, of Princeton, is an honored one among Presbyterians. He was not "idiotic," nor one who indulged in the "romance of madness," but was a clearheaded, deliberate man, who knew what he was about In an article in the Princeton *Review* for January, 1887, he said:—

> "All we have to do is for Catholics and Protestants—disciples of a common Master— to come to a common understanding with respect to a common basis of what is received as general Christianity, a practical quantity of truth belonging equally to both sides, to be recognized in general legislation, and especially in the literature and teaching of our public schools. The difficulties lie in the mutual ignorance and prejudice of both parties, and fully as much on the side of the Protestants as of the Catholics."

The article in which these words occur, which declare that Catholics have an equal amount of truth with Protestants, and that they should unite their interests, is quoted by the *Occident,* of San Francisco (Presbyterian), whose editor calls it "a dying legacy of this able and lamented minister," and says that "these suggestions are worthy of earnest consideration." We know of few prominent religious journals which have not expressed similar sentiments.

It is a fact that must be patent to anyone who is conversant with current religious news, that among Protestants the Catholic Church is being regarded with more and more favor. There is a feeling that the Catholic Church has changed, or that at any rate it has been misjudged. That church is now counted as a branch of the Christian Church, having its specific work to do, just as the Methodists, Presbyterians, Episcopalians, etc. The barriers between Catholics and professed Protestants are continually being broken down; and when it is found that certain legislation in behalf of "religion" cannot be brought about without the co-operation of Catholics, Protestants will not only accept their aid, but will sue for it. We could give instances where this has already been done.

Let our brother remember one thing: The Catholic Church will not change its characteristics, nor abate one iota of its arrogance; and when National Reform, with the aid of the Catholic vote, shall have succeeded, Roman Catholic principles will predominate, and we shall have in this country an American Papacy, with all that that implies.
