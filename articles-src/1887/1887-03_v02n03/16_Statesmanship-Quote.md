"Statesmanship cannot save the country. Christ's refusal to be made a king, and his rejection of Satan's offer of the world's scepter, ought to teach those who seek to save the world, that moral means are necessary to moral ends. Christ saw that the world could not be saved by legislation, and that only by his being lifted up could all men be drawn unto him. He saw that he could not save the world without sacrificing for it; no more can we. The saving power of the church is its sacrificing power."—*Rev. Josiah Strong.* Common sense sentiments like these cannot be given too great prominence. National Reformers stand sadly in need of them.
