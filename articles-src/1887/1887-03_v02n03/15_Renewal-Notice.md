Many who read this number of the American Sentinel have been enjoying its visits for a year. Do you want it continued? Then do not delay your renewal. We do not believe that anyone who has read the Sentinel for a whole year, would willingly forego the pleasure and profit for the future; but some may not realize that their subscription has expired. Please examine the label on your paper, and if it reads March, '87, send in your renewal at once, and thus save us the trouble of taking your name off our list and then putting it on again. Remember that your personal assurance, with the cash, is the only means we have of knowing whether you appreciate the paper, and how much.
