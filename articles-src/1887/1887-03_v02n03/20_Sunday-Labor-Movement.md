The following suggestion by the *Catholic Review,* we find adopted into the editorial columns of the *Christian Statesman.* It is an important item in the steadily growing Sunday movement:—

> "The time is near at hand when those who have so warmly advocated eight hours as a workman's day, will find it necessary to agitate for six days as a workman's week. If the labor organizations are really anxious for an issue on which they can have the help of the vast majority of the American people, let them take up this of Sunday labor. They will find enormous obstacles to contend with in the wide-spread avarice of the non-Catholic workingmen as well as of the capitalists. If the limit of a day's labor to eight hours is calculated to restrain the over-production to which they object, the cessation of Sunday labor, which is now carried on to an extent enormously in excess of what the general public is disposed to believe, would exercise a still further restraint in this direction. If the labor associations are sincere in their professions, they will find that temperance—if not total abstinence—on all days of the week, and the Christian observance of the Lord's day, will tend greatly to diminish many of the evils of which they justly complain."

We have not the least doubt that this thing will be done soon. We fully expect soon to see the labor organizations throughout the country, busily agitating for "six days as a workman's week," and the churches and preachers, both Roman Catholic and Protestant Catholic, all loudly cheering on the agitation. The *Christian Statesman* may congratulate itself for that will be a mighty re-enforcement to National Reform.
