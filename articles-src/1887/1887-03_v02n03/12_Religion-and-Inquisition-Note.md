The Boston *Pilot* (Catholic) says: "No good government can exist without religion." That is straight National Reform doctrine, and every National Reformer would say amen to it. But the *Pilot* continues: "And there can be no religion without an Inquisition, which is wisely designed for the promotion and protection of the true faith." If the first proposition is true, the second must also be true; and no one who accepts the first can dissent from the second. If there is national religion, there must be an Inquisition, or its equivalent, and punishment for heresy. National Reform contends for national religion; hence a National Reform government will of necessity persecute.
