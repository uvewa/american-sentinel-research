# Will They Unite?

A clergyman, the pastor of a Presbyterian Church, sends us the following appreciative letter:—

“Berwick, Penn., Jan. 27, 1887.

> “American Sentinel, Oakland, Cal.—*Gentlemen:* This afternoon I found the American Sentinel for December, 1886, and part of a copy of the *Signs of the Times.* In the former are several articles which I have read with intense interest; among which are, ‘Is It Blindness or Duplicity?’ ‘Infidel Views of the Logic of Christianity,’ ‘The American Hierarchy,’ and ‘The American Papacy.’

> “In one thing you must be mistaken, viz., that ‘whenever the Roman Catholics are willing to co-operate in resisting the progress of political atheism, we [Protestants of the Presbyterian denomination] will gladly join hands with them.’
> “Oh, but you reply, the *Christian Statesman *said so in an editorial December 11, 1884. Well, that does not make it true. And what is more to the purpose, the thing cannot possibly ever take place. To entertain the thought for a moment is the very romance of madness. Certain persons may have expressed themselves in these very words to that effect. But [23] that the mass of Protestant Christians have any wish so monstrous and idiotic, yes, impossible, I will not and cannot believe, the Rev. S. F. Scovel, and others, to the contrary, notwithstanding.
> “But go ahead, write, protest, show all the facts upon the subject.
> “I believe you are honest, sincere, in dead earnest, and if you can show mo how to guide my way better than in the past, I will take it well.
> “I am, gentleman, with respect, yours,
“James Dickson.”

We heartily believe that our reverend brother is as earnest and sincere as we are. If all professed Protestants were like him, no doubt it would be an impossibility to unite with Catholics. But, unfortunately, instead of looking toward the light, as he is, they are looking away from it. Wo assure our friend that while any sort of a union between Catholics and Protestants is indeed “monstrous,” the thought that it will erelong be an accomplished fact is neither “idiotic” nor “the romance of madness.” To believe it requires no faith whatever; one has only to observe the signs of the times.

We do not base this belief on a single statement of the *Christian Statesman,* nor indeed upon any statement of that paper, professing a willingness for such union. As a matter of fact, however, that paper is editorially committed to just such a union. These statements in the *Christian Statesman* are, however, only the natural result of the teachings of National Reform. As we have abundantly shown, the principles of National Reform are identical with those of the Papacy. Both believe that the State should support the church. Both believe in the persecution of heretics— those who think and act for themselves contrary to the “established” religion; and both hold in the main to the same points of doctrine. Having these points of similarity, and working for the same object, it is the most natural thing in the world that the two bodies should unite their interests.

When all National Reformers see, what their leaders already see, that they cannot accomplish their purpose without the aid of Catholics, an alliance with that church will be speedily effected.

The name of Dr. A. A. Hodge, of Princeton, is an honored one among Presbyterians. He was not “idiotic,” nor one who indulged in the “romance of madness,” but was a clearheaded, deliberate man, who knew what he was about In an article in the Princeton *Review* for January, 1887, he said:—

> “All we have to do is for Catholics and Protestants—disciples of a common Master— to come to a common understanding with respect to a common basis of what is received as general Christianity, a practical quantity of truth belonging equally to both sides, to be recognized in general legislation, and especially in the literature and teaching of our public schools. The difficulties lie in the mutual ignorance and prejudice of both parties, and fully as much on the side of the Protestants as of the Catholics.”

The article in which these words occur, which declare that Catholics have an equal amount of truth with Protestants, and that they should unite their interests, is quoted by the *Occident,* of San Francisco (Presbyterian), whose editor calls it “a dying legacy of this able and lamented minister,” and says that “these suggestions are worthy of earnest consideration.” We know of few prominent religious journals which have not expressed similar sentiments.

It is a fact that must be patent to anyone who is conversant with current religious news, that among Protestants the Catholic Church is being regarded with more and more favor. There is a feeling that the Catholic Church has changed, or that at any rate it has been misjudged. That church is now counted as a branch of the Christian Church, having its specific work to do, just as the Methodists, Presbyterians, Episcopalians, etc. The barriers between Catholics and professed Protestants are continually being broken down; and when it is found that certain legislation in behalf of “religion” cannot be brought about without the co-operation of Catholics, Protestants will not only accept their aid, but will sue for it. We could give instances where this has already been done.

Let our brother remember one thing: The Catholic Church will not change its characteristics, nor abate one iota of its arrogance; and when National Reform, with the aid of the Catholic vote, shall have succeeded, Roman Catholic principles will predominate, and we shall have in this country an American Papacy, with all that that implies. E. J. W.

In the New York *Independent* of January 6, President Washburn, of Robert College, Constantinople, has an article on “Eastern and Western Civilization,” in which occur the following paragraphs, which we commend to the careful consideration of National Reformers, who hold that civil government should be paternal:—

> “The idea of Eastern civilization is ‘paternal-government.’ The people are children, not of a modern father, but of the Old World father, who was the irresponsible master of his family.

> “Western civilization utterly repudiates this idea, denies the existence of any analogy between the family and the State, and seeks to make *men* and not *children* of the people.
> “A paternal government, under exceptional circumstances, may for a time secure a certain amount of material prosperity and even of moral and intellectual development, but in general this system must develop a type of character where the virtues of childhood are not only exaggerated at the expense of those which are the glory of manhood, but are liable also to be extinguished by the vices of a manhood uncontrolled by reason or conscience.” [24]
The Boston *Pilot* (Catholic) says: “No good government can exist without religion.” That is straight National Reform doctrine, and every National Reformer would say amen to it. But the *Plot* continues: “And there can be no religion without an Inquisition, which is wisely designed for the promotion and protection of the true faith.” If the first proposition is true, the second must also be true; and no one who accepts the first can dissent from the second. If there is national religion, there must be an Inquisition, or its equivalent, and punishment for heresy. National Reform contends for national religion; hence a National Reform government will of necessity persecute.

For the last three months a largo number of people have been receiving the American Sentinel through the courtesy of friends. We should be greatly pleased to have these persons become subscribers on their own account. Many of the best minds in the country are convinced that there is urgent need of just such work as is being done by the Sentinel, and it is the only paper in the United States that is doing the work. Let a l who feel that a union of Church and State would bo a calamity, rally to the support of the journal that is doing battle for liberty of conscience and for civil rights. Wo confidently look for a largo increase in our regular subscription list.

Speaking of Japan, the *Christian Statesman *says: “Open opposition to Christianity has ceased; the peril is of another sort—that sho will accept the form of Christianity without knowing its power.” It would seem that the *Statesman* should find no fault with that, as it is just what the National Reformers propose to have done in this country. Here they even profess to believe that its accomplishment will usher in the millennium. However the climate may make some difference; and possibly something more than an act of Congress or an imperial decree is needed to convert the natives of Japan—and it is possible that the sequel may show that something more is needed to *convert* people here.

Many who read this number of the American Sentinel have been enjoying its visits for a year. Do you want it continued? Then do not delay your renewal. We do not believe that anyone who has read the Sentinel for a whole year, would willingly forego the pleasure and profit for the future; but some may not realize that their subscription has expired. Please examine the label on your paper, and if it reads March, ’87, send in your renewal at once, and thus save us the trouble of taking your name off our list and then putting it on again. Remember that your personal assurance, with the cash, is the only means we have of knowing whether you appreciate the paper, and how much.

“Statesmanship cannot save the country. Christ’s refusal to be made a king, and his rejection of Satan’s offer of the world’s scepter, ought to teach those who seek to save the world, that moral means are necessary to moral ends. Christ saw that the world could not be saved by legislation, and that only by his being lifted up could all men be drawn unto him. He saw that he could not save the world without sacrificing for it; no more can we. The saving power of the church is its sacrificing power.”—*Rev. Josiah Strong. *Common sense sentiments like these cannot be given too great prominence. National Reformers stand sadly in need of them.

Let it never be forgotten by any lover of civil or religious liberty that were the Constitution of the United States to be amended as the National Reform Association demands that it shall be, it would necessarily follow that the Christian religion, which would then be the State religion, would have to be defined by law. And it would naturally follow also that the courts would be called upon to decide *what Christian,* and *who are Christians. *For the proposed *regime* “would disfranchise every logically consistent infidel,” and all will be considered as infidels who chance to differ with the National Reform idea of Christianity, even in a single particular.
