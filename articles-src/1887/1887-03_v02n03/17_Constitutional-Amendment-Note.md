Let it never be forgotten by any lover of civil or religious liberty that were the Constitution of the United States to be amended as the National Reform Association demands that it shall be, it would necessarily follow that the Christian religion, which would then be the State religion, would have to be defined by law. And it would naturally follow also that the courts would be called upon to decide *what is Christian,* and *who are Christians.* For the proposed *regime* "would disfranchise every logically consistent infidel," and all will be considered as infidels who chance to differ with the National Reform idea of Christianity, even in a single particular.
