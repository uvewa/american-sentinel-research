Speaking of Japan, the *Christian Statesman *says: "Open opposition to Christianity has ceased; the peril is of another sort—that sho will accept the form of Christianity without knowing its power." It would seem that the *Statesman* should find no fault with that, as it is just what the National Reformers propose to have done in this country. Here they even profess to believe that its accomplishment will usher in the millennium. However the climate may make some difference; and possibly something more than an act of Congress or an imperial decree is needed to convert the natives of Japan—and it is possible that the sequel may show that something more is needed to *convert* people here.
