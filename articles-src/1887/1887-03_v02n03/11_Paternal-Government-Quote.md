In the New York *Independent* of January 6, President Washburn, of Robert College, Constantinople, has an article on "Eastern and Western Civilization," in which occur the following paragraphs, which we commend to the careful consideration of National Reformers, who hold that civil government should be paternal:—

> "The idea of Eastern civilization is 'paternal-government.' The people are children, not of a modern father, but of the Old World father, who was the irresponsible master of his family.

> "Western civilization utterly repudiates this idea, denies the existence of any analogy between the family and the State, and seeks to make *men* and not *children* of the people.
> "A paternal government, under exceptional circumstances, may for a time secure a certain amount of material prosperity and even of moral and intellectual development, but in general this system must develop a type of character where the virtues of childhood are not only exaggerated at the expense of those which are the glory of manhood, but are liable also to be extinguished by the vices of a manhood uncontrolled by reason or conscience."
