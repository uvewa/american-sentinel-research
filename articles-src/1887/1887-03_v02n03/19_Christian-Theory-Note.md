The remark recently made by a writer in the *Christian Statesman* that "a Christian is one who in theory is obedient to Christ," seems to throw considerable light upon the National Reform idea of Christianity, and explains how this can be made a Christian nation by constitutional amendment. If obedience in theory is all that is required, Congress can of course furnish it in any quantity desired.
