For the last three months a largo number of people have been receiving the American Sentinel through the courtesy of friends. We should be greatly pleased to have these persons become subscribers on their own account. Many of the best minds in the country are convinced that there is urgent need of just such work as is being done by the Sentinel, and it is the only paper in the United States that is doing the work. Let a l who feel that a union of Church and State would bo a calamity, rally to the support of the journal that is doing battle for liberty of conscience and for civil rights. Wo confidently look for a largo increase in our regular subscription list.
