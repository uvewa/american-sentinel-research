# The National Reform Gospel.

National Reform Secretary J. H. Leiper says:—

> “Wo preach exactly the same gospel to the body politic—that moral individual we call the nation—[that we do to the demoralized individual person].”—*Christian Statesman, June 18, 1885.*

The gospel which Christ sends by his ministers to the “demoralized individual” person is this: “Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature. He that believeth *and is baptized* shall be saved.” And this: “Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, *baptizing them* in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost; teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you.”

Now if the National Reformers propose to preach to the body politic the gospel of Christ, and if that body politic is going to obey that gospel—if it is going to observe what Christ has commanded—then that body politic must be baptized; and the National Reformers will have to baptize it. We should like for Mr. Secretary Leiper to tell “exactly” how that thing can be accomplished.

If the National Reformers will say that the body politic needs not to be baptized, then it follows that the gospel which they preach to the body politic is not the gospel of Christ. And in that case, this being “exactly the same gospel” that they preach to the demoralized individual, it follows that the gospel which they preach either to the individual or to the body politic is not the gospel of Christ. We are persuaded that the conclusion is the literal truth of the matter, and of this persuasion we must remain until the National Reformers tell us how the body politic shall or can be baptized.

The morality as derived from religion which the State needs will be best supplied by the confinement of its agency to things temporal and the entire omission on its part of any attempt to administer things spiritual. The State can do religion no favor so great as to have nothing to do with it, and itself no favor so great as to let religion alone. The moment the two are put in alliance with each other both are injured.—*Samuel T. Spear, D. D.*
