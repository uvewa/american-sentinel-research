# Renewals of Subscriptions.

A number of subscriptions to this paper expire in February, 1887, also in March, 1887. The address label will tell the exact date to which your time is paid. Our terms are cash in advance and we hope that none of our readers will allow their name to be dropped from our mailing list. Please renew early so as to avoid the possibility of missing any issue of the Sentinel. The price is only 50 cents per year, less than one cent a week. Who cannot raise that small sum to aid a noble cause? If you will send us two *new* subscribers at 50 cents each, we will send *you* the American Sentinel one year *free.*
