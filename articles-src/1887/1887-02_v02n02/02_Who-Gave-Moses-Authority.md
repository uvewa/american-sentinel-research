Mr. Gault, in the *Christian Statesman* of December 30, 1886, seems to think he has settled a vexed question. He refers to Deut. 1:13, where Moses said to the people, "Take you wise men, and understanding, and known among your tribes, and I will make them rulers over you." We referred to the same transaction (Num. 11:16, 17) in speaking of this subject. But the question with us is: Who gave Moses authority *to make rulers* for the tribes? And would these wise men have had any authority to act if Moses had not put them into office? The President of the United States has the power to appoint a great many officers, and it is quite customary for the people to present names to him that he may appoint the men of their selection. He may or he may not appoint the ones they select; but in any case, their selection does not make these men officers. They must be appointed by authority. But when the people *elect* their officers, the President has no more to say on the subject than Mr. Gault has. There was no election, in any proper sense of the term, in the transaction referred to in Num. 11, or Deut. 1.

But let us go back of that. The people elect our President, and thereby give him the appointing power. But *who elected Moses? *Who gave him such power over the tribes and over their judges? Will Mr. Gault please to meet the question, and not longer evade it?
