> "The students in the industrial department of the South Lancaster Academy print the *True Educator* as a part of their school work, and it is one of the neatest papers which comes to our desk. Fortunate that parent whose child has such facilities in connection with his studies."—*New England Journal of Education.*

> "The *True Educator* is certainly a credit to its editor and to the Academy. Shall try to send something for its columns."—*John C. Rolfe, Ph. D., Cincinnati, O.,* late instructor in Greek, Cornell University.
