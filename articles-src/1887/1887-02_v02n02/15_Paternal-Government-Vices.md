A paternal Government, under exceptional circumstances, may for a time secure a certain amount of material prosperity and even of moral and intellectual development, but in general this system must develop a type of character where the virtues of childhood are not only exaggerated at the expense of those which are the glory of manhood, but are liable also to be extinguished by the vices of a manhood uncontrolled by reason or conscience.— *Pres. George Washburn.*

The most fatal consequence which has in any age resulted from the connection between Church and State, is the application of the penalties of the one to the disorders of the other,—the correction of spiritual offenses by temporal chastisements. . . . And since its wickedness and its folly have been exposed and acknowledged, there can now be no circumstances under which a wise Government would employ such interference, or an enlightened priesthood desire it.— *Waddington.*
