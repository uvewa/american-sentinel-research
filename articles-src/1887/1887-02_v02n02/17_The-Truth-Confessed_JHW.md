The National Reformers persistently talk about the "Christian Sabbath," and the "Christian law of marriage," and one of their most prominent "Secretaries" said, in the *Statesman,* that "the race is indebted to the religion of Christ for the pure blessing of the family." The gospel is of infinite worth to the fallen race, but we do not believe it is honored or advanced by destroying its relations. To deny original obligations and original institutions is to neutralize the gospel, for the gospel is purely *remedial,* and to merge every obligation and institution into the gospel is to make it elementary and not remedial.

But the truth will out sometimes. In the *Christian Nation* of December 22, 1886, in the Sunday-school Notes by Rev. W. J. Coleman, himself a zealous "Reformer," are the following words:—

> "Marriage and the Sabbath, these are the two gifts of God to Paradise, which have survived the fall. How sadly sin has marred them both, yet they bear the aroma of the Eden whence they came, and hold inclosed within them the greater part of the happiness yet engaged [enjoyed?] in this world."

True, every word. But that which was given in Paradise and has "survived the fall," cannot be of Christian origin, or be any part of Christianity. Both these institutions are contained in the moral law, the violation of which made the gospel necessary. We have several times called attention to the fact that the Reformers generally ignore the proper distinction between *morality* and *religion. *The above declaration of Mr. Coleman looks toward a recognition of that distinction. We are constrained to believe that these people have no *system* of Bible ethics, but indulge in random talk to suit their fancy and the occasion.

We repeat what we have said before, "The gospel enforces all morality, but it originates none." Pardon recognizes the obligation or binding power of the law, but it does not annul law, or give authority to law. The ministry of the gospel is a "ministry of reconciliation." That, and that only. Whenever our model reformers prove that the Sabbath and marriage are of Christian origin, and did not exist in Paradise before the fall of man, then we will unite with them in talking about a "Christian Sabbath," if any such can be found, and we will accept marriage as a Christian institution, and acknowledge that the blessing of the family is peculiar to the gospel—but not till then. J. H. W.
