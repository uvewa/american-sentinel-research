There is no place on earth where the principles of the "National Reform Association" are more clearly exemplified than they are in the Territory of Utah. It is as useless for the Reformers to deny the likeness as it is to deny that their movement contemplates a complete union of Church and State. Over against their constant disclaimers of a desire to inaugurate such a union, every feature of a practical union of Church and State is found embodied in their demands for changes in our Government. And it is a noticeable fact that all classes, except the self-styled Reformers themselves, no matter what their belief may be in respect to matters of the Government and of Christianity, are fully agreed that a union of Church and State will be the unavoidable result of their movement.

What is the actual condition in Utah? And, What are the actual demands of the National Reformers? Answers to these questions will cover the entire subject under consideration, and we will proceed to answer them by quotations from the pages of the organs of the Association.

The *Christian Nation* of Jan. 13, 1886, quoted the words of a man who had spent some time in Utah studying the situation. He said:—

> "The Territorial Government of Utah is now and has been from the beginning, dominated by the Mormon Church. Twenty-five years before our forefathers were called upon to proclaim liberty, they eradicated the evil of a union between Church and State. Thomas Jefferson, as you know, was the great apostle of this reform, and it as much as anything else prepared us for a republican form of government; but, for the last forty years, there has existed in Utah an ecclesiastical rule more flagrant than anything Jefferson was ever called upon to consider. The Mormon organization does not pretend to be merely a church, but the kingdom of God on earth—*i. e.,* it is a sort of theocratic government."

In this description of things in Utah, three points are made prominent:1. The Mormon Church dominates the civil Government, and this is fitly represented as a union of Church and State. 2. Thomas Jefferson was opposed to this state of things, it being contrary to republican government. 3. The Mormon organization does not pretend to be merely a church, but the kingdom of God on earth. The first and third points present the peculiar characteristics of Mormonism, and we shall now show that what these embrace is demanded by the Reformers, in our Government.

We shall not preserve the order laid down, but notice,

*First,* The National Reformers claim that this Government or nation will be the kingdom of Christ when the Religious Amendment is adopted. In the Pittsburg Convention, in 1874, Dr. Browne, speaking of the present and future position of office-seekers in respect to their movement, said:—

> "When our Master comes into his kingdom in our beloved land, they will be candidates for the foremost positions, and scramble with the mother of Zebedee's children for the right or left hand places in the kingdom."

This language is unmistakable, and is in entire harmony with the general tenor of their teachings. Rev. J. C. K. Milligan, in the *Statesman* of March 21, 1884, said:—

> "If our nation will accept God as the source of all authority, Christ Jesus as the nation's king, and his law as of supreme authority over them, its creed is orthodox."

It is well known that the National Reformers have captured bodily the National Woman's Christian Temperance Union. The highest officers of the Union are vice-presidents of the Reform Association, and labor zealously in its interest. Mrs. Woodbridge, in an address to the Knights of Labor, in Cleveland, urged upon the Knights the claim of the National Reform cause, closing with the following words:—

> "Thus would the National Woman's Christian Temperance Union join hands with the Knights of Labor in placing this 'Government upon the shoulders of Him who is Wonderful, Counselor, the Mighty God, the Everlasting Father, the Prince of Peace,' and in crowning Christ, our Lord, as the Ruler of nations."

In the *Statesman* of May 27, 1886, that superlatively zealous National Reformer, "Rev. M. A. Gault," addressing an objecting minister, said:—

> "Strange to tell, you are harder to reconcile to the enthronement of Christ in the nation, than even the Unitarians."

The pamphlet report of the Pittsburg Convention is prefaced with an article by Dr. McAllister, the general secretary of the Association, the closing words of which are as follows:—

> "This edition of the report is sent forth with the prayer that He whose honor this movement seeks to promote, . . . will carry forward the glorious work until our beloved nation shall become one of the kingdoms of our Lord and of his Christ."

The first quotation given from the *Nation *says that "the Mormon organization does not pretend to be merely a church, but the kingdom of God upon the earth." And the analogy between this and the claim of the Reformers is complete. They constantly affirm that it is not their intention to *legalize a church,* but to bring Christ into his kingdom, to put the Government upon his shoulders, to enthrone [10] him, to crown him, in this nation. In this respect the theory of the Mormons and of the National Reformers is identical. The theory is absurd, for the Scriptures give no intimation that Christ will be brought into his kingdom, enthroned, or crowned, in any such manner. The theory is peculiar to the Reformed Presbyterians and the Mormons; and the latter apparently borrowed it from the former.

*Secondly,* The Mormon Church dominates the civil Government, and this is, practically, a union of Church and State. But this is exactly what the Reformers demand in the whole nation. Rev. J. M. Foster, in the *Statesman* of March, 1884, said:—

> "According to the Scriptures, the State and its sphere exist for the sake of and to serve the interests of the church."

If this does not mean that the State, the civil power, is to be subordinated to the church, then no language could be framed to express such an idea. And this is not a *lapsus linguae, *an unconsidered expression, for "Secretary Leiper," a valiant defender of National Reform, undertook to vindicate Mr. Foster in the following language:—

> "J. H. W. stumbles at an utterance of Rev. J. M. Foster in *Christian Statesman,* of March, 1884: 'According to the Scriptures, the State and its sphere exist for the sake of and to serve the interests of the church.' This statement J. H. W. emphatically denies. As a believer in the Bible, how will he undertake to expound Isa. 49:23 and 60:12, in accord with his views of the relation of Church and State?"

Yes, we emphatically deny the statement, even as we deny that marriage is a Christian institution. There are some things in the government and providence of God which are as truly for the non-believer as for the believer. If the National Reformers had their way the sun would shine and the rain would fall only upon the Reformed Presbyterian Church! But that is not God's method. But the point is, that Mr. Leiper indorses Mr. Foster's statement, and emphatically repudiates our "views of the relation of Church and State." In the *Christian Nation* of July 14, 1886, we find the following strong language:—

> "A civil recognition of the church is often represented as inconsistent with her independence and freedom, whereas it is absolutely necessary to that freedom. No true friend of Christ would accept State favor at the expense of independence. The church exists as the Lord has ordained, and the [civil] ruler in an official recognition accepts it as it is, and its great charter, the word, is pleadable before any Legislature or in any court. Otherwise, *if the church is only known as a voluntary association,* it is bound down to the specific regulations that determine the order of procedure. In the United States, whose Federal Constitution knows no Bible, no Christ, no God, the church has no reason to boast of freedom of action in her own department, and is exposed to prosecution and penalties, when insubordinate members choose to appeal to the civil courts against that discipline which they had vowed to accept."

Here again we demur to the doctrine. The church is properly a voluntary association; and it has no right to transcend the duties which lie between man and man, or to so deprive its members of their rights as to become subject to "prosecution and penalties." It is only in such a Government as the National Reformers seek to establish that the civil power can interfere in questions of doctrines and ordinances; but in questions of individual rights it ought to interfere, for the Bible gives no church or officer authority to lord it over God's heritage. But our gentle Reformers are by no means satisfied with the measure of power conferred upon them in the gospel. They must, forsooth, usurp authority over the Government which protects them.

The *Statesman* of December 9, 1886, publishes extracts from what it calls "a noteworthy thanksgiving sermon," in which are the following words:—

> "It used to be the law in New England that no man could vote who was not a professing Christian, a member of the church of Christ. An absurd and pernicious law, doubtless, with men what they are. Yet the law is an almost pathetic memorial of the grand design of the Pilgrim Puritans to establish a theocracy in the New World, to which they had fled from the corruptions and persecutions of the Old—a State which should be governed by those and those only who were governed by God. It is also a striking prophecy of that prime necessity of good citizenship, a heart-felt submission and allegiance to the authority of God, which will inevitably result in an effort to realize in society divine ideals of love and justice."

But the Reformers themselves do not admit even the half-hearted disclaimer here used. Thus Hon. Mr. Patterson, of Pennsylvania, in his speech in the Pittsburg Convention, 1874, said:—

> "'And this religion, as understood by Protestants, tending, by its effects, to make every man submitting to its influence a better husband, parent, child, neighbor, citizen, and magistrate, was by the people (of Massachusetts) established as a fundamental and essential part of their Constitution;' and ought, we claim, to be likewise established by the people of the United States, as a fundamental and essential part of their Constitution."

That is to say, that as professed Christians only could vote or exercise the rights of citizenship in Massachusetts, so it should be in all the United States. Remember, it was under this very Christian arrangement in Massachusetts that dissenters were banished, whipped, and put to death! Lest the reader should think that we draw too strong conclusions from these several statements, we quote again from the *Christian Nation* of September 15, 1886:—

> "Of course, a Government organized on a basis embracing Christianity, could not, with propriety, intrust those with office who are hostile to its characteristic faith. And none of this class have any right to claim that they shall be equally eligible to office with those who are *bona fide* citizens."

Here it is in full. None are *bona fide* citizens unless they are in harmony with the "characteristic faith," or religion of the Government! Under their benign rule, which, they often boast, will "secure the rights of all classes," the dissenter will not be a *bona fide *citizen, and will have no right to claim equal rights with the patriotic Reformed Presbyterian! no right to claim eligibility to office. And there is no Church and State in this; oh, no! "Will you walk into my parlor?"

Once more: President Brunot, in his Pittsburg address, said it was their purpose to acknowledge the Bible as the supreme rule of the conduct of the nation. In the *Christian* *Nation* of February 24, 1886, are the following words:—

> "Respect for the Bible means respect for the church, for the preaching of the gospel, and for all the means of grace."

We might multiply quotations to show that they expect to have "the church" occupy a controlling position in their new manner of government, but space forbids. And, as far as the purpose of this article is concerned, it is not needed, for we have fully shown all that we claimed of the complete likeness of the system of the Mormons and of the National Reformers. Both claim that their system, when carried out, is the kingdom of Christ on earth. Both claim that it is the duty of the civil Government to care for, to uphold, and to enforce the teachings of the church. Both claim that the civil offices should be filled by members of the church, and that dissenters have no right to hold office. And this state of things, in the description of Utah as quoted from the *Nation,* is represented as a union of Church and State. But how will the Reformers avoid the conclusion that the same state of things in the whole country will be a national union of Church and State?

It was this very thing that Thomas Jefferson opposed as inimical to a republican Government. It was against this that the framers of our Constitution wisely guarded in the Sixth Article and the First Amendment. It is well known that Thomas Jefferson, more than any other man, is blamed for the secular character, or, what the Reformers claim, the godless character of our Government. Thomas Jefferson was not a religionist; but he was a firm friend of civil and religious liberty, and we hope that the people of the United States may be aroused to the fact that our liberties, both civil and religious, are in danger from the efforts now being made to subordinate this civil Government to the will of the church. It is just as dangerous to republicanism now as it was in the days of Jefferson; just as dangerous to individual rights as it was two centuries ago in Massachusetts; just as dangerous in Pennsylvania, Ohio, or Tennessee, as it is in Utah. And let us not be deceived with the idea that the days of religious persecution have passed away, never to return. Religious bigotry and intolerance are manifest in every part of our land. Were it not so, the cause of "National Reform" or of the Religious Amendment of the Constitution, would not flourish as it does, and become popular as it is very fast becoming. Dr. Howard Crosby well said: "The moment you put religion into the hands of the Government, you do what Constantine did. and will bring about the dark ruin of the tenth century." J. H. W.
