Reform Logic.—In the *Christian Nation,* a certain minister, in an article headed, "Ours a Christian Nation," amongst other proofs (?) offers the following:—

"There is not an anti-Christian law on our statute books; that is, not a law opposed to Christianity."

And there is not a law on our statute books opposed to Mohammedanism; does that make ours a Mohammedan nation? There is not a law against Buddhism; not a law against infidelity. Therefore—what kind of a nation are we? A law against any of these would be an infringement of human rights, and therefore an outrage. Ours is a civil Government —just as it ought to be. To make it a religious Government—to unite it with ecclesiasticism—is simply Church and State, and any denial of it is a subterfuge.
