> The same cause which restrained the vigor, polluted the character of the church; for, being unable immediately to repress by its own spiritual weapons the violent animosities of its ministers, and impatient of the gradual influence of time and reason, in a dark and disastrous moment it bad recourse to that temporal sword which was not intended for its service, and which it has never yet employed without disgrace or with impunity.— *Waddington. *[11]
