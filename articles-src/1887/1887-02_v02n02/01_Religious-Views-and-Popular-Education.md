The *Independent* says: "If the religious views of infidels or some form of paganism were to be taught by the State, and believers in the religion of the Bible were to be taxed to pay the expenses thereof, these believers would complain bitterly and justly. The principle, however, is the same, no matter what religious views are incorporated into a system of popular education at the public expense. It is no better and no worse when applied to the religion of the Bible than it would be if applied to any other form of religious belief. The fact that the majority of the people, so far as they have any religion, believe in Christianity, and would have that taught by the State, if any religion is to be thus taught, does not alter the case at all. The rights of the minority not thus believing are just as sacred to them as those of the majority."
