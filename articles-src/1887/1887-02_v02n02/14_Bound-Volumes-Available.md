Many have made inquiries concerning bound volumes of the Sentinel. We are happy to say that we can now fill orders for any quantity of the first volume, bound in manilla or cloth, with index. The bound volume is neat and handy, and will be of great value as a book of reference, or a text-book for those who wish to understand the folly and iniquity of the so-called National Reform movement. Price, in manilla covers, 60 cents; in cloth, $1.00. Address, American Sentinel, Oakland, Cal.
