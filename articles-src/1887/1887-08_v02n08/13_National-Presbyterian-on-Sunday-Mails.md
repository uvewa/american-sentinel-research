It seems that the germs of the Church and State pestilence are everywhere. The *National Presbyterian* makes no pretensions to National Reform, and has never directly mentioned the subject, yet it has the root of the matter in itself. The July issue contains an editorial in approval of the resolution of the United Presbyterian Synod, relative to Sunday mails, in which it urges the following reasons why there is hope that such a movement may be successful:—

> "The present is a favorable time for a movement of this character. The country is at peace and there is nothing in our circumstances as a nation or as a people that could be presented as an excuse for opposing it. The President, though not a member of an evangelical church, has been bred to the Presbyterian idea of Sabbath-keeping, and the influences of his household are in favor of a scriptural view of this subject. For some time past, to a greater extent perhaps than in former years, there has been a disposition on the part of both the great political parties to insist upon religious or moral qualifications for the more important offices of the general Government. A majority of the Justices of the Supreme Court are members of evangelical churches. If our information is correct, more than half of them are Presbyterians. If the movement suggested by the Reformed Synod could be made with a good degree of unanimity and earnestness, there is strong ground for hope that it might be successful. Let the movement be made."

We do not say that its hopes are well founded, nor do we think that the possible Presbyterian proclivities of President Cleveland will aid in bringing about the result; but we do say that when religious journals begin to talk about religious qualifications for the important offices of the general Government, and confidently expect that men in public position will conduct the public business in accordance with the beliefs of their church, it is high time that lovers of civil and religious liberty should awake to the danger.
