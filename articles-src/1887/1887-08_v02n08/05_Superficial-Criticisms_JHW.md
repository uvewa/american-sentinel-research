# Superficial Criticisms.

A letter has been received from Ohio, criticising our positions taken in the Sentinel. We do not give the name of the writer, because we do not know that he has any standing among the National Reformers. But he speaks as the Reformers speak, and labors under the same difficulties of mental vision which afflict all, or nearly all, of that order, and therefore we will give him some attention. The reader will notice that we have already examined the same points as set forth by writers in the *Statesman* and *Nation.*

The writer is astonished that we make a distinction between morality and religion. We, in turn, are astonished that anybody can be found who denies or doubts that such a distinction exists. The difficulty is to so simplify the subject as to bring it down to the comprehension of the average Reformer. But we will make another effort.

Our critic acknowledges that moral laws, such as, Thou shalt not kill, or steal, existed before Christianity existed; but he insists that they are a part of Christianity because a man cannot break these laws and be a Christian. Now we know that Christianity *enforces *morality, but in its nature it is distinct from it. To prove his point he offers the following as an illustration:—

> "A man commits a theft; we say that he has violated the law of the land which says, Thou shalt not steal. Did this country originate that law? No. But it is a part of the law of the country."

Now there must always be some analogy, or likeness, between an illustration and the thing intended to be illustrated. But in this case there is none whatever; hence there is no illustration. Christianity is a religion—neither more nor less. Our Government is not a religion, or a religious system. There is a Christian religion, but there is not an American religion, or a United States religion. No such religion was ever instituted. Again, Christianity is *a remedial system;* its whole design toward man is to recover him from his fallen condition, for if man had not fallen Christianity would not have existed. But our Government is not a remedial system, in any sense, nor to any degree. It is a civil, legal system. It does not, it cannot take hold of man's moral nature; it cannot recover him from any fallen condition. Its object is solely *to keep the peace;* to restrain men from overt acts of aggression upon the rights of their fellow-men. The very fact that this writer presents Christianity and this Government as parallels or analogous systems, proves that he has not the remotest idea of correct distinctions in morals and religion.

While we cannot draw a parallel between Christianity and our Government, we can present an illustration in *the action* of our Government in case of transgression. A man has transgressed—sinned against our Government. Every step in the trial, conviction, and pardon of the accused is a recognition of the claims and authority of the law. All is for the enforcement of law. The verdict of the jury is, "Guilty." Guilty of what? Of violating the law. The judge pronounces sentence. For or upon what? Violation of the law. And the governor issues a pardon. Pardon for what? For violation of the law. But the law is no part of the verdict of the jury, the sentence of the judge, nor the pardon of the governor. Our critic asks, "How can the gospel enforce that which is no part of itself?" How could the President's proclamation of amnesty uphold and enforce the Constitution unless it was the Constitution, or the Constitution was a part of it? And how can people be convinced of the principles and relations of Government, if they have not the power to comprehend them?

Speaking of our positions, he says:—

> "The conclusion must of necessity follow that you want none of the laws of Christianity put on a legal basis, and to be enforced by legal penalties."

That is the conclusion, exactly. Anything beyond that culminates in the Inquisition. The Author of Christianity never commissioned any man nor any set of men to enforce the gospel by civil laws and civil penalties. To attempt to do so is to usurp authority, to pervert the gospel, and to commit an outrage on human rights. We repeat, that the highest office given to the servants of Christ is that of ambassadors, to beseech men to be reconciled to God. 2 Cor. 5:20. We ask to see their commission to act as judges and executioners. We read: "Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord." And again: "Judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the heart." But these Reformers, following their prototypes of the Dark Ages, are not content to occupy the position assigned them by the Lord, but must needs usurp authority over the consciences of their fellow-men, and essay to compel men to obey the gospel under civil penalties. Was more ever done by the Inquisition than they aspire to do?

Our critic thinks himself wise, no doubt, in endeavoring to place us on the side of infidels and anarchists. Thus he says:—

> "The cry of the Anarchists is, Kill the law. All the infidels of the land will help you to abolish the Sunday laws and put all the days of the week on the same legal basis. A large per cent. of the Mormons and Spiritualists will aid you to abolish the marriage laws, and let everyone be governed in this matter by his religion or inclination. All murderers and thieves will join your ranks to abolish the laws, Thou shalt not kill or steal."

If anything were wanting to prove the blindness, or duplicity, or both, of these model Reformers, such language as the above would fully answer the purpose. Not an expression, not a sentiment has ever appeared in the [60] Sentinel which would justify such a slanderous accusation. We have always been explicit in our statements that it is the duty of civil Government to protect its citizens and secure the rights of all classes and persons. We have distinctly said that it is the duty of the Government to protect the marriage institution, and that there ought to be a uniform or national law respecting divorce. We say this, *because marriage is not a Christian or religious institution.* If it were, then none but Christians would have a right to get married, and then it would belong to the church alone. But it is not an institution of that nature; and when National Reformers talk about "the Christian law of marriage," and when they say that the race is indebted to Christianity for the marriage institution, we know that it is spoken in ignorance or perverseness.

Here we will copy from the *Christian Statesman* of February 24, 1887, a double item which appears under the head of "Clashing Voices: "—

> "In short, the incorporation of religion into the laws of the State, marks the decline of religion in the hearts of the people. And this is what the Religious Amendment party is trying and pleading to bring about. Every American citizen should fight such an enactment to the last man."—*D. C. Marr, in St. Louis Republican.*

> "If so, then to prevent the decline of religion, we must blot from our legislation all laws against murder, theft, and Sabbath breaking, for these are religious principles taken from the decalogue, and incorporated into nearly all our State constitutions. Your blunder is in supposing that the State cannot adopt the moral law of the Bible without uniting with some church."—*M. A. Gault.*
The characteristic "clashing" in this and other utterances of Mr. Gault is a clashing with common sense. If they will not be convinced of their errors, others may be made to see them.

If there were a nation of infidels to erect a Government, we should expect them to enact laws against murder, theft, adultery, and perjury, because these are offenses, not merely against religion, but *against human rights. *These laws are founded in our natures; they rest upon the relations instituted by the Creator when he created the race; they do not belong to any nation, Government, or religion. They are no more peculiar to Christianity than they are to Mohammedanism. But if that nation should enact laws in favor of baptism or the Lord's Supper, we should all be surprised, for these are Christian institutions, with which infidels have nothing to do. We should not expect them to enact laws concerning the Sabbath, blasphemy, or worship of any kind; because these, though a part of the decalogue, are religious laws,— they relate to our duty directly to God, not to our fellow-men.

NATIONAL REFORMERS CONDEMNED BY WEBSTER.

On the word "religion," Webster's dictionary says:—

> "Religion, *as distinct from* virtue or *morality, *consists of the performance of the duties we owe directly to God, from a principle of obedience to his will. Hence we often speak of religion and virtue as different branches of one system, or the duties of the first and second tables of the law."

But this refers to what is properly called *natural religion,* for the precepts on both tables of the law grow out of relations established in creation. In this respect they are entirely unlike Christian precepts, which grow out of our relations *as sinners.* This paragraph from Webster, though it casts light upon the subject under consideration, as it marks a clear distinction between religion and morality, does not reach to *the whole truth* after which we are inquiring. We read again from Webster on the word "religion: "—

> "Any system of faith and worship. In this sense, religion comprehends the belief of pagans and Mohammedans, as well as of Christians; any religion consisting in the belief of a superior power or powers governing the world, and in the worship of such power or powers. Thus we speak of the religion of the Turks, of the Hindoos, of the Indians, etc., as well as of the Christian religion. We speak of false religion as well as of true religion."

Webster also says:—

> "The practice of moral duties without a belief in a divine Lawgiver, and without reference to his will or commands, is not religion."

These declarations are plain as they are truthful. It takes so little reasoning power to recognize this distinction that we are inclined to believe the denial of it by the Reformers is mostly perverseness. "Rev. M. A. Gault" is one of the most persistent in his disregard of this distinction, and we shall not attempt to locate him in either class—the ignorant or the perverse. Sometimes it would seem that he belongs to both. He has even gone so far as to say, in the *Statesman,* that if our Constitution forbids religious legislation, then we cannot legislate concerning murder and theft, for these are religious questions!

We have never expressed any desire to have all the days of the week put on the same legal basis; we are not opposed to the Government making the Sunday a legal holiday. But we are opposed to enforcing its observance on all classes under the misleading name of "the Christian Sabbath." The Sabbath, as given to us in the Bible, is an institution as old as creation; instituted before the fall of man; and therefore it antedates Christianity. It is no more a part of, or peculiar to, Christianity, than is marriage. There is no such institution as the Christian Sabbath. And no class of religionists treat the Sabbath as they treat Christian institutions. This point we will demonstrate, but, not to lengthen this article unduly, we will defer it for future consideration.

One more point in the letter of our critic we will notice:—

> "Let us see what religion is. James 1:27: 'Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.' What is this but morality?"

Very well said. And now will the writer be so kind as to inform us if he wishes to put this article of religion "on a legal basis"? Would he compel, under civil penalties, all classes of citizens to visit the fatherless and widows? Will he ask the Legislature to make a law that all people shall keep themselves unspotted from the world? and if such a law were enacted, will he inform us by what means he would have it enforced? Satisfactory answers to these questions will prove that he has intelligent ideas concerning the enforcement of religion by civil law. But until we receive such answers, we must be permitted to doubt on that subject. J. H. W.
