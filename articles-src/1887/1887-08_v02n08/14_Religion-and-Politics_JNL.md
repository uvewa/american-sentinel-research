# Religion and Politics.

The following letter shows how Protestantism is following the ways of the Papacy:—

> Editor Sentinel: During the month of June I spent a few days in Humboldt County, Cal. While I was there some significant meetings were held in Eureka. The leading denominations of the place came together, as stated in the first meeting, to consider the matter of a more perfect union of their forces for political purposes. The speakers said matters were continually coming up which the church did not like, but she was powerless to do anything because they were not united and thoroughly organized. Now what they propose was to so unite that they could carry their points at the polls.

> It was proposed to canvass the whole town, to ascertain to what church each individual belonged, or favored. If any were found of Baptist proclivities the canvasser was to report them at once to the Baptist minister. And so with all the denominations. Those found who were not members of any denomination were to be requested to attend some church. In the carrying out of this plan there was a committee of three chosen, who were to select fifty persons to go from house to house, and at once take a religious census of the town. On the question being raised whether those making the canvass should be men who could carry salvation to the houses as they went, it was decided that that was immaterial to the purpose. That could be attended to by the workers who might afterwards be sent. So the matter passed from the open meeting to the committee.
> As to all of the results of this canvass we are not yet informed. But a statement was made by one of these ministers working in this scheme, in his pulpit, on the Sunday following the census-taking, that there were three thousand infidels in Eureka. That is about one-half of the inhabitants. On what ground they based the charge of infidelity, whether on a direct avowal of unbelief in the Bible, or a disagreement with the scheme this politico-religious party proposes to carry out, the writer was not informed. The object to be gained being one to carry religious ideas by the aid of the ballot-box, seemed to me a different move for the propagation of the gospel than the method of our Lord, who declared that his kingdom was "not of this world," and that those who took the sword (to enforce their religion, we suppose he meant) should perish by the sword.
