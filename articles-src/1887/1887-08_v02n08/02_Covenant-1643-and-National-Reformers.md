The provisions of the Covenant of 1643 were introduced by the following words: "Having by our great oath declared the uprightness and loyalty of our intentions in all our proceedings," etc. In like manner the National Reformers declare their loyalty to the Government, and the uprightness of their intentions, and that they do not wish harm to anybody. We may charitably suppose that they are as honest as the Covenanters were, but their honesty will not change the result. The result of the Covenant was a Protestant Inquisition that differed from the Papal Inquisition only in degree. It proved, what the centuries of Papal oppression should have taught them, that when religion becomes a matter of politics, the religion is corrupted and the State is made no better, while the people are oppressed.

The case stands just this way: No one can be so blind as not to admit that when Church and State are united, even to the slightest degree, evil *may* result, and men *may* be oppressed. This may be the case even when good men hold the reins of power, for good men are liable to be mistaken, and may persecute as deadly error that which is in reality truth; and evil is *certain* to result when bad men hold the reins of power. And even allowing that those who lead out in the movement are honest and that honest men cannot do wrong (a thing not supposable) no one can tell how soon their places may be filled by men of the baser sort. Therefore if these would-be reformers really do wish well to the country, they will learn a lesson from the past, and will forbear to forge chains for evil-disposed men to place upon the necks of the innocent.
