# The Evils of National Religion.

Than the evil of confounding common morality with Christian ethics, of mixing politics with religion, of connecting State and Church, there is none which in itself seems more insignificant but which in its workings has proved itself more disastrous to all the interests of mankind. That it is an evil at all, the mass of mankind has been astonishingly slow to learn; and there are not a few even in our time who as yet do not recognize it as such. But now that the mistakes of the past are before us and generally seen in their true light, and looking back upon the long and wearisome days of instruction and discipline, how inexpressibly cruel has been the mode of teaching and how enormously great the price of learning!

Clearly distinguishing between the things belonging to Cesar and those belonging to God, the good and wise Master bade all to render to each his due. And for centuries his own obeyed the precept. Not so the pagans. These, rejecting the knowledge of the true God proclaimed to them, and thus refusing to render unto God the things that are God's, sought to prevent his own people from doing so also and required of them to do homage unto the national gods. And paganism ruled the world. *Pontifex maximus* of its religions no less than sovereign in affairs of State, emperor followed emperor in directing every power at his command against the Christ of God and all who dared to name him Lord. Then Christians, more than can be numbered, rather than deny their faith, sealed it with their blood. The honor to die for the Lord and his cause some coveted, others accepted, while suckling babes were not spared.

Alas, that the Christian Church of those days, and later, profited not by its own bitter experience—that Christians ever forgot the precept of their Master! There were then, and there have been at all times, those who did not forget, who closely distinguished between the provinces of politics and religion, who deprecated all interference of the one with the other, and who condemned persecution. But their voices were raised in vain. No sooner did the opportunity offer than, 0 day of evil! the Christian religion itself was made a matter of politics, and politics a matter of religion—than the Christian Church gave itself to the State and the State to the Church. Whether for better or worse, history must tell.

During the past centuries the power of the State had been employed against the Church; now with the time of their courtship and marriage came also the day of retaliation. Had the sovereigns of this world thus far repressed the Christian religion in deference to paganism? now began they the work of exterminating the heathen superstitions in deference to Christianity. But the means and methods adopted for its doing were little better than those before employed against the very religion they now sought to propagate. Following his victory over Maxentius, a political rival and a vehement defender of official heathenism, and ascribing his success to the God of the Christians, *Constantine* at once enlarged the *Galerian* edict of toleration and proclaimed religious liberty throughout his domain.

The all-absorbing question which then agitated the minds of men concerned the power of State. Paganism struggled with might and main to retain its hold and Christianity was determined to seize it. The latter obtained complete dominion; and thus for the first time in their history was the marriage of State and Church effected—a relation which has continued with little interruption, but with ever varying phases and fortunes, up to our own time. And what has been the fruit? Certainly the little good which has come of it might have been achieved without it, and much more too, and all in a manner legitimate; but the amount of evils and wrong-doing of which it has been the cause or occasion, direct or indirect, is simply incalculable.

The very thought of the deeds perpetrated in the name of justice and holy religion, and committed for their apparent benefit, is sufficient to rend the human heart with feelings of shame and indignation. Much has been said, and something can be said, in palliation of the mistakes then made and of the atrocities committed; it has been maintained that the accounts given of them are exaggerating; and that this be so, must be the fond hope of everyone humane of heart. But the facts, as far as they are known with certainty, alone are more than enough to show whither men will drift and what men will do as soon as they follow their own counsel rather than the wisdom of God.

By its victory over heathenism and its exaltation, if such it can be called, to the dignity of a national religion, Christianity had indeed subdued but by no means as yet destroyed its old and bitter foe. The struggle was as yet not ended. Besides, by its very deliverance from this, its old thralldom, it was imperceptibly subjected to another and new condition of servitude, and it is not difficult to say which [63] of the two in the end proved to be the worse. The church, like a persecuted slave, first set free and then wedded to a self-willed lord, was delivered from the heavy hands of an imperial *pontifex maximus* only to be placed into the strong hands of an imperial *summus episcopus *—there to remain for many long and weary days.

Its new lord and lords, while they slowly and surely assumed control of the church, first tolerated but soon took it upon themselves wholly to drive out and destroy such of its enemies as were left. By imperial decree the temples of the gods were plundered and closed, destroyed, or re-opened for Christian worship; pagan sacrifices were forbidden under penalty of death; the property of the disobedient was confiscated, while they themselves were sent into banishment, apostasy and return to the old superstition were branded officially as crimes and high treason, a premium was put upon connection with the church, and many civil advantages were connected with offices ecclesiastic. Too well did the husband protect the newly-acquired wife; lavishly did he provide for her wants, and zealously did he indulge her reasonable desires and her whims as well—so great was the ardor of first love.

Meanwhile, as the wife sometimes obtains the mastery over the husband, so here. At first their relation assumed the character of a *Caesario-papia,* then followed the *Papo-caesario. *First the State presumed to dictate to the church; but gradually the latter asserted its rights not only but it began to dictate to the State. In the East, to be sure, the sovereign lords of State generally maintained their dignity, that is, they continued to toy with the church pretty much as they pleased; and a lucrative employment they found it to be, goodly sums being paid them quite frequently for the office of a bishop, and for like favors. But in the West affairs assumed an entirely different phase. Here slowly and wearily, but steadily and surely, the Papal hierarchy established itself—that monster prolific of a thousand woes to the States and churches of the world, even to this day.

Alas, how the once pure and lovely bride had degenerated! Espoused to one husband after another, and these devoted to politics, to intrigue, and to the waging of wars, why marvel that she herself forgot both her station and mission, that her virgin graces and peaceful habits gave place to Amazonian passions and outrageous excesses. Then was the word of God bound, lest the people should be undeceived; and in its stead was set up the *ignisfatuus* of uncertain tradition. The entire fabric of the church was gradually reconstructed from top to bottom. Even the Old Foundation, elect and precious, was rejected. Yet not altogether rejected. In view of past service and of probable present usefulness, the venerable Corner-stone was not wholly left out of the new structure: fitted and framed anew, it was fixed in a place, high and dry, like a trader's sign, and for no better purpose.— *State, Church, and School,*
