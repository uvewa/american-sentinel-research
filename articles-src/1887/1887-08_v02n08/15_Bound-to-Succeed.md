# Bound to Succeed.

We are all quite familiar with the idea that a man's heart and pocket can be most certainly reached through his stomach; it has remained for National Reformers to propose reaching his head by the same route, a Fourth of July W. C. T. U. National Reform basket picnic having been arranged for Valley Camp, Pa.

> We hope the effort will succeed. Much talk has been indulged in from time to time about popularizing National Reform; Vice- President Frances E. Willard and Secretary Weir are to be congratulated upon this excellent device for bringing about that end.— *Christian Nation.*

We see no reason why the National Reform movement should not succeed, now that its managers have discovered some substantial argument. If they hope to succeed, they would do well to stick to the new plan, for certainly they will be able to reach people's heads by this indirect means much quicker than by any direct means which they have heretofore used. All the National Reform arguments that we have ever read have left us feeling as though we had been fed upon the east wind. Their new argument will be far more "filling."
