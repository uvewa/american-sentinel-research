# Sunday Prohibition.

The report of the "Committee on the Sabbath," at the late Reformed Presbyterian Synod, says:—

> "Sunday saloons rob the working classes of their week's pay, and turn the workingman's home into a very hell."

Indeed! It is the *Sunday* saloon that robs people! It is the *Sunday* saloon that turns people's homes into a hell! What a wicked thing that *Sunday* saloon is! Annihilate it by all means before next Sunday comes, so that the working classes may be perfectly secure in their money, and the workingmen's home may be made happy. But by all means let the dear, good, honest, week-day saloon, that makes gentle the brutish husband, that makes kind the cruel father, that protects the promising youth, that turns the workingman's home into a paradise—let it remain, and touch it not, for a blessing is in it. Robbery and hell are found alone in the *Sunday* saloon.

But what makes the *Sunday* saloon so intensely bad that it must be denounced more than any other saloon? Any saloon at all is an unmitigated curse. Then why condone it on week-days by condemning it only on Sunday? If the *Sunday* saloon can be abolished, why cannot all be abolished? There is quite a large class of people who, realizing that the sale of intoxicants cannot yet be absolutely prohibited, propose to cut off as many saloons as possible by high license. This the Prohibitionists denominate "a covenant with death and an agreement with hell." Very well. Then these same Prohibitionists will loudly denounce the *Sunday* saloon and demand laws that shall close the saloons on Sunday but let them run full blast all the rest of the week. What is that then but "a covenant with death and an agreement with hell," just as much as is the other? The high license folks say, "If we can't yet abolish all, we will abolish all we can." This the Prohibitionists denounce in unmeasured terms, and then say the same thing, only in other words. We wish the Prohibitionists would stick to their text, and not so stultify themselves. Prohibition absolute, everywhere, all the time, and forever, say we. [64]
