# Sunday Prohibition.

The report of the “Committee on the Sabbath,” at the late Reformed Presbyterian Synod, says:—

> “Sunday saloons rob the working classes of their week’s pay, and turn the workingman’s home into a very hell.”

Indeed! It is the *Sunday* saloon that robs people! It is the *Sunday* saloon that turns people’s homes into a hell! What a wicked thing that *Sunday* saloon is! Annihilate it by all means before next Sunday comes, so that the working classes may be perfectly secure in their money, and the workingmen’s home may be made happy. But by all means let the dear, good, honest, week-day saloon, that makes gentle the brutish husband, that makes kind the cruel father, that protects the promising youth, that turns the workingman’s home into a paradise—let it remain, and touch it not, for a blessing is in it. Robbery and hell are found alone in the *Sunday* saloon.

But what makes the *Sunday* saloon so intensely bad that it must be denounced more than any other saloon? Any saloon at all is an unmitigated curse. Then why condone it on week-days by condemning it only on Sunday? If the *Sunday* saloon can be abolished, why cannot all be abolished? There is quite a large class of people who, realizing that the sale of intoxicants cannot yet be absolutely prohibited, propose to cut off as many saloons as possible by high license. This the Prohibitionists denominate “a covenant with death and an agreement with hell.” Very well. Then these same Prohibitionists will loudly denounce the *Sunday* saloon and demand laws that shall close the saloons on Sunday but let them run full blast all the rest of the week. What is that then but “a covenant with death and an agreement with hell,” just as much as is the other? The high license folks say, “If we can’t yet abolish all, we will abolish all we can.” This the Prohibitionists denounce in unmeasured terms, and then say the same thing, only in other words. We wish the Prohibitionists would stick to their text, and not so stultify themselves. Prohibition absolute, everywhere, all the time, and forever, say we. [64]

Note.—No papers are sent by the publishers of the American Sentinel to people who have not subscribed for it. If the Sentinel comes to one who has not subscribed for it, he may know that it is sent him by some friend, and that he will not be called upon by the publishers to pay for the same.

Subscriptions to the Sentinel are now coming in in a way to delight the hearts, not only of the publishers, but of all who believe that the Sentinel has an important work to do. Every mail brings in scores, and some, hundreds of subscriptions. That it does occupy a position second to none in importance is conceded by all who are awake to the issues of the day. Let its friends rally to its support.

The following from an editorial in the *Christian Nation,* June 15, we insert exactly as it is. Comment is unnecessary:—

> “When the State becomes positively Christian in constitution, and Christian men are elected to make law, something like this will be done: A street-car company’s charter will be granted conditioned upon the running of cars free on Sabbath for the accommodation of Christian people on errands of worship, of necessity, and of mercy, even as bridge toll is at present remitted on the Sabbath in some places. To this it will be objected that others than Christians will ride for other than Christian purposes, which is very true, but the sin will be upon their own souls. The company will suffer no hardships, the men employed will be God’s messengers for good, and ‘in that day there shall be upon the bells of the horses, *holiness unto the Lord. ’ ”*

It seems that the germs of the Church and State pestilence are everywhere. The *National Presbyterian* makes no pretensions to National Reform, and has never directly mentioned the subject, yet it has the root of the matter in itself. The July issue contains an editorial in approval of the resolution of the United Presbyterian Synod, relative to Sunday mails, in which it urges the following reasons why there is hope that such a movement may be successful:—

> “The present is a favorable time for a movement of this character. The country is at peace and there is nothing in our circumstances as a nation or as a people that could be presented as an excuse for opposing it. The President, though not a member of an evangelical church, has been bred to the Presbyterian idea of Sabbath-keeping, and the influences of his household are in favor of a scriptural view of this subject. For some time past, to a greater extent perhaps than in former years, there has been a disposition on the part of both the great political parties to insist upon religious or moral qualifications for the more important offices of the general Government. A majority of the Justices of the Supreme Court are members of evangelical churches. If our information is correct, more than half of them are Presbyterians. If the movement suggested by the Reformed Synod could be made with a good degree of unanimity and earnestness, there is strong ground for hope that it might be successful. Let the movement be made.”

We do not say that its hopes are well founded, nor do we think that the possible Presbyterian proclivities of President Cleveland will aid in bringing about the result; but we do say that when religious journals begin to talk about religious qualifications for the important offices of the general Government, and confidently expect that men in public position will conduct the public business in accordance with the beliefs of their church, it is high time that lovers of civil and religious liberty should awake to the danger.
