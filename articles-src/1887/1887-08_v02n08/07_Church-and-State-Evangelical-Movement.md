# Church and State.

## EVANGELICAL MOVEMENT FOR THEIR ALLIANCE.

The following interview published in the San Francisco *Chronicle,* July 4, is a very becoming item for the national holiday, and shows that the National Reform movement is not passing along unobserved. It likewise shows that that movement is not always going to have the plain, smooth sailing it has had hitherto. We hope the *Chronicle* will go on with this good work, and not weary of such well doing.

> "Are you aware," said a prominent clergyman of this city to a *Chronicle* reporter yesterday, "that there is a great and growing society in this country called the National Reform Association, the object of which is the practical union of Church and State?"

> "Certainly not," was the reply. "Is there any movement of that sort on this coast?"
> "No, not as yet, but I understand that a branch society is about to be organized in this city, and the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, which is in close affiliation with the National Reform Association, has a numerous following on this coast. The headquarters of the association are in Philadelphia, where its organ, the *Christian Statesman,* is published, and there are State branch organizations in many of the States. The organization is a strong one. It has among its 120 vice-presidents eighty prominent clergymen of different denominations, including eleven bishops, ten college presidents and professors, one governor, three ex-governors, nine Supreme Court justices, one Judge of the United States District Court, and seven prominent officials of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, including Miss Willard, its president. Two years ago, at the suggestion of Miss [62] Willard, the National Convention of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union created a special department of its work to co-operate with the National Reform Association, and Mrs. Bateham, of Ohio, one of the vice-presidents of the National Relief Association, was made general superintendent."
"What are the objects of this so-called Reform Association?"

> "A fundamental change in the national Constitution by means of what is called a Christian amendment, which will practically overturn the secular character of the Government and unite Church and State. Its avowed intention is to afford a basis of organic law for the general enforcement of Sunday observance, the reading of the Bible in the public schools, etc."

> "You do not think there is any probability of its effecting its purpose, do you?"
> "Certainly I do. Having secured the cooperation of the Woman's Temperance Union, it is now bidding, through the union, for that of the Knights of Labor and other workingmen's organizations. At the Workingmen's Assembly in Cleveland, 0., Mrs. Woodbridge, an official of the Reform Association and Woman's Union, made an appeal and proposition to that effect, which, it is stated, received favorable consideration."
> "Do all of the clergy and religious press favor this movement?"
> "No, not all. A few of us are opposed to it, but the majority of the clergy and the religious papers favor it. They have a mistaken idea that it would enhance the power of Christianity, whereas, I believe, it would weaken it greatly."
> "In what way?"
> "BY AWAKENING A STRONG CURRENT OF POPULAR OPPOSITION TO CHRISTIANITY, AND DEVELOPING IN THE CHURCH AN ARROGANT AND OVERBEARING SPIRIT. THE WHOLE HISTORY OF CHURCH AND STATE UNIONS CONFIRMS THE FACT THAT THEY ARE NOT ONLY BAD FOR THE STATE BUT BAD FOR THE CHURCH. IT WAS FOR THIS REASON THAT THE FOUNDERS OF OUR GOVERNMENT PROVIDED IN THE CONSTITUTION FOR THEIR COMPLETE SEPARATION."
> "Which one of the religious denominations takes the lead in this movement?"
> "The Presbyterian, perhaps, but all, or nearly all, the denominations called 'Evangelical' favor it. The Reformed Presbyterians and United Presbyterians are particularly interested in the movement. Rev. Dr. Gibson, of this city, Moderator of the last General Assembly of the United Presbyterian Church of Philadelphia, is a vice-president of the National Reform Association, and I am told that it is his intention on his return from Europe, where he now is on a vacation, to organize a State branch of the National Reform Association in California, in which the different evangelical denominations will unite."
> "Are there any other widespread organizations which favor this Church and State movement?"
> "Yes; the Prohibition party is committed to it, in its national platform, adopted in Pittsburg in 1884, and the platforms of the State Prohibition Conventions in Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Texas, and many other States contain a distinct indorsement of National Reform measures. Now, while one of these organizations, working alone, might give no cause to fear its success, there is, in my opinion, ground for apprehension that they may, by uniting their forces, eventually accomplish their object. But it will not be without a fearful struggle, such as this country has not yet seen, except on the slavery question, and there are many who look for another civil war from this source before the close of the present century. General Grant once said that if there was another civil war in this country it was more likely to be on this issue than any other, and in one of his last speeches, that at Des Moines, he emphatically reprobated the proposed union of Church and State. Senator Charles Sumner and Governor John A. Andrews, of Massachusetts, are among these master minds who have foreseen this danger to the republic and advised guarding against it."
