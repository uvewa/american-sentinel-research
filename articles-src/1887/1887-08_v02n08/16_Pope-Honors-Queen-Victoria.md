The papers announce that "the Pope grants unprecedented honors to Queen Victoria." It was very kind indeed in the dear, good Pope to condescend to "grant" honors, unprecedented or otherwise, to the queen of Great Britian. The unprecedented honor in this case is that the Pope has "entirely of his own accord, and without any hint from Cardinal Manning, issued a rescript which ordains that on Jubilee day, June 21, high mass and a Te Deum shall be performed in all Roman Catholic Churches in England." It is said that "his holiness could not have done more in the case of the most faithful Catholic sovereign." And then it is suggested, very innocently, of course, that "the English clergy might return the compliment on the occasion of his holiness's approaching jubilee." Yes, they might, nor should we be much surprised if they do so. Of course some such thing as that is just what the Pope is fishing for, and only if it should be so at the official direction of the queen, such a recognition on the part of England would be of great weight in the longed-for universal recognition of the Papal sovereignty.
