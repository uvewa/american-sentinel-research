# Bound to Succeed.

We are all quite familiar with the idea that a man’s heart and pocket can be most certainly reached through his stomach; it has remained for National Reformers to propose reaching his head by the same route, a Fourth of July W. C. T. U. National Reform basket picnic having been arranged for Valley Camp, Pa.

> We hope the effort will succeed. Much talk has been indulged in from time to time about popularizing National Reform; Vice- President Frances E. Willard and Secretary Weir are to be congratulated upon this excellent device for bringing about that end.— *Christian Nation.*

We see no reason why the National Reform movement should not succeed, now that its managers have discovered some substantial argument. If they hope to succeed, they would do well to stick to the new plan, for certainly they will be able to reach people’s heads by this indirect means much quicker than by any direct means which they have heretofore used. All the National Reform arguments that we have ever read have left us feeling as though we had been fed upon the east wind. Their new argument will be far more “filling.”

The papers announce that “the Pope grants unprecedented honors to Queen Victoria.” It was very kind indeed in the dear, good Pope to condescend to “grant” honors, unprecedented or otherwise, to the queen of Great Britian. The unprecedented honor in this case is that the Pope has “entirely of his own accord, and without any hint from Cardinal Manning, issued a rescript which ordains that on Jubilee day, June 21, high mass and a Te Deum shall be performed in all Roman Catholic Churches in England.” It is said that “his holiness could not have done more in the case of the most faithful Catholic sovereign.” And then it is suggested, very innocently, of course, that “the English clergy might return the compliment on the occasion of his holiness’s approaching jubilee.” Yes, they might, nor should we be much surprised if they do so. Of course some such thing as that is just what the Pope is fishing for, and only if it should be so at the official direction of the queen, such a recognition on the part of England would be of great weight in the longed-for universal recognition of the Papal sovereignty.

Let us preach and teach that liberty in the truth is the only abiding freedom.—*Rev. L. A. Abbott. *[65]
