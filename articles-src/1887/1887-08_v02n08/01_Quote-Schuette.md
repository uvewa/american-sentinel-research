Among the nations past and gone there is not one people which, if ever free to govern themselves, preserved their freedom. They either did not value properly their inherent right of self-government, and deservedly lost it, or they were meanly deprived of it by dint of false doctrine and fraud, or by force of arms. *—Schuette.*
