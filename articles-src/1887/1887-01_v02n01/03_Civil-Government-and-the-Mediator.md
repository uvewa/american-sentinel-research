# Civil Government and the Mediator.

The grand error, perhaps, of National Reform is in its persistently hugging the fabulous and shadowy being it calls a “moral person.” But let us admit (for the argument) that the State is a moral person, as Nation al Reformers say. It will be admitted that no unfallen being or person approaches God through a Mediator. Adam and Eve did not before the fall. Holy angels do not now. The question then arises, Is civil government, if a “moral person,” a fallen person? Civil government was instituted after man’s fall and was intended for the benefit of believers and unbelievers, and differed in this respect from the church, which was intended by its founder to be made up only of believers. There has been no change made in the constitution of civil government since it was instituted. If then it is a fallen person, it must have been created so by a holy and righteous God; which is a conclusion too dishonoring to God to be entertained for a moment. Civil government then not having fallen from “its first estate,” needs no Mediator, and has no atonement, as ono writer in the name of National Reform admits. It worships God in obeying his commands, and that without a Mediator.

We notice a few scriptures. National Reform says, “Christ as Mediator represents the Godhead in the government of the world.” That is for National Reformers to prove. It seems monstrous to hold that God can surrender, or delegate his essential kingdom to [3] another. We are, according to this astounding idea, to understand that when Christ declares a sparrow shall not fall to the ground without the permission of our heavenly Father, the reference is to the mediatorial kingdom instead of God’s kingdom of providence, or his essential kingdom; that when our Saviour taught his disciples to pray to their heavenly Father for daily bread, the Mediator was meant. Will some ardent National Reformer cite us to a single passage of Scripture that asserts that Christ as Mediator ever furnished a mouthful of food for his people *except by a miracle?* His whole work upon the hearts of men is supernatural. Christ as Mediator does not interfere with the essential government of the Godhead in his natural and providential dealing with mankind, except as the interests of his church require. Saint and sinner eat of the grain from the same field, warmed by God’s sun, fertilized by his rains, and the only difference is, the saints through mediatorial intercession receive a supernatural blessing with it.

National Reformers cite Matt. 28:18, “All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.” They set up a man of straw; no one denies the *power* of the Mediator. But the question is as to the *exercise* of that power. We bold to the declaration that the exercise of the mediatorial power is subservient to the interests of the church. The mediatorial power is infinite, but its exercise is just equal to the need of the children of God. The *grace* of the Mediator is infinite, but its exercise is limited to the perfect welfare of the elect. So it is we apprehend in regard to the *power* of the Mediator; it is limited in its exercise to the needs of the elect. If we are charged with impiety in holding to the latter, National Reformers are liable to the same charge in reference to the former.

Matt. 28:18 is cited, but this does not refer to the government of the world in the exercise of “all power” but to the needs of his church *baptizing and teaching.* It refers undoubtedly to Christ’s spiritual kingdom. We believe the National Reformers make a gross misapplication of the text. The work that Christ put upon his disciples was a mighty one. From the human standpoint the means to the end were insignificant and foolish. Hence Christ, to help their wavering faith, prefaced his command by telling them, all power in earth and heaven was given unto him. “Go ye therefore,” said he, without fear and doubting, “and disciple all nations,” “and, lo, I am with you alway.” The reference is undoubtedly to the exercise of Christ’s power in establishing his spiritual kingdom. This will be clear when we compare Rev. 2:26 with the text cited. This passage *gives the same power precisely* into the hands of *believers.* If the passage cited by the National Reformers gives Christ, as Mediator, rule over civil governments, or “the nations,” then in that case he is to have rivals to his supremacy, for Rev. 2:26 puts the *same power* into the hands of believers. “To him [“that overcometh”] will I give power over the nations.” We have had these passages examined by a critical and learned expositor, and he tells us the original word is the same in both places.

One passage more, Col. 2:9, 10. These verses have no reference whatever by any kind of twisting to civil government. National Reformers, to make this citation available, must show that civil governments are included in the words, “principalities and powers.” This no man can do; because the apostle settles it beyond all controversy the other way. In the fifteenth verse it is said, having *“spoiled* principalities and powers;” and if civil government is included, then the apostle was mistaken, for civil government yet lives *unspoiled,* for National Reformers to quarrel over with the rest of the world. The allusion is doubtless the same the apostle makes in Eph. 6:12, to spiritual powers: “For we wrestle not against *flesh* and *blood,* hut against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness,” etc. The exposition that National Reformers give would make the Mediator “spoil” an institution of which National Reform declares him the head. Ho is absurdly made by them to overwhelm his own kingdom. They seem determined to “take him by force and make him King.” We are profoundly persuaded that the crown National Reform holds in its hand is a crown of thorns. Orient.
