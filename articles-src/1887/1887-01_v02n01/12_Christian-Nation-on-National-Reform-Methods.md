The *-Christian Nation* puts the whole thing in a nut-shell, when it says:—

> "There seems to us to be a feeling throughout the rank and filo of our workers for National Reform something like this: Secure the respect of men for our cause first, and then work as much as possible without losing that respect."

It would be impossible to make a clearer or better analysis of the methods of National Reform. The *Nation* calls upon them to get down from their "loftiness," but we are quite sure that they will not do it. Their movement is essentially of this world, and is dependent solely upon worldly influences, worldly methods, and the political preferences of men ambitious of worldly power; therefore, the first and last consideration *must* be to secure the respect of men. For the National Reform workers to get down from such "loftiness" would be the certain destruction of their cause.

Wendell Phillips said: "No reform, moral or intellectual, ever came down from the upper classes of society. Each and all came up from the protest of martyr and victim." This very characteristic, and the essential one, of National Reform, of working exclusively amongst "the upper classes of society," of courting the respect of the "respectable classes," shows that it lacks the element of a true reform. It begins in the wrong place; it uses the wrong methods of true reform. By Mr. Phillips' statement—and it is the truth—"National Reform" is the reverse of true reform, and therefore is not reform at all.
