The *Christian Statesman* says that recently National Reform "Secretary" Weir "has met with a cordial welcome for the sake of his cause," in Maryland and Virginia, and thereby "has been convinced that the work ought to be carried at once into the Southern States." The *Statesman* and Mr. Weir are both way behind the times. If they had carefully read the Sentinel they would have learned that National Reform has already begun—more than a year ago—in the Southern States. Both in Arkansas and in Tennessee, quite a goodly number of people have been fined and imprisoned, within the past year, for worshiping God according to the dictates of their own consciences. But if Secretary Weir or some other leading National Reformer should go down there, we have no doubt that the good work could, by organization, be greatly promoted, and their ebullient zeal made much more effective in rooting out heresy. For the information of whoever of the "Secretaries" shall go to the South, we would state that he will certainly find at Springville, Arkansas; Paris, Tennessee; and Atalla, Alabama, a cordial welcome for the sake of his cause. He would do well to make these places his headquarters. At Paris there are now honest Christian men lying in prison for conscience' sake; in Springville the same thing has been; and in Atalla there is an earnest desire on the part of certain persons that it shall be. Also in Worcester, Massachusetts, there are men who are soon to be compelled to stand trial for conscience' sake; we would direct the National Reformers to that city as a promising field. We would advise all the "District Secretaries" to become subscribers, and regular readers of the American Sentinel. They can thus keep well informed in regard to all the particularly good openings for the display of their activities for National Reform.
