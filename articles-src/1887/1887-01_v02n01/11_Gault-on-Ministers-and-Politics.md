"Secretary" Gault says:—

> "An ungodly world has ever frowned contempt upon ministers of the gospel who take an active part in the politics of the day. The devil only asked of the Saviour that he would withdraw from politics and let him manage the governments of the world."

Webster defines blasphemous as "wickedly calumnius," and under this definition we think we are just in saying that the above paragraph is blasphemous; for it is false and libelous, and could have been written by no one except a "National Reformer," or an avowed infidel. If Mr. Gault has ever read the Bible he must know that our Saviour never had anything to do with politics. He must know also that the devil tried to draw our Saviour into politics, and as an inducement offered him "all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them," but the offer was rejected with scorn. Yet Mr. Gault is the man who advises Sentinel writers to study the Bible, and is one of the men to whom, when "National Reform" shall have succeeded, the courts must look for the interpretation of the Bible. All true Christians should pray to be spared the sight.

We would inform Mr. Gault that the Saviour could have entered into politics only at the expense of falling down and worshiping Satan. This proposition is still open to the ministers of Christ, and they cannot mingle in politics without to a greater or less extent accepting it.
