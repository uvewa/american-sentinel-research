The first volume of the American Sentinel met with as great favor as could be expected, or even desired. True, its circulation was not nearly as large as it should have been, but was as large as could reasonably be expected under the circumstances. It has had a great many intelligent and appreciative readers; and many have confessed themselves enlightened upon the subject of which it treats, and have become aroused to the importance of the subject, and to the danger which impends over our beloved country from the strenuous efforts which are being made to unite Church and State in this land.

Volume Two is commenced under more favorable auspices. Friends have been raised up who are pledged to aid in extending its circulation. We have reason to confidently look for a largely increased subscription list for 1887.

The progress of the National Reform party, and the course of the *Christian Statesman, *the organ of that party, we have carefully watched for about a score of years. We have marked every phase of the agitation of the question of a Religious Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, and closely studied the arguments by which that party seeks to accomplish its ends. That many of those people think they are laboring for the glory of God, and for the upbuilding of the kingdom of Christ, does not turn their sophistries into truths, nor lessen the danger which their movement threatens. The ultimate action of the Inquisition—the burning of heretics—was named an "act of faith." The Saviour forewarned his followers that the time would come when "whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service." John 16:2. Zeal for the church and for the cause of God, led Saul to persecute the Christians; but that did not remove the guilt of the persecutors, nor lighten the stones by which Stephen was put to death.

Considering the magnitude and the rapid growth of the Religious Amendment movement, it is surprising that so little attention has been paid to it by the secular press. The public press ought always to be the advocate of the people's rights—the vigilant guardian of our liberties. Some of the newspapers have highly commended the Sentinel, while others have expressed their surprise that anybody considered the movement worthy of so much notice. We fear that the majority of the papers will utterly ignore this subject until our dearest liberties are subverted, and the way is opened for the scenes which marked "the dark ages" of European history to be re-enacted in America.

While we have followed the Amendmentists in the announcements of their purposes, in their platform, their published speeches, their sermons, editorials, etc., they have studiously avoided meeting our arguments, concealing them from their readers. They only meet us with repeated sneers at, what they are pleased to term, our ignorance of the Bible, of history, of the principles of civil government, and even of their own intentions. It may be gratifying to their self-complacency to hide themselves behind slurs and insinuations; but the popularity of their cause will not always prove a shield for their course.

They have declared, with great assurance, that they have not given so much notice because our arguments "do not meet the question." But we appeal to the readers, both theirs and ours: What is the point which we have to meet? Where shall it be found? We propose to briefly re-examine some of the positions which they have taken before the public, and if we do not both touch the question, and fully meet it, we invite them, one and all, to point out our failure.

The National Reform Convention held in Pittsburg, Pa., Feb. 4, 5, 1874, was the largest of the kind that was ever held, and the *Statesman* says the report of its proceedings is "more full of life than either of the others." Hon. Felix R. Brunot, president of the National Association, was chosen president of this convention. On taking the chair, President Brunot delivered an address, in which he quoted verbatim from the published principles of the Association, as follows:—

> "We propose 'such an Amendment to the Constitution of the United States (or its preamble) as will suitably acknowledge Almighty God as the author of the nation's existence and the ultimate source of its authority, Jesus Christ as its ruler, and the Bible as the supreme rule of its conduct, and thus indicate that this is a Christian nation, and place all Christian laws, institutions, and usages on an undeniable legal basis in the fundamental law of the land.'"

This paragraph expresses the very "sum and substance" of the aims and designs of the Religious Amendment party. A more clear and explicit expression of the object of that party could not be made. As we will further show, in another article, this is *the point* of their movement.

Now we inquire: Have we mistaken "the point" aimed at by the Religious Amendmentists? Surely we have not. President Brunot, speaking for the Association and the convention, says, "We propose"—and then follows this declaration of their aims. Have we failed to "meet" this point, as they have said? The leading article of the first number of the Sentinel was mostly devoted to an examination of this very paragraph. And in every number we have taken up the speeches and writings of the leading advocates of that Amendment, and pointed out the sophistries of their reasonings and the dangerous tendency of their doctrines. Failed to meet the question, indeed!

The correct way to judge measures is by their consequences. The plan of these "Reformers" may seem plausible; but we must look beyond present appearances, and inquire what effect this Amendment would have on the administration of our Government. This is a question of interest to every citizen, and in answering it we shall deal only with evident facts,—so evident that none can possibly deny them.

1. To place the laws, institutions, and usages of Christianity on a legal basis is to make them matters of legal enforcement. And as no law can exist or be enforced without a penalty, so Christianity, or what they may be pleased to recognize as Christianity, would then be enforced by civil penalties. Anything less than this would not place the laws of Christianity on a legal basis in the law of the land.

2. A person can be convicted of a misdemeanor only before a court of justice, and the court is necessarily constituted the judge or exponent of the law. And, therefore, under the proposed Religious Amendment, the court would have to decide what is or what is not Christian law, institution, or usage.

3. But the Amendmentists do not intend that such questions shall be decided by civil courts. May it not be, then, that they will do something to relieve this matter of its odious appearance? Let us see. A writer in the *Christian Statesman* says:—

> "We will not allow the civil Government to decide between them [the churches] and to ordain church doctrines, ordinances, and laws."

But we see no hope of relief in this suggestion. No matter what is the nature of the court or tribunal which shall determine questions of Christian institution or usage, the fact would remain that matters of Christian faith and practice would be removed from the domain of individual conscience, and placed in the hands of a legal body, whose duty or privilege it should be to decide what is and what is not Christian faith and practice,—what we may and what we may not believe and practice as professed Christians! For, remember, whatever they decide is Christian institution or usage, is to be placed on a legal basis in the law of the land.

4. There are many different forms of religion in the land; and inasmuch as all creeds and faiths cannot possibly be embraced in the same legal enactment, it will become the duty of the law-makers to decide which shall be enforced as the true religion! It then needs no extended argument to show that *somebody's religious rights* will be trampled under foot. And it would not make any difference how small the minority whose consciences were ignored, and who were made to conform to *somebody else's religion* which themselves did not believe, it would still be *religious oppression,* and a subversion of the dearest principles of our Government.

5. It is quite useless for the advocates of the proposed Religious Amendment to deny that their movement tends to a union of Church and State, for they expressly declare that "the State and its sphere exist for the sake of and to serve the interest of the Church." (See *Christian Statesman* of March, 1884.) In the same article it was declared to be "the duty of the State, as such, to enter into alliance with the Church of Christ, and to profess, adhere to, defend, and maintain, the true religion." And they complacently talk of what the churches will and will not suffer the civil Government to do in carrying out the Religious Amendment. Now if placing Christian usages on a legal basis, and subordinating the civil State to the will and interests of the Church, is not a union of Church and State, then we shall be pleased to be informed what would be such a union. Such a state of things once existed under the Roman emperors and popes, and it is universally regarded as a union of Church and State. And so it would be here.

6. Not only religionists, but non-religionists, have rights. Not only will minorities in religion be compelled to observe religious usages which they do not believe, but non-religionists will also be compelled to observe "Christian laws, institutions, and usages," without any religious conviction whatever. These model "Reformers" do not pretend that they can make men Christians by legal enactment; they only intend to compel them by law *to act as if they were Christians!*

7. Under the proposed Amendment, and in such a Government as they contemplate, only professed Christians can be eligible to office. They have already announced that in their system of government every consistent infidel will be disfranchised, and Christians alone, or they who conform to Christian usages, can be permitted to hold office. It needs no great insight into politics and human nature to foresee that every persistent office-seeker will then become a member of the church—the most popular one, of course—as the surest stepping-stone to office. And in this manner these model Reformers propose to turn our republic into the kingdom of Christ!

8. But one more point we will notice. The National Reformers profess the intention to retain the republican features of our Government; the officers will be elected by the majority, and the administration of the Government will be shaped according to the will of the majority. But the will of the majority is constantly changing, as parties rise and fall. As there are now party politics, so then there will be party religions. To suppose otherwise, is to suppose that human nature is suddenly to be entirely transformed. The majority, wherever that majority may be found, will always have it in their power to determine *what religion* shall be enforced at any given time. And *the religion of the nation will be put in the market at every general election. *Religious questions will then be canvassed, not only in the churches and in the civil courts, but on the stump, on the streets, and in the saloons. Candidates will be put up on this and that religious issue. And what would be the consequence? Religion itself would become contemptible in the eyes of the masses, and a reaction would take place, fatal to the cause of Christianity in our country, or else a *religious tribunal of last resort* would be demanded—a second papal system, modeled after that of Rome.

This is but a digest of these subjects as they have been presented in the first volume of the Sentinel, and we repeat our appeal to the reader: Have we not herein met the very point, the vital question at issue? We invite, we earnestly urge, our opposers to point out any particular wherein we err in our conclusions. Please to show that what we have indicated as conclusions, are not relevant. We affirm that what we have indicated as the results of that Amendment being adopted, are not *only possible,* but *inevitable.*

American citizens, sons of the patriots of 1776 and 1787, our appeal is unto you. Do not be deluded by the siren song of "assured peace in the land." Strife and contention, religious intolerance and persecution, are as sure to follow the adoption of a Religious Amendment to our National Constitution as effect follows cause. It is in your power now to avert it. But if you let the warning pass unheeded; if you suffer the flood-gates of bigotry and intolerance, of misguided religious zeal, to be opened in this land, be assured that no hand can stay the flood until desolation and ruin are left in its track.  J. H. W.
