# The Situation of the Present as Related to the Past.

In reading the lives of John and Charles Wesley, one is astonished at the unreasonable prejudice manifested against the labors of these men. They were frequently set upon by mobs, and miserably abused when they had committed no offense except preaching plain Bible truths without conforming to all the burdensome ritual of the Established Church. But any attempt at a description of the opposition they had to meet would be out of place in this short article. The point which I wish to notice is the opinion that was entertained by the reformers of those times regarding ministers meddling themselves much in matters of civil government.

Dr. Whitehead was a personal friend of John Wesley, and one of three to whom Mr. Wesley willed all his manuscript. From this manuscript the Doctor wrote the authorized lives of the Wesleys. In this book he expresses the sentiment of his fellow-laborers. In this work he publishes an account of a Methodist minister named Westall, preaching at Cambourn, England, in the year 1751. The services were held in the house of one Mr. Harris. In the midst of the discourse he was assaulted by a mob and forcibly taken from the house. This was on Sunday. He was held by them until the following Tuesday, at which time the Rev. Dr. Borlase issued his *mittimus,* by virtue of which Westall was to be committed to the house of correction at Bodmin as a vagrant. He was kept in charge at that place until the next quarter, when the justices met and decided the action illegal. This circumstance caused Mr. Whitehead to remark as follows:—

> “How seldom have we seen clergymen in the commission of the peace, but they have neglected the duties of their profession, and grossly abused the power committed to them! Our Lord declared his kingdom was not of this world, and when his ministers, of any denomination, obtain dominion and authority over the temporal things of others, or acquire any share in the civil government, it seems as if a curse attended everything they do. They mar whatever they meddle with, and occasion infinite confusion and mischief.”

It will be seen from the above expression of sentiment that the early Methodists were far from favoring the meddling of ministers with the civil government. As they sought God in earnest prayer for divine aid, they could realize something of the inconsistency of a church professing to follow the meek and lowly Saviour, and yet at the same time endeavoring to force every one to worship God just as they did. In their condition they could measure the enormity of the crime attached to the persecution of the righteous, because they chanced to be on the side of the few. These representative pioneers could then pass sweeping condemnation upon the very things now so earnestly sought after by their professed followers.

It is to be supposed that there are honest, God-fearing people not on the popular side of some of the theological problems of our times. What shall these expect from the reverend magistrates when all Christian laws, institutions, and usages (as they shall interpret them) shall be placed on an undeniable legal basis in the fundamental law of the nation? Will any one have an occasion to complain of these clerical officials then as Dr. Whitehead and Wesley remonstrated against them in their day? Are men so much better now than they were then that they make to us a great blessing out of what proved to be such a curse then? If mankind has improved so much since Wesley’s time that there is no danger of civil power being prostituted for partisan purposes, we would then suppose that the people are so far enlightened that they could become religious without the aid of a theocracy to coerce them into the service of the Lord. Wm. Covert.
