Section VII of the constitution, of Kansas reads as follows:—

> "The right to worship God according to the dictates of conscience, shall never be infringed; nor shall any person be compelled to attend or to support any form of worship; nor shall control of, or interference with, the right of conscience be permitted, or any preference be given by law to any religious establishment or mode of worship."

And yet Mr. M. A. Gault, speaking with direct reference to this section, calls the Kansas constitution a "rickety constitution" See *Christian Statesman,* October 22, 1885.
