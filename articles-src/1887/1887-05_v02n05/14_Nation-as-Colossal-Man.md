The National Reformers are determined to have the nation a moral person, even though they have to create it such. In the Cincinnati Convention, 1872, Prof. J. R. W. Sloane said of a nation, that its "true figure is that of a colossal man," having "consciousness," "will," "purpose," and "a soul." "District Secretary" Rev. J. M. Foster, carries forward the conception after this sort:—

> "The executive department of Government is the *head,* the judicial the *arms,* and the legislative the *legs,* through which this sovereign body exercises its will."—*Christian Statesman, July 24, 1884.*

We are waiting to see who of them will complete the absurd idea. There is here an excellent opportunity for the Rev. M. A. Gault to display the creative power of his sublime genius.
