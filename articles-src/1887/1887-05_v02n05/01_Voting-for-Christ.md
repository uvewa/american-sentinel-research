In the *Christian Statesman,* January 20, was published an article by Dr. T. K. Davis on "Using the Ballot for the Glory of God," in which he inquires, "Could any method of confessing and honoring Christ be more significant and emphatic than *to vote for him?" *And the italics are his. This article the *Statesman* says "ought to waken earnest reflection in multitudes of Christian minds." We think it ought; especially in view of the National Reform efforts to make this the popular method of "confessing and honoring Christ."
