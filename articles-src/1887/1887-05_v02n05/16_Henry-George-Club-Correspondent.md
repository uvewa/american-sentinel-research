The librarian of a "Henry George Club" in Cincinnati, Ohio, writes us that we may be sure that anyone who writes under that heading is "opposed to the union of Church and State—particularly under our present social conditions." He thinks, however, that we are wasting our time fighting an "improbable bugaboo," while a far deeper social wrong, viz., land monopoly, exists, and that, "under a *proper social system,* the evil that you so much dread would amount to nothing, *even if it did take place."*

Our friend may be very sure that it will take place, when so many people are ignorant as to the progress it has already made, and are indifferent as to whether it does or not. And when it does come, he will find that a "proper social system" will be just the thing that cannot possibly exist in connection with it. A proper social system would keep National Reform pretensions from becoming actual facts.
