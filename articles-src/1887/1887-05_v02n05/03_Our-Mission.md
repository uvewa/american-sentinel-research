The Sentinel frequently receives letters from people who want it to advocate this, that, or the other reform. Now we heartily sympathize with all true reformers. We know that intemperance is a horrible curse, that the devil has agents circulating vile literature in every place possible, and that unnamable vice is stalking through the land. But there are thousands of good people who by voice and pen are working with might and main to check these evils, while the American Sentinel is the only paper in existence whose sole object is to combat a rapidly-growing movement which, if successful, would make us a nation of slaves, not simply slaves in body, but what is far worse, slaves in conscience. And so while we bid all true reformers Godspeed, we must confine ourselves to exposing the sophistries of those who under the name of reform would rob us of all our liberties.
