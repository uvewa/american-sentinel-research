In the *Christian Nation,* February 9, 1887, Rev. W. J. Coleman says that Senator Sherman is credited with favoring an appropriation of one hundred millions of dollars for coast defenses, and then remarks as follows:—

> "The hundred million which the Senator would expend on earth-works and great guns, if put at interest, would yield as much every year as all the Christians in the United States give to foreign missions. And why would not that be a wiser way to expend it? It would soften our hearts at home until we would not want to fight, and it would raise our reputation abroad so that our neighbors would not want to fight us."

What a wonderful efficacy there must be in National Reform prescriptions. Why don't some of these Reformers persuade the European nations to adopt this method of raising their reputation? It would be a splendid missionary triumph if they only could do it.
