In the Pittsburg Convention, 1874, National Reform President Brunot said:—

> "Where States undertake by statute laws to compel men's consciences in their, relation to God, there is a condition of affairs indicated as a 'union of Church and State.'"

It would be impossible to compel men's consciences in any other relation than their relation to God, because conscience has to do alone with man's relation to God. Yet to have the State by statute laws to compel men's consciences is precisely what the National Reformers propose to do. Proof: Rev. David Gregg in the *Christian Statesman,* June 5, 1884, said of "civil government: —

> "It has the right to be, and the right to command the consciences of men."

Therefore, by their own premises, the conclusion inevitably follows that under a National Reform Government there would be "a condition of affairs indicated as a union of Church and State," and they can't disprove it.
