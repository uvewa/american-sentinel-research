"District Secretary" Rev. M. A. Gualt says he is "proud to belong to a denomination which appropriates $10,000 of its funds for political agitation each year." We do not doubt it in the least. But, Mr. Gault, "Pride goeth before destruction," for "Everyone that is proud in heart is an abomination to the Lord; though hand join in hand, he shall not be unpunished." To the American people we say, When these proud political agitators come to you, remember that "Blessed is that man that maketh the Lord his trust, *and respecteth not the proud."*
