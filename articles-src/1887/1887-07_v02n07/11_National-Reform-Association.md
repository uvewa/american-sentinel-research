The above is the title of an organization that seeks a union of Church and State. Despite all their disclaimers, in their demands for changes in our Government are found embodied all those ideas that lead logically to a union of Church and State as fully as that which exists with the Mormons in Utah. The papers and the ministers of this association abound in arguments that point unmistakably to such union.

We had, during our colonial days, several examples of such union, the fruits of which we read in the hanging of Quakers, and the various civil disabilities imposed upon men whose faith was not in harmony with orthodox creeds. They could not act as jurors, could hold no office, were not allowed to testify, and had no vote. By the time our Constitution was framed, these disabilities had become so odious in the popular mind that it was determined that the separation between Church and State should be made complete, and that no religious tests should be allowed.

We often hear this omission imputed to Jefferson, who is reputed an infidel; but the [55] truth of history is, that the framers of that instrument were nearly all, if not quite all, believers in Christianity, and Jefferson was not in the convention, nor in this country when it was made. From the days of Constantine to that time no case could be cited in which the union of Church and State had not proven pernicious to both. Dr. Crosby has put the matter well when he says: "The moment you put religion in the hands of the Government you do what Constantine did, and will bring about the dark ruin of the tenth century." Conversely, when you put the Government under church control, the history of the Roman church in its wars and persecutions, the Inquisition of Torquemada, the fires of Smith- field, and the bloody records of witchcraft and hanging of Quakers is prophetic of what will follow. These unions have never purified politics, always have degraded religion.

We know it is claimed that the age of persecution is passed. 'Tis not so. We see around us constantly reminders that human nature is always the same—and as long as we have bigots in religion we will have the spirit of persecution that would employ fire and fagot if it dared. How often do we hear it claimed that only members of church are fit for public stations. All pains and penalties and disabilities imposed for lack of belief in dogmatic theology, whether it be by the State or by the Church, is against the genius and spirit of American institutions; and he who advocates it is disloyal to that freedom of conscience which every truly good citizen claims for himself and freely accords to others.

Man's religion is a matter wholly between the Creator and the creature; and homage is voluntary, belonging to a realm over which no human authority extends. Neither State nor Church can coerce men into piety, or subjugate individual reason. "Each soul, as to its faith, its thoughts, and affections, and the obligations which bind it to God, is as free from the rightful control of human authority as it could be if no such authority existed. This is what is meant by religious freedom; not from God's authority, but man's authority; so that each one is left to follow the dictates of his own conscience." All the rightful duty of Government in matters of religion, is to *protect.*

We have written these things because of the efforts being made by the National Reformers to change our Constitution, under which men enjoy full liberty of conscience, and have prospered more than another people, and because we fear Pharisees more than publicans and harlots. Better let it be—let well enough alone, and take no steps in the direction of the conditions in the time of Constantine, Louis XIV. of France, the Commonwealth rule in England, or the Puritans in Massachusetts.—*Eaton (Ohio) Register.*
