## National Reform District Secretary J. M. Foster says:—

> "The same cry that aroused the crusaders in the eleventh century to rescue the holy sepulcher from the hands of the infidel, will awake the hosts of Immanuel to rescue this land from the powers of the world, and incorporate it in the *City of God."—Christian Statesman, June 2, 1887.*

We have an idea that that is just about the straight truth in the matter as it will be when National Reform gets to its full tide of progress. Then, as like causes produce like effects, we may expect to see again enacted some of the fanatical scenes of the crusades. Says Waddington: "The crusaders exclaimed, 'It is the will of God!' and in that fancied behest, the fiercest brutalities which the world ever beheld sought—not palliation, but— honor and the crown of eternal reward."
