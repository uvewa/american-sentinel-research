# The Question Met—and Evaded!

The Religious Amendment party has utterly failed to vindicate itself under the indictment which we have brought against the movement. The Sentinel has taken up the leading declaration of what they “propose” to do; it has analyzed it, and clearly pointed out its tendency, and its unavoidable results; it has examined the main points in their own reports of the speeches of their leading men; it has followed the *Statesman* in its editorials and in its correspondence; and while they have maintained an apparently studied silence in regard to our exposure of their errors and sophistries, they console themselves with asserting that our arguments do not “meet the question.” We now propose to show that the question has been meandering in the hands of its friends, and can only be met by crossing its winding track.

A National Convention of the Amendmentists was held in Pittsburg in 1869. In the call for this convention are found the following words:—

> “The National Association, which has been formed for the purpose of securing such an Amendment to the National Constitution as will remedy this great defect, indicate that this is a Christian nation, and place all Christian laws, institutions, and usages in our Government on an undeniable legal basis in the fundamental law of the nation, invites,” etc.

In the Cincinnati Convention in 1872, Dr. T. P. Stevenson, editor of the *Christian States man,* and Recording Secretary of the National Association, delivered an address on “The Legal Effect and Practical Value of the Proposed Amendment,” in which he attempted to guard the expression of the above “call” as follows:—

> “It will furnish a legal basis for all Christian laws, institutions, and usages in our Government. . . . It is all Christian laws, institutions, and usages *in our Government. *We do not propose to find a basis for the laws and institutions of the church, of Christian families, or of the closet, in the National Constitution; but for that great body of laws, institutions, and usages, *in our Government,* which are of Christian origin.”

This disclaimer is worthless, for two reasons: 1. It is neutralized by other statements of the “Reformers,” and of Doctor Stevenson himself, as we shall show. 2. There is no “great body of laws, institutions, and usages in our Government, which are of Christian origin.” In fact, there is not a single law, institution or usage in our Government which is of Christian origin, as we shall presently notice.

In the second Pittsburg Convention, held in 1874, Hon. Felix R. Brunot, president both of the association and of the convention, announced the object of their movement as follows:—

> “We propose ‘such an Amendment to the Constitution of the United States (or its preamble) as will suitably acknowledge Almighty God as the author of the nation’s existence and the ultimate source of its authority, Jesus Christ as its ruler, and the Bible as the supreme rule of its conduct, and thus indicate that this is a Christian nation, and place all Christian laws, institutions, and usages on an undeniable legal basis in the fundamental laws of the land.”

President Brunot quoted the above words from their previously made declaration of principles. The limitation for which Mr. Stevenson made his plea was not inserted. We shall give reasons for believing that there was no intention to have it inserted.

Regarding this declaration of principles a letter of inquiry was addressed to the *Statesman,* asking if they meant what they said; if, inasmuch as baptism and the Lord’s Supper are “Christian institutions,” it was their intention to have these placed on a legal basis. But, instead of “touching the real question,” they evaded it, and gave the following as the enumeration of the points at which they aimed:—

> “Among these are the laws which regulate marriage, and those which forbid and punish blasphemy, the offering of prayer in our National and State Legislatures, the maintenance of religious worship and instruction in our asylums, reformatories, and jails, the observance of public thanksgivings and fasts, the use of the oath in courts of justice, and many others. All these, moreover, are proper to the State, and cannot, in any candid mind, be confounded with baptism and the Lord’s Supper.”

No; these are not to be confounded with baptism and the Lord’s Supper, because these latter are “Christian institutions while those enumerated by the *Statesman* are not! Not one of the things mentioned by the *Statesman *is peculiar to Christianity. When the question was raised as to what would be the effect of the Religious Amendment on the Jew, an officer of the association replied: “We are not a Jewish, but a Christian nation; therefore our legislation must be conformed to the institution and spirit of Christianity.” And yet it is a fact that the Jewish nation had every law, institution, and usage which the *Statesman *enumerated, which can be drawn from the Scriptures. Of late a conference of Jewish rabbis appointed a committee to draw up a petition to be presented to Congress, urging that body to pass a national marriage law. And yet our model Reformers tell us that marriage is a Christian institution. The truth is, that the origin of marriage is given in the Hebrew Scriptures, and the institution antedates Christianity. And so of the other points named.

But, we inquire, what effect did the inquiry have on the National Reformers? It led them to be yet more guarded in their platform, and it now reads thus:—

> “The object of this society shall be to maintain existing Christian features in the American Government, to promote needed reforms in the action of the Government,” etc., “and place all the Christian laws, institutions, and usages of our Government,” etc.

We might safely challenge them to show that there are any “Christian features” in our Government—anything that is peculiar to Christianity. But the point we wish to notice now is, that this platform does not really express their designs. In the Pittsburg Convention Dr. Stevenson gave an address on “The Ends We Seek,” before President Brunot took the chair and announced what they “propose” to do. Dr. S. said:— [52]

> “Through the immense largesses it receives from corrupt politicians, the Roman Catholic Church is, practically, the established church of the city of New York. These favors are granted under the guise of a seeming friendliness to religion. We propose to put the substance for the shadow, to drive out the counterfeit by the completer substitution of the true.”

This language may seem much or little; we shall have to interpret it by other statements which more clearly reveal their designs. In this same address Mr. Stevenson said:—

> “Our hopes, too, look beyond the mere maintenance of our Christian institutions as they are. We must do more than merely arrest the current which is bearing us away from God and religion. We must begin to make progress in the opposite direction. The success of our movement will be the introduction of a springing and germinant principle into the Constitution, which will yet redeem American politics from all unholy influences, and enable us to attain to a complete and consistent character as a Christian nation.”

There is no mistaking this language. To expect to exclude “unholy influences” from American politics, and yet maintain the republic—allow the right of suffrage to the people—is the sheerest folly. The truth is that the success of their schemes will leave scarcely a vestige of the present features of our Government, which is “of the people, by the people, and for the people.” And here we will let President Brunot put a quietus upon the idle assertions of recent writers in the *Statesman.* They present the Government of Israel as the one after which they wish to pattern, and declare that it was a republic, and that under it the people had larger liberty than we have in this Government. In President Brunot’s address in the Pittsburg Convention, February 4, 1874, he said:—

> “Up to the Christian era no nation permitted freedom of conscience in religion. The government of the Israelites was a theocracy. The laws came directly from God.”

This is the truth; but to the same extent that these words are true, to that extent the words of the writers referred to are false.

Particular attention is called to the statement of Doctor Stevenson, that it *is not* their intention to merely maintain “the existing Christian features in our Government,” whatever that expression may mean. The adoption of the proposed Religious Amendment would be the introduction of a “germinant principle into our Constitution;” it would be only the beginning of the complete subordination of the civil to the ecclesiastical power in the nation. Listen to another avowal from the *Christian Statesman* of November 1, 1883:—

> “An acknowledgment of God does not of itself impose any *restraint on the conscience, *nor fix a single law requiring obedience. We have it in our State Constitutions, and it has little or no force. . . But we do not stop here. This is simply the foundation for an imposing structure. These principles are only premises; the conclusion is yet to come, and it has the dangerous character of the syllogism, that the conclusion *must* come, and come with invincible power.”

We have found that these *reformers* often publicly claim much less than they mean, but their words are too significant and strong to permit us to believe that they ever mean less than they claim. The conclusion which has “the dangerous character of the syllogism,” and which *must* “come with invincible power,” is the self-same conclusion which was involved in the Councils of the Catholic Church, and wrought out practically by the Inquisition.

We hope that American citizens do not need any argument to prove to them that the civil Government has no right to put “any restraint upon the conscience.” Yet this is exactly what the National Reformers demand; they affirm that “the church” shall determine what restraints the Government shall put upon the consciences of religious minorities, of dissenters, as well as of the non-religious.

Now while we have taken up the various items of their platform; the published speeches made in their National Conventions; the editorials and correspondence of their papers; and the reports of their “district secretaries;” we have analyzed and shown the tendency of their utterances, their professed arguments; and we have carefully set forth the necessary and undeniable results of the success of their movement—they have not taken up and reviewed a single article of the Sentinel; they have not met a single argument we have presented on the tendencies and results of their movement; they have not attempted to justify their absurd statements wherein they not only confound religion and morality, but religion and crime; and yet they have the effrontery to say that it is unnecessary for them to notice our arguments, because we do not meet the point! Some time since, when this assertion was reiterated, we invited them to frankly and plainly tell us what the point is; what is the question at issue; and if it is not found in their platform; in their published speeches; in their weekly organs, either as editorials or correspondence, to just indicate where we might find it, and we promised to notice it fully and at length, but all in vain. From their actions we might infer that they had joined a perpetual “mum social.”

There are many intelligent and inquiring people carefully watching the progress of this controversy. And the number of such is fast increasing. And the self-styled Reformers may rest assured that, in the eyes of the real inquirer, accusations of ignorance of history, of the Bible, and of government, in which they have freely indulged, are poor substitutes for argument. We would be glad to know whether they ever intend to try to “meet the question,” fairly and squarely on its merits. J. H. W.

Governments have it not in their power to do their subjects the least service as to their religious beliefs and mode of worship. On the contrary, whenever the civil magistrate interposes his authority in matters of religion, otherwise than in keeping the peace amongst all religious parties, you may trace every step he has taken by the mischievous effects his interposition has produced.—*Burgh.*
