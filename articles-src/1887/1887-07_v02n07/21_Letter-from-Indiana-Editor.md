A gentleman in Indiana, who is both a lawyer and the editor of a paper, sends us a letter, from which we take the following extract:—

> "I have just finished reading the May number of the Sentinel. I like it very much. It seems to oppose the National Reform nonsense as a Christian should, and not as an infidel would. I dislike the so-called reform, because I think it dishonors my Saviour, not because I don't believe in him. Whatever dishonors Christ, brings misery to men. I like your arguments, and wish you great success. Many ministers in my church are carried away with this heresy, and are injuring their usefulness. My church is the United Presbyterian; it is near of kin to the Covenanters."

Our friend has the right idea of National Reform, and he has hit exactly upon the secret of the Sentinel's opposition to it. May there be many like him, not only among the United Presbyterians, but among the Covenanters themselves. No one who truly desires to honor the Lord Jesus, will wish to see his religion degraded to the level of politics, nor to have national acknowledgment of Christ secured by the help of the votes of selfish and worldly men.
