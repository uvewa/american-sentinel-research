# At It Again.

This is the title of a very appropriate cartoon inserted in *Puck* for November 18, 1885. It represents the Pope with the triple crown on his head and himself crawling through the ballot-box, to pull down that clause in the Constitution which declares that “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion.” Just above the crawling Pope, suspended from the wall, are extracts from the Papal Encyclical.

> 1. “Every Catholic should rigidly adhere to the teachings of the Roman pontiffs, especially in the matter of modern liberty, which, already, under the semblance of honesty of purpose, leads to error and destruction.”

> 2. “All Catholics must make themselves felt as active elements in daily political life in the countries where they live. They must penetrate wherever possible in the administration of civil affairs.”
> 3. “All Catholics should do all in their power to cause the constitutions of States, and legislation, to be modeled on the principles of the true church.”
With this picture the motto of *Puck* is very appropriate—“What fools these mortals be.”

In the coalition about to be formed between the Papists and the Protestants, this picture well represents the case. It is through the ballot-box that the National Reformers propose to amend the Constitution. And the National Reformers well understand that they can do nothing of the kind without the aid of the Roman Catholics. The Roman Church looks to the subjugation of all earthly Governments. This she has publicly stated many times, and, with a mixture of haughtiness and effrontery, she still urges forward her claims to political power, and to the right to dictate to politicians and statesmen and Governments what policy they shall pursue.

That she has done this in time past, none will deny; that kings and emperors have sat at the feet of the Pope and done his bidding, all history attests; but to a great extent this galling yoke was broken in the progress of liberty and Protestantism since the Reformation. But now Protestantism proposes to undo all her past good deeds, by making religion an element in our national Constitution; and this the proposed Amendment will in effect accomplish. They proclaim to the world their willingness and even their ardent desire to cast this fire-brand of religious controversy into the arena of political strife, thus signifying to all that they wish to have a hand in once more inaugurating wars of extermination, similar to those of the Dark Ages, when Peter the Hermit preached extermination of the Turk, or such a war as the bigoted Philip of Spain confidently entered upon, when he built his huge ships and sent his Invincible Armada to frighten Queen Bess out of her Protestant ideas of allowing her little island to become a safe asylum for religious refugees from the Inquisitions and Bastiles of the continent.

The Sigismund of 1414, who violated his word with Huss and Jerome, and such monarchs as Philip II. of Spain, decided in religious controversy as to what church or what doctrines all should accept; and the Church of Rome is responsible in a large measure for the course pursued by kings and emperors and States of that age.

When a church uses its influence to corrupt the State, that moment the church becomes responsible to God for the blind, mistaken course any Government will enter upon in the administration of religious affairs; and once established, laws of this kind will not be relinquished by the State without a struggle. Such power once attained is a boon to legislators who stoop to any device to gain honor, wealth, or preferment; hence such power as the Amendment to the Constitution of the United States proposes to vest in civil rulers, has dangerous precedents.

Such power, the National Reformers affirm, was vested in the Hebrew State; and certainly all will admit it was evil when bad rulers administered it. So here, we cannot expect to elect good and holy men to the offices of Government; therefore, it will be with us as it was with Israel when Ahab reigned. Elijah will have to flee forty days’ journey into the wilderness, and many Protestant amendmentists will bitterly rue the day they amended the Constitution; for the Government is already under Papal rule to some extent, and it will be wholly so when the Amendment is carried out. Then will Protestant bigots realize the part they have acted in helping the Pope to crawl through the ballot-box. Well does one artist say, “At it again;” in other words, “History is repeating itself.” Joseph Clarke.

In a note on the annual meeting of the National Reform Association and its demand for national religion, the *Christian at Work *makes the suggestive remark that “it is noteworthy that nothing is said as to the deterioration of religious life in the family, nor is any allusion made as to the means for supplying that deficiency.” That is true. Likewise there is nothing said of the deterioration of genuine godliness in the church. All the lack is in the hypothetical individual which they call the nation; that is the butt of all their complaints. They may plaster the national Constitution all over with Religious Amendments, but such methods will never plant practical religion in the family nor supply the lack of vital godliness in the church. They may plead that it is by increased godliness in the family and in the church that they expect to get the Religious Amendment to the Constitution. But it is not so. That association is making no effort to increase godliness in either the family or the church. Its methods and its aims are wholly political, not moral. And this movement being so largely indorsed by the churches is proof positive and confessed that those churches are powerless to do the work which God gave the church to do. Nor will a Constitutional Amendment supply the power. True, it will give the churches the power *to force* upon the ungodly their own form of godliness without the power, all which will only increase unto more ungodliness. And from all such people and their work the word of God commands to turn away. Look at 2 Tim. 3:1-5.
