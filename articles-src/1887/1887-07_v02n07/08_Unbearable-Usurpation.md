# Unbearable Usurpation.

Thus says Prof. O. N. Stoddard, of Wooster University, Ohio, and a leading National Reformer:—

> “The State must begin the cultivation of morals at the cradle’s side, and continue till mature manhood and womanhood have completed the lesson.”

That is to say that the State must step between the parent and the child even at the cradle side, and at the very first begin to instill into the mind of the child doctrines which the parent abhors because he knows in his heart they are false. What can the parent do? If he protests then he is separated entirely from his child, as one whose influence is contaminating and dangerous to the interests and the authority of the State.

Do not think that this statement of Professor Stoddard’s is a slip of the pen, or exceptional among National Reformers. It is straight out National Reform doctrine. In their Cincinnati Convention, 1872, Rev. A. D. Mayo said:—

> “But why not divide this work, and leave the moral and religious part of the education of the citizen to the parent and priest? Because you cannot hold the parent or the priest to any public responsibility to educate the child into that practical form of religion and morality essential to good citizenship in a republican State.”

So therefore under National Reform rule the State must supplant the parent. And under such rule we shall be inducted into the times of Louis XIV., when parents were robbed of their children, because “The will of the king is that there be no more than one religion in this kingdom; it is for the glory of God and the well being of the State.” Or the times of the Covenanter rule in Scotland, when “the preacher reprehended the husband, governed the wife, chastised the children, and insulted over the servants in the houses of the greatest men.”

If there was ever a more wicked scheme devised outside of the Papal Church than is set forth in this National Reform iniquity, we know not where in all history it can be found. And to realize that such a wicked thing is today supported in its aspirations by the moral influence of “all evangelical churches” and by the active influence of the Woman’s *Christian* Temperance Union, is astounding.

A gentleman in Indiana, who is both a lawyer and the editor of a paper, sends us a letter, from which we take the following extract:—

> “I have just finished reading the May number of the Sentinel. I like it very much. It seems to oppose the National Reform nonsense as a Christian should, and not as an infidel would. I dislike the so-called reform, because I think it dishonors my Saviour, not because I don’t believe in him. Whatever dishonors Christ, brings misery to men. I like your arguments, and wish you great success. Many ministers in my church are carried away with this heresy, and are injuring their usefulness. My church is the United Presbyterian; it is near of kin to the Covenanters.”

Our friend has the right idea of National Reform, and he has hit exactly upon the secret of the Sentinel’s opposition to it. May there be many like him, not only among the United Presbyterians, but among the Covenanters themselves. No one who truly desires to honor the Lord Jesus, will wish to see his religion degraded to the level of politics, nor to have national acknowledgment of Christ secured by the help of the votes of selfish and worldly men.
