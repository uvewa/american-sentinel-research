# The Promoter of Sin.

The author of the “Philosophy of the Plan of Salvation” truly says: “All happy obedience must arise from affection, exercised toward the object obeyed. Obedience which arises from affection blesses the spirit which yields it, if the conscience approve of the object obeyed, while, on the contrary, no being can be happy in obeying one whom he does not love. To obey a parent, or to obey God, from interested motives would be sin. The devil might be obeyed for the same reason. All enlightened minds agree to what the Bible confirms, and what reason can clearly perceive without argument, that love for God is essential to every act of religious duty. To tender obedience or homage to God, while we had no love for him in our hearts, would be dishonorable to the Maker, and doing violence to our own nature.”

Than this we know of no paragraph in all literature that more clearly reveals the essential wickedness of all enforced conformity to religious duties, and therefore the wicked cruelty of all State interference in religious things. “No being can be happy in obeying one whom he does not love.” Therefore for Governments to compel men to conform to duty toward God while bearing in their hearts no love for him, is only to compel men to sin, because, saith the Scriptures, “Whatsoever is not of faith is sin.” While for the State to offer inducements to men that would lead them to conform to religious duties from interested motives would also be sin. “To tender obedience or homage to God while we have no love for him in our hearts, would be dishonorable to the Maker, and doing violence to our own nature.” Now such is precisely what the National Reform scheme proposes to do to the people of this nation. The National Reformers propose to compel men to tender obedience and homage to God, while they have no love for him in their hearts. Therefore the direct result of the triumph of National Reform principles will be to compel men to dishonor their Maker and do violence to their own natures, and thus vastly to increase the ratio of sin in the nation and hasten its destruction.

The Bible says, “If one man sin against another, the judge shall judge him; but if a man sin against the Lord, who shall entreat for him.” But the National Reform doctrine is that whether one man sin against another, or whether he sin against the Lord, the judge shall judge him anyhow. The fact of the matter is that nothing can be truer than that National Reform is directly opposed to the Bible.

“District Secretary” Rev. M. A. Gualt says he is “proud to belong to a denomination which appropriates $10,000 of its funds for political agitation each year.” We do not doubt it in the least. But, Mr. Gault, “Pride goeth before destruction,” for “Everyone that is proud in heart is an abomination to the Lord; though hand join in hand, he shall not be unpunished.” To the American people we say, When these proud political agitators come to you, remember that “Blessed is that man that maketh the Lord his trust, *and respecteth not the proud.”*

In the Cleveland National Reform Convention, 1883, the Rev. Frederick Merrick, D. D., said:—

> “Given any form of government, and human nature what it is, and the temptations of office what they are, and corruption is inevitable.”

Of course it is. And yet with human nature exactly as it is, and the temptations of office precisely what they are, these men actually teach that a National Reform form of government will bring the millennium. But even though the thing could last a thousand years it would only be a millennium of corruption worse corrupted. There is no danger however of there ever being a millennium of National Reform. It would be literally impossible for human society to bear for any considerable length of time the weight of corruption that would be heaped upon it by such a form of government.

The National Reform Association proposes a Constitutional recognition of Christianity as the national religion, and to provide the church “funds out of the public treasury for carrying on her aggressive work at home and in the foreign field.” The following words from Dr. Herrick Johnson, of Chicago, are true and most appropriate just now:—

> “State recognition and State support lead inevitably to pride, bigotry, and intolerance. And this may easily pass into a divine-right consciousness that shall use the stake, the rack, the torture, to vindicate the arrogant claim, and bring protesting heretics to their senses. Happily we are rid of all this. Let us thank God for it, and keep it so. Let us pray that that bitterest and bloodiest of all wars, a religious war, be spared us. Let us say instantly and firmly to any grasping hierarchy coveting State recognition and aiming at exclusive privilege, ‘Hands off! No public money for sectarian use.’ Let us keep Church and State clear of each other. It has been our glory and our peace thus far.”

The National Reformers tell us that they do not want their Constitutional Amendment until they can get it by a free vote of the people. They do not want Christian institutions and customs enforced by civil laws, until it is the will of the people that they should be so enforced. Very well, that looks mild enough, and people certainly ought not to complain of the results of laws which they themselves enact. But let us examine the case a little more closely.

What do they mean by the will of the people? Do they mean *all* the people of this land? If so, what necessity will there be for placing Christian laws and usages “on an undeniable legal basis in the fundamental law of the land”? If *all* the people accept Christianity of their own free will, what need of laws enforcing Christianity? At any rate, if that is just what they want, they could save time by saying nothing about laws at present. Let them exert all their energies to get men converted as soon as possible, and then when all are converted, they can introduce their scheme of a legal recognition of Christianity.

But it is not at all probable that any National Reformer would claim that they expect to get every person in favor of their scheme before they put it through. They do not expect that *all* the people will ever voluntarily accept their theories. What they mean by having the Amendment a free expression of the will of the people, is that they want a clear, working majority. In other words, they don’t want the Amendment until they can have a large enough majority in favor of it to *compel* dissenters to accept it, “under all civil pains.”
