The National Reformers tell us that they do not want their Constitutional Amendment until they can get it by a free vote of the people. They do not want Christian institutions and customs enforced by civil laws, until it is the will of the people that they should be so enforced. Very well, that looks mild enough, and people certainly ought not to complain of the results of laws which they themselves enact. But let us examine the case a little more closely.

What do they mean by the will of the people? Do they mean *all* the people of this land? If so, what necessity will there be for placing Christian laws and usages "on an undeniable legal basis in the fundamental law of the land"? If *all* the people accept Christianity of their own free will, what need of laws enforcing Christianity? At any rate, if that is just what they want, they could save time by saying nothing about laws at present. Let them exert all their energies to get men converted as soon as possible, and then when all are converted, they can introduce their scheme of a legal recognition of Christianity.

But it is not at all probable that any National Reformer would claim that they expect to get every person in favor of their scheme before they put it through. They do not expect that *all* the people will ever voluntarily accept their theories. What they mean by having the Amendment a free expression of the will of the people, is that they want a clear, working majority. In other words, they don't want the Amendment until they can have a large enough majority in favor of it to *compel* dissenters to accept it, "under all civil pains."
