In a note on the annual meeting of the National Reform Association and its demand for national religion, the *Christian at Work *makes the suggestive remark that "it is noteworthy that nothing is said as to the deterioration of religious life in the family, nor is any allusion made as to the means for supplying that deficiency." That is true. Likewise there is nothing said of the deterioration of genuine godliness in the church. All the lack is in the hypothetical individual which they call the nation; that is the butt of all their complaints. They may plaster the national Constitution all over with Religious Amendments, but such methods will never plant practical religion in the family nor supply the lack of vital godliness in the church. They may plead that it is by increased godliness in the family and in the church that they expect to get the Religious Amendment to the Constitution. But it is not so. That association is making no effort to increase godliness in either the family or the church. Its methods and its aims are wholly political, not moral. And this movement being so largely indorsed by the churches is proof positive and confessed that those churches are powerless to do the work which God gave the church to do. Nor will a Constitutional Amendment supply the power. True, it will give the churches the power *to force* upon the ungodly their own form of godliness without the power, all which will only increase unto more ungodliness. And from all such people and their work the word of God commands to turn away. Look at 2 Tim. 3:1-5.
