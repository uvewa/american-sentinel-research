In his speech at the late National Reform Convention, Rev. T. P. Stevenson remarked that,—

> "Every reform is rooted in some principle. The Reformation was rooted in the great principle of justification by faith. The great doctrine of religious liberty rests upon the basis of the inviolability of the conscience—that God alone is Lord of the conscience."

That is all true. The progress of the Reformation in the sixteenth century and onward has been but the progress of truth. Each successive step in reform has been but the development of one more principle of truth. No movement can be a genuine reform if it subverts or repudiates any principle of reform already developed. Now the great doctrine of religious liberty is inseparable from the Reformation. It is just as essential a principle as justification by faith, itself. It rests indeed upon the *inviolability* of the conscience, and upon the truth that God *alone* is Lord of the conscience.

But this so-called National Reform repudiates this fundamental principle of the Reformation. It declares that the State has "the right to command the consciences of men." It refuses to be comforted with a Constitutional acknowledgment of God, because such acknowledgment would *not* "impose any restraint on the conscience." But if the State has the right to command the consciences of men, then God is not alone Lord of the conscience. And if men have the right by civil enactment to impose restraint upon the conscience, then there is no such principle as the inviolability of the conscience.

Therefore this so-called National Reform, in repudiating this fundamental principle of the Reformation, shows itself to be not a reform at all, but subversive of the Reformation and a return to both the ante and anti-Reformation principles of the Papacy.
