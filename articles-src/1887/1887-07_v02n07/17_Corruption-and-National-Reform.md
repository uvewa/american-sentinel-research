In the Cleveland National Reform Convention, 1883, the Rev. Frederick Merrick, D. D., said:—

> "Given any form of government, and human nature what it is, and the temptations of office what they are, and corruption is inevitable."

Of course it is. And yet with human nature exactly as it is, and the temptations of office precisely what they are, these men actually teach that a National Reform form of government will bring the millennium. But even though the thing could last a thousand years it would only be a millennium of corruption worse corrupted. There is no danger however of there ever being a millennium of National Reform. It would be literally impossible for human society to bear for any considerable length of time the weight of corruption that would be heaped upon it by such a form of government.
