The Bible says, "If one man sin against another, the judge shall judge him; but if a man sin against the Lord, who shall entreat for him." But the National Reform doctrine is that whether one man sin against another, or whether he sin against the Lord, the judge shall judge him anyhow. The fact of the matter is that nothing can be truer than that National Reform is directly opposed to the Bible.
