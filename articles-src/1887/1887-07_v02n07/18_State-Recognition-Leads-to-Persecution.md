The National Reform Association proposes a Constitutional recognition of Christianity as the national religion, and to provide the church "funds out of the public treasury for carrying on her aggressive work at home and in the foreign field." The following words from Dr. Herrick Johnson, of Chicago, are true and most appropriate just now:—

> "State recognition and State support lead inevitably to pride, bigotry, and intolerance. And this may easily pass into a divine-right consciousness that shall use the stake, the rack, the torture, to vindicate the arrogant claim, and bring protesting heretics to their senses. Happily we are rid of all this. Let us thank God for it, and keep it so. Let us pray that that bitterest and bloodiest of all wars, a religious war, be spared us. Let us say instantly and firmly to any grasping hierarchy coveting State recognition and aiming at exclusive privilege, 'Hands off! No public money for sectarian use.' Let us keep Church and State clear of each other. It has been our glory and our peace thus far."
