The *Christian Union* commenting upon the Mormon Constitution for the proposed State of Utah, which pretends to prohibit polygamy, says:—

> "Shutting polygamy out of the State Constitution will no more make Utah a Monogamous State than putting God into the National Constitution would make the United States a pious nation."

That is a most apt illustration of National Reform and its pretensions. It is the whole National Reform scheme in a nutshell.
