Read the report of the Lakeside (O.) National Reform Convention, which appears in this number of the Sentinel if you think that the National Reform movement is only a bugabear, and that there is no danger of its attaining sufficient proportions to warrant giving it any attention. Dr. McAllister's statement that their amendment will be secured by 1896 at the latest, and that it may come in 1892, is not a wild one. The leaven is working in all classes of society, and yet people are asleep to the danger. The Sentinel did not enter the field a day too soon. It will do all that it can to sound the alarm; who will second its efforts?
