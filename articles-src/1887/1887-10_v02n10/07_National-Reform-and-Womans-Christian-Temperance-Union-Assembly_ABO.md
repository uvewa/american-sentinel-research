# National Reform and Woman's Christian Temperance Union Assembly.

This Assembly was held at Lakeside, Ohio, August 18-21. Lakeside is situated on a beautiful peninsula extending into Lake Erie, about nine miles from Sandusky, and is becoming every year more and more popular as a summer resort, having connected with it religious meetings of various kinds, such as Sunday-school encampments, camp-meetings, Christian assemblies, etc. In fact it is becoming widely known as the "Chautauqua of the West." The population of this summer city reaches at times up to four and five thousand inhabitants, and it is abundantly supplied with hotels, cottages, restaurants, etc. It has two large, permanent, open-air auditoriums, lighted with electric lights, and able to seat three thousand, and fifteen hundred respectively. The city is supplied by a system of water works with pure lake water; this with its sanitary arrangements and its naturally fine location on the lake shore opposite Kelley's Island and Put-in-Bay make it withal a very pleasant, comfortable summer resort.

We arrived on the grounds Thursday, August 18, in time to listen to the opening address, "The Work of the National Reform Association," by the Rev. David McAllister, LL.D. The subject was introduced by an extract from the Pittsburg *Commercial Gazette, *dated August 16, in which it was stated that the Germans were making an organized effort for the repeal of existing Sunday laws in that State, and that in Allegheny County circulars had been sent to some 30,000 Germans to enlist them in this effort. To counteract such influences was the work of the National Reform Association, and the only hope of gaining its object, he said, was by having God and the Bible recognized in the Constitution of the United States, inasmuch as those who seek to break down the Christian character of the Nation, intrench themselves behind its non-sectarian character. And he was glad to say that the National Reform movement was gaining adherents and supporters among all denominations, and even outside of the denominations. The Association recognizes the authority of God over the State and the National Government, and also that the moral law is supreme over man in every relation. The corruptions that exist among office-holders, the laxity of present divorce laws, and similar evils, makes it necessary, he argued, [79] that earnest work be done in the line of National Reform. "Those who oppose this work now," said he, "will discover when the religious amendment is made to the Constitution, that if they do not see fit to fall in with the majority, they must abide the consequences or seek some more congenial clime."

At 2:30 p. m. the Rev. A. B. Leonard, D. D., delivered a very eloquent, stirring address on the subject of intemperance and prohibition, using as his text, "The Upas Tree." At 7:30 p. m. Rev. J. M. Foster delivered an address on the principles of National Reform. He stated that there are two theories of civil government: (1) The infidel, that regards it simply as a secular matter; (2) the Christian, that places it on the basis of the Bible. The French adopted the first, for a day and an hour, but the results were such that they were glad to return to the other and recognize the authority of God in civil government. He proceeded: "Ours is a Christian nation. Christianity is the common law of this land. A Christian nation ought to have a Christian government. The State has a mighty power, but this it receives from Almighty God. The civil government is simply the arm of Jehovah dealing with man. If this is so, then it is the duty of the Nation to recognize the fact that God is the source of power. The laws of the State come from God, and are based upon the divine law of God, which was given upon two tables of stone to indicate its perpetuity. Those commandments are not obsolete; they are still in vogue. The State is the divinely appointed keeper of the decalogue, and should regulate its affairs in harmony with its individual precepts, thus recognizing God as the source of law, preserving the sanctity of the Sabbath [Sunday], guarding the family relations, prohibiting murder by the revolver and by rum, etc. But our fathers made two mistakes in setting up this Government; first, in permitting slavery, and second, in ignoring the claim of the King of kings as the author of civil law. Slavery has been abolished; and now the other mistake must be corrected, and in doing this the speaker maintained that the Nation would act the part of wisdom as to her national salvation."

The Rev. M. A. Gault's "Talk on Bible Politics" given at 4 o'clock, in a hall called Bradley Temple, was mainly an effort to prove a similarity between the Jewish State and our Government, and to show that some of our principal laws are nothing but adaptations and modifications of laws given by Moses. The speaker held strongly that the moral law, the decalogue, is still binding upon mankind, and should be enforced upon the people by the State. And, in fact, these statements were repeated time and again by other speakers, so that if we had not known just the object of this movement, we might have thought ourselves in the midst of a people that wished to magnify the law and make it honorable, a people that especially kept the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus. And here we apprehend will be the secret of their success. A direct appeal to the moral law, the ten commandments, has still a deciding influence upon the minds of a great many professed Christians who do not see that the enforcement of moral precepts is beyond the power of civil governments.

The time on Friday evening was occupied by several speakers, among whom were the Rev. R. C. Wylie, and Mrs. Mary A. Woodbridge, one of the vice-presidents of the National Reform Association, and recording secretary of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union. Mr. Wylie presented in a ten-minute speech the principles of National Reform, and Mrs. Woodbridge followed with a short address, in which she remarked: "Those who have heard our brother outline the principles of the National Reform Association, will see how closely allied it is with the Woman's Christian Temperance Union."

The next day, the 20th, was given to the Woman's Christian Temperance Union. In the forenoon addresses were made on the subject of woman's suffrage, on prison work, on the flower mission, and on the subject of Sabbath observance. Mrs. Bateham, superintendent of the Sabbath Observance Department of the W. C. T. U., spoke on the last mentioned subject. She stated in brief, that this was one of the most important of the forty different lines of work that the W. C. T. U. had in hand, and that considerable work was being done in this direction; that thirty-six States and Territories had already adopted this department of the work, that State superintendents and agents had been appointed, and were out in the field, and that encouraging reports were being received. She stated that their aim was not to effect a union of Church and State, but to secure the right for every man of having one day in seven. All unnecessary labor and traffic should be prohibited on Sunday, and the people should be led to see, that the safety of the Nation lies in the maintenance of this day as a day of rest.

In the afternoon Mrs. Munsol delivered an address, and in the evening Mrs. Fannie W. Leiter read a paper on the value of scientific temperance education.

The next day, Sunday, which was the last day of the Assembly, Rev. W. J. Coleman preached in the forenoon a National Reform sermon, based on Rev. 19:11-16. His points were in brief as follows: "Every reformation in the past has been brought about when the people have obtained a new view of Christ. This must also be the case before a reform in national affairs can be secured. The Lord Jesus Christ is the ruler of nations, and this is the fundamental principle of national religion." To prove that Christ is the ruler of nations, reference was made to such expressions as "the son of David," "he shall rule them with a rod of iron," "the Lord shall make his enemies his footstool," "the Prince of Peace," "there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom," "every knee shall bow," "King of kings and Lord of lords" etc.—passages that undoubtedly refer to Christ, but not until he has taken his everlasting kingdom into his possession; not until he has come the second time, to punish the wicked and reward the righteous; not until the "prince of this world," Satan, has been conquered, and He shall rule, whose right it is to reign. It seems to us that these National Reformers are making just as grievous a mistake in regard to Christ and his present position, as the Jews did in regard to his first advent. The Jews applied the prophecies relating to Christ's second coming in glory and power, to his first advent. And so these zealous, but mistaken reformers apply to Christ at the present time, passages that refer to his future glorious kingdom, when sin and sinners are no more, and when Christ shall reign supreme.

Referring to the sacrifices made to secure the abolition of slavery and to conquer the Rebellion, the speaker said that there ought to be a mighty army ready to pour out treasure, and blood, if need be, to vindicate the authority of Christ. "The Bible should be adopted as a standard to decide questions in political life, to decide between right and wrong. The idea of a divine law and a divine Christ should be forced into politics. There is now no religion in the Constitution of the United States. Our aim is to bring this Nation to Christ, and to place it under the divine law. Our fundamental principles are: Christ is king of the Nation, and the Bible is the rule of action. When this is recognized in the Constitution, it will settled the question of prohibition as well as every other moral reform. And this is the reason why the National Reform question, should be agitated and pressed in connection with that of prohibition."

The address in the evening by Rev. J. B. Helwig, D. D., on the subject of the "Sabbath Question" was an effort to prove the necessity of maintaining and preserving the Sabbath [Sunday], pointing out some of the dangers which threaten it at the present time. At the close of the sermon, farewell words were spoken by a number. Rev. James P. Mills stated that he had planned that next year a grand eight or ten days' National Reform Assembly should be held at Lakeside, if possible earlier in the season, so as to secure a larger attendance, and that this Assembly should include the National Woman's Christian Temperance Union, the twin sister of the National Reform Association, the Young Men's Christian Association, the Ohio Divorce Association, various Sabbath leagues, anti-secret societies, etc. Such a grand Christian Assembly would, he said, "set the groves of Lakeside ablaze with Reform ideas, the people would become enlightened, and would return to their homes prepared to carry on the work among their neighbors and friends."

The advocates of National Reform are alive and busy at work, agitating, creating sentiment, enlisting prominent and educated men in their ranks, and above all are very sure that their cause will triumph. There are two things which they themselves regard as very potent factors in bringing about the objects they have in view: 1. The close sympathy and union existing between the National Reform Association and the National Woman's Christian Temperance Union, and the hearty cooperation of this mighty army of women in furthering the aims of the Association. 2. The prospect of securing the right of suffrage for women, a line of work to which the W. C. T. U. are devoting their energies, and which the N. R. A. does not object to. And we were impressed that these two assistants, with others, might prove to be mighty agents in bringing about the changes in our Constitution which they demand. A. B. Oyen. [80]
