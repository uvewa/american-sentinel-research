A few days ago we received five hundred and ninety-four subscriptions for the Sentinel, accompanied by the cash, from a single canvasser. This is the largest list yet sent in by any one man, but we hope it will not long remain the largest. There are scores of men who could do as well. The publishers give a liberal commission on Sentinel subscriptions, because the journal is not run for the purpose of making money, but for the purpose of warning the people of the United States of the impending danger. Where are the men who see this danger, who will help sound the alarm by increasing the circulation of the Sentinel?
