# National Reform and Woman’s Christian Temperance Union Assembly.

This Assembly was held at Lakeside, Ohio, August 18-21. Lakeside is situated on a beautiful peninsula extending into Lake Erie, about nine miles from Sandusky, and is becoming every year more and more popular as a summer resort, having connected with it religious meetings of various kinds, such as Sunday-school encampments, camp-meetings, Christian assemblies, etc. In fact it is becoming widely known as the “Chautauqua of the West.” The population of this summer city reaches at times up to four and five thousand inhabitants, and it is abundantly supplied with hotels, cottages, restaurants, etc. It has two large, permanent, open-air auditoriums, lighted with electric lights, and able to seat three thousand, and fifteen hundred respectively. The city is supplied by a system of water works with pure lake water; this with its sanitary arrangements and its naturally fine location on the lake shore opposite Kelley’s Island and Put-in-Bay make it withal a very pleasant, comfortable summer resort.

We arrived on the grounds Thursday, August 18, in time to listen to the opening address, “The Work of the National Reform Association,” by the Rev. David McAllister, LL.D. The subject was introduced by an extract from the Pittsburg *Commercial Gazette, *dated August 16, in which it was stated that the Germans were making an organized effort for the repeal of existing Sunday laws in that State, and that in Allegheny County circulars had been sent to some 30,000 Germans to enlist them in this effort. To counteract such influences was the work of the National Reform Association, and the only hope of gaining its object, he said, was by having God and the Bible recognized in the Constitution of the United States, inasmuch as those who seek to break down the Christian character of the Nation, intrench themselves behind its non-sectarian character. And he was glad to say that the National Reform movement was gaining adherents and supporters among all denominations, and even outside of the denominations. The Association recognizes the authority of God over the State and the National Government, and also that the moral law is supreme over man in every relation. The corruptions that exist among office-holders, the laxity of present divorce laws, and similar evils, makes it necessary, he argued, [79] that earnest work be done in the line of National Reform. “Those who oppose this work now,” said he, “will discover when the religious amendment is made to the Constitution, that if they do not see fit to fall in with the majority, they must abide the consequences or seek some more congenial clime.”

At 2:30 p. m. the Rev. A. B. Leonard, D. D., delivered a very eloquent, stirring address on the subject of intemperance and prohibition, using as his text, “The Upas Tree.” At 7:30 p. m. Rev. J. M. Foster delivered an address on the principles of National Reform. He stated that there are two theories of civil government: (1) The infidel, that regards it simply as a secular matter; (2) the Christian, that places it on the basis of the Bible. The French adopted the first, for a day and an hour, but the results were such that they were glad to return to the other and recognize the authority of God in civil government. He proceeded: “Ours is a Christian nation. Christianity is the common law of this land. A Christian nation ought to have a Christian government. The State has a mighty power, but this it receives from Almighty God. The civil government is simply the arm of Jehovah dealing with man. If this is so, then it is the duty of the Nation to recognize the fact that God is the source of power. The laws of the State come from God, and are based upon the divine law of God, which was given upon two tables of stone to indicate its perpetuity. Those commandments are not obsolete; they are still in vogue. The State is the divinely appointed keeper of the decalogue, and should regulate its affairs in harmony with its individual precepts, thus recognizing God as the source of law, preserving the sanctity of the Sabbath [Sunday], guarding the family relations, prohibiting murder by the revolver and by rum, etc. But our fathers made two mistakes in setting up this Government; first, in permitting slavery, and second, in ignoring the claim of the King of kings as the author of civil law. Slavery has been abolished; and now the other mistake must be corrected, and in doing this the speaker maintained that the Nation would act the part of wisdom as to her national salvation.”

The Rev. M. A. Gault’s “Talk on Bible Politics” given at 4 o’clock, in a hall called Bradley Temple, was mainly an effort to prove a similarity between the Jewish State and our Government, and to show that some of our principal laws are nothing but adaptations and modifications of laws given by Moses. The speaker held strongly that the moral law, the decalogue, is still binding upon mankind, and should be enforced upon the people by the State. And, in fact, these statements were repeated time and again by other speakers, so that if we had not known just the object of this movement, we might have thought ourselves in the midst of a people that wished to magnify the law and make it honorable, a people that especially kept the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus. And here we apprehend will be the secret of their success. A direct appeal to the moral law, the ten commandments, has still a deciding influence upon the minds of a great many professed Christians who do not see that the enforcement of moral precepts is beyond the power of civil governments.

The time on Friday evening was occupied by several speakers, among whom were the Rev. R. C. Wylie, and Mrs. Mary A. Woodbridge, one of the vice-presidents of the National Reform Association, and recording secretary of the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union. Mr. Wylie presented in a ten-minute speech the principles of National Reform, and Mrs. Woodbridge followed with a short address, in which she remarked: “Those who have heard our brother outline the principles of the National Reform Association, will see how closely allied it is with the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union.”

The next day, the 20th, was given to the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union. In the forenoon addresses were made on the subject of woman’s suffrage, on prison work, on the flower mission, and on the subject of Sabbath observance. • Mrs. Bateham, superintendent of the Sabbath Observance Department of the W. C. T. U., spoke on the last mentioned subject. She stated in brief, that this was one of the most important of the forty different lines of work that the W. C. T. U. had in hand, and that considerable work was being done in this direction; that thirty-six States and Territories had already adopted this department of the work, that State superintendents and agents had been appointed, and were out in the field, and that encouraging reports were being received. She stated that their aim was not to effect a union of Church and State, but to secure the right for every man of having one day in seven. All unnecessary labor and traffic should be prohibited on Sunday, and the people should be led to see, that the safety of the Nation lies in the maintenance of this day as a day of rest.

In the afternoon Mrs. Munsol delivered an address, and in the evening Mrs. Fannie W. Leiter read a paper on the value of scientific temperance education.

The next day, Sunday, which was the last day of the Assembly, Rev. W. J. Coleman preached in the forenoon a National Reform sermon, based on Rev. 19:11-16. His points were in brief as follows: “Every reformation in the past has been brought about when the people have obtained a new view of Christ. This must also be the case before a reform in national affairs can be secured. The Lord Jesus Christ is the ruler of nations, and this is the fundamental principle of national religion.” To prove that Christ is the ruler of nations, reference was made to such expressions as “the son of David,” “he shall rule them with a rod of iron,” “the Lord shall make his enemies his footstool,” “the Prince of Peace,” “there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom,” “every knee shall bow,” “King of kings and Lord of lords” etc..—passages that undoubtedly refer to Christ, but not until he has taken his everlasting kingdom into his possession; not until he has come the second time, to punish the wicked and reward the righteous; not until the “prince of this world,” Satan, has been conquered, and He shall rule, whose right it is to reign. It seems to us that these National Reformers are making just as grievous a mistake in regard to Christ and his present position, as the Jews did in regard to his first advent. The Jews applied the prophecies relating to Christ’s second coming in glory and power, to his first advent. And so these zealous, but mistaken reformers apply to Christ at the present time, passages that refer to his future glorious kingdom, when sin and sinners are no more, and when Christ shall reign supreme.

Referring to the sacrifices made to secure the abolition of slavery and to conquer the Rebellion, the speaker said that there ought to be a mighty army ready to pour out treasure, and blood, if need be, to vindicate the authority of Christ. “The Bible should be adopted as a standard to decide questions in political life, to decide between right and wrong. The idea of a divine law and a divine Christ should be forced into politics. There is now no religion in the Constitution of the United States. Our aim is to bring this Nation to Christ, and to place it under the divine law. Our fundamental principles are: Christ is king of the Nation, and the Bible is the rule of action. When this is recognized in the Constitution, it will settled the question of prohibition as well as every other moral reform. And this is the reason why the National Re- form question, should be agitated and pressed in connection with that of prohibition.”

The address in the evening by Rev. J. B. Helwig, D. D., on the subject of the “Sabbath Question” was an effort to prove the necessity of maintaining and preserving the Sabbath [Sunday], pointing out some of the dangers which threaten it at the present time. At the close of the sermon, farewell words were spoken by a number. Rev. James P. Mills stated that he had planned that next year a grand eight or ten days’ National Reform Assembly should be held at Lakeside, if possible earlier in the season, so as to secure a larger attendance, and that this Assembly should include the National Woman’s Christian Temperance Union, the twin sister of the National Reform Association, the Young Men’s Christian Association, the Ohio Divorce Association, various Sabbath leagues, anti-secret societies, etc. Such a grand Christian Assembly would, he said, “set the groves of Lakeside ablaze with Reform ideas, the people would become enlightened, and would return to their homes prepared to carry on the work among their neighbors and friends.”

The advocates of National Reform are alive and busy at work, agitating, creating sentiment, enlisting prominent and educated men in their ranks, and above all are very sure that their cause will triumph. There are two things which they themselves regard as very potent factors in bringing about the objects they have in view: 1. The close sympathy and union existing between the National Reform Association and the National Woman’s Christian Temperance Union, and the hearty cooperation of this mighty army of women in furthering the aims of the Association. 2. The prospect of securing the right of suffrage for women, a line of work to which the W. C. T. U. are devoting their energies, and which the N. R. A. does not object to. And we were impressed that these two assistants, with others, might prove to be mighty agents in bringing about the changes in our Constitution which they demand. A. B. Oyen. [80]

Note,—No papers are sent by the publishers of the American Sentinel to people who have not subscribed for it. If the Sentinel comes to one who has not subscribed for it, he may know that it is sent him by some friend, and that he will not be called upon by the publishers to pay for the same.

The *Christian Union* commenting upon the Mormon Constitution for the proposed State of Utah, which pretends to prohibit polygamy, says:—

> “Shutting polygamy out of the State Constitution will no more make Utah a Monogamous State than putting God into the National Constitution would make the United States a pious nation.”

That is a most apt illustration of National Reform and its pretensions. It is the whole National Reform scheme in a nutshell.

Read the report of the Lakeside (O.) National Reform Convention, which appears in this number of the Sentinel if you think that the National Reform movement is only a bugbear, and that there is no danger of its attaining sufficient proportions to warrant giving it any attention. Dr. McAllister’s statement that their amendment will be secured by 1896 at the latest, and that it may come in 1892, is not a wild one. The leaven is working in all classes of society, and yet people are asleep to the danger. The Sentinel did not enter the field a day too soon. It will do all that it can to sound the alarm; who will second its efforts?

We have a verbatim report of all the addresses delivered at the Lakeside National Reform Convention, and also of the questions and answers. Thus we have a good stock of the latest utterances on National Reform, by those who are at the head of the movement. The answers to some of the questions reveal very fully the real spirit of the movement, and we shall give some of them to our readers in the next number. We design to make the next number of the Sentinel the best that has ever been issued, and that is simply in the line of our purpose to make each number better than the one which preceded it.

A few days ago we received five hundred and ninety-four subscriptions for the Sentinel, accompanied by the cash, from a single canvasser. This is the largest list yet sent in by any one man, but we hope it will not long remain the largest. There are scores of men who could do as well. The publishers give a liberal commission on Sentinel subscriptions, because the journal is not run for the purpose of making money, but for the purpose of warning the people of the United States of the impending danger. Where are the men who see this danger, who will help sound the alarm by increasing the circulation of the Sentinel?

Prussia’s hobnobbing with the Papacy has begun already to bear the unfailing fruit of a legal recognition of Romanism. A Lutheran minister in Prussia was recently sentenced to nine months’ imprisonment for “insulting” the Romish Church. The insult consisted in publishing a pamphlet in which he remarked that the Romish apostasy is “built upon superstition and idolatry.” And for such “insulting” remarks as this, to prison for nine months their author had to go. And this in the land of Luther! Let Prussia be called no more a Protestant country. She has been surrendered bodily to the Papacy, and Rome rules there, and that in Rome’s own wicked way.

The National Reform scheme still gathers strength as it goes. Hitherto the *Christian Union* has been opposed to it, but now it too has fallen into line. In an editorial, September 8, endorsing a National Reform circular, the *Union* strikes the genuine sanctimonious- political tone of the regular National Reform key, thus:—

> “The political aim of Christianity is to bring forth a time in which Christianity shall control the caucus, religion shall control politics, the politicians shall be saints, and the polls shall be holy ground.”

> “This know also that in the last days, perilous times shall come. For men shall be . . . blasphemers . . . having a form of godliness.” 2 Tim. 3:1,2, 5.
The Rev. F. S. Hatch, of Hartford, Conn., telling in the *Congregationalist* of the success of the Connecticut law forbidding railway trains and traffic on Sunday, says that “Baptists, Episcopalians, Methodists, and Roman Catholics have united with Congregationalists in the successful attempt to secure this reform.” He says the condition of affairs is not yet perfect, but that “it is a fresh illustration of the familiar truth that no evil in our midst can stand against the determination of the united Christian Church.” And if the supposed evil happens to be a good, it is all the same. This is a pointer which shows how this church affair may easily be made national when the work of National Reform shall have progressed a little further.

Besides the Lakeside National Reform meeting mentioned elsewhere, there was also a most important one at Saratoga Springs, August 15, 16, and 17. This was a meeting almost altogether of ministers from different parts of the country. Dr. Price, president of the Young Ladies College, Nashville, Tenn.; Dr. Cowles, president of Elmira Female College, New York; Rev. J. H. Smythe, New York City; Dr. Parmelee, Jersey City; Dr. Kerr, Richmond, Va. ; Dr. McFarland, Virginia; Dr. Herrick Johnson, Chicago; Dr. Smith, Baltimore, Moderator of the Presbyterian General Assembly 1887 ; Rev. Mr. Foster, Saratoga; Dr. Dowd, Temple Grove Seminary, Saratoga; Dr. Leech, Saratoga, exchaplain New York Senate; Rev. Samuel McLanahan, Baltimore; Rev. Mr. Winn, Petersburg, Va.; Dr. Niles, York, Pa.; Prof. E. N. Jones, principal Saratoga Public Schools; Rev. Mr. Tufts, Munson, Mass.; Rev. Mr. Sawyer, East Hampton, Mass. ; Rev. Mr. Lanphear, Beverly, Mass.; and Joseph Cook, the Boston Monday Lecturer, were the prominent speakers in the meeting. Dr. Herrick Johnson presided. Preserve this list. You will have use for it in the future.

An exchange says:—

> “The law cannot make a man moral, but it can make him dreadfully uncomfortable when he is immoral.”

Well, that depends. It is true that the law cannot make a man moral; and if it is the law of the land that is referred to, as we suppose it is, then we know that a man may be terribly immoral without suffering the least inconvenience from the law. The trouble is, people have a very low standard of morality. If a man does no open violence, nor cause any serious inconvenience to his neighbor, he is called a moral man; whereas, a man may do nothing for which the law could molest him, and still be as corrupt as the grave. It should be understood that civil laws cannot make men moral, and are not for the purpose of punishing immorality, but simply for the purpose of protecting the rights of people; in short, to deter men from acting in an uncivil manner.

A writer in the *Evangelical Churchman,* of Canada, makes a strong plea for the Canadian Legislature at its next session to pass an Act authorizing the Governor-General “to issue a proclamation prohibiting all Sunday railway traffic throughout the entire dominion, at such a date as a similar Act shall come into operation in the United States.” He says that “when the people of the United States know that Canada has passed an Act against Sunday railway traffic, which must remain inoperative until their own Congress passes a similar Act which in connection with the Canadian one would stop all Sabbath desecration by railway and steamboat companies, and when they are appealed to as they will be by pulpit and press, they will say, ‘This thing must be done.’ ” This appeal by pulpit and press is even now being made, loud enough to be heard even to Canada. How long will it be before the thing shall be accomplished?

Christ’s kingdom is not of this world. The church is not a Police Board, not Cesar’s lieutenant, but a saviour of lost sinners. Its simple, sole, glorious mission is to bring sinners to Jesus by preaching the gospel to them with the Holy Ghost sent down from Heaven. *—St. Louis Observer *[81].
