The National Reform scheme still gathers strength as it goes. Hitherto the *Christian Union* has been opposed to it, but now it too has fallen into line. In an editorial, September 8, endorsing a National Reform circular, the *Union* strikes the genuine sanctimonious- political tone of the regular National Reform key, thus:—

> "The political aim of Christianity is to bring forth a time in which Christianity shall control the caucus, religion shall control politics, the politicians shall be saints, and the polls shall be holy ground."

> "This know also that in the last days, perilous times shall come. For men shall be . . . blasphemers . . . having a form of godliness." 2 Tim. 3:1,2, 5.
