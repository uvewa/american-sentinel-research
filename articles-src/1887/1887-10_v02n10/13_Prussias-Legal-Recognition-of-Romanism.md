Prussia's hobnobbing with the Papacy has begun already to bear the unfailing fruit of a legal recognition of Romanism. A Lutheran minister in Prussia was recently sentenced to nine months' imprisonment for "insulting" the Romish Church. The insult consisted in publishing a pamphlet in which he remarked that the Romish apostasy is "built upon superstition and idolatry." And for such "insulting" remarks as this, to prison for nine months their author had to go. And this in the land of Luther! Let Prussia be called no more a Protestant country. She has been surrendered bodily to the Papacy, and Rome rules there, and that in Rome's own wicked way.
