# Prussia at the Pope's Feet.

The Pope has sent out a note of rejoicing over his triumphant conquest of Germany, upon which, under the above heading, the *Christian Advocate* comments as follows:—

> "One of the most pitiable spectacles presented in these latter days to the world's gaze is that of Prussia—great and Protestant Prussia—doing obeisance to the Pope of Rome.

> "If any human force could make Martin Luther and Philip Melanchthon arise from their graves beneath the marble slabs in the Wittenberg church, it would be this. But, alas! so bound hand and foot is their land to-day, that not one strong voice in the whole country dares to sound the alarm and tell the whole civilized world what is going on in Berlin.
> "The climax has just been reached in the Pope's allocution, which came by cablegram from Rome. His holiness appeals to the whole world to hear his cry of victory over German Protestantism. Here are some of his jubilant notes:—
> "'We felt more concerned at the evils of this religious struggle with Prussia, and as we were unable to remedy them by striving alone, owing to the obstacles which impeded our power, we invoked the co-operation of the German bishops and the Catholic deputies in the Prussian Diet, from whose constancy and concord the church derived great fruits, and expects still greater. Thanks to the equitable and pacific sentiments of Emperor William and his counselors, the Prussian Government removed the more serious inconveniences, and then accepted the various practical conditions of peace, by which some of the former laws against the church have been repealed and others mitigated. Something remains, but we must rejoice at what we have obtained, and, above all, in regard to the free action of the Pope in the government of the church in Prussia.'
> "If Bismarck is not entirely blind to all Protestant sentiment, and is not utterly consumed by his love of Prussian imperialism, whatever becomes of the people, he must have some sense of shame when he reads the Pope's allocution—that this triumph of Romanism in Germany is made the basis of an appeal to Italy to range herself on the side of Papal interests. Germany more Catholic than Italy! That is the picture now, and the world is told so by Leo XIII."
