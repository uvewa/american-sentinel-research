We have a verbatim report of all the addresses delivered at the Lakeside National Reform Convention, and also of the questions and answers. Thus we have a good stock of the latest utterances on National Reform, by those who are at the head of the movement. The answers to some of the questions reveal very fully the real spirit of the movement, and we shall give some of them to our readers in the next number. We design to make the next number of the Sentinel the best that has ever been issued, and that is simply in the line of our purpose to make each number better than the one which preceded it.
