The School Board of Pittsburg, Pa., have made a Catholic priest, Father McTighe, principal of one of the public schools of the city, and have appointed two nuns as teachers in the same school. Now if only that priest and those nuns will establish the Catholic Bible, and Catholic worship, and Catholic instruction, in that school, we may expect that the hearts of the National Reformers will sing for very joy. For this is a long stride toward the point at which the National Reformers are aiming, and this is the very thing which the National Reform Association is commissioned by the Saratoga resolution to secure "if possible," by an alliance with the Romish Church.
