The Rome correspondent of the *Catholic Mirror,* writing under date of July 12, says:—

> "Monsignor Ruffo and his companions were well received in England, as you know from the reports of the English press. Mgr. Ruffo is convinced that the time is not distant when an amicable arrangement will be made between the English Government and the Papacy and official representatives accredited from both. The queen was especially kind to the Papal envoy, and assured him that she remembered with great pleasure the visit made by the present Pope to Windsor [before he became Pope] after completing his mission in Belgium."

We have no doubt at all that the convictions of Mgr. Ruffo are well founded.
