Than Right Hon. Wm. E. Gladstone there is no Protestant who is better acquainted with the ways of Romanism; and of it he says:—

> "Ultramontanism has been very busy in making controversial war upon other people with singularly little restraint of language; and has far too little of the truth told to itself. Hence it has lost the habit, almost the idea, of equal laws in discussion. Of that system, as a system, I must say that its influence is adverse to freedom in the State, the family, and the individual; that when it is weak it is too often crafty, and when strong tyrannical."

And yet the National Reformers "r*egret* to say" that up to August 17, 1887, no decided attempt had been made to secure the active co-operation of the Roman Catholic Church in subjecting this Government to the religious power! As such an alliance could be wished for only by the crafty or the tyrannical, the openly expressed "regret" of the National Reformers that it has not been secured reveals at once the nature of the National Reform movement.
