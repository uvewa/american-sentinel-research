# What about Persecution?

Among the questions asked at the Lakeside National Reform Convention, was the following:—

> "Will not the National Reform movement result in persecution against those who in some points believe differently from the majority, even as the recognition of Christianity by the Roman power, resulted in grievous persecutions against true Christians?"

This is a question in which many people are deeply interested, and we would call special attention to Dr. McAllister's answer:—

> "Now notice the fallacy here. The recognition of the Roman Catholic religion by the State made that State a persecuting power. Why? Because the Roman Catholic religion is a persecuting religion. If true Christianity is a persecuting religion, then the acknowledgment of our principles by the State will make the State a persecutor. But if the true Christian religion is a religion of liberty, a religion that regards the rights of all, then the acknowledgment of these principles by the State will make the State the guardian of the rights of all men. False religion will be persecuted, and the State will be the persecutor. True religion never persecutes."

We may well say of Dr. McAllister's answer, "Now notice the fallacy here." And notice also the cool air of superiority with which he [87] pats himself and his fellow-reformers on the back. *"Our* movement will not result in persecution, because true religion never persecutes, and of course *we* wouldn't handle anything but the genuine article." Well, we will not now dispute the genuineness of their religion, but we are *sure* that they will not persecute so long as they have not the power, and there is no telling what the best of men may do when suddenly elevated to power to which they are not accustomed, and which is not theirs by right.

Let it be remembered that the possession of great power by any man, of by any organized body of men, is always dangerous. Mr. McAllister says that the recognition of the Roman Catholic Church by the State made that State a persecuting power, because the Roman Catholic religion is a persecuting religion. Wonderful! But if the Roman Catholic religion is a persecuting religion, why did it not persecute before it was lifted to the throne of the world? Oh, because it did not have the power! Exactly; and if it had never received the power, the world would never have found out that it was a persecuting religion, would it? Certainly not. Then it was not the *nature* of the Catholic religion that made it a persecutor, but it was the *power* that was given to it.

And let it be also remembered that the Roman Catholic religion was simply a perversion of the purest form of religion that was ever exhibited to the world,—that taught by Christ and his apostles. Some of the same churches that were founded by the apostles themselves, became the worst instigators of persecution. What was it that brought about this change? Nothing else than their seeking for power, and for the aid and friendship of the State. Says the apostle James, "The friendship of the world is enmity with God. Whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God." No matter how pure the religion may be which any body of men possesses, it is sure to be corrupted when they seek alliance with civil power.

It was not because the Popes of Rome were the worst men that ever lived, that they persecuted. It was simply because *their* religion was made a part of the State, and disobedience to that religion thus became disloyalty to the State, and therefore there was no alternative but to punish the offender. But when the State punishes a man for a crime against it, which crime is only a matter of conscience, then such punishment becomes persecution. The following words from Buckle's "History of Civilization in England" are very true, and we recommend them to the serious thought of National Reformers and of all others:—

> "Protestants, generally, are too apt to suppose that there is something in their creed which protects them against those hurtful extravagances which have been, and, to a certain extent, still are practiced in the Catholic Church. Never was a greater mistake. There is but one protection against the tyranny of any class, and that is to give that class very little power. Whatever the pretensions of any body of men may be, however smooth their language, and however plausible their claims, they are sure to abuse power if much of it is conferred upon them. The entire history of the world affords no instance to the contrary. In Catholic countries, France alone excepted, the clergy have more authority than in Protestant countries. Therefore, in Catholic countries they do more harm than in Protestant countries, and their peculiar views are developed with greater freedom. The difference depends, not on the nature of the creed, but on the power of the class. This is very apparent in Scotland, where the clergy, being supreme, did, Protestants though they were, imitate the ascetic, unsocial, and the cruel doctrines which in the Catholic Church gave rise to convents, fastings, scourgings, and all other appliances of an uncouth and ungenial superstition."

It was not because the people of Arkansas are worse than the people of Kansas, nor because the religion professed by the citizens of Arkansas is of a worse type than that professed by the people of Kansas, that the former State a year ago persecuted citizens even to the death, and the latter did nothing of the kind. It was simply because there was a law in Arkansas which made it a crime for the few to worship God in a different manner from what the majority did; and Kansas had no such law. Any other State in the Union, having a law like the Arkansas Sunday law, would do just as she did.

It is true that true Christianity never will persecute; but it is also true that true Christianity is never found in alliance with civil power. People often make the mistake of confounding true Christianity with the profession thereof. But true Christianity is known by fruits, and not by profession merely. A man is not necessarily a Christian because he professes the Christian religion. Even though his creed may be a perfect one, and he may hold to no doctrinal error, he may lack the vivifying influence of the Spirit of God, which alone can make the true Christian. Lacking this, his profession of the purest form of doctrine will avail him nothing. But this Spirit is never found in an alliance with civil authority. See James 4:4, already quoted.

Lastly, in the very answer in which Dr. McAllister disclaimed any intention on the part of National Reformers to persecute, he admitted that persecution would come. Said he: "False religion will be persecuted." Well, when did any people ever persecute those whom they thought were professing the true religion? The Papal persecutions were all directed against "heretics." The Catholics never professed to persecute the holders of the true religion; they would indignantly resent any such accusation. But the trouble was, *they* arrogated to themselves the power to decide who were heretics, and what was the true religion. If they had allowed the poor Huguenots and Waldenses a voice in the matter, the decision would have been different. But no; the Catholics were in the majority, and had the power, and *that* made them infallible. So the National Reformers, when once they get the power, will virtually declare themselves the infallible judges of true and false religion; and woe to the unfortunate few who profess what they decree to be the "false religion," because it differs from theirs. Who is willing to help the National Reformers into power, after hearing their own statement of their intentions? No beings but glorified saints or angels, with Christ himself as leader, could be trusted with all power, both civil and religious; and without any disrespect to National Reformers, we say that they are a long ways from being either saints or angels.

Yes, Mr. McAllister, we see the fallacy, and we think that other people can, unless they are National Reformers.E. J. W. [88]
