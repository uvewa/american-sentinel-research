The National Reform Association will have to look out for itself; we have received a paper printed at Buffalo, N. Y., entitled the *National Reformer,* the organ of what it proposes to call the "National Reform Party." Its platform is not exactly that of the original simon-pure National Reform party. It seems to be kind of half-and-half; in some things it seems to incline toward the original, but it declares that "the just powers of government are derived from the consent of the governed," and this is political atheism in the eyes of the regular National Reformers. It may be that the regular National Reform Association will swing this new party into its train, as it has the "evangelical" churches, the W. C. T. U., Prohibition, and as it proposes to do with the Workingmen, the Catholics, and everything else. We rather expect that it will. It will have to do something, or else there will be a serious clash of voices and aims, with both parties running under the same name. However, as "District Secretary" M. A. Gault is an adept in dealing with "clashing voices," we have no doubt that he can bring this matter out all straight. We hope he will try, for the Sentinel expects to have something to say about the regular, original National Reformers, and we don't want to be misunderstood.
