# What Was the Point?

In the *Christian Statesman's* report of the Ohio Prohibition Convention we find the following item:—

> "John B. Finch brought down the house when, with allusion to Governor Foraker's prompt invocation of the power of the courts a fortnight ago to forbid the return of the rebel flags, he inquired why the Governor, when it was first proposed in the Ohio General Assembly two years ago to repeal the Sabbath law, did not instantly telegraph to the bishops of the M. E. Church to serve out an injunction, etc. The audience saw the point, and cheered till they were tired, and then renewed the applause, with fluttering handkerchiefs, high lifted fans, and straw hats in profusion."

Just exactly what the point was which the audience saw in this and cheered so lustily, we cannot imagine. Is it possible that Mr. John B. Finch meant that Governor Foraker *should* have telegraphed to the bishops of the M. E. Church to serve an injunction against the repeal of the Sabbath law? and is that the "point" that the audience saw and cheered till they were tired? Did Mr. Finch mean to convey the idea that the bishops of the M. E. Church have, or ought to have, power to serve injunctions upon the civil authorities of the State of Ohio? and is that the "point" which was applauded with handkerchiefs, fans, and straw hats, in such vociferous profusion? Or, above all, did he mean to imply that either the body of bishops of the M. E. Church, or any other earthly power, has, or ought to have, the right to serve an injunction upon the legislative power of the State of Ohio? and is that the "point" (?) over which the convention went so wild? If it is, the idea is certainly wild enough in itself to justify even the wild demonstrations so admiringly described in the report.

There is, however, that about the affair which serves to perfectly illustrate the real point which we are now emphasizing in the Sentinel, that all legislation enforcing the observance of the Sabbath is essentially religious legislation. Else why should it be thought the proper thing for a governor to do to call upon a board of bishops to serve an injunction against any legislation adverse to its compulsory observance? The point is that Sunday laws cannot be separated from religious legislation. Perhaps that is the point that the convention saw in Mr. Finch's speech, and which they so heartily cheered. Church and State ideas are becoming very popular now in Prohibition conventions.
