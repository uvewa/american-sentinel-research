# Christianity under Our Constitution.

The American Churches have no official connection with the State. They stand on a basis of perfect equality before the law. They are all equally protected by the State in their rights of property and in the public exercise of their religion according to their conscientious convictions, but none is supported or ruled by the Government.

The first amendment to the Federal Constitution is the *Magna Charta* of our religious liberty. It abolishes the tyranny of a State religion, and cuts persecution by the root; it forbids the establishment by law of any particular Church or sect, and, at the same time, guarantees full freedom in the exercise of religion to all denominations of Christians. This is all the Church can desire and ask from the State. She is thrown on the principle of self-support and self-government, as in the first three centuries, and enjoys, at the same time, the protection of the law, which was denied her in those centuries of persecution. Here we have not the odious distinction between churchmen and dissenters, conformists and nonconformists, Churches and sects. Here no one need apologize for being a “dissenter,” as even in liberal England, where dissent is tabooed and socially ostracized. No Church has a right to say, “W*e* are *the* Church, or the American Church; all the rest are sects.” Such language has no legal meaning; it is simply presumptuous and absurd.

But while the State has no official connection with the Church, and no right to interfere with her internal affairs, the nation, in an unofficial way, is as closely allied to Christianity as, yea, more closely than, in any European country where Church and State are united. The reason of this lies in the fact that religion grows and prospers best in the atmosphere of freedom. Compulsory religion is apt to breed hypocrisy and infidelity. Our American infidelity is mostly imported from the State Churches of Europe. This is a significant fact, and a strong argument for free Churches.

De Tocqueville, one of the most philosophic observers of the democratic institutions of America, and a liberal Roman Catholic, expressed the conviction that “there is no country in the whole world in which the Christian religion retains a greater influence over the souls of men than in America.” A forty-four years’ residence in the United States, and a dozen visits to nearly every part of Europe, have brought me to the same conclusion, or, rather, I formed it long before I read De Tocqueville’s “Democracy in America.” In Roman Catholic countries and in Russia there is more historic faith and superstition in the lower classes, more skepticism and indifference in the higher classes, than in Protestant countries. Germany, Switzerland, and Holland are honeycombed by rationalism. In England and Scotland there is more vital Christianity than in any part of the Continent, because there is more religious freedom there. But in the United States Christianity has the strongest hold upon all classes of society.—*Prof. Philip Schaff, D. D., LL.D. *[96]

Note,—No papers are sent by the publishers of the American Sentinel to people who have not subscribed for it. If the Sentinel comes to one who has not subscribed for it, he may know that it is sent him by some friend, and that he will not be called upon by the publishers to pay for the same.

In the *Christian Statesman* of September 22, 1887, “District Secretary” Weir, speaking of the Lord Jesus, exclaims:—

> “To him be glory and dominion and power forever in our American politics.”

And thus they make him, as stated in their own words, “the divine politician.” There seems to be place here for a very fitting application of the scripture, “Thou thoughtest that I was altogether such an one as thyself.”

The National W. C. T. U. is circulating for signatures three petitions to Congress to be presented this month, asking for national legislation on the Sunday question. It is under cover of the demand for Sunday laws that this nation is to be put under the tyrannical heel of the National Reform Church and State movement. If you want to help establish Church and State and a man-made theocracy, here, then sign these petitions. If you don’t want to engage in that enterprise, then give these, and all similar petitions, the widest possible berth.

One of the “fundamental truths of theism” which the National Reformers propose to have taught by putting the Bible in the public schools is, as stated by themselves, “The *deathlessness* of the human soul.” Very well, let us suppose the Bible is put into the schools as the supreme standard and textbook; and suppose that the pupils read there Ezekiel 18:4, “The soul that sinneth, *it shall die;”* and Romans 6:23, “The wages of sin *is death,”* and scores of similar passages; then we would inquire, How can the proposed National Reform *teaching* agree with the plain word of God which the pupils have *read?*

It is with devout thanks to God that with this number the Sentinel closes its second successful year. A year ago we stated that there had been more than 136,000 copies of the Sentinel circulated in that year, and that we hoped to see more than 250,000 copies circulated in 1887. And now at the close of 1887 we are happy to announce that our hopes have been realized. More than 255,000 copies of the American Sentinel, by actual register, have been printed and circulated in 1887 ; 1,651 paid subscribers were received in October alone. The Sentinel is a success. It has come to stay. Its field is constantly enlarging; its work is growing constantly more important. Everybody needs the paper. And, reader, we bespeak your good offices in helping us to see that everybody gets it. (1) By subscribing, or renewing your subscription, yourself; and (2) by getting your neighbors and acquaintances to subscribe or to renew their subscriptions. For terms to agents and in clubs see previous page. A good many subscriptions expire with this number. Look at the little tab on the paper and see if yours is one. If it is, please renew without delay, so that we shall not have to remove your name from our list at all. We hope to make the Sentinel for 1888 still an improvement over that of 1887. We hope to see more than 500,000 copies printed and circulated in 1888, and we shall see it if you will help us.

Did you know that the fourth commandment was abrogated more than a year ago, and that, too, by the Ohio General Assembly? Well, sir, that is a fact—that is it must be so, because the Ohio Prohibition Convention, held last summer, said so. Thus says the report:—

> “Wild enthusiasm arose when, amid the opening songs of the Convention, someone pinned on the great banner at the back of the stage a copy, in big red letters on brown wrapping paper, of the fourth commandment with this addendum: ‘Abrogated May 14, 1886, by the Ohio General Assembly.’”

Now the American Sentinel is heartily in favor of prohibition—not prohibition on Sunday alone, but prohibition all the time—but we just as heartily wish that some Sunday prohibitionist would tell us what the Ohio General Assembly, or any other earthly assembly, can properly have to do with either abrogating or affirming the fourth commandment. The obligations of that commandment pertain solely to men’s relation to God, and with it Cesar can have nothing at all to do, in any way whatever. And yet this Prohibition Convention must needs go “wild” with enthusiasm over such a silly proposition as that the Ohio General Assembly “abrogated” the fourth commandment.

In the procession at the centennial celebration of the Constitution at Philadelphia last September, the National Reform Association asked to carry a banner with this inscription:—

> “The Fifteenth Amendment secures the rights of man. Let us have another securing the rights of God.”

Do the National Reformers mean to imply that God is in a condition similar to that of the men whose rights are particularly secured by the Fifteenth Amendment? Do they mean to assert that God is as helpless toward securing his rights, as impotent in the assertion of them, as were the slaves? If not, then where is the propriety of their plea?

Another banner which they proposed to carry in the procession was one bearing the inscription:—

> “Christ the King of Nations, and the Bible the Supreme Law.”

Their application was denied, and “Secretary” Foster in intended condemnation of the act of the Commission in denying the request says:—

> “Perhaps it was well enough, for it would not have looked well for such a banner to follow Gambrinus and the Beer Barrel.”

Indeed, it would not have looked well, and we can only wonder in astonishment that men pretending to have any respect whatever for the Lord Jesus, should want to carry such a banner in such a procession, either going before or following “Gambrinus and the Beer Barrel”! All these things go to make clear the fact of the perfect barrenness, in the National Reformers, of any just conception of God, or of Christ, as well as a sad dearth of ideas of propriety in things pertaining to the character or the work of the Most High. The Centennial Commission did itself lasting honor by denying the request.

We are happy to acknowledge the receipt of valuable documents from “The Central Committee for Protecting and Perpetuating the Separation of Church and State.” This is an organization of citizens of the State of New York, irrespective of party or denominational ties, associated together “for the purpose of securing an amendment to the State constitution, so that it shall conform to the provisions of the Constitution of the United States in prohibiting any future legislation ‘respecting an establishment of religion.’” Such an organization is made necessary by the persistent, dangerous, and successful encroachments of the Romish Church in the State of New York. This necessity and this danger are just now materially increased by the proposed alliance of the National Reform Association with the Romish Church for the avowed purpose of securing an amendment to the Constitution of the United States, by which the Catholic worship, Catholic instruction, and the Catholic Bible, shall be established in the public schools and other public institutions of the country, wherever the Catholics may be in the majority. And yet there are people who think the Sentinel is performing a thankless task in calling attention to these things! We wish this New York committee a hearty Godspeed. We shall take pleasure in inserting in our columns extracts from the documents received. The office of the committee is No. 30, Bible House, New York City.

In the Pittsburg Convention Dr. McAllister said of National Reform:—

> “This movement is bound to succeed through the influence of the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union.”

We are afraid that it is too true.
