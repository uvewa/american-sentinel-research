There are few clergymen of the United States who are more prominently before the people than Dr. Josiah Strong, author of "Our Country," and now secretary of the Evangelical Alliance. Recently in Boston, before a company of ministers and prominent laymen, he "represented that it was of the utmost importance that the masses be made to know that the gospel, and not the ballot, is the panacea for social problems." National Reformers and others please make a note of this.
