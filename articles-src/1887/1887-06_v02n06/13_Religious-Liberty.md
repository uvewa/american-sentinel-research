A speech of the Hon. Robert H. Crockett, in the Arkansas Legislature, in behalf of a bill which he had introduced into the Legislature, granting immunity from the penalty of the Sunday law, to those who observe the seventh-day Sabbath. The speech itself explains the situation which made the bill a necessity. We have compiled an *eight-page tract *from the speech as it appeared in the *Signs* and American Sentinel (April number) and will send the tract, post-paid, for $1.00 per hundred copies, or that issue of the Sentinel at three cents per copy.
