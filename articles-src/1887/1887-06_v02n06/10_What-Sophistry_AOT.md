When we consider the course of action marked out by the National Reform Association, and the object at which they are aiming, and compare them with their avowed statements that the success of their work will not produce a union of Church and State and bring about religious persecutions, we are all led to exclaim, What sophistry!

In a pamphlet published by the association we find that Article 2 of their Constitution reads thus: "The object of this society shall be to obtain such an amendment of the Constitution of the United States as shall suitably acknowledge Almighty God as the source of all power and authority in civil government, the Lord Jesus Christ as the ruler of nations, and the revealed will of God as of supreme authority in civil affairs." The *Christian Statesman, *the organ of the association, also declares that one object for which they are working is to "place all the Christian laws, institutions and usages of our Government on an undeniable legal basis in the fundamental law of the land."

Mark their statements: "The Lord Jesus Christ as the ruler of nations;" "the revealed will of God as of supreme authority in civil affairs;" "all the Christian laws" on a "legal basis in the fundamental law of the and." It is indeed surprising and not a little amusing to hear any organization put forth such statements as the foregoing, and then watch their ebullitions of apparent indignation when we tell them their work will produce a union of Church and State. We have never heard them say so, but it is quite evident from their platform that if they are *not* working for a union of Church and State, they mean to have it *all* Church and *no* State. Perhaps that is a secret of the organization as yet in the background.

There is one point that we cannot get clear in our mind, and that is, If the Reform party succeeds in getting all Christian laws and usages on a legal basis in the law of the land, do they not also intend to enforce them by civil power? And if they do not intend to enforce them by civil power, why put them on the basis of civil law? Again we ask, *Why?*

If Christian laws are enforced by civil enactment, there is no reasoning that can show that such a condition would not be a union of Church and State. *Sophistry* might *think* to show differently, but unsound reasoning has no blushes, and what it lacks in reasoning it makes up in bombast and ridicule. Let the leaders of the movement step forward and tell us why they want "all Christian laws" on a civil basis if they do not mean to inflict civil punishment upon the transgressors of those laws? And if they do want to inflict civil punishment upon the transgressor of Christian laws, how is it, then, that the Church is not in union with the State. The Church decides the penalty, and the State inflicts it. If this is not a *union* of the two, will some one kindly show us wherein is the *disunion?*

Some more of this sophistry is shown in the following: Pres. J. B. McMichael, D. D., of Monmouth, Ill., made the following significant statement: "To kiss Him (the Son) in any other way than through the regenerated hearts of its citizens, the nation wouldn't survive the wrath of God an hour longer than though it hadn't kissed Him at all." To which the Rev. M. A. Gualt replied through the *Statesman:* "There is no one proposing to have the nation kiss Him in any other way than through the regenerated hearts of its citizens, except you and other enemies of National Reformers, who persist in thus misrepresenting the movement in order to excite opposition to it. The movement is laboring to first educate in the minds and hearts of the people submission to Christ; and it does not want the national confession until it comes through the regenerated hearts of the people."

This is only a sample of their sarcastic indignation. Laying aside the sarcasm, let us apply a little reasoning and see how it comes out. We fully agree with President McMichael. But if, as Mr. Gault says, the National Reform does not propose "to have the nation kiss Him in any other way than through the regenerated hearts of its citizens," why have the Christian laws on a legal basis in the law of the land? Will not the regenerated hearts obey all the requirements of God's word without being forced by civil authority? If a man is regenerated in *fact* and not in *name* only, he surely will. Then wherein is the need of having the Christian laws on a civil basis?

In place of uselessly spending our time and talent trying to *legislate* the "Lord Jesus Christ" into the position of "ruler of nations" in this world, would it not be well to listen and give heed to some of Christ's own words? "My kingdom is not of this world; if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews; but now is my kingdom not from hence." John 18:36. To undertake to legislate Christ into the position of king of the nations of this world, when God in his word has given us such plain statements as the above, would be the most absurd folly. It would be as foolish as the action of France during the "Reign of Terror," when they passed a law that there was no God. Yet God existed, and still exists, the French law to the contrary notwithstanding. And when Christ has expressly said, "My kingdom is not of this world," can finite man *legislate* to the contrary, and cause the Son of God to acquiesce in opposition to what he has so positively and plainly declared? 0 sophistry, where is thy blush! A. O. Tait.
