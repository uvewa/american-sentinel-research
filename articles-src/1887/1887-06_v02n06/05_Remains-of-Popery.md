It is curious to observe how tenaciously the ecclesiastical mind still holds to some of the principles of Popery which were not uprooted by the Reformation. In the minds of many Protestants the functions of civil rulers are in part spiritual, and they are ready to invoke the sword of government in the enforcement of religion.

The *Christian Instructor,* published at Philadelphia, and representing the conservative wing of the United Presbyterian Church, looks with a jealous eye upon every ritualistic innovation as a dangerous step toward Rome. In particular it deprecates the introduction of the organ in the praise service of the church as Romish in its origin and tendencies; and with a fidelity to its convictions that does it honor, gives the organ a sturdy opposition. It is however to be feared that the *Instructor *is going Romewards in another direction much faster than its contemporaries of ritualistic tendencies.

Last year the governor of North Carolina issued a Thanksgiving Proclamation over which the *Instructor* rejoices, and expresses its approbation by saying, "We could wish we had more governors like him." The features of the proclamation that call forth this ardent indorsement are as follows:—

> "Believing that God Almighty is the source of all authority and power in civil government, and recognizing him in the person of his Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, as the Saviour of mankind and the giver of every good and perfect gift," etc.

The confession the governor makes which so greatly pleases the *Instructor* is: (1) A confession of the governor's faith individually, and (2) a declaration by whose authority he appoints a day of worship.

As to the governor's formal confession of his faith to the world, we have only to say that if that duty is inseparable from the functions pertaining to civil office, then it follows that no one but a saint of God can perform the duties and be eligible to civil office. That the governor's confession is one that no one but a Christian can make, is clear from the declarations of the Holy Spirit in the Scriptures. In Romans 10:10 it is said: "With the heart man *believeth* unto righteousness; and with the mouth *confession* is made unto *salvation."* Also 1 John 4:15: "Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God."

It will be seen, therefore, that no one but a Christian, except he be a detestable hypocrite, can act as a civil officer, if his duties are such as Governor Scoles has performed to the intense gratification of the *Instructor.* Let it be known generally that National Reform principles, if fully carried out, would make every man ineligible to office, who is not a professed Christian, and it would instantly fall to the ground. A government founded upon National Reform principles would simply offer office as a bounty for the most detestable and Heaven-daring hypocrisy.

The *Instructor,* in indorsing Governor Scoles's avowal that his appointment of a day of worship "by the authority of almighty God, through Jesus Christ his Son," goes Romewards further than the Ritualists can do, for it is the very essence and foundation of Popery. Do not misunderstand us; we recognize God Almighty as the source of all power and authority; we know it, and do not quarrel with Governor Scoles about that. What we deny is that God has ever given the civil ruler power to appoint days of prayer, thanksgiving, praise, or any other part of divine worship. The assumption by Governor Scoles of this power is the same in kind, and only differs from that of the Pope in extent.

That Christ, the king and head of the church, has commissioned his church to appoint such days as are indicated in the providence of God, there can be no doubt. In thus doing they have the promise of the presence of Christ to direct them by his Spirit, and he binds in Heaven what is thus bound on earth. Has Christ, the head of the church, given the same authority to the civil ruler? We compassionate the man who has so little brains or is so hopelessly swayed by prejudice as to so assert.

If the civil ruler has power to appoint one day for worship, he may appoint any number of days, and the church as an organization separate from the State is useless. His government being purely spiritual, in a conflict of prerogative with the State, she must succumb, or the State carries the sword to compel obedience to its appointments. The power assumed by Governor Scoles is the same as is described in 2 Thessalonians as the man of sin, "the son of perdition; who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshiped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself that he is God." We do not unite with the *Instructor* in the wish that we had more such governors.

Let the *Instructor* present any argument possible for the right of the civil ruler in the name of Almighty God through Christ as [44] Mediator, to appoint days of worship, the argument will be equally valid for the appointment of any worship that men can render. We think, therefore, that those who are laboring to inaugurate a system of civil government, the avowed object of which is to interfere in spiritual things, and to enforce them by penal enactments, are further on their way to the Papacy, and infinitely more to be feared, than the Ritualists. It is clear to the writer that if the civil ruler is clothed with authority in the smallest particular in spiritual things, *to that extent he is Pope.* Orient.
