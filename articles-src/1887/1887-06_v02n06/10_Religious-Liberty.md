# Religious Liberty.

A speech of the Hon. Robert II. Crockett, in the Arkansas Legislature, in behalf of a bill which he had introduced into the Legislature, granting immunity from the penalty of the Sunday law, to those who observe the seventh-day Sabbath. The speech itself explains the situation which made the bill a necessity. We have compiled an *eight-page tract *from the speech as it appeared in the *Signs* and American Sentinel (April number) and will send the tract, post-paid, for $1.00 per hundred copies, or that issue of the Sentinel at three cents per copy. Address, Pacific Press, Publishers, Oakland, Cal. [48]

Note.—No papers are sent by the publishers of the American Sentinel to people who have not subscribed for it. If the Sentinel comes to one who lias not subscribed for it, he may know that it is sent him by some friend, and that he will not be called upon by the publishers to pay for the same.

Those who wish to learn what “National Reform” really is, and who wish to become thoroughly familiar with every phase of it, should read the American Sentinel. A single issue of the Sentinel contains more National Reform argument (always refuted) than both of the National Reform organs do in a month. The *Statesman* has now taken to copying from the Sentinel articles which National Reformers have sent to us, and which we have reviewed. It is perhaps needless to say that the *Statesman* never favors its readers with the reply of the Sentinel. It well knows that its only strength consists in keeping its readers ignorant of the argument against its theories. In this respect National Reform closely follows its exemplar, the Papacy. The Sentinel will still continue to publish “both sides,” always being careful to indicate clearly on which side truth and justice stand.

In his report from North Carolina, “Secretary” Weir takes occasion to eulogize Governor Scales, because he alone accepted the sample thanksgiving proclamation which the National Reform Association sent last fall to the governors of the various States. Mr. Weir says of him: “He is, of course, greatly interested in National Reform, although not yet familiar with its. doctrines and work. To use his own language, he is for ‘whatever will advance the honor of the Lord Jesus’”

If that is the case, he will do well to let National Reform alone. Christ cannot be honored by any such cheap means as voting him king, even of all the earth. Whatever power Christ has or ever will have is solely by virtue of his being the Son of God, and any action that man may take will not affect his state in the least. If every man on earth should say, “We will not have this man to rule over us,” his power would not be diminished; and if they should all vote to make him king, they would not add a feather’s weight to his power and glory. On the contrary, a vote to recognize the Lord Jesus Christ as the ruler of nations, would be dishonoring in the extreme; for it is inconceivable but that in the most perfect campaign possible among mortals, some would vote through policy or desire for gain. And in no way is Christ more dishonored than by hypocritical professions of loyalty to him.

We stated above that it would be impossible but that in any general election that could be held, some votes would be cast, not from principle, but from hope of gain. The following quotation from a speech by a Dr. Browne, in the Pittsburgh National Convention of 1874, shows that the National Reformers themselves do not expect that all who join their movement will do so from purely unselfish motives:—

> “There is no more persistent man alive than the typical representative American office-seeker. Of that class, the most of those who have not yet found whether they are for Christ or not, or who are openly decrying this movement, are ready to be its firm friends as soon as they acquire wisdom to discern the signs of the times, and are assured of its speedy success. They may pull back now at the hind axle, or scotch the wheels of the car of progress; but when they see it move, they will quickly jump in to get front seats, and avow that they always thought it was a good thing.”

And when with such help as this they have voted Jesus Christ king of this republic (!) then they think they will have given him all the honor that is his due. We can only pity the blindness of those who have so low a sense of the honor due to Christ the Son of God. The only way that he can be honored is by humble obedience to his requirements, and this must be the voluntary tribute of each individual for himself. Says Christ: “Why call ye me Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?”
