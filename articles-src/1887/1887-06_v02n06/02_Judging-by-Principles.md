Some will say, "Well, if the National Reform Association is supported by such eminent men and women, it cannot be a bad thing, so no matter how strong it is." That is a very uncertain way of judging. Members and names are a good index of the strength of a party, but they are no real index as to the character of its principles. It is a well- known fact that the institution of slavery had as able, and no doubt as pious, men for its zealous supporters as could be found fighting for its overthrow; and many of the eminent and eloquent ladies of the W. C. T. U. were most earnest advocates of that institution. If they were mistaken then, it is not out of the range of possibilities that they are mistaken now. It has passed into a proverb, that "great men are not always wise;" and when we see learned judges of the same court, giving decisions upon the same point, which directly conflict, we are warranted in concluding that wise men are not always infallible in their judgment. The only way to judge of anything is by its principles. Judged in this way, so-called National Reform is found to be a thing that is dangerous just in proportion as it has strength. We are very certain that a great many of the honorable men whose names appear as vice-presidents of that association, have given it the support of their names and influence on the strength of what working National Reformers have claimed for their movement, without closely examining its principles to see their tendency. For we are obliged to say that no man eminent for learning or soundness of judgment (we cannot say as to piety) is an active worker in the National Reform cause. This makes the situation the worse, for if the movement should succeed, these who are foremost as agitators would come to the front as legislators, while the learned men who are now silent partners, would still retain the back seats.
