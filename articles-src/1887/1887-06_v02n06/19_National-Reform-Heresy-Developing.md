If the triumph of National Reform theories were dependent upon the efforts of the body known as the National Reform Association, the lovers of "pure religion and undefiled" would not be called on for very strenuous opposition, for although it boasts a great many *names,* it cannot boast many original ideas. Both the *Christian Statesman* and the *Christian Nation* seem to have long ago exhausted the argument for National Reform, for were it not for the Constitution of the National Reform Association, which they keep standing, the reader would often be at a loss to know why the papers are printed. But what are called National Reform principles are not confined to the National Reform Association. There are individual women of the W. C. T. U., who are doing more for the advancement of those principles than all the men connected with the National Reform Association. And the W. C. T. U. is not the only additional factor in the work. George Parsons Lathrop, writing of national Christianity, in the May number of the *Atlantic Monthly,* said: "It has not been tried yet, and it is not one of the least hopeful signs of the times, that a disposition to give it a serious probation is developing simultaneously in several quarters." The movement will receive some of its most powerful assistance from quarters where it would least be expected, for politics makes strange bedfellows. National Reform heresy is developing as though, like a physical pestilence, the germs were in the air, and men who love liberty need to be awake and guarding every point.
