Those who wish to learn what "National Reform" really is, and who wish to become thoroughly familiar with every phase of it, should read the American Sentinel. A single issue of the Sentinel contains more National Reform argument (always refuted) than both of the National Reform organs do in a month. The *Statesman* has now taken to copying from the Sentinel articles which National Reformers have sent to us, and which we have reviewed. It is perhaps needless to say that the *Statesman* never favors its readers with the reply of the Sentinel. It well knows that its only strength consists in keeping its readers ignorant of the argument against its theories. In this respect National Reform closely follows its exemplar, the Papacy. The Sentinel will still continue to publish "both sides," always being careful to indicate clearly on which side truth and justice stand.
