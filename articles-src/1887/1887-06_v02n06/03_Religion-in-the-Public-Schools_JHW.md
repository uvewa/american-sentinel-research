Dr. Wm. M. Taylor said: "It looks very pious to say that we should have religion taught in our schools; but it is terribly shortsighted, and exceedingly unstatesmanlike." The more the subject is examined, the more clearly will it be seen that this remark is just. We are every day admonished, especially in religious concerns, that it will not do to trust to appearances. Paul said his countrymen had a zeal toward God, but not according to knowledge. The truth, Christianity, has had no greater obstacle to its success than the blind zeal of misguided friends. Zeal, earnestness, are the criteria of merit with some people. But loud harangues and long prayers are no proof of Christian standing. Fanaticism and self-confidence are always zealous, and never disturbed with doubts. Self-complacency is almost synonymous with pleasurable feeling, and many mistake *good feeling* for *strong faith, *though they may be as far apart as two things can possibly be.

To shut the Bible and religious instruction out of the public schools seems, to some people, to be a sacrilegious proceeding; but to maintain them in the public schools is not only very difficult, but very hazardous. So short-sighted, so illiberal and unjust, are the self-styled "National Reformers," that they accuse all of pandering to "the demands of liberalism," or even of favoring atheism, who do not assent to their propositions, and especially if they do not favor the introduction of the Bible and religion into the public schools. Our feelings—we might say our prejudices— were once all enlisted on that side of the question. We changed only when we became thoroughly convinced that the plan is altogether impracticable. To carry it out, one of two conditions is necessary: 1. The people must be all of one mind; of one religious belief. But, practically, this is out of the question. Communities of that kind will be so small and so rarely found, if ever, that they cannot be taken into account in providing for general action. 2. One part or class in the community or the State must *enforce* the teaching of their religious opinions or convictions at the sacrifice of those of other classes. But this is outrageous and inquisitorial, as all must concede, as all will concede at once, except those who are actuated by selfish motives, and have no regard for the golden rule.

This view of the case is no new thing, gotten up to meet the necessities of the present occasion. It contains the very essence and spirit of the Reformation; not of the sham National Reform of this day, but of the genuine Reformation of three centuries ago. In it is embodied all human rights of conscience and religious liberty. Horace Mann was one of the noblest educators that Massachusetts ever produced. He was a Christian of unquestioned integrity. In his Twelfth Report on the Schools in Massachusetts he used the following language:—

> "But if a man is taxed to support a school where religious doctrines are inculcated which he believes to be false and which he believes that God condemns, then he is excluded from the school by the divine law, at the same time he is compelled to support it by the human law. This is a double wrong. It is politically wrong, because, if such a man educates his children at all, he must educate them elsewhere, and thus pay two taxes, while some of his neighbors pay less than their due proportion of one; and it is religiously wrong, because he is constrained by human power to promote what he believes the divine Power forbids. The principle involved in such a cause is pregnant with all tyrannical consequences. It is broad enough to sustain any claim of ecclesiastical domination ever made in the darkest ages of the world."

Here is a plain statement of the case in few words; an argument which cannot be successfully met. It was a very good idea of Rev. Dr. Tiffany, that "when our Lord said, 'Render unto Cesar the things that are Cesar's,' he drew a sharp line between the two;" and, *"Cesar can only give what is his own."* The Doctor touched an important point in the following remarks:—

> "The reason why so many of the people of the church act no better than the world's people is that so much of that divine institution of teaching religion has been taken out of the family and put into the hands of Sunday- school teachers. It is, I think, one of the crying evils of the time, not that we have Sunday-schools, but that so much of the function of the family is delegated to them. And when you say that the State shall teach religion you cut the sinews of the church. The divine institution of the church which Christ himself appointed is not in mere teaching, in a series of doctrines, but in the atmosphere of prayer and devotion which it creates, with the authority of the Master in the institution founded by him for that purpose. The church is an institution not merely to state a fact, but to environ us with an atmosphere. When my brother says he cannot send his child to a public school because religion is not taught there, why I would as soon say that I could not send my boy to a restaurant for a beefsteak because they do not give him a chapter of the Bible while he is there. This is a perfectly illogical conclusion from the premises and it is a perfectly impracticable plan in our circumstances. It is a mistake to put the teaching of religion in the hands of the State and [42] not keep it where Christ has put it, in the hands of the church."

This, we believe, is solid truth. The more the State is intrusted with the work that God has committed to the church, the weaker the church becomes in vital power; and soon the State becomes a dictator to the church in regard to both its teachings and its methods.

And, with such a state of things as is demanded by the National Reformers, it is impossible for the State to be less than a dictator in religious matters. Thus Mr. Gault, in the *Christian Statesman,* marks out the duty of our Government as follows:—

> "Our remedy for all these malific influences is to have the Government simply set up the moral law, and recognize God's authority behind it, *and lay its hand on any religion that does not conform to it."*

To appreciate the above, the reader must consider that Mr. Gault is a very loose writer, making no distinction between the moral law and religious tenets. We have said, and we repeat, that the State will teach, not the Bible, but "somebody's construction of the Bible;" and then it must "lay its hand" on the construction of all others! And the construction which it will teach will be that of those who happen to be in authority at the time when the scheme takes effect. Now, of course, when the political complexion of the nation changes, when another class of rulers comes into power, a religion of another type may become the standard, "with God's authority behind it," according to the stereotyped phrase.

In view of the fact that the religion and the church having the most *political influence* in the country is the Roman Catholic, and that, while the National Reformers profess great abhorrence of the Romish religion, they are willing to work with the Catholics *on their own terms* in favor of establishing a national religion, the following remarks of Dr. Howard Crosby are well worthy of consideration:—

> "How are we going to take the first step as to the character of the religious instruction that is to be given to the children of the land? Are we to find a sort of average that all will agree upon? Where is the average that all will agree upon? There are in this country between one-fourth and one-fifth of the whole population who have not the slightest sympathy with the forms of religion represented in this room to-night. Are we to leave them all out entirely and say to them, You are a minority and we have nothing to do with you; we are the majority and we are going to rule? Gentlemen, if the State is to furnish religious instruction, there is another thing that it will have to furnish, and that is the Inquisition. That will be the legitimate outcome of religious instruction by the State. It will be the logical issue to which you must come. If the State is going to teach religion, it will have to compel the people to receive that religion, and in order to do that it will have to have the strong arm of the Inquisition. But not only that. In your attempt to find out what sort of religion you are going to have taught in your schools and what kind of teachers you are to get to instruct, you have got to deny and destroy the foundation of American independence, which is our boast, and the boast of our fathers, which brought us, under God, through the Revolution. The foundation of it all before God is individual independence and mutual equality. Every man on this continent stands exactly on the same platform with his neighbor, and no mere majority clothes any man in that majority with power to say, You must be taught my religion."

The thoughtful reader may wonder how the Reformers will meet all these arguments. In truth they do not meet them; they affirm and re-affirm their figments, and, as Dr. Taylor says, they put forth propositions which *seem *to be pious, but are very short-sighted and impracticable. Let them say what they will, they never can disguise the fact that their scheme, if successful, would result in continual contensions and religious disputes, until one party had proved itself conqueror in a struggle which would leave genuine piety trailing in the dust.

To delegate the teaching of religion to the State is as great an incongruity as to turn a church meeting into a political caucus; and, in truth, the latter will follow the former, for the Reformers have already decided that, in their millennium, the final decisions of *civil, *as well as ecclesiastical, questions will be made by the church. According to their plan, as has often been shown, the church will be the dominant power. And yet, it must be trammeled in its religious activities by being bound to the civil power. Such an alliance must prove unprofitable to both the State and the church.

Dr. Spear, in his work on "Religion and the State," has given us most excellent thoughts on this subject. Instance the following:—

> "One would think that so simple a proposition as that which affirms the existence and inalienable character of the rights of a religious conscience as above and beyond all human authority, ought to have been among the earliest and most widely-extended discoveries of the race. The fact, however, is sadly the reverse. Of all the forms of wrong which men have suffered from each other, none have been less reasonable or more merciless and unrelenting than those of religious zeal armed with the civil power. There is no darker chapter in the history of Governments than that which chronicles their misdeeds in the attempt to administer and propagate religion. The attempt is a horrible human tyranny begun, and every step of the process is that tyranny continued."

Dr. Spear also quotes from the decision of the Supreme Court of Ohio in the somewhat celebrated Cincinnati school case, from which we copy the following in regard to teaching religion in the public schools:—

> It "violates the spirit of our constitutional guaranties, and is a State religion in embryo; that if we have no right to tax him [the citizen] to support worship, we have no right to tax him to support religious instruction; that to tax a man to put down his own religion is the very essence of tyranny; that, however small the tax, it is the first step in the direction of an establishment of religion; and I should add that the first step in that direction is the fatal step, because it logically involves the last step."

All of which confirms the declaration of Horace Mann, that "the principle involved in such a course is pregnant with all tyrannical consequences."

And yet our modern Reformers insist that that is just what we need,—religious instruction by the State, and a State religion,—to cure all the ills of the body politic. In answer to this it is enough to say that many if not most of the great criminals of the day were brought up under religious instruction. Let them ponder the following statement from the *Church Union:—*

> "Chaplain Bass, of the penitentiary in Brooklyn, says that twenty years ago only about five per cent of prisoners had previously been Sunday-school pupils, but that now seventy- five per cent of actual and suspected criminals have been such. It is a sad showing. Pastor Crafts gives an account of an inebriate asylum where the per cent is eighty, and another of fallen women where all have been in Sunday- schools. This is a growing evil. It is a most ominous one. A generation in Sunday-schools of habitual neglecters of the sanctuary is growing up. The term formerly applied to the school, 'the nursery of the church,' is getting to be a ghastly satire. What shall be done? A hearty recognition of these facts and of the extent of the evil is of prime importance."

It is not *more* religious instruction, certainly not *compulsory* religious instruction, that is needed, so much as *a higher standard* of religious instruction. Compulsion in religious instruction never wins respect, and State religion is necessarily of a low type, as may be easily shown. We cannot possibly have any guaranty that the State will teach *the true* religion; that will depend altogether on the standing of the majority who decide *whose* religion shall be taught. And when we consider that the largest and most powerful religions in the world are the most corrupt, we leave it with the reader that, to take religion from the domain of individual conscience, and make it a subject of legal decisions, is a most hazardous proceeding.
