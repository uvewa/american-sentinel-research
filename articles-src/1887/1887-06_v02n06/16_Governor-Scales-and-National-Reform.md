In his report from North Carolina, "Secretary" Weir takes occasion to eulogize Governor Scales, because he alone accepted the sample thanksgiving proclamation which the National Reform Association sent last fall to the governors of the various States. Mr. Weir says of him: "He is, of course, greatly interested in National Reform, although not yet familiar with its. doctrines and work. To use his own language, he is for 'whatever will advance the honor of the Lord Jesus'"

If that is the case, he will do well to let National Reform alone. Christ cannot be honored by any such cheap means as voting him king, even of all the earth. Whatever power Christ has or ever will have is solely by virtue of his being the Son of God, and any action that man may take will not affect his state in the least. If every man on earth should say, "We will not have this man to rule over us," his power would not be diminished; and if they should all vote to make him king, they would not add a feather's weight to his power and glory. On the contrary, a vote to recognize the Lord Jesus Christ as the ruler of nations, would be dishonoring in the extreme; for it is inconceivable but that in the most perfect campaign possible among mortals, some would vote through policy or desire for gain. And in no way is Christ more dishonored than by hypocritical professions of loyalty to him.
