# Assorted Back Numbers.

Now is the time to do missionary work with the American Sentinel as most everybody is willing to read about the Sunday Question, Constitutional Amendment, National Reform Party, etc.

We will send assorted back numbers of the Sentinel, post-paid, for $1.50 per hundred copies. Address, Pacific Press, Publishers, Oakland, California.
