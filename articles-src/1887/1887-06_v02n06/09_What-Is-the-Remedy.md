An appreciative reader of the Sentinel, in Hamilton County, New York, who says that he has read the Sentinel from the first of its publication, and has also read everything that he could get hold of on the National Reform side, sends us the following clipping from the New York *Times,* as an indication of the great straits to which men in high positions are driven "in order to avoid the show of religious persecution in the enforcement of the Sunday law:"—

SUNDAY LAW FOR JEWS.

> "J. P. Solomon, the editor of the *Hebrew Standard,* recently wrote to the mayor regarding the enforcement of the Sunday law against those Hebrews who kept Saturday as the Sabbath. In his response the mayor says:—

> "'The Sunday law has been the subject of judicial construction, and it has been decided that it is not based upon religious principles, but upon public policy, and that it is to be observed by all citizens without regard to condition or religious belief. It does not deny to any portion of our citizens the right to observe the Sabbath-day, and it does not compel them to do so. It merely provides that one day in seven shall be a day of rest, and inasmuch as that day cannot be made to suit everybody, a day is selected which suits the majority. Doubtless this inflicts a hardship upon the minority, but under our theory of government it is a hardship which cannot be avoided. . . . The remedy is for these citizens, whom you regard as unoffending, to obey the law which will give them immunity from arrest. I can assure you in conclusion that I have a great respect for the rights of conscience, but if the doctrine were once admitted that the law is to give way to every man who puts in the plea of conscience, the law would become a nullity'"
Dr. Franklin said that, it is a very convenient thing to be a *reasonable creature,* "since it enables one to find or make a *reason* for everything one has a mind to do." There is not the slightest doubt but that any good Catholic could demonstrate to his own satisfaction the reasonableness of attending mass every Sunday, and if the majority of the people of the United States were Catholics, they could compel the minority to conform to their custom; but in such case the rights of conscience would be outraged, although not more than in the enforcement of Sunday rest upon those who do not believe in it.

Mayor Hewitt admits that the enforcement of the Sunday law will necessarily inflict a hardship upon the minority who observe Saturday, but he says: "Under our theory of government it is a hardship which cannot be avoided." With all respect for his honor, we must say that that statement indicates a very slight knowledge of our theory of government. Has he never read the Declaration of Independence? Does he not know that that declaration, which made us a nation, and of [47] which the Constitution of the United States is but the outgrowth, was based upon the self-evident truth that "all men are created equal, and endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, among which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness?" Perhaps he has read that statement without knowing what it means. It means that in this country the laws must give equal protection to all; it means that the powerful majority must not pass laws to suit their own convenience, regardless of the rights of the feeble minority. The Declaration of Independence is founded upon the principles of justice, and justice works no hardships to a man simply because he is in the minority. A law that works injustice to a single individual is an unjust law.

We can tell exactly how to avoid inflicting a hardship upon the minority who observe Saturday; do not enact Sunday laws. "But this would not meet the minds of the majority." Perhaps not; but it would not hinder the majority from keeping Sunday, and why should one man be compelled to do a thing which he does not want to do, simply because two other men wish to do it? The injustice of such a proceeding is the more marked when we learn that the two can do what they want to, whether the one does it or not.

But reasoning will have no effect to stop a proceeding which outrages reason. Just because there can be no just reason produced for laws enforcing the observance of Sunday, or any other religious ordinance, those who are committed to the enactment of such laws will carry them through. We write with the hope of increasing the number of the minority who will at least *protest.*
