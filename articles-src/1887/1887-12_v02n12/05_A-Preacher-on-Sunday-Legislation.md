# A Preacher on Sunday Legislation.

The following ringing words from the Rev. Bird Wilkins, pastor of Bethesda Baptist Church, Chicago, are of a sort that is too seldom heard nowadays. If the whole Protestant Church should take this position, she would have no need to seek political aid to make her power felt.

It is no advantage to the religion of Christ or his church that laws are being enacted at our State capital, looking to a strict observance of Sunday as a holy day. That is what it means. It is church legislation. Whenever and wherever the church has entered the halls of legislation, she has left her power outside. She, upon entering the political arena, lays aside her robes of victory. She may have a majority, and thus carry her point, but I tell you it is contrary to the genius of the gospel of Christ. He did not leave us the political sword with which to set up his kingdom in the hearts and lives of men.

I tell you, the United States herself will lose her robes of honor whenever she puts religion into her statute-books. Whenever Jesus is to appeal to Blackstone, then will Jesus become a politician; then will come to pass the attempt to force men to bear the mark of the beast. I am not ready to see the church scrambling amidst the political corruptions of the day to have laws passed for the preservation of her holy days. Whenever I think the religion of love given by Jesus needs the arm of the State to support it or protect it I will renounce it. Whenever I believe the Baptist Church covets secular power to save her holy days, I will be Baptist no more. It is a declaration of weakness on [85] our part to ask such legislation, and suicidal to rejoice over it. Say it is not religious intolerance if you choose, but I know it is, and you know it is.

To indorse these Sunday laws as a church is to indorse or to approve one of the festivals of the ancient sun-god, and an edict of a Pope of Rome. And how our Protestant divines, and Baptist ministers, especially such men as Dr. P. S. Henson, of this city, and Dr. Fulton, of Brooklyn,—I say, how these brethren can defend a law that attempts to consecrate a day which is made holy by the decree of a heathen idolater, I do not understand, nor can they explain it. I do not oppose these Sunday laws, however, on account of their origin, but because I do not want to see the church creeds put into our law books. No, not a single line of any creed do I want to see there. And I think the larger number of candid-minded people in this country, upon sober second thought, will follow the example of California in this matter, should such laws be enacted here, and repeal them.—*Selected,*
