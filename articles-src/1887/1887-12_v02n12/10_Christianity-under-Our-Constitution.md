# Christianity under Our Constitution.

The American Churches have no official connection with the State. They stand on a basis of perfect equality before the law. They are all equally protected by the State in their rights of property and in the public exercise of their religion according to their conscientious convictions, but none is supported or ruled by the Government.

The first amendment to the Federal Constitution is the *Magna Charta* of our religious liberty. It abolishes the tyranny of a State religion, and cuts persecution by the root; it forbids the establishment by law of any particular Church or sect, and, at the same time, guarantees full freedom in the exercise of religion to all denominations of Christians. This is all the Church can desire and ask from the State. She is thrown on the principle of self-support and self-government, as in the first three centuries, and enjoys, at the same time, the protection of the law, which was denied her in those centuries of persecution. Here we have not the odious distinction between churchmen and dissenters, conformists and nonconformists, Churches and sects. Here no one need apologize for being a "dissenter," as even in liberal England, where dissent is tabooed and socially ostracized. No Church has a right to say, "W*e* are *the* Church, or the American Church; all the rest are sects." Such language has no legal meaning; it is simply presumptuous and absurd.

But while the State has no official connection with the Church, and no right to interfere with her internal affairs, the nation, in an unofficial way, is as closely allied to Christianity as, yea, more closely than, in any European country where Church and State are united. The reason of this lies in the fact that religion grows and prospers best in the atmosphere of freedom. Compulsory religion is apt to breed hypocrisy and infidelity. Our American infidelity is mostly imported from the State Churches of Europe. This is a significant fact, and a strong argument for free Churches.

De Tocqueville, one of the most philosophic observers of the democratic institutions of America, and a liberal Roman Catholic, expressed the conviction that "there is no country in the whole world in which the Christian religion retains a greater influence over the souls of men than in America." A forty-four years' residence in the United States, and a dozen visits to nearly every part of Europe, have brought me to the same conclusion, or, rather, I formed it long before I read De Tocqueville's "Democracy in America." In Roman Catholic countries and in Russia there is more historic faith and superstition in the lower classes, more skepticism and indifference in the higher classes, than in Protestant countries. Germany, Switzerland, and Holland are honeycombed by rationalism. In England and Scotland there is more vital Christianity than in any part of the Continent, because there is more religious freedom there. But in the United States Christianity has the strongest hold upon all classes of society.—*Prof. Philip Schaff, D. D., LL.D. *[96]
