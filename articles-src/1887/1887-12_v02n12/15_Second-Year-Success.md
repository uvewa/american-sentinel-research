It is with devout thanks to God that with this number the Sentinel closes its second successful year. A year ago we stated that there had been more than 136,000 copies of the Sentinel circulated in that year, and that we hoped to see more than 250,000 copies circulated in 1887. And now at the close of 1887 we are happy to announce that our hopes have been realized. More than 255,000 copies of the American Sentinel, by actual register, have been printed and circulated in 1887 ; 1,651 paid subscribers were received in October alone. The Sentinel is a success. It has come to stay. Its field is constantly enlarging; its work is growing constantly more important. Everybody needs the paper. And, reader, we bespeak your good offices in helping us to see that everybody gets it. (1) By subscribing, or renewing your subscription, yourself; and (2) by getting your neighbors and acquaintances to subscribe or to renew their subscriptions. For terms to agents and in clubs see previous page. A good many subscriptions expire with this number. Look at the little tab on the paper and see if yours is one. If it is, please renew without delay, so that we shall not have to remove your name from our list at all. We hope to make the Sentinel for 1888 still an improvement over that of 1887. We hope to see more than 500,000 copies printed and circulated in 1888, and we shall see it if you will help us.
