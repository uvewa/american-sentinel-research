In the procession at the centennial celebration of the Constitution at Philadelphia last September, the National Reform Association asked to carry a banner with this inscription:—

> "The Fifteenth Amendment secures the rights of man. Let us have another securing the rights of God."

Do the National Reformers mean to imply that God is in a condition similar to that of the men whose rights are particularly secured by the Fifteenth Amendment? Do they mean to assert that God is as helpless toward securing his rights, as impotent in the assertion of them, as were the slaves? If not, then where is the propriety of their plea?

Another banner which they proposed to carry in the procession was one bearing the inscription:—

> "Christ the King of Nations, and the Bible the Supreme Law."

Their application was denied, and "Secretary" Foster in intended condemnation of the act of the Commission in denying the request says:—

> "Perhaps it was well enough, for it would not have looked well for such a banner to follow Gambrinus and the Beer Barrel."

Indeed, it would not have looked well, and we can only wonder in astonishment that men pretending to have any respect whatever for the Lord Jesus, should want to carry such a banner in such a procession, either going before or following "Gambrinus and the Beer Barrel"! All these things go to make clear the fact of the perfect barrenness, in the National Reformers, of any just conception of God, or of Christ, as well as a sad dearth of ideas of propriety in things pertaining to the character or the work of the Most High. The Centennial Commission did itself lasting honor by denying the request.
