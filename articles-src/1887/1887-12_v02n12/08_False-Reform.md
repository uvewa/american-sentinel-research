# False Reform.

In the November Sentinel we noticed National Reform District Secretary W. J. Coleman's answer to the following question asked at the Lakeside National Reform Convention:—

> "Does your movement not appeal more exclusively to the educated classes than to all classes in general?"

Doctor McAllister's answer to this question is this:—

> "I say that a question like this must begin with the educated classes. When you get a few educated men, they will reach others."

What a pity it is that the Saviour did not work according to National Reform methods! What a grand success he would have made in his efforts to convert the Jewish nation if he only had secured first of all the indorsement of the high-priest, the rabbis, the doctors of the law, the scribes, and the principal Pharisees! When he had gained these, through them and their influence he could have gained others, even the great body of the nation, and then if there had been any remaining who would not receive him, they could very easily have been compelled to receive him, or else go to some wild, desolate land, and stay there till they died; and thus the whole nation would have been converted, and that would have been then a "Christian nation," don't you see? But, alas! alas! he who made man, and who knew what was in the hearts of all men, deliberately began with all classes in general, and tried to reach the common people, even ignorant fishermen, first! What could ever have been the reason of the Saviour's acting so? What could ever have induced him to act so openly contrary to the very first principle of all reform—National Reform we mean?

Well, the secret of the whole matter is, that of all the questions that the Saviour had to bring to the notice of men, not one was "a* question like this;"* consequently it was not necessary for him to "begin with the educated classes" through whom he would reach others. The Lord Jesus would have every man to believe on him and to confess him, from honest *conviction,* and not from the *influence* of the proud, or the powerful. And the fact that there is such a radical difference between the method of Christ and the methods of National Reform demonstrates completely, and at a glance, the proposition that the National [95] Reform movement is not in any degree whatever connected with the work of Christ, and that consequently it is not in any degree whatever a work of genuine reform.

Says Dr. McAllister: "A question like this *must* begin with the educated classes." Yes, that is true, but it only goes to prove that "a question like this" can never be for the benefit of the body of the people; it only proves that *this* question does not embody any real reform. The words of Wendell Phillips fit in here precisely: "No reform, moral or intellectual, ever came down from the upper classes of society." Yet this is the very way in which this National Reform question "must" be carried; and one of the main reasons is that by means of the upper classes the lower may be reached. And *that* is the secret of the long list of Rev.'s, D. D.'s, LL.D.'s, Ph. D.'s, etc., etc., which composes the figure-head vicepresidency of the National Reform Association. The *influence* of that figure-head list of names has done and will do ten times more to give currency to National Reform than any appeal to the sober *convictions* of men can ever do. And that is the very use that is made of it too. When in examining the proposals and claims of the National Reform movement, anyone sees the danger to religious liberty and our free institutions, that inheres in it, they at once propose to silence all objections and delay all fears by some such astonished (?) argument as this: "What! would you pretend to imply that such eminent divines, such distinguished and influential men, as these would do anything which for a moment would endanger the liberties of any person? Impossible. Nothing could be more abhorrent to these eminent men than such a thing as that." And then under the direct influence of the names of these influential men, they deliberately set forth such abominable propositions as that the civil power has right to compel the consciences of men; that all dissenters from National Reform doctrines shall be treated as lunatics and conspirators and sent to the devil in some wild, desolate land, where they shall stay till they die; and that the Roman Catholic Bible, instruction, and worship, shall be established in the public schools wherever the Catholics are in the majority. In the estimation of all fair- minded men such propositions as these are enough to condemn to universal detestation and eternal infamy any association that would set them forth. Yet under the influence of the names of these eminent men these very propositions, and many more of like tenor, are published throughout the length and breadth of this land, almost entirely unquestioned, and with scarcely a protest, except by the American Sentinel alone; while the men who advocate the infamous propositions are received and indorsed by ecclesiastical bodies, welcomed by the churches, and fraternized and supported by the Woman's Christian Temperance Union.
