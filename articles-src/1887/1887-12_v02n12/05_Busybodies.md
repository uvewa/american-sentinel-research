# Busybodies.

Mr. Secretary Gault was preaching National Reform out in Wisconsin, in October, at the same time that President Cleveland passed through that State on his tour of the Western and Southern States. Mr. Gault preached twice in Menomonee, and in one of his sermons he argued in favor of governmental enforcement of Sunday-keeping. In the *Cynosure* we find a highly commendatory report of it, and among other things we find this:—

> "Brother Gault was very much exercised with regard to the course of President Cleveland last Sunday at Madison. He, together with Postmaster-General Vilas, was expected to attend a certain church. Pews were reserved and decorated, and ushers were waiting; services were delayed a long time, but no President and no Postmaster-General appeared. The fact was that when the bells were ringing for church, Grover was still in bed, [94] and at 11 o'clock he was taking breakfast. He should have risen early, Brother Gault thinks, and studied the Sunday-school lesson for one hour before breakfast, and then after breakfast sallied forth to Sabbath-school and addressed the school. Then after dinner he should have visited and addressed the Y. M. C. A., and in the evening gone to some church. Instead of this he spent several hours of the afternoon dictating official correspondence; and doubtless a good many besides Brother Gault and myself will not vote for Grover Cleveland."

This is a perfect illustration of the spying meddlesomeness that will be obtruded upon the people, and of the forms that will be exacted of them, when the National Reformers obtain the power which they are now so zealously seeking. How did Mr. Gault find out that the President was in bed when the church bells were ringing, and that he was at breakfast at 11 o'clock? How does he know that the President "spent several hours in the afternoon dictating official correspondence"? And even though it were all true, what business is it of Mr. Gault's, or of the National Reform Association, or of all the religionists of Christendom together? Macaulay truly says: "Nothing is more galling to a people not broken in from the birth than a paternal, or, in other words, a meddling Government, a Government which tells them what to read, and say, and eat, and drink, and wear." But this galling thing is just what the National Reformers aim to establish in this land.
