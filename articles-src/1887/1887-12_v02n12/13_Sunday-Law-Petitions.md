The National W. C. T. U. is circulating for signatures three petitions to Congress to be presented this month, asking for national legislation on the Sunday question. It is under cover of the demand for Sunday laws that this nation is to be put under the tyrannical heel of the National Reform Church and State movement. If you want to help establish Church and State and a man-made theocracy, here, then sign these petitions. If you don't want to engage in that enterprise, then give these, and all similar petitions, the widest possible berth.
