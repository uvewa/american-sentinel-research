We have no sympathy with the land theories of Henry George and Dr. McGlynn, but with the following propositions which the Doctor presents in the August number of the *North American Review,* we heartily agree:—

> "Only common schools and common charities should be supported by the common treasury.

> "The doctrine of equal taxation should be applied to all corporations, civil and religious, without exemption in favor of any church, charity, or school, or, in a word, of any institution that is not the property of the people, and controlled for some public and common use by public officials."
Concerning this doctrine, the *Independent *makes the following just comment:—

> "It is the only doctrine that is consistent with justice to all the people, or with the fundamental principles upon which government is organized in this country. If religious sects, whether Catholic or Protestant, choose to establish a system of 'parochial schools,' for the purpose of teaching therein their peculiar religious tenets in connection with secular education, then let them do so at their own charges; but let not a dollar of the public money, raised by taxation, either directly or indirectly, be used for the support of these schools. It is enough for the general public to pay the expenses of the public schools organized by the State, without being saddled with those of private schools for religious propagandism. So, also, in the matter of taxation, there is no good reason why a religious corporation, owning private property which it controls for its own uses, and which is protected by civil society, should be exempt from taxation any more than a bank or railway corporation. Such exemption necessitates a heavier rate of taxation upon other property that is taxed; and it compels the people by law to contribute to the support of churches, and that, too, as really as if an annual appropriation of public funds were made for this purpose. The exemption is unjust on both grounds. Taxation, in order to be equal, should as nearly as possible apply to all private property."

It is especially refreshing at this time when National Reform sophistry is clouding the perception of so many men in public positions, to hear this clear utterance from so influential a journal as the *Independent.* It will be a good thing to quote when the *Independent *comes out on the other side.
