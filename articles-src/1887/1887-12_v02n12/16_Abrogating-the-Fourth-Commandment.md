Did you know that the fourth commandment was abrogated more than a year ago, and that, too, by the Ohio General Assembly? Well, sir, that is a fact—that is it must be so, because the Ohio Prohibition Convention, held last summer, said so. Thus says the report:—

> "Wild enthusiasm arose when, amid the opening songs of the Convention, someone pinned on the great banner at the back of the stage a copy, in big red letters on brown wrapping paper, of the fourth commandment with this addendum: 'Abrogated May 14, 1886, by the Ohio General Assembly.'"

Now the American Sentinel is heartily in favor of prohibition—not prohibition on Sunday alone, but prohibition all the time—but we just as heartily wish that some Sunday prohibitionist would tell us what the Ohio General Assembly, or any other earthly assembly, can properly have to do with either abrogating or affirming the fourth commandment. The obligations of that commandment pertain solely to men's relation to God, and with it Cesar can have nothing at all to do, in any way whatever. And yet this Prohibition Convention must needs go "wild" with enthusiasm over such a silly proposition as that the Ohio General Assembly "abrogated" the fourth commandment.
