# Christianity Means Honesty.

It is told of one of the patriots of the American Revolution that, having a suit in court, he employed a lawyer who tried to advance the cause of his client by taking advantage of a technicality by which he hoped to evade a fair issue. Instantly the hero arose and rebuked his lawyer, declaring that he never hired him to take unfair advantage of his opponent. This was no more than strict integrity, but such strictness is seldom seen, even among those of whom we have every right to expect it. True Christianity presents the highest form of uprightness; yet we have to record that many profess to represent the highest type of Christianity, who are not ashamed to dissemble, and to resort to the most unworthy methods to advance their cause. Everyone knows that God is not honored, and his cause is not advanced, by evasions and deceptions. When men resort to unworthy methods to, professedly, advance the cause of God, we may be sure that they are either deceiving or deceived; that their motives are selfish, and not founded on principle.

The American people are not so far from the days of the Revolution as to have entirely outgrown a regard for the sentiments that inspired the illustrious founders of our Government. But that they are guarding with jealous care the principles that fired the hearts of their forefathers, cannot be said. A half century ago, one of the mottoes most commonly in use was this: "Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty." But it has been entirely thrown aside, because the necessity for vigilantly maintaining that for which our father's suffered and died to bequeath to us, is not appreciated by the mass of our population. Having lived nearly two-thirds of the entire period of our national existence, I feel qualified to speak from observation.

When Richard M. Johnson presented the celebrated "Sunday Mail Report," it was considered an able State paper, clearly vindicating the grounds of our civil, and especially our religious, liberty. But so many have lost the real Spirit of American independence that they suffer themselves to be cajoled into compliance with projects which tend to subvert our liberties, and are not at all alarmed at the encroachments of the enemy.

The Sentinel was correct in its saying that some respect is yet paid to the opinions of George Washington; but that respect is not deep enough to cause the people diligently to inquire if those opinions are worthy to be vindicated at the expense of a strong effort. The expression that the Sentinel recently quoted will bear repeating:—

> "I have often expressed my opinion that every man who conducts himself as a good citizen is accountable alone to God for his religious faith, and should be protected in worshiping God according to the dictates of his own conscience."—*Washington.*

This language is as plain as it is reasonable and just. None can misunderstand it—none should find fault with it. But there is a class, fast increasing in numbers, who, while enjoying all the privileges of our benign Government, in the full exercise of their religious freedom, indulge the feelings of Haman; they cannot enjoy even the richest blessings, if Mordecai has his share of the same. And they resolve in their hearts that Mordecai shall retire from the king's gate or be hanged.

But will they rise up and denounce this declaration of Washington? By no means. That would be an open avowal of their designs, which might prove fatal to their cause. If not frank, they are shrewd and diplomatic, and have well studied the course to pursue to best accomplish their purposes.

If we enter into the councils of certain bodies of clergymen, we hear them declare that Sunday is the Christian Sabbath, "the very foundation of our holy religion." They loudly bewail its desecration, and resolve to take steps to secure its universal observance. They agree to preach on the subject, and they make an appeal to their brethren in the ministry to assist them in their efforts to arouse the people to action. But they are painfully aware of the fact that their pulpit utterances have lost their power to take deep hold of the consciences of the people. Some more effective measures must be devised. The State must be called to their assistance. Rigid laws must be passed to compel the people to observe the Christian Sabbath.

But will the people submit to compulsory observance of religious institutions? Will they consent to religious legislation? Can they be led to ignore the sentiments of Washington, and to reverse the fundamental principles of our glorious Government? Perhaps not; but if not, that circumstance must not stand in the way of their success.

There is a people who ply a vocation which is one of unmixed evil. They deal in alcoholic drinks. Seven days in the week, almost the entire day and night, they are firing the brains of half-insane inebriates, stimulating them to deeds of evil, beggaring wives and children, and luring the youth to ruin. What shall be done? The answer comes: "Down with the Sunday saloon! The business of the Sunday saloon must be stopped! " But, query, Why not down with the every-day saloon? Why not put the saloon of other days on a footing with the Sunday saloon? And again, If you separate the Sunday saloon from the saloon of other days, why not separate the Sunday saloon from the useful trades of honorable people? But no; the demand [93] is made that the law shall have the same effect on other business that it has on the Sunday saloon. And why? Because the Sunday saloon is a curse! And then they call upon the people to make and uphold such a law as the great remedy for the evils of intemperance! And even though men may be working zealously to put down saloons every day in the week, they are still denounced as enemies to the cause of temperance, unless they advocate the Sunday law. This we label Deception No. 1.

Very soon we find the same clergymen who declared that a law for the observance of Sunday is the only safeguard of religion, again declaring that a law for the strict observance of Sunday is not at all of the nature of religious legislation. Rest is necessary for health; therefore a compulsory Sunday rest is purely a "sanitary regulation." No matter if a man has rested on the day preceding, every man stands in physical need of a rest on Sunday. We will label this Deception No. 2.

Besides this, the State has already recognized it as a holiday, in which men may not be compelled to work; now it must take one little step more, and *compel them not to work. *Although such action is not consistent with the idea of a legal holiday, the necessities of the case require that it shall be so considered. And then the Sunday law becomes purely "a police regulation." "Only that, and nothing more." Now from the same pulpit from which it was announced that a Sunday law was demanded in the interest of religion, the people are assured that not at all as a religious question, but as one of loyalty to the State, they are required to keep Sunday. This we will call Deception No. 3.

But they are confronted with the fact that some good citizens, in every way meeting the requirements of Washington's declaration, peaceable, industrious, honest, and proverbially temperate, conscientiously observe the seventh day, claiming authority for so doing from the decalogue, which says, "The seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God; in it thou shalt not do any work." Is not this strict Sunday law which the State is asked to enact, contrary to the avowal of Washington? and to the spirit of our national Constitution? Will it not infringe upon their religious rights? Not at all, is the reply of the clergymen. The Sunday law will not deny them the privilege of keeping the seventh day. We shall compel them to keep Sunday, and after that they may keep as many other days as they please. Our law interferes with no man's rights of conscience. Here is Deception No. 4.

That this is a deception of the rankest kind is readily seen. By such sophistry as they adopt, any abomination might rightfully be forced upon the servants of God. The officers of Nebuchadnezzar might have used the same argument with the three Hebrews, and with an equal show of justice. "We do not propose to interfere with your religion. It is your duty to 'honor the king.' By a police regulation you are called upon to bow down to the golden image. Having done this, you are at liberty to worship Jehovah as much as you please." Now there is a controversy among the churches on the subject of baptism. By an appeal to the lexicons, the Baptists appear to have the argument. So the State decides, and in addition to its law for the observance of the Christian Sabbath, it makes a law enforcing Christian baptism, thus requiring all her citizens to be immersed. To this the great majority of the clergymen herein referred to demur, as they do not believe in immersion. They and their children have all been sprinkled. The law, they claim, is an interference with their religion. But they are assured that they are altogether wrong. Washing in water being necessary to health, this law is purely a sanitary regulation; and, being enacted by the State, it thereby becomes a police regulation. For these considerations they must obey it. And besides this, it cannot infringe upon any rights of their religion. True, it requires them to be immersed, in accordance with the faith of the Baptists; but having submitted to this, they are at full liberty to sprinkle and be sprinkled as much as they please! No coercion of conscience, at all; they are at liberty to carry out their own religion to their heart's content. It is needless to ask what they would think of such a law, or of such a reason for enforcing it. When certain ministers who declared that it was no infringement on the rights of those who kept the seventh day to compel them to keep Sunday, because they were at liberty to keep the seventh day also, were asked if they would be willing to obey a law compelling them to keep the seventh day on the consideration that they would be at liberty to keep the Sunday also, they promptly answered, No! Thus they confess that Deception No. 4 is a sheer deception of the basest kind; it is unworthy of those who make the slightest claim to be honorable men; much more so of those who claim to be Christians.

But the observers of the seventh day are inclined to do just as these clergymen say they would do under their circumstances; they say that while the decalogue commands them to keep the seventh day, and they are in conscience bound to keep it, the same law says, "Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work." They say that they need the avails of the labor of the six days to support themselves and their families; they deny the right of any earthly power to deprive them of this. He who commanded them to keep the seventh day, gave them a legal permission to work six days; he gave his own example for the institution of the Sabbath; he created all things in six days and rested the seventh day. On these facts is based the precept to work six days and rest the seventh day. Therefore their right to work six days, as well as to keep the seventh day, rests on the authority of the Creator. Now if the advocates of the Sunday law are not convinced of their duty to keep the seventh day, they must surely respect such reasoning, honor such regard for the authority of the Creator of Heaven and earth, and admire the spirit which leads people to bear so heavy a cross to carry out their convictions of duty to follow the word of God. But do they? No; they affect great religious zeal, and denounce them to the people as a "pestilent sect," as disloyal to the Government, as "needlessly peevish" to maintain their "whimseys," as traitors to the laws of God and man; they denounce them as heretics, and class them with atheists; as men who would join hands with Anarchists to destroy society. Do they really believe these gross charges? do they not know that that people as a class are law-abiding to the extreme? that it is solely out of respect for law and authority that they suffer loss and bear reproach? Yes; they know all this. What, then, shall we say of their affectation of righteous indignation over their course? We must set it down as Deception No. 5. It is the very climax of all deceptions. But we find it in those who profess to respect nothing as highly as 'religious consistency and a high regard for the law of God.

But there are some who come out boldly and say that our national Constitution is wrong; that the Sixth Article and the First Amendment contain the germs of anarchy and national destruction. They say that it is the duty of Congress to adopt a standard of religion to which all the people must be compelled to conform. That this strikes at the very life of our religious freedom—at the very foundations of our Government—cannot honestly be denied. And yet, as the Sentinel has proved over and over again, the innovation is sought to be thrust upon the people by a series of evasions and deceptions of the most dishonorable nature. And the half has not been told. It has error for its spring, and it can only be upheld by deception.

If we were ready to grant that we need a national religion, which we are not, or believed that it was for the welfare of the Government and of religion, which we surely do not, we could not adopt a system which is so ready to resort to the most unworthy methods,—and which rests so largely on evasions and deceptions. It may be *religion,* but it is anything but *Christianity.* We insist that Christianity means honesty. J. H. W.
