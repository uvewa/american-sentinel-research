We are happy to acknowledge the receipt of valuable documents from "The Central Committee for Protecting and Perpetuating the Separation of Church and State." This is an organization of citizens of the State of New York, irrespective of party or denominational ties, associated together "for the purpose of securing an amendment to the State constitution, so that it shall conform to the provisions of the Constitution of the United States in prohibiting any future legislation 'respecting an establishment of religion.'" Such an organization is made necessary by the persistent, dangerous, and successful encroachments of the Romish Church in the State of New York. This necessity and this danger are just now materially increased by the proposed alliance of the National Reform Association with the Romish Church for the avowed purpose of securing an amendment to the Constitution of the United States, by which the Catholic worship, Catholic instruction, and the Catholic Bible, shall be established in the public schools and other public institutions of the country, wherever the Catholics may be in the majority. And yet there are people who think the Sentinel is performing a thankless task in calling attention to these things! We wish this New York committee a hearty Godspeed. We shall take pleasure in inserting in our columns extracts from the documents received. The office of the committee is No. 30, Bible House, New York City.
