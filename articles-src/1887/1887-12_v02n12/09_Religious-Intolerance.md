# Religious Intolerance.

A short time ago we gave an account of a Catholic procession in France, at which a man was beaten nearly to death for not taking off his hat as the procession went by. It will be remembered that that was given by the *Christian at Work* as proof that France is not a godless nation. In the same paper, August 18, we have an account of another such procession, this time in Spain, as follows:—

> “The Spanish republic under Prim sought to establish religious toleration; and it was so successful that when the revolution came, and Alfonso ascended the throne, he had to accept the fact as a fundamental law. But the new law is not always respected, as the following shows. As the reader doubtless knows, in cases of administering the rite of extreme unction to the dying, it is customary in Spain to go in procession through the streets, the priest carrying aloft the ‘custodia,’ and an acolyte ringing a hand-bell, at the sound of which all passers-by are expected to kneel until the procession passes. Since the establishment of religious liberty in 1868 it is no longer obligatory on all to conform to this custom, and consequently many, from conscientious scruples, refrain from doing so, although, if possible, they endeavor to get out of the way, so as not to give needless offense. But the other day a poor woman—a member of the Protestant community—was passing through one of the streets of the town, and on turning a corner came into contact with ‘the procession of the host.’ Not prepared to kneel, and unwilling to appear disrespectful, she stepped aside into a doorway to let the procession pass; but the priest rushed after her, dragged her out, and with great violence endeavored to force her on her knees. Not succeeding in this, he handed her over to two policemen, and charged her before the Judge of First Instance with insulting the ‘established religion.’ The judge took the priest’s declaration [in writing], absolutely refusing to hear the poor woman, and ordered her off to prison to await her trial. Heaven knows when this ‘trial ’ may come on, and so this poor wife and mother is excluded from her home for an indefinite period. It is gratifying to know, however, that the matter having come to the knowledge of influential parties in London, counsel has been secured and funds raised for the purpose of seeing that the poor woman receives justice.”

France and Spain are two of the European countries in which the *Christian Statesman* and National Reform “cordially and gladly recognize the fact that the Roman Catholics are the recognized advocates of National Christianity and stand opposed to all the proposals of secularism,” and which “in a world’s conference for the promotion of National Christianity could be represented only by Roman Catholics.”

Nearly every Protestant paper in the country, whether religious or secular, has confessed it to have been the duty of Dr. McGlynn to go to Rome when he was commanded by the Pope to do so, to answer for his opinions that were already condemned. The truth is, that if he had gone to Rome, he could, and no doubt would, have been kept there forever, and that too in a dungeon, just as likely as not, unless he should have recanted. And even had he recanted he would never have been allowed to return to free America. The chances are ten to one that had Dr. McGlynn gone to Rome he would never have been directly heard of more. The *Christian Advocate *(N. Y.) has come nearer to the truth in the matter than any other paper we have seen. It says:—

> “Once in Rome he could have been kept their indefinitely. He could be assigned to duty in any part of the world; could be cut loose from his life-work, and removed from all his associations and centers of influence, and be compelled to begin a new career under a ban.”

But Dr. McGlynn knows Rome’s methods too well to be caught in the toils of the Romish Inquisition, and he still breathes the free air of yet free America. But how long America shall remain free from Rome’s pernicious power is a question. With the National Reform party and its allies endeavoring to create a constitutional basis for religious legislation in national affairs, and bidding for Rome’s influence to help secure it; and with the press of the country siding with Rome in a controversy involving the right of free thought and free speech of an American citizen, the prospect is not very reassuring.
