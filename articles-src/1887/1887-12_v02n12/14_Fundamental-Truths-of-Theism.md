One of the "fundamental truths of theism" which the National Reformers propose to have taught by putting the Bible in the public schools is, as stated by themselves, "The *deathlessness* of the human soul." Very well, let us suppose the Bible is put into the schools as the supreme standard and textbook; and suppose that the pupils read there Ezekiel 18:4, "The soul that sinneth, *it shall die;"* and Romans 6:23, "The wages of sin *is death,"* and scores of similar passages; then we would inquire, How can the proposed National Reform *teaching* agree with the plain word of God which the pupils have *read?*
