In the *Christian Statesman* of September 22, 1887, "District Secretary" Weir, speaking of the Lord Jesus, exclaims:—

> "To him be glory and dominion and power forever in our American politics."

And thus they make him, as stated in their own words, "the divine politician." There seems to be place here for a very fitting application of the scripture, "Thou thoughtest that I was altogether such an one as thyself."
