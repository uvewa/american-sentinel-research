# The “Christian Statesman” and the “American Sentinel”

The *Christian Statesman,* the organ of the “Religious Amendment Party,” gives a very respectful notice of the American Sentinel, and at considerable length. It says their work has been languishing for lack of opposition, and that “the lack is now, in part at least, to be supplied.” If fair and honorable, yet vigorous opposition will aid their cause, we shall certainly help to give it an impetus. But time will show what the Sentinel will accomplish in that respect. If we cannot stay the popular tide, which seems to be setting so strongly in favor of a union of church and State, we shall certainly succeed in saving many from giving their aid and influence to that which, we verily believe, will prove a curse to our country and to the cause of Christianity.

The *Statesman* does not speak a word against the contents or methods of the Sentinel. We do not think it can possibly pick a flaw in any argument we used, and we hope that the future may merit the favor which the first number has so generally received. The *Statesman *quotes at length from our leading article, for which it has our thanks.

But one thing we think was “off the base.” It says, speaking of our reasons given for publishing the Sentinel, that we gave them “in a somewhat apologetic tone.” Not if we know our feelings and motives. It might as well say that Jefferson introduced the “immortal Declaration” with an apology; he certainly considered it just to give a reason for their action. But was it an apology? Not much. And we do not believe that any one who has read our first number thinks that we felt like apologizing or that our work needs an apology.

In contrast with the notice of the Sentinel given by the *Christian Statesman,* another paper which prints “Christian” on its head, gives its opinion that the Sentinel is working in the interest of the Liberal League and of infidelity. We think not. And we may at some future time give our opinion as to what interest it is serving in its position. We leave our work with all confidence to the judgment of candid readers.
