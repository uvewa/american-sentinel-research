In contrast with the notice of the Sentinel given by the *Christian Statesman,* another paper which prints "Christian" on its head, gives its opinion that the Sentinel is working in the interest of the Liberal League and of infidelity. We think not. And we may at some future time give our opinion as to what interest it is serving in its position. We leave our work with all confidence to the judgment of candid readers.
