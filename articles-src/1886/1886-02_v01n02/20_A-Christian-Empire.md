Our zealous reformers are anxious to have these United States legalized into a "Christian Nation." We have read of the Roman Empire becoming Christian, and of Constantine, "the first Christian emperor." But we never read of the good that accrued to Christianity from the alliance. Willard's Universal History says:—

> "Surely it was not in the spirit of Christ, who said, 'My kingdom is not of this world,' that Constantine made it the religion of the empire; and from henceforth we find its heavenly influence sullied by mingling with earthly things."

And so it will be in our own land, if Christianity shall be made the legal religion of the nation. Has the preaching of the cross become of no effect that civil law is required to compel men to conform to "Christian laws, usages, and institutions"? Dark will be the day to liberty and Christianity when this alliance is formed. [17]
