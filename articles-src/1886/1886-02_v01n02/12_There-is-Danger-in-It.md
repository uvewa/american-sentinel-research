# There is Danger in It

The *Christian Statesman* once published a quotation a column long from a sermon by Dr. Talmage, upon the subject of God in our politics and in our Government. To the supposed objection that there is somebody that does not believe in God, the preacher replies:—

> “Well, my friends, there are a great many people who do not believe in chastity, a great many who do not believe in the sanctity of the marriage relation, a great many who do not believe in the rights of property, a great many people who do not believe in any style of government—people who would rob and steal and murder. Do you refuse to make laws against criminals because they are criminals? Will you refuse to recognize God in the Government affairs because there are men who do not believe in God?”

We yield to nobody in our love of the Bible and Christianity; in our reverence for God and regard for his authority. But we protest against that persecuting spirit, so foreign to true Christianity, which places an unbeliever, *because he is an unbeliever,* on a level with adulterers, thieves, and murderers. There was a time when “the church” declared that “heresy is the highest crime.” Do we wish to return to such a state of things? We are fast drifting in that direction.

We believe in making “laws against criminals because they are criminals,” but for no other reason. We do not believe that heresy, or unbelief, or infidelity, is a crime with which human laws have anything to do. To set up such a standard of crime is menacing to our liberties, both civil and religious. These people may succeed in thus subverting our liberties, but the effort will bring trouble on all and ruin to its promoters.

The religious wars and persecutions of Europe in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, were a training school for the political independence of the United States of America in the eighteenth century. Diverse and seemingly incongruous as were the nationalities represented in the colonies,—Dutch, French, German, Swedish, Scotch, Irish, English,—they had all imbibed, either by experience or by inheritance, something of the spirit of personal independence, and especially of religious liberty. Gustavus Adolphus designed his colony of Swedes for the benefit of “all oppressed Christendom.” Penn, the Quaker, established Pennsylvania as “a free colony for all mankind,” where the settlers “should be governed by laws of their own making.” The first charter of the Jerseys—which were largely peopled by Quakers and Scotch and Irish Presbyterians—declared that “No person shall at any time, in any way, or on any pretense, be called in question, or in the least punished or hurt, for opinion in religion.” And Oglethorpe’s Colony of Georgia was founded to be a refuge for “the distressed people of Britain, and the persecuted Protestants of Europe;” then the German Moravian settled side by side with the French Huguenot and the Scotch Presbyterian, under the motto, “We toil not for ourselves, but for others.”—*Townsend’s Old World and New.* [16]
