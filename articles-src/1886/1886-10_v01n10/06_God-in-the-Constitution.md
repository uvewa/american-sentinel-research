The word God was not accidentally left out of the Constitution. It was most reverentially left out of it by the God-fearing men who drew the instrument, because it had no business there. It was the purpose of the founders of our Government to make it purely secular. It was a mere federation or union of States for purely worldly purposes. It did not claim to have any divine authority or sanction, but only the consent of the people. It did not establish any religion, because it guaranteed entire religious freedom. The word God has no more business in the Constitution than it has in articles of co-partnership, or in a promissory note. A promissory note would not be a whit more negotiable if it should contain a "recognition of God." This should be equally true of the State Government or of the United States Government. Entire religious freedom requires it; for as soon as the word God enters the organic law of a State, there is the necessary implication that the State has religious authority, and this is incompatible with absolute freedom of conscience.—*Baltimore American.*
