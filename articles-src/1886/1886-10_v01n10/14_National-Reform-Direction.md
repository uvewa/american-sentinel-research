Says Rev. C. E. Walker in the *Christian Nation'.—*

> "As a nation we have suffered judgments, and will suffer yet more, far more, unless the people return to God as directed *by the National Reform Association"*

We are to understand then, we suppose, that in the matter of the Nation's returning to God, the sole direction is committed to the National Reform Association. For our part we choose to follow the directions of the word of God.
