# “Reformed” Political Methods

The National Reformers claim that the passage of the religious amendment will thoroughly reform politics; indeed, some have gone so far as to claim that its enforcement would solve the problem of how to reach the masses with the gospel, for at the polls every voter would learn of it. Accordingly we anxiously look for the indications of reform, and the first thing that comes to our notice is that in a convention recently held in Mattoon, Ill., to secure the passage of a Sunday law, one minister stated that he could “control” 700 votes, and two other ministers stated that they could each “control” 300 votes. We conclude that the man who is able to “control” the most votes will be accounted the most successful minister of the “gospel.” If they can only imbue some New York politicians with National Reform ideas, what zealous evangelists they would make! Their experience in ward politics would prove such an aid to them in this new method of preaching the gospel, since they so well know how to “control” votes. This is the kind of “reform” that “National Reform” will give. In any unholy alliance the union takes the character of the baser party. When the church adopts the methods of the world, it must necessarily become like the world. This “reform” is a backward one. The world reforms the church according to its own model. “Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned? Can one go upon hot coals, and his feet not be burned?”
