A short time ago the Young Men's Christian Association held a reception at their hall in San Francisco. Judge Sawyer of the United States Circuit Court "made a few introductory remarks in which he endeavored to impress upon the Bible students the necessity of studying the political creed of their country as summed up in the Constitution of the United States."

Now Judge Sawyer is one of the vice-presidents of the National Reform Association, whose purpose it is to obtain such an amendment to the Constitution of the United States as shall declare that this is a Christian nation, and which will place all Christian laws, institutions, and usages in our Government upon an undeniable legal basis in this charter of our Government, and to introduce "i*nto the body* of the Constitution such changes with respect to the oath of office *and all other matters* as may be necessary to give effect to this amendment." Whether or not Judge Sawyer desired to impress upon his audience the necessity of studying the Constitution as it now is, for the purpose of discovering wherein it will have to be changed to conform to the National Reform idea which he supports, we cannot say. But if, as that party declares, our Constitution is atheistical and only represents the atheistical idea in government, it would scarcely be appropriate or consistent for Christians and Bible students to study it with any other end in view. We, too, would impress upon the people in this Nation the necessity of studying the practical creed of our country as summed up in the Constitution as it is, so far as religion is concerned. And we would also impress upon them the necessity of studying it with especial reference to the subversive doctrines of the National Reform party of which Judge Sawyer is an officer. [81]
