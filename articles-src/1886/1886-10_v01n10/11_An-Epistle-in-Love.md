# An Epistle “in Love”

In an article on another page of this paper, we have given some facts in relation to the way in which American citizens are treated in the State of Arkansas, when they choose to keep Saturday as the Sabbath. Much the same thing has been repeated in Tennessee, and as the following will show, certain persons in Alabama, are anxious that that State shall follow suit. There are some Seventh-day Baptists down there, who properly enough go quietly about their own business on Sunday after having kept what they conscientiously believe to be the Sabbath. This has stirred up a certain “Professor T. E. Hudson,” to write to the *Pick and Shovel, *a weekly paper published at Attalla, Alabama. From Mr. Hudson’s contribution we clip the following:—

> “Remember you are guilty when you furnish land, stock, and work to a people who habitually violate this sacred day. If they conscientiously believe Saturday to be the day of rest, let them go where that day is observed. If they cannot conform to the decision of the large majority of this Christian people, I ask, in the name of all that is sacred and good, shall we conform to the wicked decision of this hopeless few?”

And then to this exhibition of Christian charity (?) he has the exceeding abundant grace to subscribe himself “In love.” But then we remember that it was entirely “in love” to their souls that for ages the Inquisition tormented men to death.

The Editor of the *Pick and Shovel* heartily indorses the very loving “Professor” as follows:—

> “Prof. T. E. Hudson, in the above article, expresses our sentiments in regard to giving employment to the two or three Sabbath-breakers in our community. The men who rent them land or give them other employment, and allow them to do that work on Sunday are in a measure responsible to God.—Editor.”

And all this because “two or three” men in a large community, choose to conscientiously disagree with the majority in a matter entirely religious, and in which they infringe upon no civil right whatever. If there is any one who thinks the spirit of Romanism and the Inquisition is dead, they would do well to look into the current Protestant literature on the Sunday question.
