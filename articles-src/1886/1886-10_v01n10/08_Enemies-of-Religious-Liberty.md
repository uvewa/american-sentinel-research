# Enemies of Religious Liberty

President Brunot says that the sixth article of the Constitution, which declares that “No religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States,” and the First Amendment to the Constitution, which provides that “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,” are “essential to the preservation of religious liberty, and with it, an effective guard against ‘a union of Church and State.’”

Now the National Reform party proposes to change Article Six of the Constitution so that a religious test *shall be* required not only as a qualification to office or public trust, but to citizenship as well. That party likewise proposes to change the First Amendment to the Constitution so that Congress *shall* make laws respecting an establishment of religion, and prohibiting the free exercise thereof. Therefore the National Reformers in working for the destruction of that which is an effective guard against a union of Church and State, show themselves in favor of a union of Church and State; and in working for the destruction of that which is essential to the preservation of religious liberty, they show themselves the enemies of religious liberty.
