Under the above heading the *Watchman *(Baptist) of Boston, gives the following report of a National Reform meeting at Saratoga:—

> "In spite of the hard rain on Monday evening, August 16, a large meeting was held at the First Presbyterian Church at Saratoga. N. Y., in the interest of the National Reform Association, the purpose of which is to extend the Christian features in our Government, and particularly to introduce the name of God and of Christ into the Constitution of the United States. Rev. W. R. Terrett, of Saratoga Springs, presided, and the vice-presidents included Rev. Drs. Herrick Johnson of Chicago; R. L. Agnew of Philadelphia, and other distinguished clergymen and laymen from all parts of the country. Addresses were made by Miss Frances E. Willard, president of the National Women's Christian Temperance Union, and Rev Dr. J. P. Stevenson, of New Jersey. A letter was also read from Rev. Joseph Cook, expressing his strong sympathy with the movement, and quoting a passage from Daniel Webster's great argument in the Stephen Girard will case, in which he said that Christianity was a part of the common law of the land."
