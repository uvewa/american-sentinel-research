It is not the intention to largely copy notices of the Sentinel, but we have just received a couple from Illinois which we will copy. The first is from the *Sentinel* published in Avon, Fulton Co., as follows:—

> "We are in receipt of No. 1, Vol. 1, of a paper entitled the American Sentinel published at Oakland, Cal. This paper is published as the national opposition organ to the 4 Religious Amendment Party.' Its motto is 4 Corrupted freemen are the worst of slaves.' Let it be remembered that those opposed to a religious political party are not necessarily opposed to Christianity; and further, we hold it as a self-evident truth that they befriend Christianity by every blow struck at any movement which has for its object a union of church and State. Any union of church and State ultimately results in a complete dethronement of all religious liberty in a nation, and lays foundation for the darkest and most despotic anarchy that could be invented. From the commencement of Governments, history is rife with such examples of the truth of this, that people should look well where they stand before they join the fanatical cry for a Christian crusade in the shape of a political party."

Truth, every word. But the following reminds us of a certain critic, who said he never read a book which he reviewed, because reading it was apt to prejudice him, and hinder a free criticism. It is from a notice of the Sentinel which we find in the Morris *Daily News. *It is evidently written without prejudice; for the writer certainly never read a single article in the Sentinel:—

> "We have received the first number of the American Sentinel, published at Oakland, Cal. It is published in the interest of the 'National Reform Association,' and is an organ of what is popularly known as the 'Religious Amendment Party,' because it is endeavoring to secure a religious amendment to the Constitution of the United States. Its object is to put God in the Constitution."

Well, that is discouraging!
