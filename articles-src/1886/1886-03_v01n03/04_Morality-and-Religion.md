# Morality and Religion

A letter has been received asking a question which has arisen in the mind of the writer on reading our remarks on this subject. It is this:—

> “Can laws which guard religious rights and protect religious privileges be considered oppressive to non-religionists?”

By no means. It is the duty of every Government to guard *all rights,* and to protect in the exercise of all privileges which may lawfully be exercised. This is not oppressive to the non-religionists. But religion is a *voluntary* matter; under coercion it is worthless and a mockery. That which is a privilege to one, being a matter of conscience, is no privilege to another, whose conscience is not exercised in the same manner. A law to compel the non-religionist to observe religious rites and rules because they are privileges to his religious neighbor, is oppressive. It is injustice to the man and an injury to religion.

The duty of the Government is not exhausted when it has protected the rights of the religious. Governments are not established for the benefit of any one class of their subjects. It is no more the duty of Government to protect the religionist, than it is its duty to protect the non-religionist. The non-religionist has a citizenship; he acquires property; he builds a house; he pays taxes; and he has the same right to be protected that his religious neighbor has. He has no right to disturb his neighbor, or hinder him from living out his religion; and his religious neighbor has no right to disturb him in the peaceful possession of his home because he is not religious; he has no right to compel him to observe religious rites in which he does not believe. Neither has any class of religionists any right to disturb others because they profess a religion different from their own. And it is equally the duty of the Government to protect them *all,* whatever their religion may be, or whether or not they have any at all.

Another question is proposed, which grows more directly out of the remarks we made upon the ten commandments. It is as follows:—

> “Although the first four commandments partake more of the nature of religious precepts than the last six, may not the Government, under some circumstances, restrain from the violation of these? for instance, the third, which forbids blasphemy.”

We are glad to notice this query, because we wish to impress more forcibly upon the minds of our readers the distinctions to which we called attention. The main points presented are these:—

1. The ten commandments as a whole are *the moral law.* Each one contains an elementary principle, or truth. They originated in the mind of the Creator, resting upon no contingency over which any creature had or could have any control. They grow out of our relations to God and to our fellow-man by virtue of our creation. And this is the main characteristic which distinguishes them from all other laws.

2. Though they are all moral, yet they are also *religious,* using the word religion in its *primary sense* only; that is, obedience to, or worship of, God, such as holy and unfallen beings could render. But they differ in this, that the religious element predominates in the first four, because they relate more directly to our duty to God; and the moral element predominates in the last six, because they relate more directly to our duty to our fellow-man. But they cannot be so separated that a man may be truly religious and violate any of the last six or be truly moral and violate any of the first four.

3. But Christianity is a religion in quite another sense. It is purely *remedial;* it grows out of the sole fact that *man sinned.* It does not grow out of any *primary relation,*—that is, any relation which existed by virtue of creation. It is essentially different from the moral law, and its rites and institutions are *religious only.* They have no moral element. For if they were moral also, they could not belong to a remedial system, as they would then be duty *on their own account.* When the precept was announced, “Repent, and be baptized,” it was not declared because it was an original or moral obligation, but because of sin; and thus it was added “for the remission of sin.” It was in the terms of the *amnesty* which the Government proclaimed to à race of rebels.

Now we are prepared to follow out this train of thought to a further conclusion. Though the ten commandments are moral, only *a moral governor* can enforce them *on a moral basis. *Civil Government, administered by fallible men, can enforce these laws only *on a civil basis. *This is shown by considering that the tenth [19] commandment, which is among the moral precepts, because it relates to our duty to man, cannot be enforced at all by civil Government; of its violation man can take no cognizance. Human Governments are, in this respect, quite limited in their scope. Pure morality has respect to *intention* as well as to *action.* In the sight of a moral governor, hatred is murder and lust is adultery; but in the sight of civil Governments these are no crimes until they take the form of actions, or open violations of the law. It is for this reason that covetousness cannot be prohibited by human Governments. As soon as it takes the form of action, it comes under the sixth commandment, which forbids stealing.

Thus it will be seen that a civil Government which pretends to enforce the morality of the ten commandments will find itself hedged in by impossibilities; it is compelled to govern only on a civil basis; and if it attempts to go any further than this, it will usurp the prerogatives of Him who alone knows the secrets of the heart.

Now inasmuch as Christianity is *secondary, *or remedial, in its nature, and its laws and institutions have no moral element, being *purely religious,* it is a matter of conviction, of the heart, and does not come at all within the scope of civil Government. Without conviction, without the heart’s full and complete acquiescence, it is nothing. It is a matter solely between God and our own souls. *Man has no right to restrain it, and it is impossible for him to enforce it.* Any attempt on his part to do either is a presumptuous usurpation of the rights and prerogatives of the Creator. Looking carefully at these principles, and the facts and duties which grow out of them, we are led to admire the harmony of the First Amendment of the Constitution of the United States with them. We cannot imagine how the *actual and necessary limitations* under which human Governments rest, can be better expressed than they are in that Amendment: “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.” In no one part of that instrument is the wisdom of the founders of our Government shown more than in this First Amendment. And if we prove ourselves worthy of such an ancestry, we will preserve it just as they left it to us. Congress has no right to erect a false standard of religion, and it is impossible for it to enforce a true one.

Further thoughts on this subject must be reserved for the future. But we hope that no one will take such a superficial view of these relations as to infer that we believe that Christianity may be divorced from morality. It is not moral itself, though it rests upon and enforces morality. The law is not made void by faith; but the law does not become remedial by faith. *Pardon* is distinct from *the law,* the transgression of which makes the pardon necessary. But pardon recognizes the validity of law; for pardon is a nullity without conviction of sin, and “sin is the transgression of the law.” J. H. W.
