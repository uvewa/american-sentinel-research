We received a kind letter from an Eastern State, the writer requesting us to send the Sentinel, saying that he had seen the notice in the *Statesman,* and had for some time thought there was room for such a paper if judiciously edited. We think there is a strong demand for just such a paper, and we shall earnestly strive to make the Sentinel meet the demand.
