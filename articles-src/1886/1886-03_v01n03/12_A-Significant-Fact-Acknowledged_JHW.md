We have called attention to the fact that when our Government is *nominally Christianized;* when they who do not profess adherence to "Christian laws, usages, and institutions," are declared ineligible to official positions (see editorial in *Christian Statesman,* Dec. 5, 1870); when the "consistent infidel" and the dissenting Christian are disfranchised (see Mr. Coleman in *Statesman,* Nov. 1, 1883), then the *politicians by trade* will unite with the church (the most popular one, of course, thereby making it more popular), and "for a pretense make long prayers," that they may be praised of men—and get office. We are not the only ones who have foreseen this state of things inevitable upon such a change in the structure of our Government as the "Reformers" propose to have made.

In the National Convention of the Reform Association held in Pittsburg, Pa., February 4, 5, 1874, two of the speakers recognized this interesting fact. Dr. Robert Audley Browne, on the evening of the 4th, used the following language:—

> "There is no more persistent man alive than the typical representative American office-seeker. Of that class, the most of those who have not yet found whether they are for Christ or not, or who are openly decrying this movement, are ready to be its firm friends as soon as they acquire wisdom to discern the signs of the times, and are assured of its speedy success. They may pull back now at the hind axle, or scotch the wheels of the car of progress; but when they see it move, they will quickly jump in to get front seats, and avow 'they always thought it was a good thing.' When our Master comes into his kingdom in our beloved land, they will be candidates for the foremost positions, and scramble with the mother of Zebedee's children for the right or left hand places in the kingdom."

Of course they will. And what is to hinder them from getting those foremost positions if they "join the church" and pray long and strong enough? Is it-said that old office-seekers will be marked, and kept from the front? What is to hinder another set, just as plausible, just as politic, just as hypocritical, rising up and appropriating the offices? That, of course, will assist in keeping the Government consistently Christian, and greatly strengthen the church in that which it prizes so much—numbers!

Dr. Geo. P. Hays made the closing speech on the evening of February 5, in which he said:—

> "Politicians are very timid of us now. They will grow wise soon. . . . When once they [the foundation masses] are moved, hundreds of politicians who would not for the world commit themselves to it now, will bawl themselves hoarse in applause, and swear they knew it would be so, and were on that side from the beginning."

We appeal to the reader: Are we not justified in opposing a movement which, if successful, will set a premium of worldly gain on uniting with the church or making a public profession of Christianity? We only wonder that in this age, with the strong lessons of history on this subject before us, any who love our liberties, and have any regard for the cause of pure Christianity, will advocate the religious amendment of the Constitution. Our paper would be unworthy of its name if it did not sound an alarm before the fatal deed is done. J. H. W.
