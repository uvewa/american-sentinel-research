THE *Christian Herald* is not given to joking, but we can scarcely believe that it had any faith in its own words when it called New York "a Christian city." We do not know the basis of its calculation; but we suppose if Lot could have found ten righteous persons in Sodom, it would be ready to name Sodom a righteous city. On such a basis it is not surprising that they think to make this a Christian nation by amending the National Constitution! The standard of Christianity is altogether too low now, and there is no need to lower it by legal enactments. If the advocates of the amendment spent as much time to convert people to the truths of the Bible, as they do to induce people to enforce the Bible by civil law, they would do far more towards making this a Christian nation.
