WHEN we were in Salt Lake City, last year, we had a 28-page pamphlet presented to us by a zealous Mormon, the pamphlet being an argument by Judge Jeremiah S. Black before the Judiciary Committee of the United States House of Representatives. In this are some strange statements, but we notice only the closing paragraph. It reads as follows:—

> "Coming back to the original and fundamental proposition that you have no right to legislate about marriage in a Territory, you will ask, Then what are we to do with polygamy? It is a bad thing, and a false religion that allows it. But the people of Utah have as good a right to their false religion as you have to your true one. Then you add that it is not a religious error merely, but a crime which ought to be extirpated by the sword of the civil magistrate. That is also conceded. But those people have a civil Government of their own, which is as wrong-headed as their church. Both are free to do evil on this and kindred subjects if they please, and they are neither of them answerable to you. That brings you to the end of your string."

As the argument of a paid attorney, for in this capacity he made the argument, it is passable. But as the opinion of a statesman and a jurist, it is more than questionable. He concedes that polygamy is "*a crime* which ought to be extirpated by the sword of the civil magistrate." But the civil magistrate and the Territorial lawmakers and the church are alike in collusion with crime, and therefore you have no remedy! Now it is a fact beyond denial that the property and even the lives of antiMormons, and especially of seceding Mormons, have not been safe in many parts of Utah, except when protected by a power outside of that of the Territory. And if they have authority to legalize one crime, they may legalize any and all crimes. And Judge Black would coolly say: "And what are you going to do about it?"

Traced to its legitimate conclusion, the case would then stand thus: It is the right and duty of the United States to appoint judges to hold courts in Utah. And if theft and murder were legalized in Utah, the Federal Courts would be compelled to rule in favor of theft and murder, because they were protected by the Territorial statutes! And the General Government would be powerless, would have no right to interfere, because the Territory is independent of the Federal Government. If the argument of Judge Black were conceded to be correct, then all Congressional laws for the government of Territories would be nullities, and United States Courts in the Territories would be farces. Fortunately for our nation, this doctrine of crimes is not accepted by the General Government.

But there is one class in the United States which ought to rejoice at the state of things which has obtained in Utah; it is the "National Reform Association." In Utah was presented an illustration of the workings of just such a Government as that for which they are laboring. In Utah the civil Government existed "to serve the interests of the church." In Utah the civil power "formed an alliance" with the church, and acknowledged its obligation "to adhere to, defend, and maintain" the religion which the church decided was the right religion. If this is not just such a Government as they wish ours to become, then their words give the lie to their desires.

But they may reply, We do not want an alliance between the State and the Church for such an object; we do not want that it should uphold polygamy. Very likely. But, unfortunately, if you ally the Church and the State, as you avow that it is your object to do, you have no possible means of determining what kind of religion, or what acts as religious acts, will be upheld. In such a Government as ours, the religion of the nation would be liable to be changed with every change of administration! Of this we challenge a denial. To hope that the whole body of people would quietly acquiesce in any particular form of religion, year after year, would be the height of folly. The truth is that people are changing their religious faiths continually; and with every change of faith there would be a clamor for a corresponding change in the religious laws. And the vote of the careless, the indifferent, or the unbeliever, would carry just as much weight in the settlement of these questions, as the vote of the most pious Christian.

We do not believe that *the people* are so blind as not to sec the truthfulness of our remarks. We shall try, in all honesty of purpose, to arouse the attention of the country to the danger which awaits our liberties if this Religious Amendment shall be carried. J. H. W.
