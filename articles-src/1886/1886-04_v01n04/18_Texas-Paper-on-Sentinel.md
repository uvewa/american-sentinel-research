A PAPER in Texas, after speaking of the object of the National Reform Association, says:—

> "Up to the first of January there was no publication in the country especially devoted to the work of combatting this politico-religious heresy, but the void is now well filled by the American Sentinel, Oakland, California. The Sentinel is one of the neatest printed publications we have seen, and is edited with a vim that shows brains are at the back of it that will give the 'Religious Amendment Party' plenty to do to defend their sophistries. It is refreshing to see some of our religious journals opposing this amendment business, notably the New York *Independent*; but this party will cause trouble if it is not set down upon vigorously by those who venerate the wisdom of our forefathers, who wisely declared the complete divorcement of Church and State is the safeguard of our liberties."

An editor of a paper in Ohio, sending for the SENTINEL, which he had not seen, wrote:—

> "This is a community of National Reformers, and many people are subscribers to the *Christian Statesman*, with whose principles I do not agree. I am an advocate of the principles of Christianity, and a firm believer in the religion of Christ, yet am opposed to making religion the foundation of our national Government. The rule of Christ is spiritual and not civil, and we regard any approach to a union of Church and State with a great deal of apprehension. We believe that a resort to the civil power for the protection of the truth of the word of God, and for the defense of the church, would result disastrously to both. We hope that your paper will, while not occupying infidel ground, successfully combat the doctrines taught by the National Reform Association, and prevent any radical change in our national Constitution that will render it in any form a confession of the religious faith of any class of citizens."

We believe in both "protection" and "defense" when anybody's rights are assailed, but on this question the "Reformers" are the assailants, and the Government should protect the rights of all classes of its citizens against their machinations.
