OHIO is the birthplace of the "National Reform Association." It is a large and well-populated State, and the Reformers are putting forth the greatest efforts to convert it to its movement. It is to be hoped that the friends of civil and religious liberty—of equal religious rights before the law—will put forth every effort to give the SENTINEL a wide circulation in Ohio. Doubtless there will be a hard struggle over that important ground.
