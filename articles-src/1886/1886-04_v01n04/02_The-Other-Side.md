THE advocates of a Religious Amendment of the Constitution love to refer to the expression of Mr. Abbot, as follows:—

> "If I were a Christian, if I believed in Christianity, I do not see how I could help taking my stand at your side."

But that expression was very unfortunate for Mr. Abbot. It did not destroy the force of his warning and his reasoning against the movement, but it did show that he was inconsistent in his positions. After showing what would be its evil effects upon the nation at large, how it would subvert the liberties of the people, he added:—

> "If I wished to destroy Christianity in this country by unscrupulous means, I should encourage your attempt in every way."

And this he said because of the reaction that the attempt will create against Christianity. There are many who are Christians who can see the dangers ahead just as readily as Mr. Abbot could, and who realize that the reaction will be detrimental to Christianity. Mr. Abbot's position implies that, though the dangers attendant upon this movement are very great, and easy to be seen; and though the reaction which it will cause will be fatal to Christianity, yet, were he a Christian, he would favor the movement! Not necessarily. There are *many* Christians who are not so inconsistent as his words indicate that he would be.
