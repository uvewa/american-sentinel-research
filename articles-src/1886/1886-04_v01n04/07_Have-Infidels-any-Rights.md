# Have Infidels any Rights?

THEY who have heard the “National Reformers” speak, or have read their writings, know full well that they wish to have our Government so changed as to deny the rights of citizenship to infidels. First, they shall be declared ineligible to office in the proposed “Christian” Government, and secondly, they will necessarily be disfranchised. This leads us to ask, in all sincerity, if infidels have any rights.

The Saviour, in his “sermon on the mount,” taught that the perfection of Christian character is found in disinterested and universal benevolence. We are to be “perfect even as our Father in Heaven is perfect,” who “maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.” See Matt. 5:43-48.

Were we going to answer our own query as to whether infidels have any rights, we should say that it depends altogether on the relations covered by the question. In the church they have no rights; in our religious systems they have no’rights. On this point there can be no dispute. In the church the infidel would be out of his place; he has no rights there—he has no right to be there. By all means keep the infidel out of the church. And as the church has jurisdiction only over its own members, it has no jurisdiction over infidels. To the church is committed the power and duty to exercise discipline, but in the exercise of this power it has no authority or right to go outside of its own membership.

But the infidel has a right *to live*. He was born in his fallen condition, for no one is born a Christian. “Ye must be born again,” are the words of Christ to all. The disabilities of the infidel he inherited from our common birthhood. And we may not deny him a place in the Creator’s domain because he does not, as well as we, appreciate the responsibilities of his position. We all “were by nature the children of wrath, even as others,” and it is only by divine grace that we differ from others.

He has a right *to acquire the means of living*. This necessarily attends upon the right to live. No avenue to business, to the acquisition of property, should be shut up against him because he is an infidel.

He has a right to *family* privileges. As a son of Adam he has a right to that institution given to the father of the race—to Adam. We cannot agree with the Catholic Church, which makes marriage a Christian ordinance or sacrament, for marriage is older than the Christian church—older than Christianity. That which the Creator gave to the father of the race belongs to the race, and not alone to any class.

He has a right to *social* privileges. He and his family are not to be ostracized because of his unbelief. In the neighborhood, in the ordinary transactions of life, all stand on an equality.

And it follows of necessity that he has rights *in the Government*. He has an interest in the proper administration of Government equal to that of any other man. He has the same interest to be protected in his right to “life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.” He pays taxes to the Government even as others, and has the same right to Government protection that others have. His ability and his judgment in business transactions, and in matters of civil Government, are not to be disputed, nor should they be scorned because of his unbelief. He often has these desirable qualities in a far higher degree than has his Christian neighbor. On this subject we commend the following words of Macaulay to the candid consideration of all:—

> “All civil disabilities on account of religious opinions are indefensible. For all such disabilities make Government less efficient for its main end; they limit its choice of able men for the administration and defense of the State; they alienate from it the hearts of the sufferers; they deprive it of a part of its effective strength in all contests with foreign nations. Such a course is as absurd as it would be in the governors of a hospital to reject an able surgeon because he is a Universal Restitutionist, and to send a bungler to operate because he is perfectly orthodox.”

But we must not be surprised that these self-styled National Reformers are ready to deny the infidel these rights; to deny them is a legitimate consequence of the course they are pursuing, for *they have always been denied where Church and State were united*. And more than this, they are not only denied to infidels, but to all Christians who dissent from the faith of the dominant party. It was so when the church of Rome became fully allied to the secular power. It was so in New England to just the extent that the Church and the State were allied. [30] Both Quakers and Baptists, no matter how pure was their Christian life, were denied the common rights of citizenship. It was so in Maryland when the State allied itself to the Protestants, and tried to put down the Catholics. It is so in Utah, where the “Gentiles” are not considered as having any rights which the “saints” are bound to respect; and were it not for our National Government the rights of no dissenters would be regarded. It is perfectly consistent for these religious amendmentists to follow in the footsteps of their predecessors in the union of church and State.

If the infidel has a right to live, to acquire the means to sustain life, to enjoy family and social privileges, he has a right to enjoy these privileges *in the Government *wherever he may chance to be. By virtue of his citizenship he is an integral part of the Government.

But if the infidel has rights in the Government, and has no rights in the church, then the church and the Government must be kept clearly distinct and separate; otherwise he will be deprived of his rights in the State, or exercise them under church regulations. If the church has the right to say that none but Christians shall be eligible to office, or to vote for officers, in the State, it has then the power to administer discipline outside of its membership. And then it would be truly consistent for the church to disfranchise and even to banish infidels, for *infidels have no rights within church jurisdiction*. Every one ought to see that this effort to subordinate the State to the church, and to make the State an instrument “to serve the interests of the church,” to “profess, adhere to, defend, and maintain the true religion,” inevitably tends to usurpation in the State and to the corruption of the church.

In the convention in Cleveland, Ohio, Dr. McAllister well said that nations “are a necessity of life.” “It is optional with a man,” he said, “whether he becomes a member of any of these artificial bodies, banks, bridge companies, etc., or not; he may join them, or not, just as he pleases. But a man cannot prevent his membership in a nation.” And why not? Because he cannot prevent his being born within the limits of the nation. His rights as a member of the nation (not of a church) he acquires by birth; and of these none may deprive him. From this conclusion there is no escape, unless our “Reformers” take another (and to them consistent) step, and deny that the infidel has a right to be born! Whether or not he has the right, we consider that it would be *unfortunate* for him to be born under the rule of this “National Reform Association,” or in any State of which they had any control. J. H. W.
