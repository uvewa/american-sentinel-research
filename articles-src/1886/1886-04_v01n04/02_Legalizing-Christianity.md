# Legalizing Christianity

IN the first number of the SENTINEL, in outlining the course of argument which will be pursued in its columns, the following remark was made:—

> “To carry this amendment into effect, any person who refuses to obey the laws and usages of Christianity must be subjected to penalties for his neglect or disobedience. As no law can exist without a penalty, no institutions or usages can be placed on a legal basis without authorizing penalties for their enforcement. This is undeniable.”

It may be well to emphasize this point in order to meet the many professions of the amendment party that their movement is harmless; that it is merely to secure a *declaration* of the supremacy of Christ and his laws, which cannot interfere with any man’s rights, or do violence to any man’s convictions. But such a declaration would not carry the force of law, and if that was what they are *really* aiming at, it would be harmless indeed. But, as is elsewhere shown in this paper, that is but the foundation on which they propose to erect “an imposing superstructure.” The superstructure includes the placing of the Christian religion, or its laws and usages and institutions, which means exactly the same thing, “on an undeniable *legal basis* in the fundamental law of the land.” And this means to secure the declaration as the necessary step to legalizing Christianity, which means to enforce it by “appropriate legislation” and the necessary penalties.

It has been said, strangely enough, that a penalty cannot with propriety be introduced until the law has been violated. The fallacy of this is apparent; for the penalty is that which alone distinguishes between *law* and *advice*. Advice leaves an individual free to act at his own option; while law is the expression of authority, and the only option a person has in regard to it is, to obey or suffer the penalty. But advice has no penalty; to attach a penalty thereto would be to convert it into law. The following strong language was used by Blackstone:—

> “Where rewards are proposed, as well as punishments threatened, the obligation of the law seems chiefly to consist in the penalty; for rewards, in their nature, can only persuade and allure; nothing is *compulsory* but punishment.”

But it is in the very nature of law to be compulsory, and therefore without punishment or penalty, no law can exist. And so, to place Christianity on a legal basis is nothing less than to enforce it by penalties.

It was declared by a writer in the *Christian Statesman* that the religious amendment would “disfranchise” every “consistent infidel.” But that expression only reaches to the voluntary action of the infidel himself, meaning that if he were consistent he could not support such a Government as the amendmentists contemplate. But of course it would not disfranchise the dishonorable or *inconsistent infidel*, because, as we have shown, such a Government would be every way favorable to dishonesty and hypocrisy. If it were calculated to promote morality and uprightness, it would disfranchise the dishonorable and inconsistent, instead of those of better character. They may reply, that they cannot control a person’s mind, but only his overt actions. Very true; and this shows the absurdity, the arrant folly, of placing Christianity on a legal basis, or trying to enforce it by law, for without reaching the mind and the heart you have not reached the seat of Christianity. So-called Christianity without this, is only a mockery; and the amendment, at best, would only serve to enforce a mockery of Christianity. The overt actions with which alone human laws have to do, may have no relation whatever to true Christianity. The Christian religion is entirely beyond the reach and scope of civil or human Governments. And we are surprised that every person who has any understanding of the nature of Christianity, and has the capacity to reason, does not at once acknowledge this evident truth.

Such a disfranchisement as that of which the writer in the *Statesman* spoke, resting entirely upon the voluntary action of a man who acts only to preserve his consistency, *is no penalty*. It would be no part of that which enforces the usages and institutions of Christianity. But to put these usages and institutions on a legal basis, there must be penalties. And these penalties, of course, would be for the punishment of those who would not or did not observe the “laws, institutions, and usages,” of Christianity! We challenge any man to attempt to trace the facts to a different conclusion.

But these “National Reformers” have over and over said that their movement is not for the coercion of any man’s conscience, and if successful it will not interfere with anybody’s religion. But such an assertion is preposterous. They know better than to say what they do. In order to enforce Christian institutions and usages by law, these institutions and usages must be defined by law. And, in the midst of the interminable differences of religious beliefs, who shall define them? Who shall determine for this whole nation what are the laws, institutions, and usages of Christianity which they are to perform? Or, rather, who [26] shall decide, amongst the great diversity of beliefs, which we shall label “Christian,” and which shall be ignored and denounced as heretical?

The American people will do well to wake up to the importance of examining these questions, for, unless this religious amendment movement shall be speedily checked, they are questions which cannot long be ignored. With the present prevailing indifference on the subject, the amendment may be carried in default of necessary action to prevent it. And we fear for the result. It will never be carried into effect *peaceably*. We have already defined our position in that respect; we shall offer no forcible resistance to its enforcement. But we cannot expect that all will be like-minded. Mr. Abbot, before the Cincinnati Convention, gave the warning which may one day be seen to be timely. He said:—

> “I warn you against the peril of instigating the Christian part of our population to attempt this usurpation. I caution you against the folly of supposing that the majority of the people will finally consent to this subversion of their common liberties. I beg you to count the cost of this agitation before you carry it further.... I make no threat whatever, but I state a truth fixed as the hills when I say that before you can carry this measure, and trample on the freedom of the people, you will have to wade through seas of blood. Every man who favors it votes to precipitate the most frightful war of modern times; and it is simply preposterous for any of your number to speak of the liberals as ‘threatening war.’ You threaten war when you avow a purpose to destroy the equality of religious rights now guaranteed by the Constitution to all American citizens. On the assailant in this struggle be all responsibility of its results.”

And the horrors of such a struggle, which is certain to follow the enactment of this amendment, would be greatly increased by the fact that it would not be bounded by State lines, as was our late war. It would be a war of parties in every State, every county, and every neighborhood in the land. And if it did not break out in open violence in every neighborhood, it would lead to endless animosities and strifes which would be anything but favorable to the interests of genuine Christianity. We pray that the Lord may open the eyes of those who are trying, though unwittingly, to precipitate such a struggle in our land. J. H. W.
