DR. J. P. THOMPSON, in his work entitled "Church and State in the United States," says:

> "Liberty of opinion, liberty of worship, liberty in all matters pertaining to religion, is not a privilege created or conceded by the State, but is a right inherent in the personality of the individual conscience; and the State is pledged not to interfere with that right. Such is the theory of the National Constitution." [33]
