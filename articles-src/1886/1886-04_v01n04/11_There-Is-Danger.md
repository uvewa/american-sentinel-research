# There Is Danger

THE following brief notice of the SENTINEL is from the Boston *Herald*:—

> “Somebody out at San Francisco is so scared by the good people who want a Religious Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, that he has started a paper to oppose their designs. The next thing some one will be organizing a society to fight the movements for inducing water to run up hill. Such a society would be as useful as such a paper.”

Every one who is acquainted with the Boston *Herald* knows that it is an able paper, but in this case it has not read up on the strength and doings of the National Reform Association, or it has not considered well what may be done by a comparatively small body which has influence to turn the majority in a political contest. An association which can number among its officers four governors, five State superintendents of public instruction, nine bishops, fifteen judges of higher courts, and forty-one college presidents and professors, with Doctors of Divinity, and other eminent men, must command influence. In fact, there is no other association of any kind in the United States that can equal it in this respect. If the *Herald* will stop a moment to consider, it must know that a society with such strength and influence could easily organize a force which would turn the scale either way in a general election; they could control a body of voters which either party would consider worth its while to capture by the strongest pledges.

And then it must be borne in mind that their profession is high, and their object *apparently* praiseworthy. They claim that they will purify the atmosphere of the political field, elevate the standard of public morality, reconcile differences which disturb our peace, eradicate such abominations as Mormon polygamy, etc. If we were to credit all their utopian schemes or professions, we must believe that they could inaugurate the millennium by a general convention, if the people would only amend the Constitution as they desire. And we are not ignorant of the fact that thousands are captivated by these specious claims, and are pledging support to their measures when the time comes for action.

It is a singular fact that in New England, the home of the Puritans, the National Reformers seem to be doing little or nothing. It is, perhaps, owing to this fact that so able a paper as the *Herald* seems to think there is as little danger of securing a Religious Amendment to our Constitution as of reversing the law of gravitation. But we know what influence they are gaining in the great West; we know by the experience of a religio-political campaign in the State of California, what such a movement may accomplish when it can offer success to a political party for espousing its cause. And we verily believe that it will be but a short time when the *Herald* will change its mind, and wonder why there have not been more to sound the alarm of danger ahead.

It is but a few years since the “National Reform Association” was organized, and its growth has been almost without a parallel. And no wonder, considering the standing of its leaders, and the persistency of their efforts to bring their views and aims before the public. We have received a letter from an observing gentleman in one of the States of the Mississippi valley, who says that our paper is timely, and its arguments just and unanswerable, but considers it tardy in its appearing. To keep pace with the progress of the amendment work it should have been started a number of years ago.

A WORKER in the amendment cause reports from Topeka, Kan., as follows:—

> “Monday I presented the subject before the Ministers’ Association. The question was heartily seconded by the pastor of the Lutheran Church. He moved that the Association give its indorsement to the cause. It seemed as if this motion would have been carried unanimously, but two Baptist ministers expressed their decided opposition, saying that such an amendment would have no more effect on the Government than the inscription on our coins, ‘In God we trust.’ Government, they said, had no right to legislate on religion.”

These Baptist ministers were true to the noble history of the Baptist denomination on the question of liberty, both civil and religious. We are always surprised when we hear a Baptist minister, as we sometimes do, favor the amendment.

DR. J. P. THOMPSON, in his work entitled “Church and State in the United States,” says:

> “Liberty of opinion, liberty of worship, liberty in all matters pertaining to religion, is not a privilege created or conceded by the State, but is a right inherent in the personality of the individual conscience; and the State is pledged not to interfere with that right. Such is the theory of the National Constitution.” [33]
