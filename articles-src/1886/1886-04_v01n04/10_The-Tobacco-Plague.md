# The Tobacco Plague

JOSEPH COOK, in a late Boston lecture, spoke as follows, every word of which we heartily indorse:—

> “A gentleman long in a public position of honor and responsibility, sends me in writing a very suggestive illustration. A lady from the country came to Boston to do shopping. On her way to Boston a gentleman occupied half the seat with her on the cars. Half his time was spent in the smoking car and the rest with the lady. When she arrived in Boston, she was sick and was obliged to send for a physician. He examined her case, and informed her that she had been made ill by tobacco. She paid the doctor’s bill and went home without doing her business, and wondering whether non-smokers have any rights which smokers are bound to respect. Another lady says she cannot come to Boston to do business on account of the ever-present fumes of tobacco in the street and shops.

> “No doubt tobacco blunts the sense of propriety. The narcotic nosegay is as unconscious of the odors he exhales as is the eater of onions and garlic. ‘Indifference or apathy with regard to the comfort of others,’ says the London Times, ‘is one of the most remarkable effects of tobacco. No other drug will produce anything like it. The opium-eater does not compel you to eat opium with him. The drunkard does not compel you to drink. The smoker compels you to smoke; nay, more, to breathe the smoke he has just discharged from his  own mouth.’
> “A lady coming from the South for her health was kept in the state-room of the steamer during all the voyage, on account of tobacco smoke on every part of the vessel, and lost the whole effect of the voyage because she could have no fresh air. Her husband, a lawyer, thinks that in equity she could bring a suit for damages against the steamboat company.
> “The new State House in Des Moines, Ia., will not allow smokers to enter its portals. An edict has just gone forth that tobacco must not be used in the halls and corridors of the White House in Washington. Our military and naval academies do not allow their pupils to use tobacco. Several colleges in the West prohibit the use of tobacco by their students. Germany has excellent laws forbidding the sale of tobacco to minors. Eighteen States in the American Union are now teaching children to abstain from alcoholics and narcotics, and my proposition is that the churches, both preachers and members, should rise at least to the secular level of the State Legislatures on both these subjects.”
THE following, told by John B. Gough, shows the danger of using alcoholic wine at the communion. And we can but express our surprise that some ministers will persist in using it as a substitute for “the fruit of the vine” used by our Saviour. Alcohol is in no sense the fruit of the vine:—

A gentleman told me in New York: “I was a sad drunkard; I became a Christian at Mr. Moody’s Hippodrome meetings at New York. I had signed the pledge. I wanted to do work for the Lord. 1 joined a certain church because the pastor was very sympathizing with us, and I had been working in his gospel tent, and trying to rescue men. Well, 1 believed and boasted that the love of Jesus had taken away all appetite for drink. Three weeks ago there was the communion service. I smelled the drink and wanted it. My fingers began to tingle. There was an itching, burning, dry sensation in my throat. I wanted it. I tried to pray. I tried to think that I had come there to show forth the ‘Lord’s death till he come.’ It was of no use. I gripped the seat. I ground my teeth. I sat in perfect agony. The wine approached me. I shuddered from head to foot. If I had taken it in my hand there would not have been a drop of it left. I know it, and I have been fighting that appetite for three weeks with all the power I had to fight anything, and I am very glad you have comforted me by the assurance that I may yet be a child of God, though subject to this terrible temptation.”

BREWERS and distillers use per year 40,000,000 bushels of grain, averaging, if ground, forty pounds of flour to the bushel. This would make sixty pounds of bread, or fifteen four-pound loaves to the bushel. Here we have equal to 600,000,000 loaves of bread each year changed into slops containing slow, sure poisons, that do not nutrify or build up the strength of the user, but, on the contrary, slowly and surely destroy his ability and disposition to earn the money with which to buy bread for himself or children.

A man needn’t become an abandoned drunkard to impoverish his family. To drink two or three glasses a day is sufficient to make a certain deficiency in the amount of their comfort.

You doubt it? Well, suppose you use at twenty years one glass of beer a day; at twenty-three, two glasses a day; at twenty-five, three glasses a day; at thirty, four glasses a day; at forty, five glasses a day—at an average cost of five cents each. You will have spent, between twenty years and forty years of age, $1,222.75.

THE Troy *Times* tells of a Troy editor who went into the tailoring establishment of a German to order a suit of clothes. After the cloth had been selected and the measure taken, the tailor demanded a deposit as a guarantee that the customer would come for the goods. To this the editor demurred, saying that he did not know the tailor any better than the latter knew him. After some little conversation, the German, however, waived the deposit, and the clothes were made. When our genial news editor called and paid cash down for the suit, the German was so delighted that he asked his customer to go out and take a drink with him. The editor declined, saying he did not drink; whereupon a gleam of satisfaction and intelligence combined shot across the tailor’s countenance as he exclaimed, “Dot’s de reason vy you pay for de clothes so quick as you got ‘em.” [32]

THE pages of the AMERICAN SENTINEL are stereotyped, and we can furnish it at any time in any quantity desired. We can but be pleased with the favor with which it has been received throughout the country.

OHIO is the birthplace of the “National Reform Association.” It is a large and well-populated State, and the Reformers are putting forth the greatest efforts to convert it to its movement. It is to be hoped that the friends of civil and religious liberty—of equal religious rights before the law—will put forth every effort to give the SENTINEL a wide circulation in Ohio. Doubtless there will be a hard struggle over that important ground.

THE *Christian Statesman*, upon its first view of the AMERICAN SENTINEL, congratulated itself that it was going to have opposition, for want of which its cause was languishing. But since that time it has preserved the most decorous silence on the subject. As it said that this is the first real opposition that it has received, and appeared to feel so pleased with the prospect before it, we have been led to wonder that it does not further make its delight manifest to the public. We do not court opposition; we stand for the defense of the truth, and are very willing to be corrected if we are in error. The National Reform Association is a large and influential body, boasting amongst its members some of the most eminent men in the land. We recognize and freely acknowledge the ability of these men, but we think they are in error on this question, having wrong views of the proper objects of civil Government, and of the proper relations of the State to religion. We should hesitate to enter into combat with them on equal ground; but with the advantage of such clear truth as we are striving to maintain, we do not fear the result of the most thorough investigation.

A PAPER in Texas, after speaking of the object of the National Reform Association, says:—

> “Up to the first of January there was no publication in the country especially devoted to the work of combatting this politico-religious heresy, but the void is now well filled by the American Sentinel, Oakland, California. The Sentinel is one of the neatest printed publications we have seen, and is edited with a vim that shows brains are at the back of it that will give the ‘Religious Amendment Party’ plenty to do to defend their sophistries. It is refreshing to see some of our religious journals opposing this amendment business, notably the New York *Independent*; but this party will cause trouble if it is not set down upon vigorously by those who venerate the wisdom of our forefathers, who wisely declared the complete divorcement of Church and State is the safeguard of our liberties.”

An editor of a paper in Ohio, sending for the SENTINEL, which he had not seen, wrote:—

> “This is a community of National Reformers, and many people are subscribers to the *Christian Statesman*, with whose principles I do not agree. I am an advocate of the principles of Christianity, and a firm believer in the religion of Christ, yet am opposed to making religion the foundation of our national Government. The rule of Christ is spiritual and not civil, and we regard any approach to a union of Church and State with a great deal of apprehension. We believe that a resort to the civil power for the protection of the truth of the word of God, and for the defense of the church, would result disastrously to both. We hope that your paper will, while not occupying infidel ground, successfully combat the doctrines taught by the National Reform Association, and prevent any radical change in our national Constitution that will render it in any form a confession of the religious faith of any class of citizens.”

We believe in both “protection” and “defense” when anybody’s rights are assailed, but on this question the “Reformers” are the assailants, and the Government should protect the rights of all classes of its citizens against their machinations.
