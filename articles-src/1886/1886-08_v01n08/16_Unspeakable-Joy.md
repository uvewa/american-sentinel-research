WHEN the SENTINEL first appeared, the *Christian Statesman* welcomed it with apparent evidence of pleasure because the work of National Reform, which had been languishing for want of opposition, would now be caused to prosper. But since then not a word has the *Statesman* said about the SENTINEL, nor has it made the slightest reference to us. The joy of the *Statesman* at the opposition of the SENTINEL must certainly be of that kind which may be fitly described as *unspeakable.* And we are glad.
