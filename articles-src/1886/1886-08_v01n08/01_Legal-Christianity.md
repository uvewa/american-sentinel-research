LEGAL CHRISTIANITY is a solecism, a contradiction of terms. When Christianity asks the aid of government beyond mere *impartial protection,* it disowns itself. Its essential interests lie beyond the reach and range of human governments. United with government, religion never rises above the merest superstition; united with religion, government never rises above the merest despotism; and all history shows us that the more widely and completely they are separated the better it is for both.— *Supreme Court of Ohio.*
