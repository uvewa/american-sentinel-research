# The Danger Real

Notwithstanding the fact that there is in this country a large and influential party whose avowed object is to “secure such an amendment to the Constitution of the United States” as will allow Congress to do what the first article of amendments to the Constitution now forbids it to do, many persons imagine that religious liberty is in no danger. But it is in danger; and many are blindly giving assent to a project which, if successful, will bind, not only the acts, but also the consciences of all who are not in harmony with the views of these religio-political schemers.

The avowed object of this association is thus set forth in article II of its constitution:—

> “The object of this society shall be to . . . secure such an amendment to the Constitution of the United States as will declare the nation’s allegiance to Jesus Christ and its acceptance of the moral laws of the Christian religion, and so indicate that this is a Christian nation, and place all the Christian laws, institutions’, and usages of our Government on an undeniable legal basis in the fundamental law of the land.”

Of course this may mean a great deal; or, like other party platforms, it may mean very little; and it is decidedly objectionable, or measurably unobjectionable, to the degree that it is made to mean all or less than is really expressed [60] in it. However, we will allow its authors to explain its meaning. We may not find perfect harmony of sentiment in all the utterances of the National Reform Party; but the preponderance of testimony shows clearly that the amendment which they propose is designed to be practical as well as ornamental. In their Convention at Cleveland, Ohio, among other resolutions they adopted the following: —

> *“Resolved,* That we *re-affirm* that this religious amendment, instead of infringing on any individual’s right of conscience, or tending in the least degree to a union of Church and State, will afford the fullest security against a corrupting church establishment, and form the strongest safeguard of both the civil and religious liberties of all citizens.”

That sounds well; and is admirably adapted to the purpose for which it was framed; namely, to disarm opposition and lead people to suppose that that which they propose is simply a paper reform (?). Just what they do really propose is shown by the following bit of Christian (?) sentiment expressed by Professor C. A. Blanchard in the Pittsburgh convention in 1874:—

> “Constitutional laws punish for false money, weights, and measure, and of course Congress establishes a standard for money, weight, and measure. *So Congress must establish a standard of religion,* or admit anything called religion.”

Of course the unavoidable inference is that Congress must make laws to punish for false religion, just as it makes laws to punish for false money, etc. And not only was this sentiment uttered in a National Reform Convention, but it was applauded by the members of that convention. But how such an amendment could possibly “form the strongest safeguard of both the civil and religious liberties of all citizens,” is not apparent to the average mind. And no wonder; for it is evident that were Congress to do anything of the kind it would *restrict* the religious liberty of all who should be in any respect outside of the religion thus established by law. For instance, the *Christian Statesman* once said of certain Congressmen who traveled on Sunday on their way to Washington:—

> “Not one of those men who thus violated the Sabbath is fit to hold official position in a Christian nation. . . . Give us in the National Constitution, the simple acknowledgment of the law of God as the supreme law of nations, and all the results indicated in this note will ultimately be secured.”

That is to say, give us the proposed amendment, and the man who travels on Sunday cannot hold office! He may be a Jew or a Seventh-day Baptist who conscientiously keeps the seventh day according to the strict letter of the fourth commandment;—may he not then set off for the national capital on Sunday? —No, indeed; for by act of Congress Sunday has been declared to be the Sabbath; and so the man who has rested on the seventh day, according to the commandment, as he verily believes, must also rest the first day according to act of Congress! And thus he is restrained both as to his outward actions and as to his conscience.

But suppose that he does travel on Sunday? —Oh! he cannot hold office. And more than that he cannot vote! In short, he will be disfranchised! At least that is the way Mr. W. J. Coleman, one of the principal exponents of this new plan of providing “the strongest safeguard of both the civil and religious liberties of all citizens,” puts it. In the *Statesman* of November 1, 1883, Mr. Coleman, in reply to a question, said:—

“The classes who would object [to the amendment] are . . . Jews, infidels, atheists, and others. These classes are perfectly satisfied with the Constitution as it is. How would they stand toward it, if it recognized the authority of our Lord Jesus Christ? To be perfectly plain, I believe that the existence of a Christian Constitution would *disfranchise* every logically consistent infidel.”

There can be no mistaking this language. For all practical purposes all who object to the amendment are to be considered as Jews and infidels and atheists, and they are all to be disfranchised! And what for? Oh, forsooth the Jew keeps his store open on Sunday; and the infidels and atheists—well, being infidels and atheists, and this being a Christian nation, they of course can have no political rights anyway! They may be all well enough as neighbors, and tax payers, but then they can’t vote; for don’t you see that by act of Congress this has been made a Christian nation!

But it may be urged that Jews, infidels, and atheists are disfranchised because they will not do that which the amended Constitution requires; namely, recognize Christ as the ruler of the nation; also that being Jews, infidels, and atheists they are necessarily immoral persons, and therefore should have no voice in a government whose fundamental code is the moral law. But how about the Seventh-day Baptist? He fully recognizes Christ and the moral law, in fact, he is quite a stickler for the law. What, then, will be the attitude of the National Reform Government* to one who differs from it only in that he, in all good conscience, keeps the day anciently observed by the people of God? Let Dr. Jonathan Edwards, of Illinois, answer. After speaking of atheists, deists, and Jews, he says:—

> “The Seventh-day Baptists believe in God and Christianity, and are conjoined with the other members of this class by the accident of differing with the mass of Christians upon the question of what precise day of the week shall be observed as holy. These all are, for the occasion, and as far as our amendment is concerned, one class. They use the same arguments and the same tactics against us. *They must be counted together.”*

Such an utterance needs no comment. This is not the sentiment of Him who said, “My kingdom is not of this world;” but it savors of the Dark Ages, and has about it the scent of the musty dungeons of the Inquisition. But history repeats itself; and why may it not do so in this as well as in other things? This Reform (?) Association is rapidly growing in numbers and influence. Their speakers are constantly in the field; and they are rapidly enlisting the sympathy and the co-operation of almost the entire ministry of our land. They are themselves ministers, and they go from place to place, visiting clergymen and securing the use of their churches in which to hold meetings.

They appeal to church people in behalf of religion; to moralists, in behalf of morality; to the temperance people, in behalf of temperance; and to laboring people in behalf of a day of rest for workingmen. Railroad accidents are by them held up as evidence of the displeasure of God toward the railway companies for running their trains on Sunday. Cyclones and floods are represented as the judgments of God upon the Nation for its wickedness in refusing to make the decalogue (as expounded by the National Reform Party) the fundamental law of the land! In short, they appeal to any and every motive to compass their ends—and all for what? That they may multiply tenfold the number of hypocrites; that our churches may be defiled by political corruption; that religious bigotry and intolerance may spring up and flourish in our land, and that they may, like Saul of Tarsus before his conversion, enter into every house, and, haling men and women, commit to prison all who do not believe and practice as they, the National Reform Party, dictate.
