The Catholic *Monitor,* of San Francisco, in an article relating how Catholics were persecuted by the Orangemen, after their organization in Ulster in the last century, says:—

> "And this happened under the flag of Protestant England, a little over a century ago; yet the Catholic Church is held up to the world as the *only* ecclesiastical power that ever persecuted for conscience' sake!"

Not so; we would not so single out the Catholic Church as the sole persecutor. Any ecclesiastical power, be it Protestant, Catholic, or Pagan, if joined with civil power, will persecute dissenters. It cannot be otherwise. The Catholic Church has been the greatest persecutor known in history, because it enjoyed the longest period of union with, and supremacy over, the civil power. If it had never been able to use the secular power, its persecutions would never have been heard of. The Catholic Church from the time of Constantine until the sixteenth century is the model after which the Religious Amendmentists in the United States are working; and if they shall gain their purpose, Protestant America will, from the very nature of the case, persecute dissenters as vigorously as did Catholic France or Episcopal England.
