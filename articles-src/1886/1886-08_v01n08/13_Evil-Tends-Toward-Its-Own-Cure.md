IN the *Christian Statesman* of July 15, there is a "Monthly Reading of the W. C. T. U." on "God in Government." As a specimen of woman-suffrage-religio-political-sentimentalism it is a magnificent success, and a curiosity. Get it. As a sample of its lustrous scintillations we give just this one: "Evil tends toward its own cure."
