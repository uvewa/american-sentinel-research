THE *Christian Statesman* is not the only organ of National Reform. The *Christian Nation, *252 Broadway, N. Y., is another weekly paper devoted wholly to the National Reform work. The *Statesman,* however, is, we believe, the *official* organ. With this exception we do not see that the *Christian Nation* is in anywise second to the *Statesman.* And, by the way, the *Christian Nation* also is of Reformed Presbyterian origin and affinities.
