# Model for Religious Amendmentists

THOSE who are laboring to procure an amendment to our National Constitution, in favor of religion, strongly profess their apprehension that infidelity and even Paganism will run riot in our fair land if not restrained by the strong arm of civil law. They are not the first to indulge such fears. Two centuries ago our worthy sires of New England engaged in the same laudable work, and carried it on to considerable success in some instances, as the “heretics and malignants called Quakers,” and also the Baptists, could testify, having experienced some of the “tender mercies” of those who were zealous for the honor of our long-suffering and compassionate Saviour.

But sometimes their plans miscarried, as in the following case. This letter from a very pious Puritan explains itself. It cannot fail to be of interest at this time, as a bit of history which is so nearly trying to repeat itself, as its second centennial:—

*“September, 1682.*

> “To ye aged and beloved John Higginson:–

> “There be now at sea a shippe (for our friend Esias Holdcraft, of London, did advise me by the last packet that it would sail sometime in August) called ye *Welcome,* R. Green was, Master, which has aboard a hundred or more of ye heretics and malignants called Quakers, with  W. Penn, who is ye scamp at ye head of them. Ye General Court has accordingly given secret orders to Master Malachi Huxett, of ye brig *Porpoise,* to waylaye ye said *Welcome,* as near ye coast of Codd as may be, and make captives of ye Penn and his ungodly crew, so that ye Lord may be glorified and not mocked on ye soil of this new country with ye heathen worshipps of these people. Much spoil can be made by selling ye whole lot to Barbadoes; where slaves fetch good prices in rumme and sugar; and we shall not only do ye Lord great service by punishing ye wicked, but shall make gayne for his ministers and people.
“Yours, in ye bowels of Christ, “Cotton Mather.”
