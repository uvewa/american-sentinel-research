# A Disinfectant Needed

REV. J. C. MCFEETERS is a prominent National Reformer, and deposes as follows:—

> “Jesus sustains a national relation to every nation. And it becomes every nation to acknowledge that national relation. But that acknowledgment is wanting. . . The anointed Son of God shall yet be honored with this acknowledgment. . . And if this acknowledgment come peaceably. . . if it come peaceably, we expect it to come at first through a political platform, for the platform is the living voice, or *fetid breath,* of dominant parties.”— *Christian Statesman, August 14, 1884, p. 6.*

This idea of the political platform being the “fetid breath” of dominant parties set us aquerying somewhat after this manner: Suppose the National Reform Party were to become the dominant political party in this country. Then, according to the religio-political scheme which it proposes, would it not be what is described in Rev. 18:2, “The hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird”? Then would not the term “fetid” fitly characterize the political odor that should issue from such a “hold”? And has not Mr. McFeeters exactly hit off the sanitary condition of the platform of the National Reform Party were that Party to become dominant? Has he not “builded better than he knew”? [65]
