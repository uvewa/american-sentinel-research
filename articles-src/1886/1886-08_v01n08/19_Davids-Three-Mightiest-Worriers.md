THE report of the Committee on Resolutions at the late Wooster National Reform Convention, in mentioning the death of two eminent National Reform preachers, says they were "like the three mightiest of David's *worriers *of old." David's *"three* mightiest worriers" is somewhat of a puzzle to us. It is easy enough to name the two that worried him most. These were Satan and Absalom, but as for the third we cannot make him out. We rather suspect that the Committee had Joab in view, for no doubt he worried David a great deal. He took advantage of the ruler's sin to exalt himself, and so ruled the ruler with a high hand; and this is precisely what the National Reformers are aiming to do in this Government. It is just possible however, that an eccentricity of the types has made the report say "worriers" instead of *warriors.* But even in that case the eccentricity is not at all inappropriate, for if the National Reformers do not yet prove to be the mightiest of this nation's "worriers," we shall freely confess ourselves most happily deceived in them.
