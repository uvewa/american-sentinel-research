THE prophet Isaiah says, "Unto us a child is born, unto us a Son is given; and the Government shall be upon his shoulder; ... of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end. . . . The zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this." Strangely enough the "National Reformers" use this text as one of their arguments to prove that they are to restore the kingdom to Christ. In order to fit their case it should read, The zeal of the National Reform Association will perform this. The reader will say that such a perversion of the text would be blasphemy. So it would; but it would be no more blasphemous than is their foolish assumption of power to do that which can be done only by the Lord of hosts.
