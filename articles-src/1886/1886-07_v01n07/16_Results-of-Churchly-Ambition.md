IN his "History of the Popes," Ranke, in speaking of the fifteenth century, when, as a consequence of the policy of Gregory VII., "the Church" had become supreme, and the State was only its vassal, says:—

> "But the orders also had fallen into the extreme of worldliness. What intrigues were set on foot among them for securing the higher appointments! what eagerness was displayed at elections to be rid of a rival, or of a voter believed unfavorable! The latter were sent out of the way as preachers or as inspectors of remote parishes; against the former, they did not scruple to employ the sword, or even the dagger, and many were destroyed by poison. Meanwhile the comforts men seek from religion became mere matter of sale; the mendicant friars, employed at miserably low wages, caught eagerly at all contingent means of making profit."

What caused this state of things? We claim that it was the legitimate result of the union of Church and State. It was not because people in those days were naturally any worse than people are now. Human nature is ever the same; and if the Amendmentists should succeed in their design of making "the State and its sphere exist for the sake of and to serve the interests of the Church," then the crimes that were committed in the name of Christianity in the time of Alexander VI., will be repeated. It cannot be otherwise when church positions are made the object of political ambition. Ambition is no respecter of place; it will as readily work ruin in the Church as outside of it. "By that sin fell the angels."
