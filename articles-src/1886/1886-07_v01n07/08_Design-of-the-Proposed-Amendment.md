IN June, 1873, Rev. Wm. Ballentine, then pastor of the Associate Congregation of Bloomfield. Ohio, delivered a lecture before the Associate Synod, on National Reform. A few weeks afterward, Dr. Wishart published a reply in the *United Presbyterian,* of Pittsburg , and to these strictures Mr. Ballentine replied in a pamphlet, being denied admission to the columns of the *United Presbyterian.* With this explanation, we invite the reader's attention to the following extract from Mr. Ballentine's pamphlet. It shows in a clear light how the proposed amendment, if adopted, will lower the Scriptures to the level of ordinary civil affairs:—

> "The ambiguity of the language in which the second proposed amendment is couched, viz., 'That the Lord Jesus Christ is Governor among the nations,' is a valid objection to its insertion in a civil instrument of government. It is susceptible of a two fold interpretation. We can understand it in what we believe to be the true theological sense, that Jesus Christ as King and Head of Zion, is Ruler among the nations, and in, 'Jacob ruleth to the ends of the earth.' But in this sense it is purely a matter of faith, and has no more claim for insertion in the Constitution than any other doctrine in our religious profession. But it is also susceptible of being understood in what we believe to be a heterodox sense, and in this sense it seems to be understood by its advocates, viz.: That Jesus Christ, in some sense, as the civil head of nations, ruleth among them Understanding it in this sense, we cannot advocate its insertion, being theologically wrong. Neither in the former sense can we advocate its insertion, it being purely a matter of faith, having no more authority for its insertion than the perseverance of the saints, predestination, or any doctrine of faith set forth in the Westminster standards. In regard to the third amendment, 'That his revealed will is of Supreme authority,' we believe it to be too indefinite to secure the end intended. If it is simply regarded as a statement of truth, without the force and sanction of law, it will not secure respect for the authority of Scripture from those who have not their understandings opened to understand the truth of God. If, on the other hand, we regard it as having the force and sanction of law, we make the Scriptures of divine truth the formal rule of the magistracy, and so constitute civil rulers the judges and interpreters of Scripture. From this, as a church, we have always demurred, and we still see no reason why we should change our ground.

> "It will probably be denied by some, that the third amendment, which we have opposed, is designed to make the Scriptures the formal rule of the civil magistrate. If this be not the design of some of their leaders, we fail to comprehend the import and force of plain English. We will give some extracts from the *Christian Statesman* that will speak for themselves. In its issue of May 15, 1868, we have a prize offered by the Reformed Presbyterian congregations of Pittsburg and Allegheny, Pa., for the best manuscript on several topics, and among others for this: "*The Bible as the supreme law in civil matters."* This may be viewed as too abstract to prove anything. Let us, then, hear the concrete or the application. In its issue of December 15, 1868, in reply to the inquiries of Mr. J. McFarland about the efficiency of said amendments to arrest the commission of frauds in Philadelphia and New York, and the demoralization in politics, the editor answers: 'Precisely in this way: The amendment which we propose will be, when it is adopted, a deliberate and solemn utterance of the national will. The people, in their sovereign capacity, will declare: "We recognize Almighty God as the source of all authority and power in civil government; the Lord Jesus Christ as the ruler among nations, and *his revealed* will as of supreme authority." Once enacted into the Constitution, this language *has the force of law.* It makes all the requisitions of the Bible concerning civil government "supreme law," and, among others, this: "He that ruleth over men must be just, ruling in the fear of God." Congress would at once be legally bound to make laws purging national offices of immoral and irreligious men. No Sabbath breaker or profane swearer, no man known to be guilty of drunkenness or licentiousness, could *legally* hold office or vote after the passage of this amendment!'

> "The editor of the *Christian Statesman* surely understands the fundamental principles of this movement. He has been one of its inaugurators. What, then, is the import of the above extract? Does it not teach that whenever the amendments are adopted, that they have the force of law—that the requisitions of the [53] Bible concerning civil governments are a 'supreme law' —that Congress must enforce it in purging national office? If this would not be making the Bible the formal rule of Congress, we think language cannot express it. The evidences on this point throughout the columns of the *Christian Statesman,* like the *'possessed,' *hath their name *'Legion'* for they are many. In the issue of June 1, 1869, the editor again, writing under the caption, 'Sufficiency of the Proposed Amendment,' uses the following language: 'The design of the pending movement of National Reform is not to secure mention of God in the National Constitution merely because such mention would be decent and becoming. It is not, in the view of its most earnest supporters, to express a sentiment which the nation already feels, and to exhibit a Christian character which, as a nation, we already possesses. The necessity for the reform lies far deeper than such arguments would imply. The success of our cause would have a far more momentous effect. Our labors are an attempt to bring this nation into subjection to God, and the conviction that we are not, as a nation, in allegiance to the King of nations, but in rebellion against him, and so in imminent danger of destruction, is the real impulse of the movement.'

> "Does this extract not clearly show that it is not the design of the 'earnest supporters' of this movement to give expression to the Christian character of the nation, by simply acknowledging God. This would be 'decent and becoming,' but it would be too tame. Something deeper, more radical, is aimed at. The design is pointedly declared 'to bring this nation into subjection to God,' by giving to the amendments, as was observed in the former extract, 'the force of law,' and expurgating all the departments of government. One of the amendments the editor expresses in the following language: 'That the Holy Scriptures, as a revelation of Christ's will, are the supreme *law of nations.'* Giving the Scriptures, which are here declared to be the 'supreme law of nations,' the 'force of law,' is surely making them the 'formal rule' of civil government. If it is not, what words could express it more clearly?

> "Further on, having noticed the omission of any express recognition of the Sabbath, the moral qualification of rulers—the duty of the State—the religious instruction of her children and the relations of Church and State—he adds: 'All these questions are subordinate to, and are included in, the ruling question, Shall the word of God be recognized as a law to this nation? When it shall be so recognized then the question will arise, What does the law of God require us to do?' This, we think, is all perfectly plain, and the editor, from his premises, perfectly logical. The recognition of the Bible, as proposed, is all that is necessary. Grant this, and all other questions about what it teaches will *then* devolve upon Congress to apprehend and enforce. Having become the law of the land, it must be interpreted by Judge Story and other commentators, and their interpretations enforced by the Judicial Department of Government. The knotty points in theology, especially the Headship question and the doctrine of the Trinity, having found a place in the Constitution, will all be cleared up in a *legal* way. The difficulties between Seceders and Covenanters and United Presbyterians will all be happily adjusted by those 'learned in the law.' Immorality will cease and iniquity will hide its head. Happy consummation!! Devoutly to be wished!!"
