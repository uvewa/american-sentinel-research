IN our March number we noticed the fact that certain Christians of Tennessee and Arkansas who keep the seventh-day, had been indicted for working on Sunday. We there stated that the indictments in Tennessee were quashed on technical grounds. They were afterward revived, however, and both there and in Arkansas these Christians were found guilty of working on Sunday and were fined. The cases were appealed to the Supreme Court of each State respectively, and just as we go to press we learn that both Supreme Courts have sustained the action of the lower Courts. The particulars of the Arkansas cases have not yet been learned; but there are three in Tennessee, who are each sentenced to a fine of $20 and costs, or to an imprisonment of one day for each 25 cents. As these men will not voluntarily aid an iniquitous cause, they will be compelled to lie in jail nearly three months for not keeping Sunday. And this is "Christian" America! "If they do these things in a green tree what will they do in the dry?" If these things are done in the present order of thing, what would not be done with a religious amendment to the Constitution of the Nation.
