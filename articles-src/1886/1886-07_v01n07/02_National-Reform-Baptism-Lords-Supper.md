IN the Canonsburg Woman's Christian Temperance Union National Reform Convention, Rev. D. S. Littell, of Cloakey, Pa., delivered an address on "The Relation of Civil Government to Christ," in which, says the report:—

> "He ably argued that it was the duty of civil government to enforce the will of Christ so far as that will has reference to the outward conduct of the individual. So far as that will pertains to the heart and inner feelings, it is the business of the Church to see to its enforcement, the Church and the State being Christ's two arms for carrying out his will."—*Christian Statesman June 3, 1886, p 7.*

Now baptism is an essential part of the outward conduct of the individual in performing the will of Christ. Therefore, according to this able argument, it is the duty of civil government to enforce baptism. Will these worthy missionaries be as generous in this matter as was their great prototype, Constantine, who gave a white garment and twenty pieces of gold to every convert? or will they employ the converting power of Charlemagne, and "wipe out" all who will not be so "Christianized."

Again the Lord's Supper is a part of the will of Christ that "has reference to the outward conduct of the individual." Therefore, it is the duty of the civil government to enforce the observance of the Lord's Supper! In this, will the National Reform hierarchy follow the example of its papal predecessors? If not, why not? If the success of Mr. Littell's "ably argued" doctrine would not be the union of Church and State, can anybody tell what would be such a union?
