THE "National Reform" people disclaim any design to persecute when they shall have secured their coveted Religious Amendment. "Persecution" is too harsh a word for their ears. Very well, let us come at the matter gradually. They cannot deny that if some form of religion is incorporated into the laws of the Government, those laws must enforce conformity to that form of religion. Now when some refuse to obey those laws and adopt that religion, what will the makers of the laws do? In harmony with the sentiments which we give most of them the credit of holding at present, they will at first use mild measures to induce the unwilling to obey. And if these measures do not succeed, what then? The laws must be enforced, and consequently more stringent measures must be adopted. And if some still refuse obedience, what then? Let Gibbon answer:—

> "It is incumbent on the authors of persecution previously to reflect whether they are determined to support it in the last extreme. They excite the flame which they strive to extinguish; and it soon becomes necessary to chastise the contumacy, as well as the crime, of the offender. The fine which he is unable or unwilling to discharge, exposes his person to the severities of the law; and his contempt of lighter penalties suggests the use and propriety of *capital punishment."—Decline and Fall,chap. 37, par. 23.*
