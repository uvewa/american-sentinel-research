# A National Reform Axiom

THE *Statesman* of August 25, 1881, said:—

> “The remedial dispensation in the hands of Jesus Christ is adapted to social as well as to individual maladies. To be a complete Saviour, he must be the Saviour of society as well as individual men, for social relations are an inseparable part of human nature. Unless he saves the family and the commonwealth, he does not save the race.”

We suppose the party which the *Statesman *represents will never get rid of the idea that the Government is an entity, something distinct from the people who compose it. If it should give up that absurdity, it would cease to exist. But if the Government is a personality, independent of the people, it logically follows that society is a personality in no wise connected with the people who compose it, and that the family is also a person entirely distinct from the individual members of the family. In the above quotation, the *Statesman* is consistent with its own peculiar absurdity. Now then, allowing its claim for the personality of the family, of society, and of the State, and allowing that Jesus Christ is the Saviour of these hypothetical persons, as well as of beings of flesh and blood, we reach the following logical absurdities: (1) The family may be saved and one or more members of it lost; (2) Any given society may be saved, yet any number of men composing it may be lost; or, (3) The commonwealth may be saved, and some of the citizens lost. And this being admitted, as it must be if the “National Reform” theory be I true, we conclude, (4) That any family, society, or State may be saved, and at the same time a majority or even all of the individuals composing that family, society, or State, may be lost! National Reform philosophy has evolved a new axiom, namely, “The whole is distinct from any of its parts.” This is, of course, not a self-evident *truth,* but a self-evident *absurdity,* and is, therefore, characteristic of National Reform. Truly, the beauty of the “National Reform” theory is the multiplicity of conclusions at which it allows one logically to arrive.
