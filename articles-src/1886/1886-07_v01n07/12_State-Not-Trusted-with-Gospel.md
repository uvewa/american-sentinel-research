THE State, as a political organization, has never been trusted by the Divine Founder of Christianity with the duty of its propagation. He never said to the State: "Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel," or "Lo! I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world." He said these things to his apostles, and to those who through them should believe on his name. The apostleship of his word he located in his disciples and followers, and not in kings, governors nor legislative assemblies. [56]
