"PROPERLY speaking, there is no such thing as 'religion of State? What we mean by that phrase is the religion of some individual or set of individuals, taught and enforced by the State. The State can have no religious opinions; and if it undertakes to enforce the teaching of such opinions, they must be the opinions of some natural person or class of persons."—*Supreme Court of Ohio.*
