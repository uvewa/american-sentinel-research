"THE powers that be are ordained of God," simply because they are existing powers, and God has ordained that men shall be subject to authority. Any government, even though it be very poor, and the ruler a base person, is better than no government at all. The first duty of the individual is to learn to obey. If he learns how to obey in the family and in the State, he can the more readily learn to obey God. Therefore it is that the man who resists authority resists God. But this by no means indicates that men should yield to the power when it makes laws that interfere with his duty to God; for then, instead of teaching its subjects obedience to God, it is teaching disobedience. Obedience to God cannot be learned by obedience to the State when the State openly teaches disobedience to God. In such a case disobedience (to the State) becomes a virtue. The less can never exceed the greater, therefore the "Higher Power" has the first claim on a man's allegiance.
