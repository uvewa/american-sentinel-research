The student of human nature must needs meet with many perplexities, for there are so many phases of the workings of the human mind that it seems almost impossible to account for them all, or even to classify them. It is a standing matter of surprise that educated men, of fair intelligence, will become so addicted to riding a hobby that they cannot see their own inconsistency, though it may be apparent to others; or discover any force in the most tangible proofs, if they do not harmonize with their own pet theories. And a more persistent set of hobby riders cannot be found than the advocates of the Religious Amendment of our National Constitution, who style themselves "National Reformers."

In a late number of the *Christian Statesman, *one of its regular correspondents, "the Rev. M. A. Gault," quotes from the American Sentinel the following words:—

> "The National Reform Party proposes to make Christ king of the United States, and yet they maintain that the Government must still remain a Republic. Will the *Christian Statesman,* or some other advocate of this reform, tell us how this thing can be?"

And then he proceeds to comment on this query, which comment we propose to notice. He says:—

> "If you would study your Bible more before you spring into the arena to champion the anti-National Reform cause, you would know that the model of Government which Christ gave to Israel was much more republican than that of the United States. All their rulers were elected by the people, while there are one hundred thousand of ours in whose election the people have no choice."

It is a custom with this class of people, when they are not able to render a reason, to insinuate or openly declare that their opponents are ignorant, and have never studied the Bible. But one thing is noticeable, that while they make many assertions concerning the "republic of Israel," the election of its officers, etc., and continue to accuse their opponents of ignorance, prejudice, and a failure to study their Bibles, they studiously ignore all our requests to give *the proofs* to sustain their assertions. We have made tangible statements concerning Moses, Saul, David, Nehemiah, and others, setting forth facts which utterly demolish the claims of the "reformers;" and while they pass by these statements without a notice, people will soon learn what estimate to put upon their sneers and accusations of ignorance. It is time that they began to give some evidence that they themselves are not lamentably ignorant. Moses, Aaron, Joshua, Samuel, Saul, David, and through the latter a whole line of kings, were all chosen of God without even the knowledge of the people. Will "the Rev. M. A. Gault" soon comply with our reiterated request to point out some of the rulers of Israel who were elected by the people? He says: "All their rulers were elected by the people." We only ask him to name a few. And we shall be indebted to him if he will point out the circumstances of some of these elections, and tell us if there were opposing candidates! We shall anxiously wait for information on these points.

His knowledge of Government in the abstract must be quite limited, judging from his use of terms. "All their *rulers* were elected by the people, while there are one hundred thousand of ours [rulers] in whose election the people have no choice." If the people have no choice in their election, by whom are they elected? His confusion of language is probably owing to the fact that he does not apprehend the difference between election and appointment. Our executives have the power to appoint certain officers (not rulers); but the people make the laws giving the executives that power, and then elect the executives who may exercise that power. Will Mr. Gault, or any of his co-laborers, point out a parallel to this in their hypothetical "republic of Israel"? This statement concerning the election of one hundred thousand of our rulers is more than erroneous—it is positively foolish. One charge that our model reformers make against our Government is, that the will of the people is the supreme authority. But, lo, we are now informed that the power of the people in this nation is not so extensive and complete as it was in their model "republic of Israel." How will they reconcile their statements? They may indeed drown the voice of their opponents by crying, "Great is Diana, of the Ephesians." This will be as pertinent as any answer they have yet attempted to give.

Mr. Gault says:—

> "You complain that the *Christian Statesman *does not notice your opposition. It is because your arguments have not touched the real questions at issue."

But while so many readers differ with you, would it not be well to notice them enough *to prove* that they have not reached the questions at issue? If we have not touched the real issues, you could easily show our failure. Why not try it, and let the readers of the *Statesman *judge for themselves? Perhaps your readers are all of that class who will take all your statements for granted, without asking for proof; but we doubt it. [90]

What are the real questions at issue, and where may they be found? Arc they contained in your platform of principles, in the speeches made in your conventions, and in the editorials and communications in the *Statesman? *These we have noticed, and at considerable length. If we have not touched the real questions at issue, it is because your party has studiously concealed them. We have pointed out the unavoidable consequences to follow the legal enforcement of the usages of Christianity; the tendency of their demands that religious tests shall be made qualifications for office, and that the First Amendment of the Constitution shall be repealed. We have even gone so far as to notice at some length the statement of "the Rev. M. A. Gault" himself, that it may cost us another war to blot infidelity out of our Constitution! And all this, he dares to assert, does not touch the real questions at issue. We can but repeat the question at the head of this article—Is it blindness or duplicity?

Now if, in their platform, their speeches, and their publications, we have failed to find the "questions at issue," then we ask him to frankly state some of these questions, and we promise to promptly notice them.

But again he says:—

> "It may be exhilarating for the editor of the Sentinel to stand on his head and turn handsprings before the public upon so serious and important a question; but as his true friend we beg of him, we implore him, to keep out from under the wheels of the National Reform movement."

Now that sounds better, and is much more consistent than what he said before. True, his figures are rather low and unseemly, but his exhortation is pathetic and touching! We advise him to hereafter confine himself to exhortation altogether. As an expositor of the Bible he has proved himself a sad failure. His references to history are a series of blunders. Only in exhortation does he seem to have any chance of success. Yet even in this line it may be well for him to direct his efforts to those who have not studied the subject of "National Reform" as we have, and who have not yet so fully discovered its fallacies.

We are far from being convinced that there is any danger in getting "under the wheels of the National Reform *movement."* In that stage it is not dangerous. But if they ever get the power they covet, to control this Government, and through it to enforce by law their theories of religion, to the exclusion of those of others who are as honest, as conscientious, as well versed in Scripture, and every way as worthy as they, then we may well fear, for somebody will surely be crushed under the wheels of their modern Juggernaut.
