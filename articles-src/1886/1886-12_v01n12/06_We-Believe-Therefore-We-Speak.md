# We Believe, Therefore We Speak

A subscriber addresses us as follows:—

> “I like your paper very much, and think the demand for just such a paper is very urgent. But I see that in all of your papers you write as though Jesus Christ was a real character, and the Bible all truth. . . . Go to the bottom, and then tell us if you do not think that all the gods, devils, etc., were made by man.”

In answer to this, we can only say that in all our papers we have written just what we believe,—that Jesus Christ is a real character and that the Bible is all true. We do not say that we have gone to the bottom, but we do say that we have gone far enough to be perfectly assured that *all* gods, devils, etc., were not made by man. We are certain that God made man and all things that are, except the devil and his works. Lucifer made himself a devil: God made him a cherub. It is because we so firmly believe the reality of Christ and of God, and the truth of the Scriptures, that we write as we do in opposition to the National Reform movement. God and Christ command us to keep the commandments of God. That, we propose ever to do, but the National Reform party proposes to compel us, and all other people in the United States, to keep that which is not a command of God at all. Christ directs us to “Render to Cesar that which is Cesar’s, and unto God that which is God’s.” But the National Reform party proposes to compel all people in the United States to render to Cesar not only that which is Cesar’s, but also to render to Cesar that which is God’s. Christ said: “All things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them.” The practice of the National Reform party is, Whatsoever ye would *not* that men should do to you, do ye *that* to them. Therefore respect to God, to Christ, and the Bible; and the defense of the rights of those who wish to respect these and the natural rights of man—these are the principles upon which the American Sentinel is founded, and in accordance with which it is conducted. We are only happy that in all our papers our readers can discern that God and Christ are written of as real persons, and the Bible as true.

Cotton Mather said: “New England being a country whose interests are remarkably in-wrapped in ecclesiastical circumstances, ministers ought to concern themselves in politics;” and among the fruits of it there was the Salem witchcraft executions. And says Bancroft: “The power of the ministers over the magistrates, having now no effect but to narrow and restrain, reposed no longer on the energy of religion, but on superstitious veneration. It is the beauty of truth that nothing can rest upon it but justice. The ministers, desirous of unjust influence, could build their hope of it only on error; and the struggle for greater freedom of mind—the struggle against superstition, and against the slavish interpretation of the Bible —was one with the struggle against their dominion in the State. . . And to the ministers, in their self-righteousness, it never occurred that vanity and love of power had blinded their judgment.”—*History of the United States, chap. 30, par. 14, 15.* [96]

Note.—No papers are sent by the publishers of the American Sentinel to people who have not subscribed for it. If the Sentinel comes to one who has not subscribed for it, he may know that it is sent him by some friend, and that he will not be called upon by the publishers to pay for the same.

Having won the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union, the National Reformers are now courting the Salvation Army.

We would again call attention to the fact that the Sentinel is stereotyped, thus enabling us to furnish back numbers in any desired quantity. Already several editions have been printed of some of the numbers.

By the evidence which we present in this number of the Sentinel, it is apparent that the National Reform movement is nothing else than a new Papacy; therefore, there is now an urgent demand for the vigorous revival of true Protestantism. The Sentinel earnestly hopes to continue its protestations.

Massachusetts has fallen into line with Arkansas and Tennessee in the work of persecution, and certain men in Worcester are to be tried for working on Sunday, after having conscientiously observed the seventh day—Saturday—as the Sabbath. Massachusetts has not a very enviable character in the matter of persecution. It was from Massachusetts that Roger Williams and others—women too—were banished; it was in Massachusetts that the Baptists were whipped; it was in Massachusetts that Quakers, and women at that, were hanged —on Boston Common; it was in Massachusetts that women were hanged as witches; it was in Massachusetts, and only last year, that a man was fined and imprisoned for publicly reading the Scriptures. With such a record it would be a wonder indeed if Massachusetts were less willing than any other State to persecute people for worshiping God according to the dictates of their own consciences.
