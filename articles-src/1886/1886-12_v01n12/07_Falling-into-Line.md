# Falling into Line

We stated some time ago that the church of the United Brethren had put a National Reform preacher into the field, and would support him. Bishop Dixon, of that church, is a Vice-President of the National Reform Association. The Bishop was lately holding some conferences out in Ohio, and District Secretary Rev. R. C. Wylie visited the Conferences in the interests of the National Reform revolution. He says the Bishop presented him to the Conference, and during a lull in business called upon him to occupy the time. Then the Committee on Resolutions presented the following:—

> *“Resolved,* That we are in sympathy and hearty accord with the National Reform Association, and that we bid the Rev. Mr. Wylie, their agent in this region, Godspeed, and shall pray God’s blessing upon him and his work.”

All this was at Stryker. From there Mr. Wylie went to Delphos to attend another Conference of the same church. There again the Bishop introduced him to the Conference, and gave him time to speak for National Reform. Here, too, a resolution of thanks was passed, by “a hearty vote.”

From Delphos Mr. Wylie went to the General Conference of the Free Methodist Church, held at Coopersville, Michigan. The senior Superintendent, B. T. Roberts (the superintendents in the Free Methodist Church correspond to the bishops in the other churches), introduced the subject of National Reform to the Conference, and an hour was set apart for Mr. Wylie to speak. His address “was greeted with many hearty Amens.’” At the conclusion of his remarks, Mr. Wylie says: “Superintendent Roberts replied, assuring me of his own sympathy with our aims, and also of the hearty co-operation of the Free Methodist Church in our endeavors. . . . And all the people said, Amen.’” The “Committee on Reforms” in its report, said: “We recognize the objects and aims of the National Reform Association, and will labor and pray for its success.”

By all this, it is quite manifest that the United Brethren Church, and the Free Methodist Church, may well be counted as pledged to National Reform—that is, to revolution and Romanism. And “Secretary” Leiper says that the “nods and amens a National Reformer gets in a Methodist [Episcopal] meeting help him wonderfully.” Yet we believe that when the people of those churches understand that National Reform is only a scheme to deliver them into the hands of Rome, the National Reformers will not find it so easy to make the delivery, as it now appears.
