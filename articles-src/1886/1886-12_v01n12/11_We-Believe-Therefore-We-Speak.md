A subscriber addresses us as follows:—

> "I like your paper very much, and think the demand for just such a paper is very urgent. But I see that in all of your papers you write as though Jesus Christ was a real character, and the Bible all truth. . . . Go to the bottom, and then tell us if you do not think that all the gods, devils, etc., were made by man."

In answer to this, we can only say that in all our papers we have written just what we believe,—that Jesus Christ is a real character and that the Bible is all true. We do not say that we have gone to the bottom, but we do say that we have gone far enough to be perfectly assured that *all* gods, devils, etc., were not made by man. We are certain that God made man and all things that are, except the devil and his works. Lucifer made himself a devil: God made him a cherub. It is because we so firmly believe the reality of Christ and of God, and the truth of the Scriptures, that we write as we do in opposition to the National Reform movement. God and Christ command us to keep the commandments of God. That, we propose ever to do, but the National Reform party proposes to compel us, and all other people in the United States, to keep that which is not a command of God at all. Christ directs us to "Render to Cesar that which is Cesar's, and unto God that which is God's." But the National Reform party proposes to compel all people in the United States to render to Cesar not only that which is Cesar's, but also to render to Cesar that which is God's. Christ said: "All things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them." The practice of the National Reform party is, Whatsoever ye would *not* that men should do to you, do ye *that* to them. Therefore respect to God, to Christ, and the Bible; and the defense of the rights of those who wish to respect these and the natural rights of man—these are the principles upon which the American Sentinel is founded, and in accordance with which it is conducted. We are only happy that in all our papers our readers can discern that God and Christ are written of as real persons, and the Bible as true.
