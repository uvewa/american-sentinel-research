The Ministers' Association of Des Moines, Iowa, lately passed some resolutions against National Reform, one of which reads thus:—

> *"Resolved,* That the National Reform Association is an attempt to accomplish by revolution the Christianizing of the nation, and therefore meets our disapproval."

Commenting on this, Rev. M. A. Gault says:—

> "Whether the Constitution will be set right on the question of the moral supremacy of God's law in Government without bloody revolution, will depend entirely upon the strength and resistance of the forces of anti-Christ."

What kind of a Christianity can that be which proposes to accomplish its purposes by a "bloody revolution"? Yet such is the style of "Christianity" that is represented in the National Reform Association. Mr. Gault says that Dr. Emory Miller, of the Centenary M. E. Church, of Des Moines, "expressed his emphatic condemnation of the whole movement, saying that he had given it careful study, and his convictions were based upon mature investigation." Dr. Miller certainly does well, and so would everybody else, to condemn the whole movement. In fact, as that movement boldly contemplates the alternative of a "bloody revolution," it is difficult to see how it can be understandingly indorsed or supported by anybody but a bloody revolutionist.
