Massachusetts has fallen into line with Arkansas and Tennessee in the work of persecution, and certain men in Worcester are to be tried for working on Sunday, after having conscientiously observed the seventh day—Saturday—as the Sabbath. Massachusetts has not a very enviable character in the matter of persecution. It was from Massachusetts that Roger Williams and others—women too—were banished; it was in Massachusetts that the Baptists were whipped; it was in Massachusetts that Quakers, and women at that, were hanged —on Boston Common; it was in Massachusetts that women were hanged as witches; it was in Massachusetts, and only last year, that a man was fined and imprisoned for publicly reading the Scriptures. With such a record it would be a wonder indeed if Massachusetts were less willing than any other State to persecute people for worshiping God according to the dictates of their own consciences.
