# The “Sentinel”

With this number, the American Sentinel completes its first year of publication. We are gratified with the reception that has been given it by the people of the nation, more than 136,000 copies having been circulated. The cause to which it is devoted is a most important one. It is a cause which vitally affects every person in the whole nation. The principles upon which the Sentinel stands, and which it defends, are the principles for the defense of which our Fathers pledged their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor. The cause grows more important as the days go by. The National Reform movement is constantly and rapidly gaining favor in* all parts of the country, and the facts presented in this paper show that the danger is great and imminent; yet the American Sentinel is the only paper in the country that is devoted to the analysis of that movement, and to exposing the danger that lies in it. We know there are thousands of people who need but to be shown the true meaning of National Reform, to cast it off utterly. And as it vitally concerns the civil and religious liberty of every person, it is important that every person shall know of it, therefore it is important that every person should have the opportunity to read the Sentinel.

Therefore to every person who is, or becomes, acquainted with the Sentinel, we extend an earnest invitation to help us in extending its circulation. With this issue a large number of subscriptions expire. Please renew for yourself, send it to your friends, and ask your neighbors to subscribe. For terms to agents, and in clubs, see previous page. You need the paper. It is for you, not for us, that the matter is written and printed. We have just now begun to get into the real merit of the discussion, and it shall still be our endeavor to make every number tell for truth, right, justice, and liberty. We do not want to remove your name from our list, and to prevent possibility of the loss of any numbers, and of mistake in dropping and taking up your name, please look at the yellow tab on your paper, and if your subscription expires with this number and volume, please renew at once. The number for January, 1887, will go to press about December 27. Be sure to have your letter of renewal here, with all the new subscribers you can obtain, by that time. We hope to see more than 250,000 copies circulated in 1887; and we shall see it, if you will help us.
