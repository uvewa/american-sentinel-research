It is an old saying, that an open confession is good for the soul. In the Christian Statesman of Jan. 8, 1885, we find one that is most excellent. Rev. J. M. Armour, a zealous National Reformer, after telling how a certain man had expressed to him the hope that the National Reform movement may succeed, utters the following sentence, which we quote verbatim et literatim, italics and all:—

> "As I left him, I felt deeply that our movement was literally following in the footsteps of that monarch of old, of whom it is so often said that he 'sinned and made Israel to sin.'"

That is good. Indeed it would be impossible to more fitly describe the nature of the National Reform movement. And yet we cannot help thinking it a queer confession to come from one who is so wedded to that movement as is Mr. Armour. We rather incline to the opinion that he intended to pay a compliment to National Reform. But be that as it may, he states the exact truth.
