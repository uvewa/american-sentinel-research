# No Power but of God

This is the declaration of the Apostle Paul concerning earthly Governments. Some have been troubled to reconcile what he says of the ruler, that “he beareth not the sword in vain,” with the words of Christ concerning non-resistance, and also with his own words in another place in his letter to the Romans, that we shall not avenge ourselves, because vengeance belongs to the Lord, and he will repay. This latter declaration and the words of Christ in his “Sermon on the Mount” have been urged against inflicting penalties for crimes. A certain class of self-styled philanthropists assure us that he who commits a crime only proves himself an object of pity, and it is our duty to imitate the benevolence of God, who “maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.” The infliction of penalties (they say) is vindictive, and contrary to the spirit of Christ, who commanded to resist not evil.

But we think the trouble of those who cannot harmonize the scriptures noticed, is quite needless. And they entirely misapprehend the character of God and the nature of his Government, who seek to draw therefrom an argument against the infliction of penalties. The Apostle Peter indeed says that God is long-suffering, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance. But that does not destroy the fact that the day of Judgment and perdition of ungodly men will certainly come.

Blackstone well says that the strength of a law is in its penalty. Indeed, there can be no law without a penalty. It is the penalty which divides between *law* and *advice,* for a rule is only *enforced* by a penalty, and that counsel which cannot be enforced is only advisory—not peremptory. Hence to enact laws with no penalties would be only a farce; and to enact laws with penalties, and never execute them, would also be a farce. Practically the result would be the same—there would be no law.

And it is also true—evidently true—that in the absence of law there can be no Government. Where no law is, sin cannot be imputed, and virtue cannot be defined; there can be no transgression, no obedience, no measurement of right and wrong. Every one is then left free to do that which is right in his own eyes, restrained only by the fear of him who may be stronger and more desperate than himself.

But the question is raised: Do you believe that wicked Governments are of God? We reply that God is the Author of Government, as he is the Creator of man. There is no man who cannot trace his origin to the hand of God; and there is no Government which has not its basis in the order which God has established. Man has “sought out many inventions,” and lost his uprightness; but he is still to be regarded as the creature of God, endowed by his Creator with noble powers and great privileges. And so of Governments; they may abuse their power, and pervert justice—but that power originates in God and in his ordinance. And thus Jesus answered Pilate: “Thou couldest have no power at all against me, except it were given thee from above.”

A Government that is measurably wicked is better than none at all. Rule, even when unnecessarily stern and severe, is better than disorder and confusion. While tyranny oppresses, anarchy destroys. Where Government exists, where order is enforced, some rights will be secured. But where anarchy and confusion reign, there no rights are secure. Society, in any proper sense, cannot exist. Therefore without Government, without a conservation of rights, whatever the aspirations of man may be, he cannot rise above a state of barbarism. But “God is not the author of confusion.” Who would not thank and adore him that he has ordained Governments upon the earth, and that he upholds them by his providence and by the authority of his word?

Paul thus describes the power of the Governor: “But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain; for he is the minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil.” Many take the view that when Christ came he entirely changed the order which had theretofore existed, and in his Sermon on the Mount destroyed the power of civil Government. But the words of Paul here quoted disprove this. And his words here coincide with other expressions in the New Testament.

How, then, is the apparent discrepancy of the texts to be reconciled? In this manner: In the Sermon on the Mount Christ was speaking to his disciples—to his church. Paul, in Rom. 13, was speaking, not of the church, but of civil Government. If Matt. 5:38-40, Rom. 12:19, and 13:1-4 had been spoken to and of the same class, we cannot see how they could be harmonized; a contradiction would seem to be unavoidable.

And the conclusion is now unavoidable that in these scriptures the church and civil Government are separated, never to be united. The Government is to execute vengeance, wrath, or justice upon evil-doers; the church is not. The highest office borne by the apostles of Christ was that of ambassadors; 2 Cor. 5:19, 20. [6] The civil Governor was an executive officer. The two were not united. In the Scriptures they are kept separate. But in the days of Constantine the two began to be united; the bishop of Rome was made a civil magistrate. And his power as a magistrate was increased because he was the bishop of the church. Soon he laid aside his commission as an ambassador of reconciliation, and history attests that he did not bear the sword in vain! And when the sword of power was united with the office of a Christian bishop, then began the “dark ages” of the church. Thenceforth the church, presided over by bishops holding the sword of civil power, became a harlot “drunken with the blood of the saints.”

Look to all history and see the effect of uniting the civil and Christian elements in Governments. Look at Rome; look at Constantinople, now the Greek Church; look at Spain, at Austria, at Mexico, at South America, where the civil authority is subordinated to or amalgamated with the ecclesiastical. England stands highest in the list of “Established Churches,” but behold the traffic in sacred orders; the “livings” possessed by profligate clergymen, sold to men in no manner qualified to fill the office. Such abuses could not exist were not the nation made a professedly “Christian nation” by uniting religion with the secular power. And, to come nearer to our homes, yes, to our very homes, look at Utah! This foul blot in our favored nation shows what is *possible,* and nearly what has always been actual, when the civil power is subordinated to the ecclesiastical; when the faith and practice of the church is enforced by civil authority.

For the sake of our national honor; for the sake of religion; for the sake of the liberty of conscience which we have hitherto enjoyed under our Constitution; for the sake of the purity of the churches, we hope and pray that our Government will not be turned into a *religious machine* to turn out machine-made Christians! We hope that the Christian religion will never be placed on a “legal basis in the Constitution of the United States. And we hope the American people will be warned, and resolve to frustrate the purpose of those religious zealots who demand that *“Congress shall establish a standard of religion.”* And we promise to do our utmost to sound the alarm—to warn the people of the danger which is coming to our homes. If “pure religion and undefiled” could be advanced by civil legislation; if men could be made Christians by vote, we would gladly join the “Religious Amendment Party;” but when the opposite is certain to be the effect of such action, we cannot refrain from raising our voices in an earnest protest against the union of the churches with the civil power.

If the struggle be between Christianity and infidelity, we take the side of Christianity. If between a Christian and an infidel, we stop and inquire into the cause. If the Christian is endeavoring to deprive the infidel of his rights, we will ignore his profession and defend the infidel. *True* Christianity robs no one of his rights, but its followers do to others as they would that others should do to them.J. H. W.
