# No Christianity by Law

The following sensible remarks we find in the *Pacific,* the Congregational paper of San Francisco:—

> “A circular of the ‘National Reform Association’ has fallen into our hands, and calls for a brief notice. We assent to its ‘fundamentals,’ viz.: ‘That Almighty God is the source of all power and authority in civil government, that the Lord Jesus Christ is the ruler of nations, and that the revealed will of God is of supreme authority in civil affairs.’ We share in its regrets over the many ‘persevering attempts which are made to prohibit the reading of the Bible in our public schools, to overthrow our Sabbath laws, to abolish the oath, prayer in our National and State Legislatures, days of fasting and thanksgiving and other Christian features of our institutions, and so to divorce the American Government from all connection with the Christian religion.’ But we are not satisfied that it would be, on the whole, the best thing (even if it could be brought about with very little effort) to insert a clause in the United States Constitution, as an amendment, containing ‘explicit evidence of the Christian character and purpose of the nation.’ We heartily desire ‘to make this nation, consistently, and in the fullest sense, a Christian nation,’ and all our labors are in that direction. But the nation will not be made such by any sort of an amendment to the Constitution; and when it has become such, there will be scarcely any need of such an amendment. If our spirit and conduct be Christian, any public declaration will not make the fact any more certain, will scarcely magnify it and will hardly make it more influential.”
