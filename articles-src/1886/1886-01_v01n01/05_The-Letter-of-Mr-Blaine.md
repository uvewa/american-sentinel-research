# The Letter of Mr. Blaine

On this question Hon. J. G. Blaine struck the keynote in his letter of acceptance of the nomination for the presidency. He said:—

> “Religious liberty is the right of every citizen in the republic. Congress is forbidden by the Constitution to make any law respecting the establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof. For a century under this guarantee, Protestant and Catholic, Jew and Gentile, have worshiped God according to the dictates of conscience. But religious liberty must not be perverted to the justification of offenses against the law. A religious sect, strongly entrenched in one of the Territories of the Union and spreading rapidly into four other Territories, claims the right to destroy the great safeguard and monument of social order and to practice as a religious privilege a crime punished with a severe penalty in every State in the Union. The sacredness and unity of the family must be preserved, as the foundation of all civil governments, as the source of orderly administration, as the surest guarantee of moral purity.”

Mr. Blaine makes a just distinction between “a religious privilege” and “a crime.” Let the reader turn again to the words of Professor Blanchard and he will see that the Professor leaves no room whatever for a distinction between *religion* and *crime!* Now if the First Amendment of the Constitution read thus: “Congress shall make no law for the suppression of crime, or restraining from the free indulgence therein,” then the remarks of Professor Blanchard would contain a pertinent argument. According to the strange method of reasoning adopted by these “reformers,” that section of the Constitution of the United States which forbids restraints upon religion, may be turned against every sentence in that instrument which refers to the punishment of crime. This is a discovery which no jurist would ever have made; and one which no jurist will ever recognize with respect.

It was a just remark of Hr. Watts in saying: “In a proper sense, virtue signifies duty toward man, and religion duty toward God.” *Virtue* is here used as the synonym of morality, which is thus defined by Worcester: “Moral goodness; ... uprightness; morality;—the opposite of vice.” If this be true—and who can deny it—then vice may be restrained or punished, and religion be left free.

But there was one sentence in Mr. Blaine’s letter which was not properly guarded. It is as follows: “Like others, the Mormons must learn that the liberty of the individual ceases where the rights of society begin.” Rights never come in conflict. Governments are for the preservation—not for the deprivation—of rights, as our “immortal Declaration” affirms. It truthfully says that “life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness” are unalienable rights; unalienable except by crime, for *crime has no rights.* A criminal may deprive himself of all rights, even of the right to life itself, in which all other rights are couched. The rights of society do not conflict with the liberty of the individual, or, the liberty of the individual does not cease where the rights of society begin. The liberty of the individual only ceases when the rights of society *are invaded.*

And in this we refer only to civil rights, for religious rights are not alienated even by crime, except with the alienation of life itself. By what we have already said our readers will understand that we here refer to rights which are truly religious; not to the practices of immorality or vice under the guise of religion, for no such right exists. It cannot exist unless crime has rights, which we again affirm it has not. But even criminals have religious rights with which man may not interfere. As long as God offers pardon to the penitent, so long has the penitent a right to the privileges of religion, without regard to his condition or his attitude toward society. We believe it is quite possible for a man to “sin away his day of grace;” to so sin as to forfeit the privilege or blessing of forgiveness. We find this in the teachings of Christ and of Paul. But it is not the prerogative of man to determine when the grace of God is withdrawn from the incorrigible. As long as any one desires to call upon God, and to seek his favor through those means which he has provided, no man, no class, no multitude of men, may restrain him or deprive him of the privilege. Nor shall they dictate to him how or in what manner he shall worship God, or seek his grace. The right to the free exercise of religion is beyond human control. It is a matter exclusively between the individual and his Maker—just where our Constitution has properly placed it in our favored nation.

But this is not all. As religion is not rightfully subject to human restraint or control, so it is not a matter of compulsion. Man has no right to say that his fellow-man *shall* or *shall not* be religious. If he chooses to be religious he may be, in spite of man or of circumstances. If he does not choose to be religious, no man may say he shall. Again, if he chooses to be religious, no man or class of men shall say what religion he shall practice; whether Catholic or Protestant, Christian or Mohammedan; it is by right a matter solely of his own choice, not of dictation.

These are all undeniable truths; undeniable except as human rights are denied and trampled under foot. And yet, every truth which we have herein presented is actually denied by the “Religious Amendment Party;” for if these truths, and the rights to which they refer, were properly regarded, no Religious Amendment would be asked for or desired. It is to control these rights, and confine them within a certain channel, that the Amendment is sought for. If they deny this, we have only to point to their own “platform”—to their public avowals—in which they declare that their intention is to place the laws, usages, and institutions of the Christian religion on an undeniable legal [4] basis. And this is nothing but to make the Christian religion a matter of legal control. As far as they do deny their object to restrain the liberty of conscience in religious matters, so far they are guilty of evasion—of endeavoring to conceal their real intention. And this ought to put on his guard every American citizen, every lover of his country and its blood-bought privileges of civil and religious liberty.

The Amendment Association declared in the most positive terms that polygamy could not be dealt with unless our Constitution were amended. The Government is commendably proving that it can. They have said, and reiterated their saying, that no action against polygamy can stand before the Supreme Court under our Constitution. But events prove that it can. To be consistent, these Amendment seekers ought to join with the Mormons in declaring that the action of the Government is unconstitutional; that the polygamists are being illegally restrained of their liberty! For such is exactly their position in regard to the decisions of the courts in the cases of polygamists. And such are their views of Constitutional and religious rights! What a figure one of them would cut before the Supreme Court in expounding our Constitution! But, fortunately, crime is called crime, vice is regarded as vice, by our Courts, and their labored efforts sink into insignificance before judicial decisions.

It is the shame of America that the foul blot of polygamy has so long been suffered to exist, to prosper, and to bear undisputed sway over so large a portion of the public domain. Blood and treasure were expended without stint to rescue the colored people from their down trodden condition. And yet our nation is so slow to learn wisdom. The public arm has scarcely been raised to rescue the women of a considerable portion of America from a degradation as vile, as abhorrent as ever cursed any people or any race. It is the greatest abomination of the age. It was a prominent part of the indictment found against slavery, that it made possible the subjection of a certain class—mark, only a certain class—of womankind in a part of the country, to the shame of prostitution, or to a denial of the rights of marriage. But Mormonism not only makes *possible,* but it makes *obligatory* the prostitution, or the subversion of the marriage rights, not of *a certain class* but of *all classes* of women within the reach of its power. And this not by lax civil legislation, but by the most stringent compulsion of *church laws,* to refuse obedience to which is made *the highest crime,* which subjects the refuser to the severest civil penalties, and to social and religious disabilities. American slavery was never so pernicious as a perverter of the public conscience and a destroyer of general morality, as American polygamy. We say “American polygamy,” for we have strong doubts whether such an abomination would be permitted to flourish in any other civilized nation, as it has flourished here.

We think we have fully exposed the fallacy of the “Amendment Party’s” argument in which they, in the face of all authority, confound crime with religion. Now the question will arise, What will you do with the Mormon claim that the Bible teaches them to practice polygamy? First we must say that that question does not come between us and the Religious Reform Association. If the Bible were declared the supreme law of the land, the Bible argument on polygamy would have yet to be settled, just as it has now. If this Association has not foreseen this, they are blind indeed. If they have seen it, we have never learned it from any of their utterances. But, secondly, we deny the claim of the Mormons in this respect. But as this paper is already longer than we intended, we must reserve that subject for another number. The importance of the question must be our excuse for making this article so long; and much yet remains to be said. J. H. W.
