# Is It Blindness?

George P. Hays, D. D., president of a college in Pennsylvania, delivered an address at the National Convention of the Religious Amendment Association in Pittsburg, in February, 1874. The reporter said his speech “was received with frequent marks of approbation, and his witty points drew forth shouts of laughter.” We can testify that this was the case. We shall have use for some of his points hereafter. For the present we only notice his argument against neutrality in regard to the subject of the Amendment. He said:—

> “To attempt neutrality by a nation that has crimes to punish, and rights of property to decide, is equally impossible and can only issue in practical but utter atheism.”

That there is any relation between laws for the punishment of crime and the protection of property, and a Religious Amendment to our Constitution which would unite religion and the State, it will take more than a witty man to show. If this was not the intention of the argument, then we would like to know why these ideas were thus coupled together in the address. And can anybody be saved from atheism by an amendment of our National Constitution? If we could only have an amendment of the Constitution which would secure some people against imbecility, it would be well worth striving for.

Well Put.—The Champlain Journal, speaking of the proposed Religious Amendment of the Constitution, made the following just remarks:

> “However slight, it is the first move for a union of Church and State. If we may cut off ever so few persons from the right of citizenship on account of difference of religious belief, then with equal justice and propriety may a majority at any time dictate the adoption of still further articles of belief, until our Constitution is but the text-book of a sect beneath whose tyrannical sway all liberty of religious opinion will be crushed.”

At first it appeared “slight,” because its advocates so stoutly denied their object of erecting in the Constitution “a standard of religion” to which all must conform. But from their later avowals Church and State stand out in bold relief in their intentions. [9]
