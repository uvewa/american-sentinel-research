# Too Plain to Be Denied

In the National Convention of the Reform Party, in 1874, President Brunot said they had no intention to disturb that provision of our Constitution which forbids any religious test as a qualification for office. Yet in 1875, the Christian Statesman, speaking of certain congressmen who traveled on Sunday on their way to Washington, said:—

> “Not one of those men who thus violated the Sabbath is fit to hold official position in a Christian nation. … Give us in the National Constitution, the simple acknowledgment of the law of God as the supreme law of nations, and all the results indicated in this note will ultimately be secured.”

Waiving the “quantum of the sin” involved, we would like to know how a “Christian nation” can make a person ineligible to office on such a ground, and yet not disturb the aforesaid provision of the Constitution? The truth is, that such a Religious Amendment as that for which they call would require the entire remodeling of our Government, to make it conform to the demands of the churches. And this that party knows, and their efforts are put forth with a full knowledge of that fact in view. Are the American people prepared for this? Can they be persuaded to it?
