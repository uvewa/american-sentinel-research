# A “Non Sequitur”

In the address of Dr. Hays, in the Pittsburg Convention, speaking of the State Constitutional Convention, he said:—

> “Would it have been out of place for them to have said, The Bible is for this State the standard of morality, and on all subjects concerning which the State takes action, it is to be the guide?”

But Dr. Hays knew perfectly well that a moral amendment is not what they ask. Their declaration is for a religious amendment. They avow their intention to put the usages, institutions, and laws of Christianity on a legal basis. Is it possible that there are Doctors of Divinity in our land who are so ignorant of principles as to confound Christian institutions with moral laws? And if the Bible is to be the standard of civil legislation, whose construction of the Bible shall be adopted? Would not such a declaration as Dr. Hays suggested, and such an amendment as this Association seeks, lead to endless religious disputes in our legislatures and in Congress? And will this increase general respect for the Bible, and tend to purify the religious atmosphere of our country? Just the reverse, we firmly believe. When a candidate’s religious position is to be canvassed in party caucuses, and political demagogues, because they have wired themselves into office, have to settle questions on the Bible, then we may write “Ichabod” on our churches and on the popular religion. Heaven save us from that day!
