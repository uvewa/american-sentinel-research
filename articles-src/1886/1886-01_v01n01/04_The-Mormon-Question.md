# The Mormon Question

We are quite well aware that the objector to our position will refer to the case of the Mormons, and aver that our doctrine would uphold all the abominations of the Utah polygamists. Having viewed our ground carefully, we do not fear to meet the issue on that question, firmly believing that the “Amendment party” are utterly at fault in their pretended arguments on this subject.

> “They who have the truth can afford to be fair.” Wherever we find men or parties resorting to concealments or evasions, we may be assured that they are serving the cause of error. There are two ways of deceiving: One is by telling that which is false; the other by concealing or perverting that which is true. The latter is the most difficult to detect and correct, and therefore it is really the most dangerous.

It is cause for wonder that the Mormon question, in its relation to religion and morality, is not better understood. It must be accounted for, we think, by the fact that the subject of morality itself is not understood. And nobody in the land is more greatly responsible for the confusion that exists on the subject of religion and morality, in their distinctions and relations, than the “National Reform Association.”

They say that the amendment to our Constitution, which they seek, is imperatively demanded in order that the evil of Mormon polygamy may be repressed. To show that we are not speaking at random in this matter, we will further quote from the speech of Prof. C. A. Blanchard, made in the Fifth National Convention of the National Reform Association, held in Pittsburg, Pa., February 4, 5, 1874:—

> “The Constitution declares that Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, and also that no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States. These statements are very general. No law may be made prohibiting the free exercise of religion. But who is to decide what is religion? The citizens, of course, for Congress may make no law respecting an establishment of religion. Every man may choose his religion or make a new one, and Congress may not prohibit its free exercise. Tartar, Confucian, and Hindoo, may bring their gods many and lords many. The Moslem minaret may shine in the setting sun from every hill. Every graveyard becomes a temple for celestial worshipers of the dead. … We cannot say, as a nation, that they do not have good religions, for we must pass no act respecting the establishment of religion.

We cannot forbid their practices, for we must not prohibit its free exercise.

> “It answers no good purpose to say that wife-burning, man sacrificing, and babe killing are not religious practices. These things are done by millions of people in the name of religion. When we say they are not religious acts, we make a law respecting the establishment of religion. When we prohibit them, we prohibit its free exercise. The Greek may bring his god of debauchery. He may commit all the nameless crimes which darken the fair name and fame of Attica. We must not say a word. He may worship his own god in his own way....

> “The American people must say that the Bible is the word of God, and that Christianity is the religion of this country, or the exclusion of such practices as we have named is prohibiting the free exercise of religion, and hence unconstitutional. This is the constitution which the infidel likes, and to which he wants our laws adapted.”
But the framers of our Constitution were not infidels; they understood the true objects of civil Government, and wisely ordained that it should not undertake to settle questions in theology or create religious tests as qualifications for office. But let us further hear Mr. Blanchard before we attempt to point out the falsity of his reasoning:—

> “‘But,’ says the Christian objector, ‘the laws of the States do not permit wife-burning and man-eating religions. Bigamy is punished by law, in every State of the Union, and the mother found tossing her babe to a hungry shark would be locked up in the prison or the mad house.

Sabbath laws, chaplains, and chapels in every part of the public service attest the national regard for religion.’ True again. But what right has Government to tax me to sustain a chapel or chaplain, when it has nothing to do with religion, and I don’t believe in any God?

What right to interfere with the suttee, when my religion commands it? What right to imprison for bigamy, if my religion teaches it and I am free to practice any religion I choose? [3]

The answer is plain. Just no right at all. No law which forbids the free exercise of religions which call for human sacrifice, adultery, or blasphemy, can stand a suit in the Supreme Court of the United States.”

We have quoted at this length (we might quote more to the same intent) in order that we shall not be accused of not properly presenting the speaker. The reader will see that the whole force of his logic and eloquence was brought to bear against the Sixth Article and the First Amendment of the Constitution. Compare with these utterances the words of President Brunot on taking the chair in the same convention. He said:—

> “The Sixth Article of the Constitution declares that, ‘No religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States,’ and the First Amendment in the Constitution provides that ‘Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.’ We have not proposed to change these. We deem them essential, in connection with the amendment we ask, to the preservation of religious liberty, and with it, an effective guard against ‘a union of Church and State.’”

No man can possibly harmonize the words of the President with those of the Professor. Had the two speeches been framed for the purpose of deception they could not have better suited the purpose. Mr. Blanchard’s speech was made after that of the President, and, as the reporter said, “was frequently greeted with enthusiastic applause.” Mr. Brunot confessed that the First Amendment is essential “as an effective guard against a union of church and State.” So we believe. But listen once more to Professor Blanchard on that point:—

> “Constitutional laws punish for false money, eights, and measures, and of course Congress establishes a standard for money, weight, and measure. *So Congress must establish a standard of religion,* or admit anything called religion, as it already has the Oneida Community in New York, the Mormons in Utah, and the Joss House in California.”

This is frank; its intent cannot be misunderstood. If the words of Mr. Brunot are true,— if the First Amendment is essential as a guard against the union of Church and State,—how can the association deny that its indorsement of Mr. Blanchard’s demand that Congress shall make laws to establish a standard of religion, is a direct demand for a union of Church and State? Congress can make no such law while the First Amendment is in force; but such a law is just what this self-styled “Reform Association” demand, and without such a law their object can never be accomplished.

But our special purpose in making these quotations is to point out the errors into which they blindly run on the subjects of religion and morality. The distinction between the two is almost universally acknowledged. We should say it is universally acknowledged if we had not the writings and speeches of these ardent “National Reformers” before us. Professor Blanchard entirely ignored this distinction in the speech from which we have so liberally quoted; and we listened to a speech of Rev. Dr. Milligan in the same convention, in which he cited numerous instances of State interference in personal action, to justify their demand.

But not a single instance of the many to which he referred had any relation whatever to religion or to religious practices! It was a persistent “begging of the question” from beginning to end, by reason of his totally disregarding the difference between morality and religion, and even disregarding the difference between common secular and ecclesiastical matters. They speak and act as if there were no distinction between civil and ecclesiastical government; as if the union of Church and State were the normal state of things, to be accepted as a matter of course.
