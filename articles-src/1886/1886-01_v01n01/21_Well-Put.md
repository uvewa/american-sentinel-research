Well Put.—The Champlain Journal, speaking of the proposed Religious Amendment of the Constitution, made the following just remarks:

> "However slight, it is the first move for a union of Church and State. If we may cut off ever so few persons from the right of citizenship on account of difference of religious belief, then with equal justice and propriety may a majority at any time dictate the adoption of still further articles of belief, until our Constitution is but the text-book of a sect beneath whose tyrannical sway all liberty of religious opinion will be crushed."

At first it appeared "slight," because its advocates so stoutly denied their object of erecting in the Constitution "a standard of religion" to which all must conform. But from their later avowals Church and State stand out in bold relief in their intentions. [9]
