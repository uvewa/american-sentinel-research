SPECIAL attention is called to the article in this number of the SENTINEL under the head of "The Higher Law." It is full of sound wisdom. And we think every article will be found interesting and instructive. Our work is an important one, and it is our intention to make the SENTINEL worthy of the cause which it advocates.
