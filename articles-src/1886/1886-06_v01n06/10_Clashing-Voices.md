# Clashing Voices

THE *Christian Statesman* runs a department under the head of “Clashing Voices.” It is conducted by Rev. M. A. Gault; that is, he makes his voice clash with voices of those who do not favor National Reform. It is our purpose to keep the *Statesman* company as far as is possible, and therefore we are minded to indulge a little in the line of “clashing voices.”

In the Cincinnati National Reform Convention, 1872, Prof. Sloane, D. D., said:—

> “Every Government, by equitable laws, is a Government of God; a republic thus governed is of him, through the people, and is as *truly *and *really a Theocracy* as the *commonwealth of Israel.”*

This is the kind of a Government the National Reform Party proposes in this country. And yet in the Pittsburg Convention, 1874, among the things with which they think they are wrongly charged, President Brunot, named this:—

> “We are charged with meaning to turn this republic into a Theocracy.”

We should like to know wherein lies the falsity of the charge.

In the first National Convention ever held by the National Reform Party—Alleghany, Jan. 27, 28, 1864—a memorial and petition to Congress was adopted. In that memorial there was embodied in the preamble of the present Constitution the Amendment which the “Reformers” propose. And to that amended preamble was attached the following:—

> “And further: that such *changes* with respect to the oath of office, and *all other matters,* should be introduced *into the body* of the Constitution as may be necessary to give effect to these amendments in the preamble. And we your humble petitioners will ever pray.”

A special committee was then and there appointed to carry this memorial to Washington, lay it before the President, and before Congress. It, with a long address, was presented to President Lincoln, Feb. 10, 1864. And yet in the New York Convention, 1873, Dr. Jonathan Edwards said:—

“Our proposed Amendment is confined chiefly and almost exclusively to the *Preamble* of the Constitution.”

Language of the same import was held by Dr. Mayo, in the Cincinnati Convention, 1872. He said:—

> “The Constitution of Ohio begins with a confession of dependence on Almighty God as the author of the liberties it is made to preserve. That is all there is in this thing.”

And in the Pittsburg Convention, in speaking of the Fourth Article, and the First Amendment, in the body of the Constitution, President Brunot said:—

> “We have not proposed to change these.”

Here are some “clashing voices” which we wish Mr. Gault would arise and explain.
