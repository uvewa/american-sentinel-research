# How Will They Do It?

WHEN the National Reform Association shall have accomplished its task; when it shall have obtained its proposed amendments to the Constitution, and the consequent legislation; when, by the application of its religious tests it shall have secured the conformity of all Christians, and, by the application of the Rev. E. B. Graham’s mild-mannered measures, and the Rev. Jonathan Edwards’s mode of Christian endeavor, shall have cleared the country of all dissenters; when thus they shall have created their Christian nation, we should like very much to know how they are going to keep it Christian. There will be, constantly, and by thousands, those who will be coming of age, and who will assume the responsibilities of citizenship.

Now if while the young were growing up any of them may have by any means imbibed sentiments of dissent from the Christian faith of the State; or if any of them should arrogantly assume the privilege of thinking for themselves, and should thereby have been led to question the right of the State to regulate the religious opinions of its citizens; what is the State going to do? If it allows these “infidels” and “atheists” to become citizens, it will be no more a Christian nation than it is now. What, then, will their “reformed” nation do to preserve its Christian life and character? We can see nothing else than that it must do one of two things: Either apply the religious test to each individual as he comes of age, or else *have all the children born Christians.* Now which scheme will be employed, we confess we are utterly at a loss to toll. Of course the latter would at one stroke obviate every difficulty; but bow in the world they can accomplish it, is what puzzles us. Our desire is that some of those most interested in this “reform” will enlighten us on this point.
