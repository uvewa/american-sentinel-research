A WRITER in the *Statesman* says: "We do not want a State religion. . . . What we want is a religious State." These "Reformers" can present more cavils, evasions, and deceptions than any other people. They say the State is a person. They want a person with religion, but no personal religion? All this will apply to any individual as well as to a State. But what can be the nature of that person's religion who has no personal religion, we cannot imagine. The truth is that religion is only a personal matter, and not at all a State matter. "If thou be wise, thou shalt be wise for thyself; but if thou scornest, thou alone shalt bear it." No laws, nor Constitutional Amendments, nor coercive measures can add one whit to the religion of a State or of individuals.
