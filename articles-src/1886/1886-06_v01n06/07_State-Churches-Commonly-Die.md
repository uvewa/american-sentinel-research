> "State churches commonly die of moral *pyaemia.* History has not yet proved that, without reformatory awakenings from outside, and disciplinary dislodgements within, a church of Christ welded to the State *can* be saved from sinking into a Sybaritic civilization in which the crumpled rose leaf takes all spirit out of evangelistic enterprise."—*Prof Austin Phelps, D. D., in Congregationalist.*
