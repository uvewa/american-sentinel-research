# What Do They Mean?

Says Rev. M. A. Gault, in his “Clashing Voices,” *Statesman,* September 9, 1886:—

> “It is outside the province of human Government to supervise the thoughts and opinions of any one. But it is the duty of Government to supervise the morals of the people, as far as their outward acts are concerned . . . This movement is prompted by love to humanity, laboring to persuade the Government to adopt God’s perfect system of morals.”

Does Mr. Gault mean to say that God’s perfect system of morals only takes supervision of the outward acts? Such is the real logic of his argument. Here is his *major premise:* It is the duty of “the Government to adopt God’s perfect system of morals.” Here is his *minor:* “It is the duty of Government to supervise the morals of the people, as far as their outward acts are concerned.” From these premises, the only conclusion is: Therefore “God’s perfect system  of morals” supervises the morals of the people only as far as their outward acts are concerned.” And this conclusion is confirmed by his other statement, that, “It is outside the province of human Government to supervise the thoughts and opinions of any one.”

But Mr. Gault does not mean at all what his argument proves, he knows full well, and he means it so, that “God’s perfect system of morals” does most decidedly “supervise the thoughts and opinions” and the very intents of the heart of every soul of man. Now if the Government is to adopt God’s perfect system of morals, bow can it possibly avoid the supervision of the thoughts and opinions of its subjects? If it is the duty of human Government to adopt God’s perfect system of morals, which supervises the thoughts and opinions of every one, then how *can* such supervision be outside the province of human Government? Having adopted as its supreme law, a system of morals that supervises the thoughts and opinions of men, upon what principle will the Government stop simply with “the outward acts”? Upon no principle whatever.

If perchance Mr. Gault should not mean either of these deductions, but really means that under God’s perfect system of morals the Government shall touch only the outward acts, then it must be that be means that the Government shall uproot the tree of immorality in this nation, by plucking off the leaves; that the inside of the national cup and platter shall be made clean by a Governmental washing of the outside. Then we simply cite him to the words of Christ to the Pharisees on this very subject. “Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full of extortion and excess. Thou blind Pharisee, cleanse first that which is within the cup and platter, that the outside of them may be clean also.” Matt. 23:25, 26.

But whether the gentleman means any or none of these deductions, the *fact* is that in the statements which he has made, he has involved himself in a muddle out of which he can never get, in harmony with God’s perfect system of morals.

The ecclesiastical power has no scruple in employing in its own favor those arms of which it deprecates the use, the employment of which it treats as impious usurpation, when put forth against it.—*Dean Milman.*

“The lofty looks of man shall be humbled, and the haughtiness of men shall be bowed down, and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day” Isa. 2:11. [89]
