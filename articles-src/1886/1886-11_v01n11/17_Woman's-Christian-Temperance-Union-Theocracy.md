A "monthly reading" lately issued by the Woman's Christian Temperance Union on the subject of "Our National Sins," says: "A true Theocracy is yet to come," and "the enthronement of Christ in law and law-makers, hence I pray devoutly as a Christian patriot, for the ballot in the hands of women." This point of "a true Theocracy" we commend to the consideration of President Brunot, who claims that it is a false charge that the design of National Reform is to turn this Republic into a Theocracy. As for the other, we should like for the author of the "reading," or some one else, to tell us how many law-makers there can properly be in a true Theocracy? Perhaps, too, we might remark that the scheme of "the enthronement of Christ in law-makers" *by ballot,* is but the expression in another form of the National Reform method of bringing the gospel to the masses, as developed in Mrs. Woodbridge's Chautauqua speech.
