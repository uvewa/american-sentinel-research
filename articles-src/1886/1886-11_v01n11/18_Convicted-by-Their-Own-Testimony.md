In the Pittsburg Nation al Reform Convention, President Brunot said: "No State can rightly attempt to compel the consciences of its citizens with a particular religion, and, as we believe, no particular religion can rightly attempt to use the State to compel men's consciences to its belief."

Then we should like to know what Mr. Brunot means by acting as the head of a movement that has in view no other aim than that of compelling men's consciences with a particular religion, namely, the Christian religion? Or does the gentleman mean to convey the impression that Christianity is not a particular religion? For it is the sheerest and most absurd sophistry to say that men's acts may be compelled with a particular religion without compelling the conscience; because when in conformity with a particular religion, men who do not believe it at all are compelled to act as though they believed it; this is nothing else than to compel the conscience.

By the way, for the especial benefit of Rev. M. A. Gault, we might in this connection indulge just a little in a "clashing voices" exercise. With the above quotation from President Brunot, please read the following from Vice-President E. B. Graham:—

> "If the opponents of the Bible do not like our Government and its *Christian* features, let them go to some wild, desolate land; and .... stay there till they die."

And the following from the *Christian Statesman:—*

> "Enforce upon all that come among us the laws of Christian morality."

Now if it be right for a Government to so persistently enforce upon all, the laws of Christian morality, that the refusal to submit can only result in perpetual banishment to some wild, desolate land, then we should like to know how Mr. Brunot's proposition can be true? But President Brunot's proposition *is* true. Therefore it is perfectly clear that the aim of Vice-President Graham, the *Christian Statesman,* and the whole National Reform movement, is but to cause the State and the Christian religion to do what cannot rightly be done.
