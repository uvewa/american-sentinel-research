The Catholic Church in the United States has learned to talk of the union of Church and State as an "unholy union." Whether the Catholics have learned this trick from the National Reform party, or whether the National Reform party has learned it from the Catholics, we shall not take upon ourselves to precisely decide; but this we know that the expression comes with equal grace from both classes.
