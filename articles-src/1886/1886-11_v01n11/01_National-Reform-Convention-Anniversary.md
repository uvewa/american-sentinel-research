Next year the one hundredth anniversary of the adoption of the Constitution of the United States, will be held in Philadelphia. The *Christian Statesman* is calling for a National Reform Convention, to be held at the same time, to consider means for altering that charter of American liberty, so as to overthrow all that was done by the revolutionary fathers.
