# National Christianity in America

The following is an article under the above heading, which was written by President T. G. Apple, D. D., LL.D., of Franklin and Marshall College, and printed in the New York *Independent,* August 5, 1886. We insert the article entire, not for the purpose of indorsing it, for the position of the Sentinel on this subject is well known, but to show the rapidly growing tendency among “leaders of theological thought,” toward a national religion. We are free to say that we seriously apprehend the danger of which Mr. Apple grants the possibility, that is, that “such an organization” would “become, in the end, tyrannical,” and we are sure that all who love true liberty will do well to share with us the apprehension. We derive no comfort at all from President Apple’s doubt that the “danger would ever become realized.” The danger has been too often fearfully realized.

> “The United States has taken the lead in the establishment of a great free republic. It now remains to organize a national Christianity in this great republic. The history of Christianity clearly reveals its tendency to nationalize itself. Whilst it is catholic in spirit—an interest that will, in the end, bind all nations in one common brotherhood—yet in working out this  result it adapts itself to the order of human [87] life. As nationality is one of the integral forms in which humanity comes to expression in history, Christianity becomes national in Christianizing the nations. Even in those ages when the centralizing tendency of the Roman hierarchy was in the ascendency, a decentralizing tendency manifested itself in the national churches of modern Europe. This was one of the factors that wrought against the Hildebrandian theory of a consolidated theocracy that tended to crush out the autonomy of national life itself. It appeared most conspicuously in the rise of Gallicanism in the time of Charlemagne, which reappeared in the reforming councils, and was not suppressed until it yielded, for a time at least, in its struggle with Ultramontanism in the late Vatican Council. But it appeared as a strong factor in the other nationalities of Europe in the general revolt against the papacy in the sixteenth century.

> “This tendency found expression in the establishment of national churches in modern Europe, in which the pendulum swung over from the one extreme of the Church asserting undue authority over the State to the opposite extreme of the State exercising undue authority over the Church. In America, when a new nation came to its birth through the confederation of the colonies, history moved on without an established national Church. This separation of Church and State came about, in part, by a preconcerted plan, but mainly, we think, by reason of actual necessity. In the minds of some, doubtless, it means that Church and State shall move forward entirely separate from each other, on parallel planes; but it has become already apparent that the two must stand in very intimate relationship as vital interests that have to do with one common life. The question now is, whether we cannot have a national Christianity without a national Church in the strict sense of the term—that is, a form of organization in which Christianity shall exert its full moulding power upon the national life without the entangling alliances that accompany the union of Church and State in the Old World.
> “If this is to be reached, in our judgment, the organization required must conform, more or less, to our political organization; for it will be found, we think, that this law has also ruled in the history of Christianity, that in its outward adaptation to the national life it follows the general features of the civil Government, thus in a good sense becoming all things to all men. Our Government is neither a consolidated democracy nor a consolidated monarchy, but a federal republic. What is there to hinder the Christian churches of this nation from forming a federal union, conforming in its main features to our civil national Government? Let the churches organize a general representative body, composed of delegates appointed by the different denominations, for the purpose of mutual co-operation, and the consideration of such questions as pertain to the common interests of Christianity in its relation to the nation. Let it be an advisory body merely, without legislative functions, to meet at stated times or as occasion calls for it. There are questions upon which a deliverance is already urgently called for. It is high time, for instance, for the churches of this country to express a judgment on the subject of marriage and divorce, on the observance of the Sabbath, and other matters of a similar character, which pertain to both Church and State. Other questions would arise that pertain more especially to the Church itself, such as co-operation in the work of foreign missions, evangelization in our large cities, meeting the attacks of infidelity, etc., etc.
> “Such an organization may have to come, perhaps, through initiatory stages and steps. Such movements are setting in all around us, movements that look to a closer union of churches of kindred types, the American Congress of Churches, etc. But it seems to us the times are ripe for a more general movement. History is moving very rapidly in this age; and the danger is that the other factors of our national life may advance more rapidly, and gain a better advanced vantage-ground, than Christianity. We believe a beginning could be made by a voluntary free conference of one or two leading men from each of the different religious bodies of the nation, who might successfully discuss a plan of union. There would doubtless be difficulties in the way, one of the greatest of which would be as to what bodies should be included in such a free union, but these would soon disappear.
> “Dangers also would be apprehended. The chief of these, perhaps, would be that such an organization, like our national Government, would tend to increasing influence and power, and become, in the end, tyrannical. But we do not believe this danger would ever become realized. Freedom has made such progress in history that we are not much disturbed by the fear of our national Government usurping tyrannical power, and there would be even more watchful care in reference to such a central organization of the churches. If, however, such a fear should prevail, let the experiment be made of an occasional congress, conference, or council. Possibly it might be found that, like the councils in the Roman Church, which has learned wisdom by long experience, or the associations and consociations in our earlier and later Puritan history, such occasional councils would meet the wants in the case.
> “At any rate there is a widespread sense of the want of some such union of our American churches as shall give utterance to a national Christianity in America, and for this reason we have here given expression to a few thoughts which, though not at all new, may aid, if but a little, in keeping the general subject before the Christian public through the widely-read columns of the *Independent.”*
The doctrine which, from the very first origin of religious dissensions, has been held by all bigots of all sects, when condensed into a few words, and stripped of rhetorical disguise, is simply this: I am in the right, you are in the wrong. When you are the stronger, you ought to tolerate me; for it is your duty to tolerate truth. But when I am the stronger, I shall persecute you; for it is my duty to persecute error.—*Macaulay.* [88]

In the *Christian Statesman* of Oct. 7, Rev. Robert White presents an article on “Jesuitry in Politics;” but if anybody wants to see the perfection of Jesuitry in politics, just let him watch closely the National Reform movement and its methods.

Professor McAllister, the Treasurer of the National Reform Association, in a late financial appeal in behalf of National Reform, says that National Reform lecturers “are listened to by large numbers and with deeper interest than ever before.”

We have obtained some particulars of the trial of those men in Arkansas for working on Sunday. We regret that we have not space to give them in this paper; but we received them so late that we are compelled to lay the matter over till our next issue, when we promise to give our readers some specimens of Arkansas justice.

The North Ohio Methodist Episcopal Conference lately held at Canal Dover, unanimously requested the Bishop to appoint Rev. J. P. Mills to the work of “District Secretary of the National Reform Association.” The Bishop, Mallalieu, made the appointment, and shook hands with Mr. Mills, wishing him “abundant success” in his new work.

The Catholic Church in the United States has learned to talk of the union of Church and State as an “unholy union.” Whether the Catholics have learned this trick from the National Reform party, or whether the National Reform party has learned it from the Catholics, we shall not take upon ourselves to precisely decide; but this we know that the expression comes with equal grace from both classes.

A “monthly reading” lately issued by the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union on the subject of “Our National Sins,” says: “A true Theocracy is yet to come,” and “the enthronement of Christ in law and law-makers, hence I pray devoutly as a Christian patriot, for the ballot in the hands of women.” This point of “a true Theocracy” we commend to the consideration of President Brunot, who claims that it is a false charge that the design of National Reform is to turn this Republic into a Theocracy. As for the other, we should like for the author of the “reading,” or some one else, to tell us how many law-makers there can properly be in a true Theocracy? Perhaps, too, we might remark that the scheme of “the enthronement of Christ in law-makers” *by ballot,* is but the expression in another form of the National Reform method of bringing the gospel to the masses, as developed in Mrs. Woodbridge’s Chautauqua speech.
