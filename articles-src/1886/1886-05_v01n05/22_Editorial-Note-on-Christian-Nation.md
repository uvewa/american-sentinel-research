The question has been raised as to how the religious sentiment of the coming generation will be kept up if our country is made "a Christian nation" according to the views of the "Reformers." There can be no difficulty whatever. Non-professors or non-church-members will not be eligible to office, and therefore every man will surely become a church-member by the time he becomes eligible to office. Infidelity will be at a great discount under such an arrangement. There might be some necessity for preaching to the women if they should prove so indifferent as to be willing to be out of the fashion. But that difficulty might also be removed by adopting "female suffrage," and making them eligible to office. Then "the offense of the cross" will have effectually ceased, and the millennium will be a fixed fact. Delightful prospect!
