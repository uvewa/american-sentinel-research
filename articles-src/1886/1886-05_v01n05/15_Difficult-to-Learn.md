# Difficult to Learn

Dr. Spear, of Brooklyn, N. Y., wrote an excellent book with the title of “Religion and the State.” We shall take occasion to quote from it in the future. On the exercise of individual conscience, he says:—

> “There ought to be room in this world for *all* the consciences in it, without any encroachment upon the rights of each other; and there would be if all men, in their relations to each other, would be content to exercise their *own* rights of conscience in a reasonable manner. This would leave every man to determine the religious question for himself, and, as the necessary consequence, relieve every man from all impositions, burdens, taxes, or disabilities arising from the determination of the question by others. Though the rule is a simple one, it is, nevertheless, one of the most difficult things for bigotry to learn. The only way to learn it effectually is not to be a bigot.”

The Doctor’s recipe is excellent, but scarcely practicable in all cases. It is somewhat as if one should say that the best antidote for a fever is not to have a fever! Unfortunately, there is a class of persons who *are* bigots, and how are they to learn this useful lesson? We might pity them and let them alone; but, unfortunately again, bigotry seems to be contagious in some localities. Well, we promise to do all in our power to prevent its spread by letting the light into its lurking places. It flourished best in the “Dark Ages,” and we do not wish for their return.

The Lancaster (Cal.) *Weekly News*, speaking of the American Sentinel, and of the efforts now being put forth to change the form of our Government, says:—

> “When it is further considered that there is no poison so easily instilled into the public mind as that which is insidiously administered under the sugar-coating of double-distilled piety, it must be confessed that it is well that an alert sentinel should be put on guard before any considerable breach is made in the ‘outer wall’ which protects our civil and religious liberties. And we will say this for the *Sentinel*, that its articles are ably and carefully concocted, without offensiveness toward the orthodox or ‘unco gude,’ and they should be read by every one who is a Christian or pretends to be one. He who is not may also find pleasure and profit in them. Its price is only 50 cents a year, and we commend the journal to public favor.”

We shall never give offense to the orthodox; for we profess to be orthodox also, fully “believing all things written in the law and the prophets.” And this is the strongest reason why we oppose the Religious Amendment of our Constitution: Such alliances with earthly powers always have been detrimental to pure Christianity, and they cannot fail to be wherever they are made. We do not wish to see the standard of religion brought any nearer to a point of worldliness than it is now.

The question has been raised as to how the religious sentiment of the coming generation will be kept up if our country is made “a Christian nation” according to the views of the “Reformers.” There can be no difficulty whatever. Non-professors or non-church-members will not be eligible to office, and therefore every man will surely become a church-member by the time he becomes eligible to office. Infidelity will be at a great discount under such an arrangement. There might be some necessity for preaching to the women if they should prove so indifferent as to be willing to be out of the fashion. But that difficulty might also be removed by adopting “female suffrage,” and making them eligible to office. Then “the offense of the cross” will have effectually ceased, and the millennium will be a fixed fact. Delightful prospect!

> “The movement looking to the amendment of our National Constitution, so as to put our Government upon an acknowledged Christian basis, is fast growing in popularity. The pulpit, the press, and the platform—the great engines of every reform—are pushing forward its interests. Meetings for its discussion are multiplying over the land.”—*United Presbyterian*.

Rev. Robert Baird said: “The putting of witches to death in Massachusetts was a legitimate result of the attempt to build up a sort of theocracy, having for its basis the civil institutions of the Jewish commonwealth.” [41]
