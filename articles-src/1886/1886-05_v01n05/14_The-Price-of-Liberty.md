# The Price of Liberty

Half a century ago, this motto was in constant use: “Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty.” The idea was deeply fixed in the minds of the American people that vigilance must guard and wisdom preserve that boon which their valor bad won. But scarcely a century has elapsed since our fathers suffered the almost incredible hardships of the Revolution, and the generation that now has the welfare of the country in charge is forgetting the lessons of 1776, and has grown into the idea that liberty is an assured thing to this people and to their posterity, and that it no longer needs to be guarded with ever watchful care.

If attention is given to the subject, it will be found that in nothing else were encroachments upon our liberties so much dreaded by our forefathers as in the union of Church and State. They brought with them to this land a lively sense of danger in this respect. Their own experience and observation had taught them the lesson. And the action of the puritanical party in New England had strengthened their conviction that any approach to such a union was fraught with danger to somebody’s civil and religious rights. The framers of our Government guarded against this danger in the body of the Constitution, and strengthened the safeguard in the First Amendment. They faithfully discharged their duty to us; now it remains for us to faithfully preserve the blessing we have received of them.

One of the worst features of our times is, that a large and influential and growing association is now putting forth the most strenuous efforts to entirely change the whole structure of our Government in this respect, and the people are not alarmed. In every direction they are gathering adherents among those who are best calculated to exert a strong influence over their fellow-men; their plans are well laid, and pursued with the most persistent vigor; but when the danger is pointed out, those who ought to have the liveliest interest in the matter, treat it as a joke, and ridicule the idea that such a thing can ever be accomplished in this “land of freedom.” Whether it remains a land of freedom depends upon our vigilance and faithfulness to our highest interests.
