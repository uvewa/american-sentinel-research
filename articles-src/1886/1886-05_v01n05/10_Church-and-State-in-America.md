# Church and State in America

In a work entitled “Religion in America,” written nearly half a century ago, we find some interesting facts concerning the union of Church and State in the United States a couple of centuries ago. It was written by a Presbyterian clergyman especially for the information of Europeans. We wish we had room for longer extracts than we are able to give in this number. Of the evils resulting from the union in New England, the author says:—

> “It gave rise to internal difficulties of the gravest nature with such of the colonists as were not disposed to agree to all the measures by which it was carried out, and led to the adoption of the harshest proceedings against those persons. One of the first cases of this kind was that of Roger Williams, in 1633-35, and it shook the colony to its center. That remarkable man had been educated for the English bar under the patronage of Sir Edward Coke; but influenced by the conviction that he was called to the ministry, he took orders in the Established Church. Expelled from that church by the bishops, on account of his Puritanical principles, he came to Boston in 1631.

> “Taught by persecution to examine how far human Governments are authorized to legislate for the human mind, and to bind its faculties by their decisions, Williams soon perceived that a course was pursued in America which he could not but condemn as repugnant to the rights of conscience. Regarding all intolerance as sinful, he maintained that ‘the doctrine of persecution for cause of conscience is most evidently and lamentably contrary to the doctrine of Jesus Christ.’ The law required the attendance of every man at public worship; Williams pronounced this to be wrong, for to drag the unwilling to public worship looked like requiring hypocrisy. Not less did he oppose the law that taxed all men for the support of a system of religious worship which some might dislike and conscientiously disapprove. ‘What!’ exclaimed his antagonists, ‘is not the laborer worthy of his hire?’ ‘Yes,’ he replied, ‘from them that hire him.’ Public functionaries were to be taken only from among members of the church. Williams argued that, with like propriety, ‘a doctor of physic, or a pilot’ might be selected according to his skill in theology and his standing in the church.—[*Bancroft*.] In [39] the end, Roger Williams was banished from the colony, and having retired to Narragansett Bay, there he became a Baptist, and founded what is now the State of Rhode Island. Absolute religious liberty was established there from the first.
> “The next case occurred in 1637, and ended in the expulsion of Wheelwright, Anne Hutchinson, and Aspinwall, who, although they held some very extravagant notions on certain points, would have been harmless persons had the only weapon employed against them been truth.
> “Testimony to the like effect is borne by the history of the colony in subsequent years. ‘Since a particular form of worship had become a part of the civil establishment, irreligion was now to be punished as a civil offense. The State was a model of Christ’s kingdom on earth; treason against the civil Government was treason against Christ; and reciprocally, as the gospel had the right paramount, blasphemy, or whatever a jury might call blasphemy, was the highest offense in the catalogue of crimes. To deny any book of the Old or New Testament to be the written and infallible word of God, was punished, by fine or by stripes, and in case of obstinacy, by exile or death. Absence from the ministry of the word was punished by fine.’ —[*Bancroft*.] Everything indicated that this union between Church and State was operating in such a manner as rapidly to undermine the rights and principles of both. The Anabaptists were treated in some cases with great harshness, and when, in 1651, the Quakers made an attempt to establish themselves in the colony, they were expelled, and prohibited from returning upon pain of death,—a penalty actually inflicted on four of them who returned in contravention of this enactment.”
