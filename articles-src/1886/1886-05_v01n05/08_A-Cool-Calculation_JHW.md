# A Cool Calculation

At the National Convention of the National Reform Association held in Cincinnati in 1872, Mr. Abbot, editor of the *Index*, a man opposed to Christianity, was permitted to present a protest against the movement. While there were some things in his address with which we cannot agree, we believe his words of warning were not too strong, but they faithfully portrayed the danger that lurks in the amendment movement. He said:—

> “I make no threat whatever, but I state a truth fixed as the hills when I say that before you can carry this measure and trample on the freedom of the people, you will have to wade through seas of blood. Every man who favors it votes to precipitate the most frightful war of modern times.”

The Convention played a shrewd game when it put forward “Rev. A. D. Mayo” to reply to Mr. Abbot, for Mr. Mayo can speak more words to less purpose, and better cover with sophistry the most evident truth, than any other man in the Convention. This is his characteristic. In his reply he said:—

> “Why, he is now living as a citizen of Ohio under a Constitution that substantially includes every idea we propose to place in the national charter. . . . As a citizen of Ohio he is exposed to all the danger of disfranchisement and persecution to which he would be exposed if this amendment was made.” Etc., etc.

Now Mr. Mayo and his associates in that Convention knew that his speech was sheer deception, from first to last. More than a year before that time the *Statesman* said that their movement contemplated “practical ends,” because under their proposed change of the Government no one would be permitted to hold office who traveled on the first day of the week! And they have loudly deplored the fact that an infidel has been elected Governor of Ohio. Now if, as they claim, no man who violates the precepts of the Bible could hold office under the amended Constitution, would there be such a parallel between it and the Constitution of Ohio as Mr. Mayo claimed? There would not; nor do they intend to have it so. We repeat, that Mr. Mayo’s speech was a deception, and they knew it was.

And Mr. Mayo ridiculed Mr. Abbot’s apprehensions of war, and of any trouble whatever growing out of their remodeling the Government. And the advocates of the amendment, including the conductors of the *Statesman*, have always treated the fears of their opponents with ridicule. And yet they look upon the very troubles that others predict, and even war [38] itself, as possibilities which may grow out of their movement. Thus we show that their pathway is marked with deception from beginning to end. For proof see the following from the pen of one of the Secretaries of the Association, Rev. M. A. Gault, published in the *Statesman* of April 1, 1886:—

> “It cost us all our civil war to blot slavery out of our Constitution, and it may cost us another war to blot out its infidelity.”

Slavery was an institution; it was bounded by State lines and upheld by State laws. It concerned man’s conduct toward and treatment of his fellow-man. It was, therefore, a matter proper to be dealt with by the Government. But who can see even an approach to a parallel, in any of these respects, between slavery and infidelity? Infidelity is not bounded by any civil or geographical lines. It is in every community. It exists side by side with Christianity in thousands of households. It is held by the undisputed right of private judgment—undisputed in every land having any just claim to being civilized. It is held by tens of thousands of American citizens, each one having the same interest in the Constitution, and in the proper administration of the Government, and the same right to the protection of the Government, that the conductors of the *Statesman *have.

Were not these people growing almost insane on this subject they would never hint such a thing as they have here spoken. They must be aware that to take the first step toward inaugurating a war, a civil war, against infidelity in any shape or manner, would be to invite the application of a torch to every church building in the land. They must know that that would not be a war of States or sections. It would be a most deadly strife in every school district, in every neighborhood throughout our wide domain. That is not the speech of Christians; it is the wild talk of religious bigots. And we greatly fear that they will yet bring upon our country the terrible calamity of which they so coolly speak. Reports show that they are making many converts to their schemes in the churches, in the theological schools, in the colleges—everywhere that it is possible to reach those who may exert a controlling influence upon society.

Let not the people be deceived by the idea that their movement is not taking root in the country. The danger is great, and it is imminent. May the warning be heeded in time.
