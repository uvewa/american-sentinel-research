The Lancaster (Cal.) *Weekly News*, speaking of the American Sentinel, and of the efforts now being put forth to change the form of our Government, says:—

> "When it is further considered that there is no poison so easily instilled into the public mind as that which is insidiously administered under the sugar-coating of double-distilled piety, it must be confessed that it is well that an alert sentinel should be put on guard before any considerable breach is made in the 'outer wall' which protects our civil and religious liberties. And we will say this for the *Sentinel*, that its articles are ably and carefully concocted, without offensiveness toward the orthodox or 'unco gude,' and they should be read by every one who is a Christian or pretends to be one. He who is not may also find pleasure and profit in them. Its price is only 50 cents a year, and we commend the journal to public favor."

We shall never give offense to the orthodox; for we profess to be orthodox also, fully "believing all things written in the law and the prophets." And this is the strongest reason why we oppose the Religious Amendment of our Constitution: Such alliances with earthly powers always have been detrimental to pure Christianity, and they cannot fail to be wherever they are made. We do not wish to see the standard of religion brought any nearer to a point of worldliness than it is now.
