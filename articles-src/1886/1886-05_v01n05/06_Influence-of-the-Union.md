# Influence of the Union

Under this head, Baptist Noel, the English author, in his book on the Union of Church and State, speaking of the excommunication of dissenters, says:—

> “Without the aid of the union, these canonical fulminations would be simply ridiculous; but when solemnly promulgated by a synod of the State-paid clergy as the doctrine of the national church, they attach the stigma of schism to dissenters in the minds of myriads. Under the shelter of these canons, bishops proclaim them in their charges to be schismatics, clergymen echo it from their pulpits, and even liberal men in the establishment are afraid openly to deny it. By aid of the union, the establishment, rising above all competition, can loftily look down upon all other churches as sectaries. ‘This is not a mere State church,’ [37] says the excellent bishop of Calcutta, ‘*but the religion of Christ our Lord *as established by his providence and grace in Great Britain in the second century, . . . *the Christian religion *wisely and mildly established by a Christian Government. Much less is our church a sectarian body, as some would call it; that is a small number of persons who have cut themselves off from the mass of Christians by certain peculiarities; but the national church of the Government, nobles, and people of our religious country.’

> “This doctrine, originated and sustained by the union, besides being in the highest degree unjust to dissenters, inflicts upon them many injuries.
> “Persons thus trained from childhood to look upon dissenters as schismatics, whom they should, according to the apostle’s command, avoid (Rom. 16:17), are afraid to hear the gospel from their lips. Were a dissenting minister to open a chapel for worship in any large village where there is a moral and benevolent rector, whose doctrine is unsound and whose life is worldly, few among the villagers would dare to hear the schismatic. Were the two ministers upon the footing of legal equality, as in a village of the United States, the multitude would flock to hear the gospel; but here where the State maintains the worldly pastor and frowns upon the evangelist, his doctrine is suspected, his person is despised, and he cannot gather a congregation. A similar spirit has hitherto impeded the evangelic labors of dissenters in every city of the kingdom.”
And so it will ever be wherever the church is placed under the patronage of the State. It is sure to result in a loss of spirituality in the body of professors.
