When the *Statesman* gave so large a notice of the American Sentinel, we hoped that it would continue its friendly offices; but its editor and correspondents seem to be attending a perpetual "mum social." We incline to the opinion that it is their wisdom to hold their peace (Job 13:5) in regard to our exposure of their fallacies and sophistry. We are confident that they can make no good defense when their positions are assailed by a correct line of argument. And we would be pleased if we could hope that they would come to realize this fact, and cease their efforts to undermine the foundations of our Government.
