# Morality and Religion

The Christian religion, as we have said on this subject, is *a remedial system*. If man had not sinned, such a system would not have existed. Man would then have been justified by his obedience. The commandments of God contain the whole duty of man. Eccl. 12:13, 14. His law is perfect. Ps. 9:7. His commandments are righteousness. Ps. 119:172. Hence, if man had not sinned he would have done his whole duty; he would have been perfect and righteous in complete obedience to a perfect and righteous law. He could not have been condemned, because all his actions would have been right. And thus it is written, “The doers of the law shall be justified.” Rom. 2:13.

And we have said the law, in every part, grew out of the will of God alone; it arose from no contingency connected with man’s probation. It is original obligation, all its relations existing by virtue of creation. And as it is perfect, and contains the whole duty of man, it is a complete summary of all morality. From the day that man first owed allegiance to his Creator, and duties to his fellow-creatures, no new morality has arisen either in principle or in precept. There is no just reason for the expression which we have often heard, “The moral laws of the gospel.” If any morality exists by virtue of the gospel, that fact would prove that the moral law previously existing Was imperfect; that it did not contain all morality, and therefore did not contain the whole duty of moral agents. The necessity for the gospel originated in man’s transgression; but man’s transgression could not possibly give rise to moral obligation. It did create a necessity for a system of redemption, of restoration, but all the laws of such a system are—what theologians correctly term—*positive *laws, in distinction from *moral*.

This is a truth of which sight is too often lost, though the distinction itself is almost universally [36] recognized. Many seem to consider that the institutions of the gospel are twofold, both moral and positive. But that is an error, as we have shown. The gospel *enforces all *morality, but it *originates none*. A Government, in declaring an amnesty or offering pardon to those who have been in rebellion, either expresses or implies the condition that they must cease their rebellion and return to the support of, and obedience to, the Constitution of the Government. But the amnesty or pardon does not originate the Constitution or add a particle to its force and obligation. Both Christ and his apostles enforced the law of God, and constantly referred to the Scriptures, the word of God, as authority for their teachings. But they never announced that they were authorized to give power and efficiency to the law, nor to annul one precept of the law and erect another in its stead, or to add any new morality to that which existed before. They taught repentance and the remission of sins. Theirs was purely a “ministry of reconciliation.” Of course we speak now of “the moral law” only, not of the types and ordinances of past dispensations. These were temporary, and were adopted for a development of the gospel or remedial system. Not one of them existed originally by virtue of the work of creation, as did the ten commandments; not one of them ever would have existed if man had not sinned.

The law of God is very brief in its terms, but universal in its application. There is not a relation in life, except those which grow out of sin, which it leaves untouched. In few words, it guards our rights in respect to *life, chastity, property*, and *reputation*. Examining these four precepts, we find that they cover all the rights which our fellow-creatures can invade, and all the duties which we owe to them. If these are obeyed in the spirit of love, which is the spirit of the law, we then observe the golden rule; we do to our neighbor just what we would that our neighbor should do to us. And thus it is seen that *there is nothing religious in the golden rule*. It relates only to duties between man and man, and surely we are not required to worship one another! It is not at all peculiar to the gospel; the Saviour said, “For this is the law and the prophets.” It needs not a word to convince any one that it would have existed as perpetual duty if man had not fallen —if there never had been any such a system as the gospel. And so we might proceed, step by step, to show that not a single item of morality that ever was taught is peculiar to the gospel.

To break any of these commandments which relate to our duty to our neighbor is to infringe upon the rights of our neighbor; and, therefore, it is perfectly proper for the civil Government to punish for the violation of them. The very object of Government is the preservation of rights, or the protection of its citizens.

But it is not the office of civil Government to declare that a man shall worship God, or to decide in what manner he shall worship, if he chooses to worship at all. And herein is shown the inconsistency of the National Reformers. They declare that the ten commandments shall be enforced if the amendment shall be secured. And they say that there is nothing in their movement which can or will hinder the Catholics working with them. And yet they well know that the Catholics, in their worship, violate both the letter and the spirit of the second commandment. In the enumeration of religious errors which these reformers say ought to be suppressed, we have never known them to mention this item of false worship. They denounce the false worship of the Chinese as dangerous to our Christianity, but say not a word against the worship of “Mary.” Why is this? It may be that the Catholics are too numerous to be meddled with, and it may be that they count on the aid of the Catholics to secure the amendment, knowing that such an amendment perfectly coincides with the Catholic faith in regard to the relation which the Church sustains to the Government.

We have little hope, if any, that we shall succeed in causing the amendmentists to recognize the difference between morality and religion—between those things which civil Government may and may not enforce or regulate. It is not to the interest of their cause to do justice to their readers in laying down the true principles of Government. As a specimen of their method of treating these subjects, we copy the following from the *Statesman* of April 1, 1886:—

> “Our Government docs not trespass on liberty of conscience when it provides that the moral law of which Christ is the author shall decide all questions in our national life.”

Who can tell what they mean by the above? To what moral law do they refer? Is it to be found in the Old or the New Testament? There is a moral law in the Old Testament, namely, the ten commandments, but in that there is not one *Christian *feature. The Jew accepts it heartily; if it were adopted as the Constitution of our Government, it would shut out neither the Jew nor the Mohammedan. That would not make us a “Christian nation.” And we confidently repeat our affirmation that the gospel of Christ does not originate one jot of morality. There is not a particle of morality in the New Testament which it does not derive from the Old. The gospel is purely and only a remedial system—not at all a moral system.

The *Statesman* was once pressed on this very point. The question was propounded to it if, when they asked to have “all Christian laws, usages, and institutions placed on an undeniable legal basis in the fundamental law of the land,” it included baptism and the Lord’s Supper. It enumerated its points as follows:—

> “Among these are the laws which regulate marriage, and those which forbid and punish blasphemy, the offering of prayer in our National and State Legislatures, the maintenance of religious worship and instruction in our asylums, reformatories, and jails, the observance of public thanksgivings and fasts, the use of the oath in courts of justice, and many others. All these, as well as the laws which guard the Sabbath, we desire to maintain. All these, moreover, are proper to the State, and cannot, in any candid mind, be confounded with baptism and the Lord’s Supper.”

True, they cannot; and why not? Simply because baptism and the Lord’s Supper are “Christian institutions,” *and the other things enumerated are not! *If anything is wanted to convict them of deception, they have furnished it above. A certain advocate of the Religious Amendment, who was also an officer of the Association, when asked what effect their legislation would have upon the rights of the Jews, said:—

> “We are not a Jewish, but a Christian nation; therefore our legislation must be conformed to the institutions and spirit of Christianity.”

If these people do not intend to deceive, why do they not speak in plain terms, and tell us just what they mean? The Jews had laws regulating marriage, punishing blasphemy, for false oaths, providing for religious worship, thanksgivings, fasts, and guarding the Sabbath. And moreover, as regards prayer in our legislatures, something less than thirty years ago, when there had been a long and bitter strife in our National House of Representatives over the election of a Speaker, a Jewish Rabbi was invited to act as chaplain one morning, and that day the strife ended in a peaceable election!

To legislate for Christians as distinguished from Jews, and to recognize Jesus Christ as ruler, and his laws as the laws of the land, it is necessary to place on a legal basis that which is peculiar to Christianity in distinction from Judaism. But in the above enumeration by the *Statesman* there is not a single point of that character. Indeed, if they drop out baptism and the Lord’s Supper, it will puzzle them to find any “Christian institutions” at all! It is very true that “in any candid mind” these stand apart from the objects which they profess to seek; but “in any candid mind” they must necessarily be included in the enumeration of “all Christian institutions.” But we are fearful that we have not candid minds to deal with in refuting the fallacies of the National Reform Association.

This distinction will be noticed further. We close this article with the affirmation, and we can maintain it, too, that no Christian institution is properly a subject of human legislation and enforcement. As was said before, infidels have no rights in the Christian church, and therefore infidels have no right or privilege to observe Christian institutions; they belong to Christians only. When enforced by civil authority, they are perverted and abused. J. H. W.
