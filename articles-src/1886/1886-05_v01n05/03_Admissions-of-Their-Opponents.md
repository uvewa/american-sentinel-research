# Admissions of Their Opponents

Now it is by all conceded that “the mass of Christians” do not keep that seventh day which is spoken of in Gen. 2 and Ex. 20. Without entering at all into the controversy as to the correctness or lawfulness of the change from that day to another, we are compelled to inquire: Is the change so clearly laid down in the Scriptures, or another day so clearly enjoined, that a person must be an atheist to deny that change? We will draw the answer to this question from the most orthodox authorities, without offering any opinion of our own, or giving any coloring either way to the testimony.

1. Dr. Buck’s Theological Dictionary says: “It must be confessed that there is no law in the New Testament concerning the first day.”

2. The Encyclopedia of McClintock & Strong uses the same language.

3. The Augsburg Confession says: “We find not the same commanded by any apostolical law.”

4. Dr. Heylyn, of England, in his History of the Sabbath, says: “For three hundred years there was neither law to bind them [the churches] to it, nor any rest from worldly labor required upon it.”

5. Dr. Scott’s Commentary says: “The change from the seventh to the first appears to have been gradually and silently introduced, by example rather than precept.”

6. The *Christian Union*, answering a question on the subject, said: “The Sabbath was changed from the seventh to the first day of the week, not by any positive authority, but by a gradual process.”

7. The *Inter-Ocean*, also answering a question, said: “The change of the day of worship from the Sabbath, or the last day of the week, to Sunday, the first day of the week, was done by the early Christians; but the work was so gradual that it is almost impossible to tell when the one left off and the other began. It was not until after the Reformation that the change was confirmed by any legal enactment. In the first ages after Christ it does not appear that the Christians abstained from their regular business upon that day, but they were accustomed to meet early in the day, and indulged in singing and some other religious services. It was not until the beginning of the third century that it became customary for Christians to abstain from their worldly business and occupation on that day.”

8. Dr. C. S. Robinson, in the *Sunday School Times*, said: “It is not wise to base the entire Sabbath [Sunday] argument on the fourth precept of the decalogue. ... We shall become perplexed if we attempt to rest our case on simple legal enactment. Our safety in such discussions consists in our fastening attention upon the gracious and benevolent character of the divine institution.” But, query. Is not that an evasion? Doubtless the Seventh-day Baptists would not disagree with him upon the “benevolent character of the divine institution,” but they would ask him to open the Bible and show them what is “the divine institution.”

9. The *Christian at Work *says: “Some plant the observance of the Sabbath [Sunday] squarely on the fourth commandment, which was an explicit injunction to observe Saturday, and no other day, as ‘a holy day to the Lord.’ So some have tried to build the observance of Sunday upon apostolic command, whereas the apostles gave no command upon the matter. . . . The truth is, so soon as we appeal to the *litera scripta* [plain text] of the Bible, the Sabbatarians have the best of the argument.”

It is true that others claim more than this in the behalf of the first day; but it only serves to show that the subject of a change is so obscure that they cannot at all agree among themselves! We could greatly multiply testimonies like the above, but these are quite sufficient for our purpose, showing as clearly as can be shown that the Seventh-day Baptists, in their observance of the seventh day, do not walk contrary to any fact or precept of the Bible, but rather have the *litera scripta *of the commandment on their side, and thus, on Biblical grounds, “have the best of the argument.” And yet for the accident of clinging to the exact language of the Bible, and thereby disagreeing with these *model reformers*, they are boldly branded as atheists!

Now comes in a most interesting query: When the Constitution is religiously amended, what shall be done with these people who presume to disregard “the traditions of the elders,” who are so perversely atheistical as to stand upon the *litera scripta *of the decalogue? Dr. Edwards has given us definite information on this subject. He speaks thus for the body, for it has published his address to the world, and others of their number have spoken much in the same strain. He said:—

> “What are the rights of the atheist? I would tolerate him as I would tolerate a poor lunatic, for in my view his mind is scarcely sound. So long as he does not rave, so long as he is not dangerous, I would tolerate him. I would tolerate him as I would a conspirator. The atheist is a dangerous man. He not only rejects and opposes my faith, but he aims to overthrow every institution, and to dissolve every relationship growing out of my faith. He would destroy the very foundations, pull down everything, and build up nothing. But he shall be tolerated. He may live and go free, hold his lands and enjoy his home; he may even vote; but for any higher, more advanced citizenship he is, as I hold, utterly disqualified.”

The reader must remember that this language is applied to the Jew and the Seventh-day Baptist. They and atheists are “one party.” They are all “counted together.” They must “be treated as one party.” And how very gracious these “mild-mannered” reformers are! The poor Seventh-day Baptist may be tolerated as a lunatic or conspirator may be tolerated. He may even “live and go free, and hold his lands and enjoy his home,” if he “*does not rave*.” Let him hold his peace; [35] let him hide his knowledge of the *litera scripta *of the ten commandments, for woe be to him if he crosses the track of “*my faith*”!

We grow more and more distrustful of humanity when we read the literature of that people, and see their unblushing effrontery in declaring that a Religious Amendment to the National Constitution is necessary “to secure the rights of all classes.” Can they possibly think that the people are so blind that they cannot perceive the deception which is being practiced? that they cannot discover the enemy of equal rights lurking under these specious pretenses? We pity those who cannot see this. We must blame those who will not see the danger impending, or who are in any wise instrumental in precipitating such a calamity upon our country. They are not asking for protection, for this they now have most fully; *they are seeking for power*. And their own avowals prove that if ever they get the power they seek, this land will cease to be “the land of the free.” J. H. W.
