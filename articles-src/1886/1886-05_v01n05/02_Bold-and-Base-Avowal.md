# Bold and Base Avowal

With the self-styled National Reformers the name of “Rev. Dr. Jonathan Edwards,” of Illinois, stands very high. And we ask no better evidence that it will not do to intrust civil authority to the hands of ecclesiastics, than the fact that the most eminent professors of Christianity, even those to whom their fellows look up with reverence, often assume the most overbearing demeanor when asserting what they claim as their special prerogatives. We would not be misunderstood in this expression. We would as readily trust to their hands the exercise of the functions of government as to the hands of any others, as long as they will confine their actions to the sphere for which civil Governments exist. It is only when they assert their right to enforce their theological ideas that they are self-asserting and arrogant.

Dr. Edwards delivered an address at the National Convention of the “Reformers,” held in New York in 1873. In this address are a number of things worthy of notice; but one portion of it, which we now consider, is particularly offensive to all who have any regard for the rights of our common humanity, as it is contrary to the spirit of Christianity as taught by Christ and his apostles.

First, we will notice an error into which all these reformers run by confounding civil with religious rights and privileges. In fact, they draw no line between them, as we have before shown. As the Government deals with us in civil matters, so would they deal with their opponents in matters of religion. Thus he speaks:—

> “We may not buy a lot among the fine houses of Broadway, or the fashionable avenues of New York, and there set up and operate a foundry, a tin shop, a bone-boiling establishment, or a soap chandlery. If we try it we shall find both ourselves and our business treated as a nuisance. People do not like the smoke, the noise, the fumes of such establishments. The majority are against you, and in this country and in all republics majorities govern. To be in a minority involves more or less of inconvenience. In business, in politics, in fashion, in morals, and in religion, whoever differs materially from the majority will certainly be made to feel it more or less in due time.”

Were the blasphemer and the hardened scoffer to place our religious rights and privileges on a level with the right to erect a tin shop or a foundry in a certain locality, or were such an one to class our religion with worldly business, with politics, or the fashions, we should not be so greatly surprised. After reading further from Dr. Edwards we can better measure the height and breadth of *his* religion; and some, perhaps, will even give him credit for consistency in making religion no more sacred than “a bone-boiling establishment or a soap chandlery.” that is, judging by the religion which he represents in his utterances. We do not hesitate to say that if the Government should deny us the right to boil bones or make soap *anywhere*, we should acquiesce and seek some other business. But if the same Government should insist that we deny the faith we hold and abstain from the practice of the religion we profess, we should dissent in the most emphatic terms. We would not yield our religious faith and practice for all the majorities the world can produce; we would not accept another in its stead, either in theory or practice, at the demand of the strongest Government or the most relentless tyrant. This is our declaration, and that of every genuine Christian in the land. We only ask for grace to maintain it.

Would Dr. Edwards yield his religion to the will of the majority, even as he now yields in many secular matters? Oh, no. That is no part of his scheme. It is not *his religion *of which he speaks when he subordinates religion to the will of majorities. It is *somebody else’s *religion; somebody’s religion which does not agree with his; it is somebody’s religion which he cannot control without the aid of the civil power!

But this is only the prelude to the avowal to which we specially call attention. In classifying those whom he considers enemies to their cause, he speaks as follows:—

> “The Atheist is a man who denies the being of a God and a future life. To him, mind and matter are the same, and time is the be-all and end-all of consciousness and of character.

> “The Deist admits God, but denies that he has any such control over human affairs as we call providence, or that he ever manifests himself and his will in a revelation.
> “The Jew admits God, providence, and revelation, but rejects the entire scheme of gospel redemption by Jesus Christ as sheer imagination, or—worse—sheer imposture.
> “The Seventh-day Baptists believe in God and Christianity, and are conjoined with the other members of this class by the accident of differing with the mass of Christians upon the question of what precise day of the week shall be observed as holy.
> “These all are, for the occasion, and as far as our amendment is concerned, one class. They use the same arguments and the same tactics against us. *They must be counted together*, which we very much regret, but which we cannot help. The first-named is the leader in the discontent and the outcry—the atheist, to whom nothing is higher or more sacred than man, and nothing survives the tomb. It is his class. Its labors are almost wholly in his interest; its success would be almost wholly his triumph. [34] The rest are adjuncts to him in this contest. They must be named from him; they must be treated as, for this question, one party.”
Every one who has any knowledge of the Seventh-day Baptists, either in regard to their *history* or to their *principles*, must set down the above utterances of Dr. Edwards as not only uncharitable but unchristian. They were the conservators of religious freedom at a time when there was much danger of a permanent union of Church and State in New England. More than to all others, we verily believe, it was to those of that faith that Rhode Island owed her liberality to all sects of Christians, so far in advance of the other colonies at an early day. The Seventh-day Baptists of Rhode Island and the Baptists of Virginia left to this country a legacy of the principles of both civil and religious liberty, for which we have reason to be thankful even at the present day.

But the ill-will—we might in truth say the malice—of Dr. Edwards towards them arises from the “accident of [their] differing with the mass of Christians upon the question of what precise day of the week shall be observed as holy.” We doubt the propriety of calling that an “accident” which grows out of conviction and intention. It is not our desire to enter into a discussion of the subject thus laid open by the National Reformers in their statement of the objects of their movement; but this affords us an excellent opportunity to show the spirit of this professed reform, and what we may expect at their hands if they ever get control of our Government. Dr. Edwards admits that the Seventh-day Baptists believe in God and Christianity; and we affirm that he would be unable to find in their faith an item which is not considered orthodox by large bodies of Christians in the land, except in the case of the “accident” mentioned. Our readers may query, as we do in all seriousness, if the fact of their observing the original day of the Sabbath—the identical day which all concede was embodied in the fourth commandment of the decalogue—is a good and sufficient reason for classing them with atheists.

There is not a single point of religious belief upon which there is entire uniformity of faith among the churches; why, then, should a difference on this point be singled out and branded as atheism? The National Reformers affiliate with the Unitarians, who differ with them materially on the nature and divinity of Christ. They speak well of the Catholics, expecting yet to work together with them in their pretended reform, though the Catholics do not recognize them as being any part of the Church of Christ, and they openly and habitually deny in faith and practice the second commandment, which forbids adoration of images. These appear to be immaterial errors, while the observance of the seventh day of the week is branded as atheism, though the observers are confessed to be orthodox in every other respect!

We take up two declarations of these reformers, namely, that the Bible shall be recognized as the supreme rule of conduct in the nation, and that the ten commandments shall be acknowledged as the rule of morality in our Government. Is it a fact that the practice of the Seventh-day Baptists in observing the seventh day is such a wide and manifest departure from the Bible and the ten commandments, that they may with reason be called atheists? Every school-boy who is taught in the Bible knows that it says that “God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it.” So far it is according to the Bible. And every school-boy knows that the commandment says. “The seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God.” Thus it is “according to the commandment.”
