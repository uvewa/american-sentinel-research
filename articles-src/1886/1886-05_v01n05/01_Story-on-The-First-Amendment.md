# Story on The First Amendment

Judge Story, in his “Exposition of the Constitution,” speaks thus of the object of the First Amendment:—

> “The same policy which introduced into the Constitution the prohibition of any religious test, led to this more extended prohibition of the interference of Congress in religious concerns. We are not to attribute this prohibition of a national religious establishment to an indifference to religion in general, and especially to Christianity (which none could hold in more reverence than the framers of the Constitution), but to a dread by the people of the influence of ecclesiastical power in matters of Government; a dread which their ancestors brought with them from the parent country, and which, unhappily for human infirmity, their own conduct, after their emigration, had not, in any just degree, tended to diminish. It was also obvious, *from the numerous and powerful sects existing in the United States, that there would be perpetual temptations to struggles for ascendency in the National councils*, if any one might thereby hope to found a permanent and exclusive national establishment of its own; and religious persecutions might thus be introduced, to an extent utterly subversive of the true interests and good order of the Republic. The most effectual mode of suppressing the evil in the view of the people, was, to strike down the temptations to its introduction.”

Many express sympathy with the position of the Sentinel, who yet consider that our work is of little use because the effort to secure a Religious Amendment to our national Constitution will never amount to anything. That is because they do not know the strength of the National Association which is laboring to secure it. They will wake up to their mistake not many years hence.

> “Let those who imagine that a nation can be made Christian by incorporating the letter of a Christian creed into its Constitution, remember the lessons of history. The worst despotisms that have ever cursed the world, were administered in the name, and by the assumed authority, of God.”—*N. Y. Tribune.*
