The "Reformers" refer to God's Government for Israel, and the kingdom of Christ, as if that which they seek were in harmony with the former, and is the bringing in of the latter. We purpose to show that they err in both respects. Their movement is merely a human device to compass selfish ends. There is nothing in the Scriptures to justify it.
