We here present some more matter for the "Clashing Voices" column of the *Christian Statesman*. In the Pittsburgh National Reform Convention, Rev. A. A. Hodge, D. D., said:—

> "If the Christian majority prevail and maintain Christian institutions, the infidel minority will be just where they have always been, in the exact position in which they voluntarily accepted citizenship."

And yet Rev. W. J. Coleman, one of the District Secretaries of the National Reform Association, says:—

> "The existence of a Christian Constitution would disfranchise every logically consistent infidel."

And Rev. J. C. K. Milligan, in speaking of the results of the Amendment, to infidels, says:—

> "The worst result would be to disfranchise them."

In the New York Convention Rev. John Hogg said:—

> "Jesus said, 'Whosoever believeth in me shall never die;' and what is true of an individual is also true of a nation. The nation that takes hold upon God and the Lord Jesus shall never die. (Applause.) ... If we mean to live, we must have it [the Constitution] imbued with a divine life. . . . Let us acknowledge God as our Father, and Sovereign, and Source of all good, and his blessing will be upon us. Crime and corruption will come to an end, and the benign reign of Jesus, our rightful Lord, will be established. (Applause.)"

In the same convention Rev. A. M. Milligan said:—

> "Becoming a kingdom of our Lord and his Christ, we shall fill the earth and endure forever."

And yet in the *Christian Statesman* of July 15, here comes Rev. J. P. Lytle, D. D., in the Convention at Wooster, Ohio, the very latest, and says:—

> "Nations are not chosen to everlasting life; . . . they have no spiritual union with Christ; and they shall all eventually go down to the 'sides of the pit' of destruction, and 'hell will be moved to meet them at their coming,' as it was for Egypt, and Babylon, and Tyrus, and Assyria."

We wish Rev. M. A. Gault, who manages the "Clashing Voices" business, would turn his attention to these. We should like very much to know how all these men can be telling the truth. Or, are we to understand that the National Reformers adopt the maxim of Mahomet, that "all contradiction is removed by the rule that any text is abrogated or modified by any subsequent passage"?
