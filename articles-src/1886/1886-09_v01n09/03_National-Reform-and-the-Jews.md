# National Reform and the Jews

That such persons as Jews, and others with ourselves, who do not believe the doctrine of Covenanters on the headship of Christ, would be eliminated from the enjoyment of civil communion, so far as actual citizenship—the use of the elective franchise—holding office, etc., is concerned, by the insertion of the second amendment, is not only our inference, but that of Reformers themselves. Hear what a Reformer said in a public speech at Zanesville, Ohio, Oct. 1, 1872. After recounting the conscientious difference between the Jew and himself in reference to religion, especially relative to Christ, he says in regard to the Jew:—

> “Well, what have been the consequences of following the lead of such a conscience?—This —that God has said the Jew shall not be a nation longer; he shall not have power to make a civil government; he shall not constitute a majority anywhere. He shall have no king but Cesar. Now, then, if God will not allow the Jew to make civil governments, or to exist in a national capacity, and this, too, for his sin against the Author of Christianity, shall the Christians go to him to learn how to make a constitution, what to put in it, and what to leave out? As for the Jew, when our Christian Amendment is adopted, he can sit in his store, and buy and sell, and make himself rich. He can enjoy all the comforts of domestic relations, [68] and will be protected by the law in all his rights as a citizen, and if he chooses to swear support to a constitution which he does not like (as some monarchists in principle do now, but which I would not advise him to do) he can also hold office, if he can find enough people to think him worthy of it.”

We cannot help stopping in the midst of this extract, and exclaiming, Magnanimous, *very*! Put the Jew under civil disabilities, and then *suggest *he can *violate *his *conscience *if he deems proper, and under these auspicious (?) circumstances why, “if he can find enough people to think him worthy he can also hold office!” Glorious privilege, indeed! Excellent exhibition of Christian charity for the conversion of the Jew! But we are not done with the extract. He says further:—

> “And if he does not choose to vote or hold office under a Christian Constitution, he can abstain, and it will not hurt him nor injure any one else. He will then be merely where God has put him, without power to exercise civil authority.”

We had thought that the arguments to sustain African slavery were dead and buried. But, to our amazement, we have them here resurrected, and animated with new life and vigor, and sent forth on a new mission. Before the trumpet of the American jubilee sounded in the ears of Africa’s sable sons, were they not where God put them? Was not the Bible ransacked to find some *sin* of their ancestors that would justify the infliction of the *wrongs* of slavery? Was not the origin of the race burlesqued by the Scottish bard,

## “How graceless Ham laughed at his dad,

## Which made Canaan a nigger,”

The only argument in the mouths of thousands, to justify the enslaving of colored men, the supposed descendants of Canaan the son of Ham? These arguments were again and again torn to shreds by a common-sense logic, that the humiliation of a people, though foretold in Scriptures, would never justify others in the infliction of wrong, unless they were the divinely constituted executioners of Heaven’s vengeance. Strange indeed, that these same arguments should become potent again in the mind of any one to justify the imposition of civil disabilities upon the Jew, because his ancestors, some nearly two thousand years ago, in religious frenzy, crucified the promised Messiah! Did the unnatural act of Jacob’s sons in selling their young brother, justify the Egyptians in treating their descendants cruelly? God’s terrible judgments on that nation contain the answer. We rejoice that our national escutcheon is not stained, like that of old England, with the persecution of the Jew. Here he is treated as a man, and offered the same privileges as others.

From the above we take it as an admitted fact—admitted by the advocates of the measure themselves, that were the amendments inserted, some would either have to violate their conscience, or surrender their civil privileges.— *Rev. Wm. Ballantine.*

The creation of a national and uncompromising church led the Congregationalists of Massachusetts to the indulgence of the passions which disgraced their English persecutors, and Laud was justified by the men whom he wronged .”—*Bancroft*.
