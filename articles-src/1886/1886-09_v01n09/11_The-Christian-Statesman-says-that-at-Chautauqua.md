The *Christian Statesman* says that at Chautauqua Dr. Vincent, Chancellor of Chautauqua University, "intimated his dissent from the views of National Reformers." That only shows Dr. Vincent's wisdom and love of human right. The difficulty with us is to see how any one who has any regard for the principles of Christianity, or for natural right, can do anything but "dissent from the views of National Reformers."
