As evidence of the favor with which the Sentinel is being received we may mention that from the beginning there have been printed ten thousand copies of each number, all of which have been taken, and to supply further demand we have been obliged to print one thousand copies extra of each of the back numbers. So send in the orders. Back numbers from Number One to the present can be furnished in any quantity desired. Nearly *one hundred thousand copies *of the Sentinel used in nine months represents an influence, and an amount of work, that is truly gratifying to the friends of the cause in defense of which it was established.
