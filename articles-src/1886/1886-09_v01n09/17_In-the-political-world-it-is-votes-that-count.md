In the political world it is votes that count. The man who can "control" votes is always in demand, and is always sure of office so long as his "influence" lasts. The man who can control the largest number of votes, can get the largest office. So it will be in the "new dispensation," which the National Reformers propose to bring in. Since religion will be upheld by the State, in accordance, not with the will of the people, but, with the will of those who "control" the votes of the people, position in the church, as in the State, will be determined by one's ability to "influence" votes. Imagine Peter asking the leaders of the "National Reform" party, "What shall we have?" The reply, unspoken, perhaps, would necessarily be something like this: "That depends upon your success as a politician; if you can control 300 votes you may have a clerkship; if you can control 700 votes you may be pastor of a city church with the privilege of going to Congress; and if you can control 10,000 votes you may be bishop, and brevet-corrector of heretics?" Perhaps we have not the correct scale, for we don't know how such service is usually paid, but the principle is there.
