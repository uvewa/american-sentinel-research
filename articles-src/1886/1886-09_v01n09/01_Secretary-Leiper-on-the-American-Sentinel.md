# Secretary Leiper” on the “American Sentinel

The “National Reform Association” has some paid traveling agents or lecturers who, for some reason not apparent, are called “Secretaries.” Among these is Mr. J. H. Leiper. In the columns of the *Christian Statesman *he noticed the American Sentinel. But when he wrote his comment he had seen only the March number, and appears to have read that quite superficially; and of course he knew but little of the position of the Sentinel, and of the arguments which it contains. In this we have a great advantage over him. We have been acquainted with the *Statesman* for a number of years. We had the opportunity of attending their National Convention in Pittsburg, Pa., in 1874, which they consider of greater interest than any other they ever held. We have watched their movement with deep interest from its very inception in 1863. Having had but little public opposition, they have considered their positions invulnerable, and themselves almost infallible and Heaven-appointed teachers of a new science of Christian Government. It is this feeling of self-complacency or self-conceit that leads Mr. Leiper to say of the position of the Sentinel that it grows out of “voluntary darkness or willful infidelity.” We think the *Statesman* or its correspondents (the *Statesman* itself noticed us courteously) will find it much easier to bring such “railing accusations” against the Sentinel than to refute its arguments. This first effort, that of Mr. Leiper, is a sad failure to refute our positions, and even to comprehend them.

Mr. Leiper quotes from the Sentinel wherein it was shown that “if a question arises as to what is or what is not Christian law, usage, or institution, it must be determined by a court of justice. There is no disputing this conclusion, and yet it is a conclusion which ought to startle every one who contemplates such a change in our Government as would make such a proceeding possible.” Now we still believe that the idea of settling religious questions in the courts of our States and Nation is, and should be, startling to all who have a just regard for our civil and religious liberties. Mr. Leiper does not attempt to show that our conclusion is unjust; he does not question the propriety of settling religious disputes in our civil courts; but he attempts to justify their efforts to bring about such a state of things, and uses the following language:—

> “What a startling thing it must have been for Nehemiah, the governor, to undertake to teach the traffickers in wines, grapes, and figs, etc., a lesson based on the Fourth Commandment. . . . What a crank Jonah was to undertake the audacious folly of preaching politics,” etc.

We think it has been sufficiently shown in the Sentinel, that the theocratic Government of Israel, with its necessary union of Church and State (for a theocracy must be a religious government), is no model for any government since that dispensation. Does Mr. Leiper consider that, if the amendment is adopted, they will elect men to the position occupied by Nehemiah? Do these “reformers” think that, in the Government of their choice, they will occupy the position of the prophets of old? If they affect such a thing they will have to give such evidences of their calling as they have never yet shown. If they do not intend to assume the office and position of the prophets, why do they make such references as this of Mr. Leiper? There is more of arrogance than argument in such words as those he uses.

And Jonah did not “preach politics.” He did not attempt to remodel the Government of Nineveh, nor did he seek for any place or office in its administration. He received a message directly from the Lord; he gave that, and that only, without any personal interference with the affairs of the Government. We fail to see any parallel to the work of the self-styled National Reformers, in that of Jonah. And we do not think they can show that any parallel exists. Such references may be captivating to those who but superficially examine these subjects, but they contain no argument whatever.

We have a lesson to read to the National Reformers which we learned from the action of the church authorities, controlling the civil power, in Salem, Mass. If they had read this lesson of history to any purpose they would cease to refer, for a warrant, to those whose position and circumstances were so different from their own.

## Religion without the church.

This point is a hobby with the Amendmentists. Concerning it Mr. Leiper says:—

> “If the Sentinel and many others had the wisdom to distinguish between the church and religion—between protection and usurpation, it might avoid many of its blunders.”

This is said in the effort to ward off the just charge that they are trying to unite the Church and the State. They say; not the State and the Church, but, the State and religion. But this distinction does not exist in fact, and is not regarded by Mr. Leiper and the party which he represents. This we will now prove. He speaks of our writing as follows:—

> “J. H. W. stumbles at an utterance of Rev. [66] J. M. Foster in *Christian Statesman*, of March, 1884: ‘According to the Scriptures, the State and its sphere exist for the sake of and to serve the interests of the Church.’ This statement J. H. W. emphatically denies. As a believer in the Bible, how will he undertake to expound Isa. 49:23 and 60:12, in accord with his views of the relation of Church and State? Does he know how to read history?” etc.

With expositions of prophecy we have not now to do. We have shown, and will continue to show, that this “Reform” party entirely misapprehends the difference between the past and present dispensations. In the above quotation it will be seen that Mr. Leiper, following Rev. J. M. Foster, utterly ignores the distinction which he says we have not the wisdom to distinguish; and he reveals the “true inwardness” of the National Reform movement. Mark, they do not say the State exists to serve the interests of religion; but, “the State exists for the sake of and *to serve the interests of *the Church.”

The truth is that religion and the Church are inseparably connected. Religion cannot exist without religious people. Christianity cannot exist where there are no Christians; and Christians, wherever found, constitute the Christian Church. If the Nation is to serve the cause of religion, it must by some means determine *what* religion or whose religion shall be enforced by the State. Will the Amendment party have the Nation set aside the churches, and adopt a religion to suit the people outside of the churches? Will they consent to thus distinguish between religion and the Church, in the action of the Government? Let the *Statesman* answer. In its issue of March 21, 1884, Rev. J. C. K. Milligan uses the following language:—

> “If our Nation will accept God as the source of all authority, Christ Jesus as the Nation’s king, and his law as of supreme authority over them, its creed is orthodox. The theological questions referred to do not belong to the Nation as a civil organism, nor to our movement, which is a civil and not an ecclesiastical one; *the churches must settle these questions *among themselves and with each other, and at least *we will not allow the civil Government *to decide between them, and to ordain church doctrines, ordinances, and laws.”

But the very life and essence of *religion *is found in church doctrines, ordinances, and laws. None but a Jesuit would pretend to distinguish between the true religion and the doctrines, ordinances, and laws of the true Church. In the above extract we have the plan of our future Government outlined by the Amendmentists themselves. The State must uphold or enforce the true religion—always noting the distinction between religion and the Church, but —“the churches must settle these questions” of theology, or define the religion which the State must enforce! It is the sphere of the State to serve the interests of the Church, and to “adhere to, defend, and maintain the true religion,” the churches always deciding what is the true religion. This is no union of Church and State—oh, no. There is a wide distinction; the State is only the servant of the Church, and it is the office of the Church to dictate to the State what “usages, laws, and institutions” of religion it must maintain! How wonderful is the logical acumen of the Religious Amendmentists! What a nice distinction they can trace, which none but themselves have “the wisdom to distinguish”! We do not accuse Mr. Leiper of intending to deceive his readers. We believe that he himself is deceived by the deceitfulness of the theory which he is endeavoring to maintain.

And to make more full proof of his blindness he says that we do not distinguish “between protection and usurpation.” But this is the very distinction we have made, and to which we have tried to call the attention of the Amendmentists. In the May number of the Sentinel we said of them: “They are not asking for protection, for this they now have most fully;* they are seeking for power*.” The truth is that *protection* is now assured by our Government to these religionists, but with this they are not satisfied; they are not content to have the Government protect them in their religious convictions and practices; they must needs *usurp* authority over the convictions and consciences of those who do not agree with them. The Amendmentists are the very ones who utterly ignore the distinction between protection and usurpation. But we plead for *protection for all*; and this they vigorously oppose, because they cannot bear the idea of seeing others equally favored with themselves.

EQUAL RIGHTS TO ALL.

Mr. Leiper continues his notice of us in the following language:—

> “But see how he stultifies himself in answer to the following question sent him: ‘Can laws which guard religious rights and protect religious privileges be considered oppressive to non-religionists?’ His answer is: ‘By no means.’ But the laws which have already created a hue and cry among the ranks of non-religionists are those that are designed to give rest to all citizens on the Sabbath, and the privilege to Christian people of worshiping God undisturbed in their homes or churches.”

We must differ with Mr. L. in his judgment of our answer. We are willing to trust the decision of every candid reader that we did not stultify ourself; in our answer we said:—

> “It is the duty of every Government to guard *all rights*, and to protect in the exercise of all privileges which may lawfully be exercised. This is not oppressive to the non-religionists. But religion is a *voluntary *matter; under coercion it is worthless and a mockery. That which is a privilege to one, being a matter of conscience, is no privilege to another whose conscience is not exercised in the same manner. A law to compel the non-religionist to observe religious rites and rules because they are privileges to his religious neighbor, is oppressive. It is injustice to the man and an injury to religion.

> “The duty of the Government is not exhausted when it has protected the rights of the religious. Governments are not established for the benefit of any one class of their subjects. It is no more the duty of the Government to protect the religionist, than it is its duty to protect the non-religionist. The non-religionist . . . has no right to disturb his neighbor, or hinder him from living out his religion; and his religious neighbor has no right to disturb him in the peaceful possession of his home because he is not religious; he has no right to compel him to observe religious rites in which he does not believe. Neither has any class of religionists any right to disturb others because they profess a religion different from their own. And it is equally the duty of the Government to protect them *all*, whatever their religion may be, or whether or not they have any at all.”
Dare Mr. Leiper or the *Statesman *copy this reply and deny our conclusion before its readers? We doubt; they may evade, and accuse us of self-stultification, by keeping our position from their readers. Our answer must commend itself to all who have any regard for *the rights of others*; who even approach to the moral duty of loving their neighbors as themselves. But it seems very plain that in this class the National Reformers are not included.

It seems impossible to make these self-styled reformers recognize the difference between morality and religion. In argument for “religious legislation “Mr. Leiper says:—

> “Such legislation will, as it should, provide for the protection of the family. But this implies marriage and divorce laws. Where would J. H. W. have us go for a safe guide in such legislation? The family is the nursery of the State, hence no laws of greater importance or farther reaching are enacted by any Government. . . . And has our objector not yet learned that the race is indebted to the religion of Christ for the pure blessing of the family?”

No, we have not learned it; and we invite Mr. Leiper to give evidence to that effect if he has it to give. We say, as we have before said, that it is the duty of the Government to enact marriage and divorce laws, because *marriage is not a Christian institution*. It antedates the fall of man and the introduction of a gospel system. Mr. Leiper is altogether at fault on the question. He really stands with the Catholics, who make marriage a Christian or Church ordinance. To be consistent he must deny that marriage is valid outside the Church. His position would deprive infidels and unbelievers of the privilege of marriage, for such have no right to the benefit of the ordinances of Christianity. But we dissent. It was an institution given to *the father of the race *before the fall, and belongs to the race without regard to their relation to Christianity. Speaking of our assertion that a civil government cannot enforce laws on a purely moral basis, Mr. Leiper says:—

> “Monogamy is a law of Christianity. Is it impossible to enforce it?”

This remark is both irrelevant and untrue. The Saviour, in his answer concerning divorce, placed the marriage institution on *its original basis*. He enacted nothing new in regard to it. He said: “Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives; *but from the beginning it was not so*. Matt. 19:8. In verses 4, 5, he shows to what this refers. He there says: “Have ye not read, that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female, and said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife; and they twain shall be one flesh? “Where had they “read” these statements? In Gen. 1:27, and 2:24. “In the beginning” God made them male and female—not male and females. They two—not they three or they five—shall be one flesh. A man shall leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave to his wife—not to his wives. Monogamy was embraced in the original marriage institution. It is not a law of Christianity; but the Saviour freed the law from the errors of tradition and restored it to its original position.

Mr. Leiper thinks that we evince wondrous ignorance of the origin and basis of civil government, [67] and that we “ignore the plainly taught Bible principle that civil government is a divine ordinance.” If he had read the several numbers of the Sentinel he would know the truth of that concerning which he is sadly ignorant. There is not a sentiment expressed or a word spoken in the Sentinel which at all implies that we ignore that fact. Besides frequent reference to the fact, at least two articles have been published on that subject. But Mr. Leiper and his *confreres *do evince great ignorance of *the true principles *of civil government, and of its relation to religion. We remember that Paul said, “There is *no power *but of God;” and that he and those to whom he wrote, and whom he exhorted to yield subjection to “the higher powers,” were the subjects of a king, and not citizens of a republic; and that this king was a Pagan and not a Christian ruler. And Peter said: “Honor the king.” We know all this; but this does not prove the correctness of the conclusions of the National Reformers. They openly refuse to honor, and deny the authority of, the civil Government unless it is molded and modeled to their peculiar notions. There is not a word in the New Testament to justify their position.

We have here noticed the main points of Mr. Leiper’s comments on the Sentinel. Some other assertions of his we may notice in the future. J. H. W.
