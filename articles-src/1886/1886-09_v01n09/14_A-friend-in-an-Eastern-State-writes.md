A friend in an Eastern State writes:—

> "I am more and more satisfied with the American Sentinel. Some fears were entertained that it might not be kept up to the standing of its first numbers, but all such fears are dispelled. The July number is fully equal to the preceding ones. I wish it all success, for it cannot fail to do much good."
