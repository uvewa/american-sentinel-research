Now that the women, especially the leaders in the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, are making themselves especially prominent in the advocacy of the National Reform movement, we shall be compelled in opposing it, to oppose them *so far as they are connected with it*, but no farther. We are sorry to have to do even this much, for it seems almost ungallant, but by their actions necessity is laid upon us. We shall, however, always remember that they are ladies, and treat them as such; while, at the same time, condemning *in toto *the National Reform doctrines and their support of them, and opposing, by all honorable means, all effort for the advancement of that cause.
