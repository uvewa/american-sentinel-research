**THE PURPOSE OF THE "LAW."**

The following, recently printed in the *Leamington Post*, a paper published in Essex County, Ontario, shows very plainly the purpose of the amendment to the so-called Lord's day act of that Province:—

Speaker's Chamber,
Legislative Assembly,
Toronto, April 3rd, 1896.

To _____, Esq., Blythewood:

My Dear Sir,—I have been finally enabled to get a bill through the legislature prohibiting farmers from working on the sabbath day. I trust this will have the effect desired in regard to the second Adventists who have been giving some annoyance in your neighborhood.
Yours respectfully,
W. D. BALFOUR.

As "the intent of the law-makers is the law," there can be no question as to the "law" for Sabbatarians in Ontario. They must observe the legal "sabbath" or suffer for it. Bigotry has so decreed and legislators have so voted.
