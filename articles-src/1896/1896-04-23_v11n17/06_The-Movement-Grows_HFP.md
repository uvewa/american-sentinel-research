THE MOVEMENT GROWS.

Adherents Numbered by Millions.

WHAT movement grows?—The movement that looks to the enforcement of Christ by religio-political methods; the movement that proposes to bring in a reign of "righteousness" by force of civil law and the policeman's club; the movement that proposes to make the polling places "holy ground," and turn politicians into "saints;" the movement that is now, even as in the earlier centuries, instilling the virus of the poisonous doctrine of a false theocracy into the minds of the masses; the movement that proposes to make a legal Christianity easy by removing all obstacles and crosses, and the road to ruin so hard that no sinner will dare to go in the broad road; and so bring in the temporal millennium.

The organ of the National Reformers, in 1887, said:

The political aim of Christianity is to bring forth a time in which Christianity shall control the caucus, religion shall control the politics, the politicians shall be saints, and the polls, holy ground.

In the same year, the Woman's Christian Temperance Union voiced the same thing in national convention, as follows: "The kingdom of Christ must enter the realm of law [force] through the gateway of politics." And in 1886, they said: "A true theocracy is yet to come, and the enthronement of Christ in law and law-makers." At that time the movement attracted little attention.

According to the statement of Mr. Buell, Chief of Church Statistics in Eleventh United States census, at this time nearly all the religious organizations in the land have allied themselves to the movement, so that its friends from these sources may be numbered by many ten thousands. And, as a sample of how the so-called Protestant churches are voicing the same thing, and giving their influence to the movement, we give here a quotation from a sermon recently delivered by a minister of St. Paul, Minn., as follows:—

The millions of Christian people in this country and the other millions of patriotic people allied with them in spirit, if not in name, are coming to see as never before, that the kingdom of God, which is the reign of law, of reason and of righteousness, is not to be postponed to some far celestial future, but is to be realized here and now in just laws, honest politics, clean business, and a social state in which all shall get their rights and none shall be wronged.

This is an alluring picture; one to be cherished if only it were true. But it is the one song of "peace and safety" from first to last. And the word of the eternal One is that "when they shall say peace and safety, then sudden destruction cometh upon them, . . . and they shall not escape." And the rapid increase and present volume of the movement gives evidence that the great crisis is very near at hand, and the destruction even now pending.
