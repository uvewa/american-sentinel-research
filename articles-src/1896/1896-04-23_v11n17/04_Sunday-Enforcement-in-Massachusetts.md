SUNDAY ENFORCEMENT IN MASSACHUSETTS.

A LETTER received April 14, from Mr. W. T. Gibson, of Everitt, Mass., shows how the spirit of Sunday enforcement is manifesting itself in that section of the country. Mr. Gibson relates that on Sunday, April 5, he was doing some work on a chimney on the top of a building located at the intersection of Thorndyke and Robbins Streets, Everitt, when he was hailed by a policeman from the sidewalk on Robbins Street, and an interesting dialogue followed. We quote from Mr. Gibson's letter:

Officer.—Gibson, do you build chimneys Sundays?
I said, I am pointing it.
O.—Been working all day?
Yes, sir.

O.—How long have you worked Sundays?
For eighteen years.
O.—Well, you must stop this Sunday work.
I said, I think not; I am not disturbing any one. I cannot keep two days, and am not going to.
O.—You come down here.
I kept at work all the time.
He walked around to the front entrance on Thorndyke Street, and with loud voice demanded, "Gibson, come down here," several times.
I made no reply.
He then came up, as I suppose, to the top floor, and said, "Gibson"!
I said, What, sir?
O.—You must stop work.
I said, I think not. You have no right to stop my working.
O.—Do you think so?
I said, Yes, sir; and if it were a matter that I considered you had a right to demand of me, I would willingly obey you. I have a right to earn my living.
O.—Will you stop work?
I said, I do not think so.
O.—Well, if you don't, I will put you in court tomorrow.
I replied, Well, I cannot help it if you do.
He went down, and I finished my work.

Mr. Gibson expected to be summoned before the court on the following day, but up to the time of writing had not been informed of any legal proceedings against him.

Mr. Gibson was prosecuted in December, 1894, for keeping a small store open on Sunday. He was fined fifty dollars and costs on that occasion, but no effort has been made to collect the money, nor has Mr. Gibson been imprisoned in lieu thereof.
