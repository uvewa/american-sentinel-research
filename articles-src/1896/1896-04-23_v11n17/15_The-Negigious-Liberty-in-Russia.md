## THE NEGIGIOUS LIBERTY IN RUSSIA.

[New York Independent, April 10, 1896.]

Just what the Russian State and Church think of religious liberty can be learned from the court proceedings at Ufa, where recently the young people were charged with having denied the Orthodox faith and become Mohammedans. The defendants declared that they had never been Christians and did not want to be, and the investigation of the officials showed that their parents had indeed, many years ago, submitted to forced baptism and were entered in the church records as converts, but that the accused had been reared as Mohammedans. On the basis of existing laws the church declared that they had been guilty of a denial of Christianity, and decreed that they should be put into a cloister, and that their property should be confiscated until they would return to the Christian religion. Essentially the same principles of procedure and laws are in vogue in the dealings of the Orthodox Church with the Protestants of the three Baltic Provinces.
