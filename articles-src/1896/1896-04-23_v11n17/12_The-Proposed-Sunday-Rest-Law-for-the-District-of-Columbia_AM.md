**THE PROPOSED SUNDAY REST LAW FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.**

Discussing the proposed Sunday "law" for the District of Columbia, Mr. Allen Moon, President of the International Religious Liberty Association, says in the Washington Star of the 8th inst:—

"I and a multitude of others are compelled to dissent from the views presented by the Rev. Dr. Elliott. I am pleased to know that the gentleman agrees with me on so many points presented in my former letter. I take it that he agrees with me on all points not controverted. But how he can find in the expression 'Sunday's excepted' a recognition of Sunday, and a precedent for enacting Sunday 'laws,' is rather difficult to conceive. The Constitution nowhere says the President shall rest on Sunday, nor does it say that Congress may enact that the President shall rest on Sunday, nor that he shall not sign any bill on Sunday, but simply in the count of days Sunday shall be a dies non. . . . There is a wide difference between Congress legislating that every man shall observe a sabbath and leaving him free to do that which may be, and is with many, a matter of faith.

The Declaration of Independence asserts that men have inalienable rights, and that governments are instituted to secure these rights, not to invade them. The convention that framed the Constitution had a perfect right to adjourn over Sunday, but by this act it did not obligate Congress to compel all men to follow its example in observing the day. The individual members of the convention might be believers in the Sunday institution and regard it for themselves, but it would have been tyranny for them to have enforced their religious practice upon the people of the nation.

It is a sufficient answer to Dr. Elliott's question as to whether the District government did enact sectarian laws to say that no human government is infallible, and laws have been enacted, even in this land of liberty, that have resulted in sending Christian men to prison and the chain-gang for no crime whatever, except that they had violated the religious sentiment of the people that had been enacted into law.

The chief object of the pending bill is to get Congress committed in favor of the religious sentiment of the people as regards the Sunday institution. Let us see how this bill would affect the liberty of the whole community. After the prohibitions of the bill, the second section provides that it shall be a sufficient defense to a prosecution for servile labor on the first day of the week that the defendant uniformly keeps another day of the week as a day of rest. There is no guarantee that the man who observes another day shall not be arrested on Sunday and locked up until Monday, and then be brought before the court to make a defense. I want to ask, is it in harmony with liberty that American citizens and Christians should thus be subjected to arrest and arraignment, and be compelled to prove that they observe another sabbath, in order to be exempt from the operations of a religious law? And also that the labor complained of was done in such a manner as not to interrupt or disturb other persons in the observance of the first day of the week as a day of rest. When people have a law in their favor they will be disturbed, if they have to turn detective and go spying into windows to see if they cannot find something to disturb them, as several gentlemen have reported having done the last few Sundays past. This is not the worst feature of this clause, for there is no provision whatever for the man who has no religious convictions. If he cannot set up the defense provided for in the bill, he must meekly submit and keep the religious day, whether he will or not. There is no liberty in it; it is monopoly. We must not be disturbed; the State must protect us in every minutia, is the spirit of this measure. I am a Christian, but I believe that the God-given right of every man is inalienable.

The bill being religious and only religious, it follows conclusively that Congress is positively forbidden by the first amendment to have anything at all to do with it, for that such is the intent of the first amendment is evident from the following consideration: Amid the discussion and the interesting and important events that immediately preceded and, in fact, led up to the making of the Constitution as it is as respects religion, this whole question was widely discussed, and James Madison published these "letter words: 'We hold it for a fundamental, undeniable truth that religion or . . . which we owe to our Creator, and the . . . of discharging it, can be directed only . . . reason and conviction, not by force or violence. The religion, then, of every man must be left to the conviction and conscience of every man, and it is the right of every man to exercise it as these may dictate.' For these and other reasons we protest against the proposed District Sunday bill."
