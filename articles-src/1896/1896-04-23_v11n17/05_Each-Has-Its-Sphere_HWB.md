EACH HAS ITS SPHERE.

[By H. W. Bowman, in A. P. A. Magazine for April.]

The church and civil society are two vast organizations, essentially different as to their origin, the object they have in view, and the means of obtaining that object. The church is drawn together for moral improvement and spiritual benefit; the State is a necessary mutual association to promote the civic welfare of the people.

The church instituted by Christ Jesus is founded upon revelation. The sense in which every civic society acknowledges God as its author is—it was the original will of God that men, for their own happiness and protection, should unite themselves and form the various civil societies such as exist in the world. The papal dogma that makes the church, as the exponent of God's will, the basis of civil society, is false and pernicious. The true origin of civil society is the compact of union, and submission to a supreme power; and it is from this compact that all the rights of civil society arise. Or, in the words of the wise statesmen of America, "All governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed."

The principles of church government and State government are dissimilar. The institutions are fundamentally so unlike that they cannot be blended without destroying the nature of one or both. For the civil ruler, the great and only essential qualification is to be able to wield the chief physical force of the community, whether the means of moral influences, or otherwise; for the church a superiority in spiritual graces—love, humility, wisdom and disinterestedness—is needed. In short, church authority and State authority rest on essentially different bases, require different qualifications, are recognized on different principles. Hence a union of church and State works an injury to both.

The chief object of the church is the moral reformation of sinners, and the establishment of believers in virtue. The discipline of the church relates to internal sentiments of the soul, rather than to any external actions. Now, as physical force does not produce internal sentiments, it follows that the church, in order to obtain its object, has no other means than instruction, exhortation, exercises piety, and sometimes the exclusion from spiritual privileges of contumacious or refractory members. The use of physical coercion does not belong to the sphere of its operation. Rome, in claiming the right to use force, violates a fundamental law of the Christian religion.

Civil society has for its object the preservation of public order, the attainment of justice, the establishment of law and the acquisition of the greatest temporal happiness to the individuals composing it. To obtain this object it refers solely to external acts, not to the internal sentiments of individuals. Civil laws, not moral ones, are the only kind it can enforce. The civil power is obliged to use force in obtaining its object. Policemen do not depend on moral suasion, nor preachers of the gospel upon the use of a club. Religion is not a subject of legislation by civil government, nor civil government a province of the church. Religious freedom does not mean religious despotism. If the church is left free to worship God according to the dictates of the individual conscience, it is not thereby granted the right to usurp the powers and prerogatives of the State and exercise them. God's law covers the realm of thought, man's law that of action. Covetousness is forbidden by God, yet the State cannot punish for it. But let one reach forth his hand and steal, and the State will punish him. Religious morality does not come under the cognizance of State law, and cannot be punished before an earthly tribunal. The State can punish incivility, it cannot punish immorality. It does not enact laws because they are revealed by God, but because they are expedient to human society. Therefore a civil government is not a moral government. *Its laws are civil, not moral.* The church deals with morals—the State with civics. Civic "righteousness" is a duty owed to the State; morality involves our obligation to God.
