**INFANT CRIMINALS.**

[New York World, April 12.]

What is the meaning of the prevalent epidemic of precocious crime? What are its causes? One day we read of a band of boy train-wreckers up the State, another day of a band of boy burglars in the wholesale district of the city. In Jersey City, even little Mamie Timothy turns highwayman and robs smaller children, and her ten-year-old brother John breaks jail twice in a day. On Fifth Avenue eleven-year-old George Farrell and two companions hold up and rob two full-grown women. Even a police captain in New York is imposed on by a boy criminal. In a single day we have the stories of a boy firebug of thirteen years of age, of an eight-year-old thief and of two others aged sixteen and seventeen respectively.

It is not pleasant to think that the natural explanation of the existence of this evil is one which holds out no promise of relief from it. Children get their ideas of right and wrong from their surroundings, and largely from parental influence, and the laws of New York and of all adjoining States are doing as much as lies in their power to confuse all the natural ideas of right and wrong in the minds of those who are most exposed to temptation.

Such harmless actions as getting shaved on Sunday or selling a pint of milk or giving away a sandwich are now solemnly proclaimed by the laws of New York to be crimes. . . Innocent acts which the people have committed unmolested for generations have been by law declared to be as criminal as burglary, highway robbery and larceny. It is no wonder that this produces a confusion of ideas; no wonder that dull, illogical children think that the crime of robbing is after all no worse than the harmless acts for which their parents and neighbors are raided and arrested.

This is one explanation of the epidemic, and it may serve to show that the attempt to reform people against their will may sometimes bring about the very opposite result to what was intended.
