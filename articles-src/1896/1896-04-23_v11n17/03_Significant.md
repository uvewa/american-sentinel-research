SIGNIFICANT.

[Southern Sentinel, Melbourne.]

OCTOBER 31, 1895, the following motion was introduced in the Anglican Synod at Auckland, N. Z.:

That this synod welcomes with thankfulness the kind expressions towards the British people, and the call to prayer for unity, contained in the letter of His Holiness Pope Leo XIII., and in response to his wishes and of those of the Archbishop of Canterbury, now respectfully requests the bishop to take such steps as he shall see fit, and call all the people in this diocese to pray to the great Head of the church for the unity of Christendom.

Although the motion did not pass, that such a motion should be introduced in an Anglican Synod is significant. It indicates a drift toward Rome.
