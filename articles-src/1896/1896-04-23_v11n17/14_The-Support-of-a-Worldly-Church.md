## THE SUPPORT OF A WORLDLY CHURCH.

SAYS the Cincinnati Christian Leader, of April 14:—

Does the Church lean on the world for support? Measurably it does. The appeals for money which the Church makes to the world through all sorts of concerts and entertainments and festivals, which minister only to the emotions, imagination and appetite, and which are devoid of all spiritual aspirations, make the fact evident that the Church is leaning largely upon the world. Has it come to this, that the "Church of the First-born" is so selfish and covetous and niggardly—so lost to all sense of self respect—as to go cringing before an exacting world, and begging of saloonists and distillers of alcohol, and dancing masters, and sportsmen, and head men of theaters, and "society women" of bad repute, for a sordid pittance with which to run the Church—into shame and everlasting contempt!

And it is precisely such a church that covets the power of the civil arm to maintain terrific and observances which have no support
