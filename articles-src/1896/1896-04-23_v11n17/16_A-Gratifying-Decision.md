## A GRATIFYING DECISION.

[Midland (Mich.) Republican, April 10, 1896.]

It is a most gratifying fact that the judiciary committee of the House of Representatives at Washington, after careful hearing of the arguments in favor of and against the proposed so-called "Christian" amendment to the Constitution of the United States, decided unanimously not to recommend it. It is a proposition fraught with danger, and it is to be hoped it will take a long rest.

One who earnestly favored it, Dr. McAllister, editor of the Christian Statesman, was asked, "If the Bible is placed in the Constitution does it not become a part of the law of the land?" He said, "Yes." Again: "If, then, the Bible is the law of the land, must not the Supreme Court give its construction to the Bible as law?" Again he said, "Yes." Then came this question: "If, then, the Supreme Court decides that the Bible Sabbath is Saturday and not Sunday, will not all citizens be compelled by law to keep Saturday instead of Sunday?" This was a poser. The doctor did not like the idea of the Bible being construed by the Supreme Court, unless he could control the court, and the answer was not forthcoming.

These few questions and sudden pause, show what a dangerous menace to the rights of conscience any such provision would be.
