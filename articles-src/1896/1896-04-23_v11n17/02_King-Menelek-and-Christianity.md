## KING MENELEK AND CHRISTIANITY.

WHILE the secular and religious press have been full of expressions of indignation concerning the attacks upon Armenian Christians by the Turks, we have seen little or nothing in condemnation of the equally unjustifiable attack of the Italian forces upon the Christian king and people of Abyssinia. The partition of Africa among the nations of Europe is evidently regarded as almost, if not quite, a Christian proceeding; for is it not being carried on by "Christian" nations? Doubtless the Italian government has as good reasons for its efforts at national aggrandizement at the expense of king Menelek and his subjects, as have any of the other "Christian" nations for their wars of conquest upon the African natives elsewhere; but there is no justification for any of them, more than there would be for a war between two of these "Christian" nations themselves.

The following letter from king Menelek to a missionary named Clarke, printed in the Washington Post, of April 3, breathes a spirit quite in contrast with that which led to the attack upon his country by the Italian forces. Menelek said:—

You are mistaken in believing that I do not care for your prayers. All prayers of believers are dear to me, even when they come from the children of Europe. Not all are aggressors in my kingdom; not all commit the iniquity of attacking those whom they hope to find weaker than themselves; not all have bent the knee before Baal, the god of destruction and the slaughterer of brothers. Many, I am sure, still truly adore the God of the cross, the God of justice and of peace. With them I feel in perfect communion of faith, and I am happy that they pray for me, for my household, and my people.

I only wish that they would make truth dwell in the sanctuary, and that instead of a mutilated gospel, which explains the confusion and the infidelity of the peoples of Europe, they would return and lead others back to the true gospel, which began with the creation of the world.

By what right do they efface the whole portion of it which precedes the coming of Jesus Christ, and have they done away with that God established for all time?

What you call the Old Testament is as true as the New, and what is contained in it must be respected and observed by those who follow Jesus and the apostles, announced by the prophets.

There are more than 300,000 of them [Jews] in my kingdom, and, though they enjoy almost complete independence, they are obedient and industrious subjects. They never conspire, pay all tributes, and respect our abums as much as do the Christians. If they are worse in Europe it is because the Christians, too, are worse. Our Lord Jesus forgare them on the cross. Why should we persecute them? You, at least, do not persecute them. May the other Christians of Europe initiate you.

What you need is to return to our God, to observe all his ordinances, to no longer separate Moses and the prophets from the apostles, or St. Peter from St. Paul. Whoever wishes to serve God must humble himself and obey. You know that, envoy of God. Teach it in Europe and Asia. I am having it taught in Africa.

May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.

MENELEK.

Of course, the fact that the Abyssinians are (professedly) Christians does not make an attack upon them any more wicked than it would be if they were heathen. The selfish grabbing for African territory at the expense of the property and lives of the natives, is altogether unchristian and wicked. Evidently all king Menelek desires of the "Christian" nations of Europe is to be let alone.
