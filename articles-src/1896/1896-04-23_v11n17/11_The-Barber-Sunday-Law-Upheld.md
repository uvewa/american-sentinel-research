**THE BARBER SUNDAY LAW UPHELD.**

The New York State Court of Appeals, in session at Albany, affirmed, April 14, the decision of the lower court in the case of the people ex. Henry J. Havenor, a barber of New York City, who was convicted of keeping open his shop on Sunday during prohibited hours. The "law" covering the case provides that barber shops in New York City and Saratoga may be kept open on Sundays until 1 o'clock P. M., but those in all other places must be closed the entire day.

The court was divided on the case, three judges sustaining the "law," and two holding it to be unconstitutional. The opinions of the two dissenting judges, Gray and Bartlett, are not based upon the principle of religious freedom. As quoted by the New York Sun, of April 15, Judge Gray said: "Regarded as an exercise of police power it cannot be justified as either necessary for the good of society or as conducive to its welfare; and it is violative of constitutional principles in that it restrains unduly and unequally the liberty of those engaged in a lawful business." In other words, the "law" is, in his opinion, class legislation, and therefore unconstitutional. Judge Bartlett holds a similar view, but in referring to the decision of the court, says that the court has very properly held that the "Christian sabbath" is one of the civil institutions of the State, and that the legislature may regulate its observance and prevent its desecration. Thus he dissents from the lesser injustice, while upholding the far greater one of religious legislation.

The principle which should have been recognized is that any Sunday "law" is class legislation, since it is passed in the interests of a certain class of the people—those who keep Sunday and want others to keep it—and against the interests of that class who regard Sunday as merely a working day. If this plain and vital fact be ignored, it is useless to oppose the "law" on other grounds. The battle for freedom will never be permanently gained while the principle of Sunday legislation is allowed to stand.

This decision adds one more prop to the legal support of the Sunday sabbath. And when Sunday observance is fully established in the civil "law," the civil liberty of the people will be at an end. We are fast nearing the time when the dividing line will be drawn between moral freemen and moral slaves.
