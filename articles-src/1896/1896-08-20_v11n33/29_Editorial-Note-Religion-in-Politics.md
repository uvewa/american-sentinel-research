"RELIGION in politics" and "politics in religion" make substantially the same mixture. The combination of the two things does not eliminate either one. With religion in politics, we will have religion subserving political ends, and thereby its own ends; and with politics in religion, we will have the same ends subserved in the same way. Each is helpful to the other for a mutually selfish purpose. Each lends its own power to the other for the sake of adding the other's power to its own. Christianity will not mix with politics at all.
