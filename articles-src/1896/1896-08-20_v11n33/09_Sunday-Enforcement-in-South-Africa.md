## SUNDAY ENFORCEMENT IN SOUTH AFRICA.

[South African Sentinel (Cape Town), July, 1896.]

The last session of the Free State Volksraad has been considering a bill providing for a more strict observance of the first day of the week, or Sunday. The following, from the Cape Times, of May 16, 1896, shows how the question is viewed by some of the members:—

This morning the Raad discussed the law for the better observance of the sabbath. The commission reported that work at the mines was necessary for the welfare of the industry, recommended doubling the tariff on Sunday telegrams, and were of opinion that not much sabbath desecration in the way of amusements existed. Mr. C. Wessels opposed it on the ground that it infringed the liberty of the subject, and referred to the case of Jews, whose Sabbath was on Saturday, but would under the proposed law be compelled to observe the Christian sabbath. Messrs. J. Wessels and Steyn objected that if the Jews did not care to observe the Christian sabbath, they should stay away. Mr. Cloete argued that the law was contrary to the institutions which guaranteed full religious liberty. Mr. Van der Walt said that under this law the President could be arrested for driving to church on Sunday. This afternoon in the Raad the discussion was continued. The law was strongly supported by Mr. Fraser, who said that mine owners rest on Sunday as well as burghers, and there was not the slightest necessity for games such as tennis, football, etc. After a lengthy discussion the Raad approved of the principle of the law.

Sabbath rest is a thing of the heart, and is a matter between the individual and God; and for this reason is beyond the purview of earthly governments. All do not agree in reference to the observance of the sabbath; some keep a different day, and some observe no day whatever. Any law, therefore, which is enacted requiring the recognition of a particular day, must necessarily result in an infringement of conscience. Mr. C. Wessels, foreseeing this dire result, opposed the bill in the Volksraad on this ground, and cited the case of the Jews as an illustration. The reply made, that "If the Jews did not care to observe the Christian sabbath [Sunday] they should stay away," is all the argument necessary to point out the tyrannical nature of Sunday laws; for certainly any law which deprives a man from becoming a citizen of a country because of his religious convictions is oppressive.

It is no more consistent to force a certain day of worship on all, than to require every-

body to be baptized in a certain way; or to require all—Jews, infidels, and unbelievers of every kind—to be partakers of the sacrament. Civil powers are ordained of God to deal with civil matters, but with religious duties they have nothing whatever to do.
