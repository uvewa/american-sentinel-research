THE Rev. Theo. L. Cuyler tells us in the Independent, of July 30, that "next to the sin of voting wrongly is the sin of not voting at all." If this be so we are in a hard predicament; for how can we know of a certainty which side is the right one to vote for? We are not infallible; nor has any infallible voice supplied us with the needed information. It would be very depressing to discover that in spite of our conscientious earnestness, we had cast our vote on the wrong side, and hence had done worse than we would have done by not voting at all.

There is plenty of information for our guidance in the matter from human sources, of course; but this does not help us out of the difficulty. Indeed, there is altogether too much information; we find all sides of the controversy represented by men of respectability and intellect, who have made a study of the questions at issue. Their study has not made them see alike. If we should study the questions we would doubtless be led to one or the other of the various parties; but the probability that our study had led us to wrong conclusions would be as great in our case as in any of the others.

In all moral questions we have an infallible guide in the word of Omniscience. But we know of no infallible guide in politics. If anybody knows of one, we would be greatly obliged if he would communicate with us at once.

Every man is entitled to his own opinion on all subjects. These opinions may represent his conscientious convictions, but they are opinions and nothing more. This is about all that can be truthfully said on the subject of political "duty."
