THE Lake County Adventists, convicted of Sunday work and condemned even before their conviction to work on the county roads, for which purpose balls and chains were actually provided, were not required to work a single day. The faultless lives of the victims of petty persecution were stronger than the prejudice which demanded the sacrifice, and the full measure of the contemplated indignities was not put upon them.
