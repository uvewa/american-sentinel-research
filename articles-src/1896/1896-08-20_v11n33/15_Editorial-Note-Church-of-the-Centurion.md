A NEW YORK religious journal makes a note of the fact that the Post Chapel, at Fortress Monroe, is called the "Church of the Centurion," and adds, "There is no reason why Christ is not preachable to military men to-day." Of course not; but there is a reason why a military man cannot remain such if the preaching of Christ to him makes him a Christian. General Sherman, a good authority on military matters, said, "War is hell;" and we fail to see that it is any part of a Christian's duty to contribute to the features of that place at the behest of the government.

The same journal adds: "The State cannot afford to have an irreligious soldiery, nor can the Church afford to have its own sons slip away from it under the sometimes demoralizing and always trying influences of camp or practice march." It is a well-known fact that men never fight more fiercely than when fired by religious zeal; hence it might be worldly wise for the State to take care that its soldiers should be religious. For this purpose most any religion would answer except Christianity. The papal religion or the Mohammedan religion are excellent for carnal warfare. History tells us how these have often made their devotees fight "like demons."

Christianity does not fill a man with the spirit of carnal warfare, but does just the opposite. It says, "Peace on earth," not war; "Put up thy sword into the sheath." When the Roman soldiers came to John the Baptist, Christ's forerunner, and asked what they should do, he replied, "Do violence to no man, neither accuse any falsely; and be content with your wages." Luke 3:14. "Fight well, . . . and be content with your wages," is what we might think he should have said, from what is taught nowadays in the name of Christianity. John's advice was calculated to make his hearers good Christians, but the poorest kind of soldiers.
