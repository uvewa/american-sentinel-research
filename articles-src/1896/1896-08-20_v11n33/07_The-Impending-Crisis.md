## "THE IMPENDING CRISIS."

[The following is the substance of an address by Major T. C. Ryan, well known as a lecturer on patriotic themes, before a large audience in the People's Temple, Boston, Mass., Sunday, July 19, and reported in the Woman's Voice (Boston), of July 25.]

My theme to-day is, The Impending Crisis. Never before in the history of our great Republic have the American people stood on the verge of a revolution that may not only enrich our soil with the blood of its own citizens, but unsheath the sword in other lands. He who cannot see the cloud on the political horizon, much larger than a man's hand, and ever increasing in size and blackness, whose thunder shall be the boom of cannon, and whose lightning the flash of swords, needs to turn his eyes to the history of our American Republic.

I hope to be understood by what may follow. I do not look for immediate war, and pray God that no rivers of blood may again flow. Yet I see but one way to avert the storm now pending, and that is for the American people to arise in their manhood, and by the ballot without reference to political affiliations strangle the despotism of Rome while they may.

The famous decision of the Supreme Court in the Dred Scott case, voiced by Chief-Justice Taney, when he declared that "the black man had no rights that a white man is bound to respect," precipitated the great rebellion, which dug more graves and put more men into them than any other war on record. While this decision was being formulated, Congress was passing laws to make it compulsory on every man in Massachusetts if he saw a negro guiding his steps to liberty and Canada by the North Star, to send him back to his merciless taskmaster. But God spoke to the free people of the North, and they swore around the family altar and on the old family Bible, that though the stars should fall they would never prostitute their manhood by keeping back one slave from liberty.

History repeats itself. The Supreme Court has declared that we are a Christian nation, and it is proposed at the very next meeting of this body to have this construed into a decision that will mean the destruction of our liberties. You may not agree with me, but I can't help that. God has put into my heart what I am about to say. I have spent days, weeks, months, over it, questioning the oracles of our past history. And now I say to you, consider this question prayerfully, thoughtfully; take it to the bar of reason, examine it by the light of the past, and let no man rob you of your free heritage. Remember, it is but a short time since Satolli came to this country, and every Roman Catholic paper published what I shall read to you:

"The coming of Mgr. Satolli will elevate the United States to the first rank as a Catholic nation. Heretofore she has stood before the church as a missionary nation, but now it is freed from the propaganda, and is considered by the Pope as a self-governing power subject only to himself." This was copied into all the secular papers.

The Supreme Court in declaring that ours is a Christian nation, is doing just what Rome wants the United States to do, and what will surely plunge us into the vortex of civil war. Good Protestant people are forming themselves into line to forward this most dangerous scheme, and even yet on the public grounds of Boston may be heard the crackling of chains forged in the Vatican.

If Protestantism does not rid itself of Romanism the churches will be looking for congregations, not congregations for churches. The Supreme Court declaration was not true, for not more than one-third of our population are Christian people. . . . Our nation is formed of all shades of religious belief. To all it says that their faith shall be respected, and their right to worship God as conscience may dictate. Let the Constitution remain as it is. There is no court of law, State or national, that can legislate the love of God into the heart.

If I had the power all differences between Catholics and Protestants—I do not mean between Catholicism and Protestantism—should be buried in one grave. But instead of catering to and compromising with the devotees of Rome, let us labor for their education, only remembering that there can be no union between Protestant and Catholic until there is absolute guarantee of the separation of Church and State. There must be taxation of church property; monastic institutions must be put on the same footing with those of Protestants, the Jesuits expelled, and the Roman Catholic Church in this country made to acknowledge the supremacy of the civil power. We will take a bishop's or a priest's advice when it is good, but reserve to ourselves the right of separating the chaff from the wheat.

God will hold us responsible for letting the Roman Upsa tree be planted on our soil. Instead of protests from press and pulpit, they have given her all the encouragement she could want. The people want to hear the truth, and to-day many ministers are preaching to empty pews because they do not dare tell the truth God bids them tell. Such cowardice is the most prolific source of the infidelity of the age.
