As previously stated in these columns the three Seventh-day Adventists, imprisoned at Tiptonville, Tenn., for Sunday work, were released August 5. The sheriff first proposed to give them the benefit of the thirty days' overtime served by J. W. Lewis, on the same charge, but it was discovered that one man could not serve time for another. The sheriff then agreed to cancel his fees. The witnesses did the same, and this cut the term of imprisonment very short.
