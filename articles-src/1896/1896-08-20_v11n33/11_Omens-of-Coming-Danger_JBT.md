**OMENS OF COMING DANGER.**

*BY J. B. THAYER.*

Among the many prophetic signs of the times is the blindness of the people to the imminent danger just ahead, and to the predictions in the sacred Scriptures concerning this nation.

While there are a few who smiled in derision at the position taken by those who many years ago saw that according to prophecy the United States was to become a persecuting power, who are now convinced by what they see that those people were correct in their interpretation, yet the great majority are as blind as ever.

The writer having been employed for more than eight years in the distribution of literature informing the people upon this subject, has thereby acquired some knowledge of public opinion in reference to this question.

While we have just cause to esteem and extol the just principles that have been, and to some extent are still, maintained in our fair-famed nation, yet it is only vain pride that is blind to the digressions from and violations of those principles of our national Constitution which have been the foundation of its existence, and the secret of its success.

No one can fail to recognize how appropriate is the application of those lamb-like characteristics of the beast of Rev. 13:11, to our nation; and many are ready to accept such application who are just as ready to reject the application of the dragonic characteristics of the same beast.

The same power or nation that was to have horns or powers like a lamb, was also to speak as a dragon. While a lamb is a symbol of Christ, a dragon represents Satan, the great enemy of Christ. So we see that the power symbolized by this beast is first to be lamb-like and afterwards to speak as a dragon. It is to prove antagonistic to its own principles.

While Satan is called the Dragon, the dragon beast is a symbol of Pagan Rome. This power used the civil law to enforce religious law, or united the civil and ecclesiastical powers, which resulted in religious persecution. It was therefore properly represented by the dragon beast.

Those only who are blind to the most obvious realities of our time can fail to see the strong tendency of our nation to a union of Churca and State, the separation of which has been the element of our prosperity and success.

The writer attended the celebration of the Fourth of July at Harriman, Tenn., and heard them sing, "My country, 'tis of thee, Sweet land of Liberty," while eight Christians, including a pastor of a church, with all of whom the writer is personally acquainted, were lying in the Rhea County jail, at Dayton, Tenn., only forty miles from the celebration.

The following is an example of many dialogues which have taken place between the writer and those whom he has met:

**Writer**—Did you ever think our nation was destined to become a persecuting power?

**Stranger**—No! That can never occur.

**W.**—It is a matter of prophecy, and even though it were not, I can see according to the trend of existing circumstances that it will prove to be an unavoidable consequence.

**S.**—Such a thing can never come, as it is contrary to our Constitution; and besides there are too many kinds of religion to form a union of Church and State.

**W.**—Do you know there are various organized religious bodies who claim that the only hope of checking the tide of infidelity, immorality, and sabbath desecration, is a resort to the aid of civil legislation?

**S.**—That makes no difference. Such a thing as religious persecution can never come in our nation.

**W.**—Are you aware of the fact that men are now lying in jail because they dare to live out their faith in the word of God?

**S.**—How is that?

**W.**—Certain people who believe in keeping the fourth commandment as it is given in the Bible, are cast into jail because they do not keep another day instead of the seventh.

**S.**—Oh! I believe we should have a day in common for the nation, and that the same should be enforced by national laws. There are too many kinds of religion already.

**W.**—You have already claimed that the presence of so many kinds of religion would militate against a union of Church and State. By your last statement you admit that to observe different days as a Sabbath, is to practice different religions.

**S.**—Yes.

**W.**—Then the Sunday is a religious institution?

**S.**—W-e-l-l, yes.

**W.**—Is not a religious institution a church institution?

**S.**—Yes.

**W.**—Did you not say our Constitution forbade a union of Church and State, and that there was no danger of religious persecution?

**S.**—Yes.

**W.**—Now, you say you are in favor of a national sabbath and the enforcement of the same by a national law, and that the "sabbath" (or Sunday) is a religious or church institution. What can the enforcement of sabbath observance be but a union of Church and State?
