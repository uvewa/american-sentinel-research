## FINE DISCRIMINATION.

From some facts which have come to light recently in Albany, N. Y., it appears that the "Law and Order League" of that place manifest a fine sense of discrimination in dealing with desecrators of Sunday.

On the first Sunday in January last this League, aided by the police, prevented the delivery of an address on "patriotic" themes which was to have been given by a non-Catholic, on the ground that it was against the law to open a licensed house on Sunday. Only two weeks previously, however, the Leland Opera House was used for an entertainment by the "Sisters of the Dominican Convent," with an admission fee of fifty cents. And in April last, handbills were distributed announcing a "living picture" entertainment in the same house, to be given by the "Choir of the Holy Cross Church," Sunday evening, April 12, which was held without opposition. Sunday evening shows are also given in Union Hall, a licensed house, by Roman Catholics, with an admission fee, which are apparently not considered as violations of the Sunday "law."

The Sunday ("Law and Order") league of Albany and similar organizations elsewhere show a certain sort of discreteness in not attempting to enforce their ideas of "Sabbath observance" upon representations of the Papacy, that power being itself the oldest and highest authority on the subject of observing Sunday. What Rome sanctions on that point it will be useless for "Protestant" believers in Sunday enforcement to oppose.
