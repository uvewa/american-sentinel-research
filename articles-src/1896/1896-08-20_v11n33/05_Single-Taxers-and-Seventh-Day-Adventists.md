## "SINGLE TAXERS" AND SEVENTH-DAY ADVENTISTS.

THE "single taxers," who have been arrested for open-air speaking in the streets of Dover, Del., are threatened with the chain-gang. This party have concentrated their political force upon Delaware, with the intent of converting that State to their views, and have been conducting the campaign for some time at Dover. Political opposition led to many arrests, on the charge of obstructing the streets. The "single taxers" had the courage of their convictions, and as fast as their speakers were arrested, volunteers were ready to take their places. The situation at first appeared humorous, but is now considered serious. We quote from an account which appeared in the Detroit News-Tribune, of August 9:—

The authorities are vindictive and threatening. The single taxers are aggressive, bitter and determined. Neither side will accept a compromise. The citizens of the town are divided in opinion, and many fear that there will be mob violence before the end is reached.

From the day of Stephenson's arrest the list of volunteers for jail service has been steadily growing. The managers say they have a list large enough to bankrupt the Dover treasury. And it really seems that such is the case. Letters are pouring in to headquarters from all sections of the country, offering names and asking for dates when wanted. New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington have sent in quite a list.

This willingness to suffer for thirty hot days in the dingy jail in Dover does not spring from any hasty impulse or desire to pose as martyrs, but from a firm realization that a principle is at stake and a right to be maintained. It is a splendid illustration of the old spirit of American independence, and it is doubtful if its counterpart could be found in any of the ordinary political movements of the day.

Finding that arrest did not check the single-tax campaign, and having a large and increasing number of prisoners on their hands, the authorities bethought them of the chain-gang. The Tribune correspondent says:—

The latest developments are the most serious of all. The levy court, made up of "hog" sympathizers, has instructed the clerk of the court to advertise for bids for the hire of all tramps and single taxers in the custody of the county. Bids are returnable Aug. 12. Whether this can be carried out, or is only a bluff, I cannot say.

This affords opportunity for an instructive comparison with the case of the Tennessee Adventists, a number of whom, as our readers know, have been sent to the chain-gang for refusing to keep Sunday, declaring that to be against their conscientious convictions of duty. They have been accused of posing as martyrs, to advertise themselves and their religion. But what shall be said of these single-tax advocates who have manifested their willingness to suffer imprisonment and the chain-gang for a cause to which they are not bound by religious convictions. The Adventists did not leave home to court imprisonment, but the single taxers volunteer for the chain-gang from a distance, in large numbers. If the charge of posing for effect can be brought against the Adventists, it can certainly be brought with much more force against these adherents of the single tax political creed.

But it is obvious that the latter are not actuated by such a motive. They are men who are moved by their convictions of what the interests of the country demand. They believe in adhering to principle in the face of all opposition. Their imprisonment and the threat of the chain-gang constitute a gross outrage upon liberty of speech, and in their devotion to that and to what they believe to be truth, they are willing to sacrifice their own temporal interests. The Adventists are likewise moved by that courageous adherence to principle without which the noblest piece of God's creation is but a servile, cringing slave. There is some courage of conviction, some love of God and man, in the world yet. And it is well for the world that it is so.
