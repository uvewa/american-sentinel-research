**A ROMAN CATHOLIC HOLY DAY IN NEW YORK.**

*[N. Y. Independent, August 13, 1896.]*

During the days of the Pope's temporal power religious parades, the celebration of saint's days and similar ecclesiastical displays were numerous in Italy. The advent of Victor Emanuel as king over united Italy, however, brought about a change which the faithful Catholic has never ceased to deplore. Public religious demonstrations grew in disfavor, and the attendant pomp and glitter became a thing of the past.

It remains for New York to renew the custom. On the corner of 115th Street and Pleasant Avenue stands a Roman Catholic church of the Carmelite order, whose membership is largely made up of Italians. Thursday, July 16th, was the feast day of its patron saint. The early morning trains brought delegations of the faithful from every city within a radius of two hundred miles of New York. The streets of "Little Italy" were thronged with gayly dressed Italians. Pilgrims began to arrive as early as 4 o'clock in the morning, and from that on the crowd kept increasing. Every one was dressed in his best. Shoes that had never before been introduced to the blacking brush shone like mirrors; shining silks which could not be bought in an American dry-goods store for love or money, and combinations of color which would drive an American woman crazy, all added brilliancy to the scene. Venders of every description lined the sidewalks crying their wares, and it seemed as tho bedlam had broken loose. One could buy anything from a gingerbread horse to an image of the Holy Virgin.

The real celebration began at 10 o'clock with a grand parade by different religious societies. There were nine bands of music and many banners with pictures of saints and the Virgin. Hundreds of girls dressed in white were in the procession, many of them carrying on their heads altars made of candles, containing images of favorite saints. Everybody in the crowd carried a candle. Following the parade was a motley crowd of men and women, some walking with naked, bleeding feet, doing penance for the sins of the past year. One woman with disheveled hair and face bleeding from self-indicted scratches, excited the commiseration of the Italians.

Mass was celebrated at 11 o'clock, during which the street was thronged for several blocks with people who could not gain admittance to the church. A great image of "Our Lady" held a prominent place near the altar, and was literally covered with jewels brought by the Italian women as gifts. Thousands of dollars are thus realized by the church every year.

In the basement several priests were kept busy all day receiving gifts of money, jewelry and candles, in return for which each giver received a picture of a saint, a rosary or a scapular. The latter seemed to be in special favor with the women and children, for they went away hugging and kissing them. Things did not go altogether smoothly, however. A

woman brought a candle, for which she had paid all her money. With tears in her eyes she begged the priest to light it; her child was dying, and she had brought this candle to the Blessed Virgin that she might see it burning and heal her daughter. The request was denied, and the woman went out the picture of despair. A man much under the influence of liquor brought a candle, for which he had paid $20. Naturally proud of his gift, he wanted it placed in a prominent position; this being refused, his anger knew no bounds, and he went away with curses. Another man, doing penance, went on hands and knees all the way up the center aisle, licking up the dust of the floor with his tongue as he went.

Fifty thousand people passed in and out of the church during the day. As evening came on, the hilarity increased. Wine and beer flowed freely, and men usually staid and sober became sadly intoxicated. Fireworks were kept up until midnight with great noise and confusion. Then "Little Italy" went to bed with a clean conscience; it had done its duty; and, notwithstanding sore heads and empty pocketbooks, it said its prayers on half blessed rosaries and was content. The great feast of Our Lady of Mt. Carmel is over for another year.
