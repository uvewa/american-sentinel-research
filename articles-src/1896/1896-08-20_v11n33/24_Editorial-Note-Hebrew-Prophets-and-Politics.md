THE New York Observer, of August 13, informs us that "there is no doubt that the Hebrew prophets preached politics. The utterances of Micah, of Jeremiah, and of Ezekiel, are full of the higher politics." In these days people know so little about those utterances that it may be many will be ready to credit the Observer's statement. However, the assertion suggests the thought that it will be well enough for the clergy to preach politics when they can receive their words by inspiration, as Jeremiah and the other prophets received theirs.
