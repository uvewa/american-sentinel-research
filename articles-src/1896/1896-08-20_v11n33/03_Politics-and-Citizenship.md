## POLITICS AND CITIZENSHIP.

The sphere of politics should not be confounded with that of citizenship. A citizen may or may not be a politician. Citizenship is based upon that which all men have naturally in common; politics is based upon that which men do not have in common. It is based upon the differences in belief which men have with respect to the interests of the State. It derives its life from them. We are naturally in the sphere of the one; voluntarily, if at all, in that of the other.

We can hardly avoid the sphere of citizenship. We come into it by birth. We may say that we are not citizens here; nevertheless we are reckoned such by the State. The national Constitution declares that "All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside." We are not the authors of our citizenship. We are not commissioned with authority to define, alter, or abolish it. We find it waiting us, defined and fixed by a power altogether beyond us, upon our advent into the world. We take it, like many other things, as we find it. There is no duty resting upon us to do otherwise.

It is not our task to defend all things which this relation has been made to cover, by the accepted principles or usages of civil government. We are not obliged to give our sanction to the "legal fiction" which is interwoven into the theories upon which civil government is conducted; least of all could we sanction all that has been done by men in the name of civil government. But we are obliged to recognize the relation which we sustain to our fellowmen as individual members of the human family, and we are bound by the obligations which grow out of it. It is because of these obligations that civil government exists. Civil government takes cognizance of natural rights. It was ordained of God for this purpose; and it is out of this that the relation of citizenship arises.

Whether one is a Christian or not, his relation is the same to the civil power. It is true that Christianity confers another and higher citizenship, which is not of this earth; but that fact does not alter the conditions to which we are subject here, any more than it changes at once "these vile bodies" to bodies of glory and immortality. The sphere of civil government and that of Christianity are altogether separate. It would be proof to the contrary were the acceptance of Christianity to affect a man's relation to the civil power. The Christian, in common with all other men, is under obligation to be subject to the "powers that be."

It is a truth, which Christians should be no less ready than others to accept, that "all men . . . are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights;" and that "to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed." So speaks the Declaration of Independence, and in this it presents the doctrine of individualism in civil government, corresponding to that individualism which the gospel asserts in the sphere of religion. The Christian has the same natural, "unalienable rights" that are possessed by others; the esponsal of Christianity takes none of these rights away. They are as necessary to his welfare as to the welfare of others. It is essential to him, no less than to others, that they should be preserved; and civil government being God's ordained means for their preservation, it is proper that he should accept the guardianship of the civil power over those rights, and conform to the requirements necessary to its existence.

Paul, the Christian, was a Jew of Tarans, "a citizen of no mean city" (Acts 21:39). Through him the Spirit of Omnisciense testifies to Christians concerning the duty of being in subjection to the higher powers, as unto the "minister of God." This of course refers only to the exercise of that power which God ordained, for God does not appoint any power to minister against himself. The power which God has ordained is that power necessary to the preservation of natural rights.

The Christian should be no less concerned about the preservation of his neighbor's rights than of his own. The spirit of his religion teaches him to seek the good of others. He may therefore be expected to be a loyal supporter of civil government, that being the means by which the good of the human race is conserved in the important matter of their rights. Even should he say that, as a Christian, he looks to God for the preservation of his own rights, he will not be so selfish as to forget the rights of his neighbor who is not a Christian. He will uphold, to the extent of his power, the means which God has established in the earth to preserve the rights and privileges of those who acknowledge him not.

But when we enter the field of politics, we tread on uncertain ground. We wander among divergent paths, each leading apparently to the goal of temporal welfare. We

behold many signboards, directing us in varying ways. We get bewildered, and the more so when we are told about our political "duty." We are at liberty to walk in any one of the beaten paths; or we can make a path of our own, but we are aware that that would be hopeless. We have been trained to associate duty with a correct standard of righteousness and an infallible guide; but in politics we possess neither one. We can be guided by our own best judgment from such facts as we can learn; but we do not find in this a sufficient basis for "duty."

But we note also that the political field is a very unsavory location. As Christians we are not pleased with the associations which it offers. We find that the "science" of politics is a struggle for the mastery—a struggle not between good and evil, but between party and party. Whatever the "science" might mean in an ideal sense, this is what men have made it, and what we must accept, if we enter the political field to any purpose. But in such contentions the Christian is out of place. He finds poor company amidst would-be victors seeking for spoils, and intriguers "pulling the wires" in accordance with the accepted rules of political ethics. He knows how to be a good citizen—to live honestly and justly before all men, not infringing upon the rights of any man, and aiding with his influence, and when occasion presents, his vote, the cause that is just. As he has opportunity, he will do good unto all men. This is as God directs. God ordained citizenship; man made the politics.

"Politics" has been truthfully likened to a "dirty pool;" and not all the morality in the church, if put into it, would cleanse it. When the church goes into this pool, her skirts will be soiled; that is all. The pool will be as dirty as ever. If any wish for proof on this point, let them note the result already visible from the political sermonizing in which clergymen have indulged in the present campaign. They will see, not righteousness, but accusation, recrimination, and discord.

For moral cleansing we must look to the power of God. God will cleanse the sinner, he will cleanse the world; the one by the blood of Christ, the other by the fires of destruction. His Word tells us this, but it contains no promise that he will cleanse politics. That is left for man to essay. But in view of the effort we can but recall the words of Scripture, "Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one."
