## PLAN TO EXTERMINATE TURKS IN CRETE AND MACEDONIA.

FROM the latest developments in the progress of events relating to the Eastern question, it appears that religious sympathy for the "Christians" in Crete and Macedonia is likely to lead to the extermination of the Turks in those countries. This, at least, is the purport of the plan now under consideration by the "powers of Europe," according to the New York Sun of Aug. 13. The Sun says:—

When the parcellation of Turkey comes, France will want her share, and England here; and even Italy has an eye on Tripoli. It was the almost inseparable difficulty of accommodating conflicting claims that last year caused Germany and Russia to concur in the harsh judgment that it was better to leave Armenia to her fate than to begin the process of interference, which would inevitably lead to the disruption of the Ottoman Empire.

There are signs, however, of a sudden and marked change of policy at St. Petersburg, caused by the fervent sympathy of the Russian people for their coreligionists in Crete.

It is reported that the Czar is inclined to countenance a blockade of Crete by a British fleet for the purpose not of hindering the despatch of munitions to the insurgents, but of obstructing the reinforcement of the Turkish troops now in the island. The struggle there would be soon over if this plan were carried out, for the Cretan Christians outnumber their Moslem neighbors in a ratio variously computed at from three to one to seven to one. It is also to be noted that the same motive which would impel Russia to take this course in regard to Crete, would operate with at least equal force in the case of Macedonia, for there not only are the Christian inhabitants members of the so-called Orthodox Church, but half of them are of the Slavonic race.

The "Christians" of Russia and England will keep out the Turkish reinforcements which the Forte might send to the scene of hostilities, while the other "Christians" at the latter place will exterminate the Turks among them,—a task which they will find comparatively easy owing to their superiority in numbers. But as one writer has pithily inquired, what material difference is there between killing "Christians" in a Turkish way, and killing Turks in a "Christian" way?
