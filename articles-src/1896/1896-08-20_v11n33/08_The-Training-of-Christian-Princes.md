## THE TRAINING OF "CHRISTIAN" PRINCES.

["Ouida," in June "Forum."]

There are two little boys now conspicuous in Europe, one is eleven and the other eight years of age; one is a crowned prince, and the other a crowned king; the former is the most dreary and self-conscious little prig that ever was drilled in pipe-clay and buckram, and the other is still a high-spirited child, bold, saucy and lovable; but both the Prussian Kronprinz and the Spanish Rey Nino, have already but one thought in their young heads: War.

The pompous little German lieutenant only lives for dreams of strategy, manoeuvres, kriegspiel, the importance of buttons, the dignity of stripes and grades, the superiority of gunpowder and chemicals; and the bright Nino climbs on Marshal Campos' knees, and begs to be told how Moors were killed in Morocco, Cubans in Cuba, and how many years he will have still to wait before he too can have the joy of killing them.

Divine education of Christian princes! These children are taken respectively to the Lutheran service and to the Catholic mass; and they are alike told that they are the servants of the Son of Peace, and what are they in truth being made, both by education and example? They are made the scourge of their own generation and of the generations to come. They are being taught to hope for and to aspire to direct the slaughter of their people and of neighboring peoples, to find their toys in military science, their theatre in the battlefield, their ambrosia in blood.

The little lads who run now before their carriages in the dust, shouting their names with joyous outcry, will be for them a score of years hence, crippled, maimed, riddled with shot, torn with explosive bullets, drowned by torpedoes, blown up by mines; thousands yet unborn will arise to curse them; mothers will ask their dead sons of their hands, and ask in vain; villages will burn up like wisps of straws, and cities crumble like trodden ant hills at their word; they are innocent themselves as the atoms of tubing of the tin sardine boxes which hold the detonators, and the iron nails of the bomb; but as these are filled with the deadliest fumes and fire of hell, so are these boys from their earliest infancy filled to the throat with the lust, the pride, the appetite of war.
