**DEBASING THE PULPIT.**

*[New York World, Aug. 10, 1896.]*

REV. GEORGE WHITFIELD MEAD, in his sermon last night at the Madison Avenue Presbyterian Church, on the subject "Gold or Silver, a Question of More than One Side," has something to say about the way some of his brother preachers were talking on the silver question.

"I deplore," he said, "the debasing of the pulpit by making it the political stall for the discussion of party politics. Some men are preaching silver, others are preaching gold. I can but feel that both are forgetting their high calling. Such men may be inspired by the sincerest sentiments of patriotism, but to many persons such preaching has the appearance of being inspired by a thirst for popular notoriety.

"The gold standard alone will never cure our ills nor will a monetary standard of gold and silver. He who looks to either as the final solution of our national and social unrest is as the man who built his house upon the sands.

"The need of our country is not money; we are the wealthiest nation in the world. Nor is our need legislation. We have been legislated to death. The present suffering of the world will be permanently relieved only as we get back to the faith in God and rid ourselves of our moral leprosy."
