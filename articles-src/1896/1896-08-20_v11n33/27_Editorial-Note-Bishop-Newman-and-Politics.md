A MEMBER of the national executive committee of the "people's party," Mr. Geo. F. Washburn, of Boston, Mass., takes Bishop John P. Newman, of the M. E. Church, to task for recent political utterances which were not complimentary to the party which Mr. Washburn represents. The latter says:—

Now, sir, I belong to the party you insult, and brand your alleged statements as false and unfair, and challenge you to name a single populist in this country who is also known as an anarchist. I am called a "leading member" of the church you represent. If I am not a "good American citizen," may I ask you are my money and influence still wanted in your church? If you are no more correct in your spiritual utterances than you are in your political, can we have any confidence in either? I agree with the prominent Roman Catholic who said he was willing to take his religion from the head of his church, but not his politics.

Now, bishop, for the sake of the church we love and the welfare of the country, I advise you to let politics alone until you have studied this monetary question.

And a caustic letter from Senator Stewart, of Nevada, to the bishop, drawn out by the latter's political utterances, concludes thus:—

I thank you that you have told the people your evil purposes. This may have been indiscreet on your part, but I assure you that it will put honest men on guard against the wicked work you propose, and perhaps your evil boasting may prove a boomerang and a benefit to the cause of honest money and honest men.

Such incidents suggest to us that it would be advisable for bishops and all clergymen, in the interests of that "peace and good will" on earth for which Christianity stands, to "let politics alone" altogether.
