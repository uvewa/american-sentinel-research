THE passage by the British Parliament of the "Deceased Wife's Sister Bill," is considered by the Archbishop of Canterbury so serious a menace to religion as to call for the formation of a church party for the purpose of defense. The New York Independent says it is at a loss to know what the archbishop means. It is hard for some Protestants to discern Rome's policy. Rome cares very little about the subject of that bill, but she does care much about the establishment of a Catholic church party in Parliament, as she has for some time had in the German Reichstag; and she will seize upon any opportunity to attain that end.
