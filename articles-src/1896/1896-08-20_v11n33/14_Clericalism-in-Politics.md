### CLERICALISM IN POLITICS.

[Present Truth (London, Eng.), July 16, 1896.]

AUSTRIA has lately been passing some new laws to prevent the interference of the clerical power in politics. The clergy have used their position as priests and confessors to terrify or influence voters to keep things in the hands of partisans of the church party. So far have they gone that in an intensely Roman Catholic country like Austria the people are driven in self-defense to legislate to keep priestcraft out of politics. In the recent Canadian elections, also, the priests issued a manifesto ordering Catholics to vote for certain candidates. The result, however, was that their arrogance was resented and some Catholic secular organs plainly told the priests to attend to religion and give a free hand in politics to the people.

What a spectacle when the world has to defend itself against the schemes of those whose profession is to be ministers of another kingdom, not of this world.
