QUITE a change has taken place in public sentiment in Lake County, Tenn. The work done there by the International Religious Liberty Association and by the Tennessee River Tract Society, apparently convinced the people that the Adventists are not a dangerous class of people; and at the recent term of court nobody was found willing to prosecute them; so no new indictments were found, though evidence was taken, and it is stated the attorney-general attempted to induce the former prosecutor to appear in the same role again.

In these Sunday cases the grand jury has not inquisitorial power, and can find indictments only as some one comes forward to furnish evidence and appear as prosecutor. The fact is, however, that the grand jury has exercised inquisitorial power in the past in the Adventist cases, and after the cases have all been prepared somebody has been found to permit the use of his name as prosecutor. We believe, however, that the attorney-general does not feel as anxious to pursue the Adventists as he did, and that the same pains will not be taken to secure indictments.
