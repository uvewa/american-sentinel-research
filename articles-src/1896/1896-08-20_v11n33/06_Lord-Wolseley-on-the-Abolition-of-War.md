## LORD WOLSELEY ON THE ABOLITION OF WAR.

THOSE who are most familiar with war and with the conditions and causes which lead up to it, are altogether skeptical concerning the coming era of universal peace of which popular theology has long dreamed. They do not believe that lasting peace can ever be evolved out of such conditions as those upon which human society and government are and ever have been constituted. Here are the words of Lord Wolseley, Commander-in-Chief of the Army of Great Britain, to some members of the International Arbitration Society, on the subject:—

Gentlemen, I do not believe in universal peace. There never was a time when peace lasted for long; and the man who believes the time will come when there will be no more wars, I believe that man to be a dangerous dreamer of dreams, and certainly dangerous in any public position. I hope that no man who believes that, may ever be in any high position in England.

In commenting upon these words, an English journal says: "Surely the Church, for her own credit, will make some protest. Mother church blesses the sword and the battleship, but only as necessary and temporary evils. If she does not look forward to the day when wars and rumors of wars will cease to ravage and alarm poor humanity, then she is a living lie. The note of unbelief has been sounded by the Commander-in-Chief. What says the Primate?"

We are inclined to think that so long as "mother church blesses the sword and the battleship," the words of the "Primate" in favor of the abolition of war will have very effect. Certain it is that nothing contributes more to the perpetuity of war among "civilized" nations than the idea, which "mother church" fosters by her blessing of sword and battleship, that war is proper and right, at least for the actual participants, if they engage

in it at the command of a "Christian" ruler and conduct it upon "civilized" methods.

It is only the coming of the Prince of Peace in the clouds of heaven, with the judgments of divine wrath in his hand against the wicked, that will make wars to "cease unto the ends of the earth." Lord Wolseley and his military compeers have much better judgment on this point than the theologians.
