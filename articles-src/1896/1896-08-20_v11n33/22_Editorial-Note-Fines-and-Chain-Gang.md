THE fact that one man cannot serve for another in jail or in the chain-gang shows that lying in jail or working in the chain-gang is not paying a fine, and is not so considered by the State. One man can pay a fine for another. This ought to assist in disposing of the question, "What is the difference between paying fines and working in the chain-gang?"
