### THE POPE BLESSING WARRIORS.

[Bible Echo (Melbourne, Aus.), June 22, 1896.]

The British naval fleet in the Mediterranean has just paid a visit to Rome. True to its cunning the Papacy has not failed to utilise the opportunity as an occasion for ingratiating itself into the love and favor of England. The dispatches state that—

The British naval visitors to Rome have met with equal welcome from the Italian Government and from the Papacy. Pope Leo XIII. conferred his blessing upon some hundreds of the British sailors, and by his orders also dinner was provided for them. The sailors heartily cheered his holiness. As a special mark of favor, he has invited as many of the sailors of the British fleet as are permitted to visit Rome to attend high mass at the Slatine Chapel.

This calls to mind the fact that the Pope once blessed another fleet, the Spanish Armada, which was sent, in 1588, to whip England into submission to the Catholic faith. The Crusaders also had the benediction of the Pope. Popes have always been ready to bless almost anything by which "blessing" they have thought the interests of the Papacy would be advanced.
