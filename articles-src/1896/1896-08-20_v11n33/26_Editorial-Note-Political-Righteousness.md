THESE are days when men talk glibly about "political righteousness," as if it were something about which every one knew. But while there are numerous conflicting ideas expressed upon the subject, the phrase remains undefined in any authority upon the subject of righteousness that we have seen. The law of God is the standard of Christian righteousness; but what is the standard of righteousness in politics? Is there any standard of "political righteousness" at all?
