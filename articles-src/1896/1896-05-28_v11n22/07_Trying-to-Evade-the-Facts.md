# TRYING TO EVADE THE FACTS.

[Evangel and Sabbath Outlook, May 14.]

The Christian Statesman is anxious to evade the facts which were brought out at the late "hearing" on the "Constitutional Amendment" at Washington, D. C. We do not wonder at this anxiety, for the application which various members of the Judiciary Committee made not only sustained the claims of the Evangel and Sabbath Outlook as to the Bible Sabbath, but they showed the self-destructive nature of the amendment scheme. The Statesman takes the usual way of trying to escape from its own defeat by finding fault with some one else. It pays its compliments to us as follows:—

The Evangel and Sabbath Outlook is responsible for the following misrepresentation which has been copied into other journals:—

"In the cross questioning, which was put upon the speakers who closed the debate for the affirmative, various members of the committee, able lawyers, brought out the weak points in overwhelming confusion. This part of the hearing developed the fact that the Sabbath question is a prominent feature of this movement. The logic of the situation was set forth by a member of the committee, when, by questioning, he showed that under the amendment, if a case of 'Sabbath-breaking' were carried to the Supreme Court, the advocates of the amendment would be compelled to abandon Sunday and keep the Sabbath. He showed that no 'interpretation' could permit any other decision under the text of the Bible. That episode alone was worth a volume of arguments in favor of the Sabbath."

The Statesman's attempt to evade the facts in the case runs as follows:—

The question asked by the member of the committee was in reference to the interpretation by the Supreme Court, in case the members of the court believed the seventh-day Sabbath to be the Sabbath of the Bible. He did not show "that no 'interpretation' could permit any other decision under the text of the Bible." With the simple acknowledgment of the Bible in the Constitution our Supreme Court as it has always been made up, would interpret the Bible as Christians with so great unanimity have always interpreted it in our country as teaching the observance of the first-day sabbath. But if by any possibility the majority of the judges of the Supreme Court should ever be Seventh day Baptists, or Adventists or Jews, and should interpret the Bible as enjoining the observance of the seventh-day Sabbath, then the nation which believed in the first-day sabbath would have to speak more definitely and in its own sovereign legislation lay down the constitutional basis so clearly that the Supreme Court could not override the explicit expression of its will in this matter of Sabbath law.

Since the Statesman wrote the above the official report of the hearing is at hand, as noted in another column. We are content to place before our readers those points in the hearing on which our "misrepresentation"(?) was based since the case is shown to be far more telling against the Statesman than our conservative report made it. It is rather unfortunate for the Statesman that the Committee concluded to publish this report. It will also be seen by the following that the friends of the amendment introduced the Sabbath question at the hearing. We quote as follows:—

(Dr. McAllister is defending the Amendment.)

The Chairman—I want to know whether you intend at all to subject the true meaning of the Bible itself to the construction of the courts?

DR. MCALLISTER—No, sir; it cannot come in that way.

THE CHAIRMAN—It is not a question whether it would or would not. I ask you what you intend.

DR. MCALLISTER—This is what is intended. Let me give you an illustration. You had the question in Congress as to whether the gates of the World's Fair should be kept open on sabbath or not. That was a practical question, and that was a question on which the law-making power had to decide. Now, Congress must take into consideration, as it did then, what the word of God says. The senator from Pennsylvania sent up to the clerk's desk a copy of the Bible with the page marked on which was "Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy."

A VOICE—That is the seventh day.

DR. MCALLISTER—It is not the seventh day. "Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy." That is what it says. There was a case of Congress having to decide whether the gates would be open on a particular day or not, and the appeal was made to the authority of the divine word. The Congress, having the law-making power, having thus decided, the courts should be bound by the law-making power; for it is not the business of the courts to make laws.

MR. BURTON—Now, suppose we adopt this amendment, and a party should be arrested for breaking the sabbath, the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday; that he should be convicted, and he should appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States, and say, "You have adopted the Bible as the standard in civil affairs, claiming that the Sabbath day is Saturday," and that the Supreme Court of the United States should decide that it was Saturday?

DR. MCALLISTER—The Supreme Court of the United States would have to go by the law.

MR. BURTON—Very well; but when they did go by it that is the end of it.

DR. MCALLISTER—Certainly.

MR. BURTON—Now, do you want to put into the Constitution of the United States a clause which will permit the Supreme Court of the United States to say that you must keep Saturday or else you violate the law of the land?

DR. MCALLISTER—No, sir.

MR. BURTON—That is just what you are trying to do. (pp. 33, 33.)

MR. BURTON—Suppose in case of war the President should call out the militia, and it should be said, "Under the Bible which you have adopted as the standard we are not permitted to fight," and the Supreme Court should say, "that is true," what would become of your army?

DR. MCALLISTER—He can do that now.

A MEMBER—Oh, no!

DR. MCALLISTER—Certainly he can; and he could not interfere with the Congress of the United States in the case of war.

MR. JONES—But could he not then raise the case to the Supreme Court and have a decision?

DR. MCALLISTER—He can raise any case now, just as the case may be raised to-day in regard to the sabbath law.

DR. LEWIS—There are to-day in the United States by the last census, and I give my statement on the authority of Mr. Charles Buell, who was a prominent member of the census corps, one million of people observing the Sabbath according to the Bible, Seventh-day Baptists, Adventists, and Hebrews. Now, I put the question to you, Doctor: Is it not the purpose of this movement—it has certainly been so announced—to compel us, who, on conscientious biblical grounds, hold to the seventh day, according to the Bible and not according to a tradition, is it not the purpose to compel us to submit?

DR. MCALLISTER—No, sir.

DR. LEWIS—It has been so announced.

DR. MCALLISTER—I am not responsible for any such announcement.

MR. BURTON—Conceding that it is not the purpose, would it not be the result?

DR. MCALLISTER—No, sir; not at all. It could not be. Now, let me give my answer as to this matter in regard to the Bible. In the first place, my good friend, Dr. Lewis, says explicitly that the seventh-day Sabbath is the Bible ground. That is his interpretation. He has a right to interpret it in that way. I say that the first day of the week is the Bible ground. And that is the way it ever will be. Now, here comes the Congress of the United States, and it must decide; the nation must decide.

MR. BURTON—Let me ask you why should anyone decide except the individual?

DR. MCALLISTER—The Congress must decide.

MR. BURTON—But why?

DR. MCALLISTER—You meet here to do certain work, and like every man, you have to decide whether you will work seven days or six. You must decide whether you will work seven days or not. You have to give a decision. The next point is that when you decide not to work more than six days you must decide which day you will rest. And you have decided to rest on Sunday, the first day. Why? Because it is a Christian country. It is the Christian sabbath. (P 34.)

MR. CONNOLLY—Suppose the Bible has already settled that question, how could any act of Congress interfere with it if that is to be in the Constitution?

DR. MCALLISTER—Because we must interpret the Bible. [Laughter.] Those gentlemen on the other side look at that as ridiculous, and yet you have to interpret every law. Congress has to interpret every law.

MR. BURTON—Supposing the Supreme Court should decide that Saturday was the seventh day?

DR. MCALLISTER—No, sir; they would not. The people themselves are back of the court.

SEVERAL MEMBERS—Oh, no.

DR. MCALLISTER—Now, gentlemen, don't get this thing mixed up. I have been making the matter perfectly clear between constitutional law and statutory law. Now, if the legislature, in its enactment of statutory law, feels that the first-day sabbath is in harmony with the Constitution, then of course it puts that interpretation on its acts. If the Supreme Court overrules it, there is a conflict, and the question goes back as to what the constitutional law is. Then the sovereign people, the maker of constitutions, if they have not got their will sufficiently clear, can act.

MR. CONNOLLY—They could put it back the way it is now. (p. 36.)

MR. CONNOLLY—In two ways—by the long way or by waiting till the Supreme Court die and by putting in new men; but until it is changed by either of these ways, if we should adopt this and a case of this kind should come up, and the Supreme Court should hold that Saturday was the Sabbath, you would have to respect their decision. You would have to worship for at least thirty years on Saturday. It would take thirty years to change the Constitution back again.

DR. MCALLISTER—Is that a fair representation? Would that compel me to worship on Saturday any more than the Seventh-day Adventists are compelled to worship on Sunday at present?

MR. CONNOLLY—No, sir; not in one sense, but you could not work on Saturday.

If we can understand the evasion of the Statesman, it is this. The Supreme Court would interpret the Bible according to the theological creed of the judges, and not according to the letter of the law. If the court should happen to be Seventh-day Baptists, they would "interpret" the law which says "the seventh day is the sabbath" to mean what it says. If they were of a different faith, they would interpret "seventh" to mean "first," especially if a majority of the people so believed. That is putting an estimate upon the candor and judicial ability of the highest court in the nation, so low that our readers shall undoubtedly rise above it, and will agree with Congressman Burton, that in seeking the amendment, those who so sharply oppose the Sabbath, seek to compel themselves to observe it. We do not wish to see the Sabbath restored under a decision of the Supreme Court of the United States, but rather under the ruling of the Supreme Statute of the Christian world—the Bible. But we would willingly risk the test of our position with the Supreme Court.
