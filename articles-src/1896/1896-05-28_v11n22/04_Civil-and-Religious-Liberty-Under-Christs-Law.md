## "CIVIL AND RELIGIOUS LIBERTY UNDER CHRIST'S LAW."

The Christian Statesman, of May 9, published an article so remarkable for the sound principles which it so plainly states, that we print it herewith, setting it in brevier, giving our comments in long primer type. The Statesman says:—

The law of Christ is the perfect law of liberty. If it were made the ultimate moral standard in both Church and State, and if all legislation and administration in these spheres of life were conformed to that final standard, civil and religious liberty would be entered by all the subjects of both ecclesiastical and political authority.

This is sound doctrine. The law of Christ is the perfect law of liberty, "and if all legislation and administration" "were conformed to that final standard, civil and religious liberty would be enjoyed by all." But while this is true, it is also a fact that Christ is the best expoenter of his own law, and as he defined that law he gave no authority to any man to coerce his fellowman in matters of conscience. He plainly said, "Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's;" and by so ordaining he necessarily declared the freedom of every man to act according to the dictates of his own conscience. But again we quote:—

It is true on the one hand, that if Christ's perfect law is not acknowledged as supreme, there may be a measure of liberty. So far as government is in fact administered in harmony with that law, even though there may be no acknowledgment of its supreme authority, true liberty will be enjoyed. It is reasonable to believe, however, that the acknowledgement of the supremacy of that divine law, lying at the basis of all legislation and administration, will help to secure practical conformity to its just and benign requirements on the part of any human government.

This is another truth plainly stated. There are some things that God has revealed not only in the sacred Scriptures but in the great book of Nature. The founders of this Republic declared it to be a *self-evident* truth that "all men are created equal," and "that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights." Wherever this truth is seen and recognized, true civil liberty may be enjoyed without any intelligent recognition of "Christ's perfect law," as such.

There is no divine law higher than the Golden Rule: "Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them." Indeed, it is the sum and some of all law, and wherever there is practical recognition of this divine rule there is liberty. But there can be no practical recognition of the Golden Rule where there is an effort to coerce the conscience or to deny to men the rights of conscience.

In the next paragraph the *Statesman* discusses a phase of the question which should be considered seriously by everyone who proposes to clothe the Government, or any civil power, with authority to interpret the divine law. Our contemporary says:—

On the other hand, even when the perfect law of Christ is acknowledged as supreme in either Church or State, there may be such an interpretation and application of it as to infringe most grievously upon the civil and religious liberties of mankind. It only adds to the repulsiveness of despotism when men in power impose their own will upon others in the name of God. Rulers may formally acknowledge Christ's law as supreme, and then give their distorted and unjust intergeneration of it the absoluteness of the law itself, and compel obedience to what is in fact opposed by that very law which the governing power is professedly seeking to enforce.

And this is just the very thing that is done and has been done by every government that has ever undertaken to enforce the divine law. It is just what this Government did when in its World's Fair legislation it undertook to decide what day is the Christian sabbath according to the fourth commandment; and it is just what the *Christian Statesman* and its co-laborers in the National Reform movement would do should they be successful in their efforts to incorporate into the Constitution their proposed "Christian" amendment. Nor is this all. The *Statesman* proceeds to show that even a church may err in its interpretation of the divine law, and that "to attempt to enforce obedience in such cases in either Church or State is an infringement of the liberty of the subjects or members." The truth of this is too patent to require demonstration or argument, and it is scarcely conceivable that this was written by the same man who, only a few weeks ago, declared before a committee of Congress that the individual must yield his conscience to the majority, as quoted on page 170 of this paper.

Our contemporary then proceeds after this fashion to show that Rome has failed to solve the problem of church authority, and denies very properly that the decisions of that church are entitled to rank with the utterances of the council held by the apostles at Jerusalem, as follows:—

Let us see how this infringement of liberty may have a place in the sphere of the Church. A church having the Christian name will as a matter of course make its final appeal to the law of Christ. But it is possible for any church to err in its understanding of that perfect law and to base unjust legislation upon it. Christ, the divine and infallible Head of the Church, has given the keys of rightful ecclesiastical authority to the human officers of her government, and has promised to them his Holy Spirit to lead them into all truth. But this is not a promise of infallibility. It is parallel with the divine appointment in the civil sphere of the magistrate as "the minister of God." The civil magistrate is the minister of God in doing what is in harmony with the divine law of civil life. But if he transgresses that law, as he may, his authority in such transgression loses the only foundation on which it can rest. In like manner ecclesiastical rulers may transgress the divine law of the Church, and when they do so transgress, their authority so far becomes invalid. To attempt to enforce obedience in such cases in either Church or State is an infringement of the liberty of the subjects or members.

The attempt of Romanism to solve the difficulty as to authority by clothing the Church either in her ecumenical councils or in her supreme pontiffs, in their deliverance ex osthedra or as the official head of the ecclesiastical government, with infallibility, is in its very nature the subversion of the liberty of men. The appeal to the decision of the council at Jerusalem, of which we have the record in the 15th chapter of the Acts, as a warrant for the infallibility of the Church of later times, and for the irreformability of her official decrees, is based on a mistaken ground. That council was divinely guided in doing what became a part of the infallible law of Christ. What it decreed was what seemed good to the Holy Ghost as well as to the council itself. Acts 15:50.

To put the decrees of later councils or of supreme pontiffs on the same level is to make them in effect a part of the inspired and infallible word of God. The determination of Romanism to be possessed of an authority from which the consciences of men were to be allowed no release drove the system logically to the blasphemous dogma of the papal infallibility. And the very fact that this dogma imposes the papal decrees, given ex osthedra, or from the pontiff in his official position and character, upon the consciences of men, is the proof that it is an assault on their civil and religious liberties.

The supposed possession of such infallibility by any human being, individual or collective, necessarily be gets and nourishes the spirit of despotism. It logically denies to individual men and collective bodies of men the right to investigate and interpret the divine law for themselves. It represses the exercise of the intellectual faculties and dulls the moral sense. God gives moral law to men in all the relations of human life in such a form in his Holy Word as to stimulate thought and quicken conscience. Each individual is to decide for himself, like Peter and John, when he ought to obey God rather than men. And church councils and Roman pontiffs are included in the word "men" in this case no less than the Jewish Sanhedrin. Require men to take God's law as given by any man or body of men as infallible, and the mainspring of the study of God's word and thus of all mental activity and moral quickening is destroyed. Men become mentally and morally dependent on the power that in any emergency of human life gives the infallible and irreformable decision or decree to which all are required to submit.

The most essential principle of the Roman Catholic or papal system is this assumption of the right of a mere mortal man to give deliverance on moral and religious questions that are to bind the consciences of all other men as if the official utterances were the very voice of God. Where this principle is accepted no true civil or religious liberty can be enjoyed. Its assertion is a hindrance to all social progress. It imposes a barrier in the way of the communion of the individual soul with God as God speaks to each soul in his word. It represses the longings of the spirit of man for the indwelling of the Divine Spirit within itself to lead it into all truth. It denies both to the Church of Christ and to the State the progress in their individual members which is the only effectual means for the progress of the social and collective bodies themselves, and thus proves the worst of foes to civil and religious liberty.

It is true, as the *Statesman* says, that the supposed possession of infallibility by any human power, individual or collective, necessarily be gets and nourishes the spirit of despotism, and this is the very thing against which James Madison warned the American people a century ago, when he declared: "It is at least impossible for the magistrate to adjudge the right of preference among the various sects that profess the Christian faith without erecting a claim to infallibility which would lead us back to the church of Rome." This, however, is the very thing which National Reformers propose to do, namely, to so amend the Constitution as not only to make it possible for the civil authorities "to adjudge the right of preference among the various sects that profess the Christian faith," but to make it absolutely necessary for Congress or the courts to do that very thing, and this would erect a claim to infallibility that will inevitably lead the Government and the whole people, if not back to the church of Rome in name, at least back to the principles that governed that church, and to an image of the Roman hierarchy. The editor of the *Statesman* has certainly written better than he knew.
