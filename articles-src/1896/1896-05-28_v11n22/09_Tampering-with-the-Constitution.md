**TAMPERING WITH THE CONSTITUTION.**

*[New England Evangelist.]*

Speaking of the Constitution brings to mind the insane idea that there was a fatal mistake in its construction, in that there is contained in it no recognition of the Almighty, nor of the Christian religion; and that it is the consequent duty of all Christians, and of the Church as such, to endeavor to amend that charter of our civil government by securing therein a proper recognition of both. To this end there exists a national organization of persons whose conceptions of the things of Caesar and of God are so imperfect or confused that they imagine that the former must acknowledge the latter in his secular affairs, else the divine kingdom may perhaps perish from the earth. Now, for our part, we believe that it was God's will that his name be left out of that *Magna Charta* of the land of liberty, and that he was on hand to see that it was left out. We appreciate the mistaken zeal with which some are laboring to correct God's mistakes; but we would say to any such that their efforts would better avail something for the good of mankind in this case, if they would devote themselves to getting the name of God written in the hearts of men, rather than upon the pages of the civil Constitution. The Lord has never told us to seek by such means to promote the glory of his name and kingdom.

Of the same nature as the before-mentioned effort to amend the National Constitution in the supposed interest of the Christian religion, is the endeavor to secure primary or additional legislation to enforce the observance of the Lord's day, or so-called Christian sabbath, as a religious institution. Probably many who are active in this endeavor do not advocate it with the purpose of forcing a religious institution upon any, but to make the observance purely a civil one so far as the law is concerned. Nevertheless, it is essentially a church movement, and its supposed benefits are not expected to be social or political, but spiritual. With the establishing of a civil day for rest we have nothing to do, except as citizens of a free country; and it may be considered as a matter of social and political expediency, as in a hundred other things. But as to the Church, and the establishing of a day of religious observance, we would dispose of the whole question by saying that if God has ordained any day to be kept, it must be that there is abundant inherent power in the religion itself to maintain it, for God does not call upon the civil authorities to uphold the ordinances of his church.

The growth of Christianity would have been small indeed in the early centuries of its era if it had depended upon the enactment of a Lord's day or sabbath observance by Nero and the Roman Senate. We have no hesitation whatever in maintaining that Christian people have no more warrant for endeavoring to secure and enforce the legal observance of a day of Christian worship as such, or as a matter of church interest, than they have to secure and enforce a similar enactment that people shall be baptized and observe the Lord's supper. It would be well if those who are zealous in getting the civil power to back up the traditions of men, would look to the end whence they are tending.
