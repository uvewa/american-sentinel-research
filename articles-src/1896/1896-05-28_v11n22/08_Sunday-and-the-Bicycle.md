**SUNDAY AND THE BICYCLE.**

The bicycle is making such inroads into Sunday as a sacred day that many of the ministers of the Sunday-keeping churches are up in arms against it, and some are demanding the legal prohibition of Sunday cycling.

The difficulties surrounding this question are however great. Can bicycle riding be prohibited while horseback riding and carriage riding are permitted? Can one kind of vehicle be forbidden on Sunday while other kinds are permitted? It would seem that such discrimination cannot be made. It follows that the "abuse" complained of by the Sunday proachers must either continue, or all riding, driving, etc., must be prohibited on Sunday, except riding or driving "reverently to and from church." This would be only an adaptation to modern manners and customs of the famous "Blue Law" of Connecticut which forbade outdoor exercise upon Sunday, "except walking reverently to and from meeting."

Of course if this matter were left to the individual conscience there would be no trouble, for in that case those who felt free to ride would do so while others would walk; but as it is becoming quite the thing to erect statutory standards for the conscience, it is probable that erelong we shall see legislatures besieged to enact "laws" regulating or even prohibiting the use of bicycles on Sunday.
