## SOME "REASONS" FOR THE "CHRISTIAN AMENDMENT."

Some of the "reasons" by which the party striving for the so-called "Christian" amendment to the Constitution are endeavoring to persuade the Christian people of the country to join with them in their effort, are given by the *Christian Statesman*, of April 25, in an article "prepared by direction of the sub-executive committee of the National Reform Association," to be "sent to bodies of Christians, such as presbyteries, conferences, conventions, ministers' associations, etc., etc., all over the country." That they are arguments only in name, will be readily apparent from a brief inspection; it is strange, indeed, that their sophistical character should not be apparent even to these "reformers" themselves. But the latter must of course be given credit for honesty in their opinions.

We are told, in the first place, that there are two theories of the relations of civil government to God and religion; that "the one is that civil government has nothing to do with God and cannot touch religion anywhere, which is the secular theory; the other is that it properly has to do and must have to do with God and religion, and this is the Christian theory."

In this statement of the case an attempt is made to mislead the reader at the very start by setting up a distinction which does not exist in fact. It is begging the question to say that the Christian theory demands that civil government must concern itself with God and religion. That is a religious theory, but not all that is religious is Christian. Pagan religion is much more widespread in our world than Christianity; and as a matter of fact this theory has pertained to all the great pagan systems of which history tells us. It had its origin in them, and through the Papacy—that combination of pagan principles and Christian forms—has been transmitted to our own times.

There are very many Christians who hold to the secular theory of civil government; not, however, in the sense of total disconnection from God as portrayed by the National Reform argument, but as being ordained of God, as declared in Romans 13:1. God has ordained that there should be civil government in this world, in order that the world may not be filled with anarchy, and "that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life, in all godliness and honesty." 1 Tim. 2:1, 2. God has created all men equal, and wishes all to live in the enjoyment of their equal rights. This is the secular theory of the ordained sphere of civil government, and it is the one which accords with Scripture and with the Golden Rule. It ought therefore to be held by all Christians.

The "reform" argument appeals to precedent in the matter of the employment of chaplains by the Government to officiate in connection with the transaction of public business by Congress, or with the exercises of the army and navy, and says, "The only thing consistent with the secular theory is to discontinue prayers in Congress." True; and such prayers ought to be discontinued. It is all right for people to pray for Congress and for the success of all worthy undertakings with which that body may be concerned; but such prayer must be offered merely as the prayer of an individual, and not in the capacity of a government official, which is that of a representative of the people. Religiously, the people have no representative save Jesus Christ, he whom the high priest typified in the service of the sanctuary, in the days of the Jewish theocracy. To set up a religious representative of the people in Congress is really nothing less than blasphemy, though it is done, of course, with motives no one will impugn.

Persons acting in representative capacity naturally feel under some obligation to give expression in their official action to the wishes and ideas of those to whom they owe their appointment. Hence it is not strange that the official prayers in Congress should frequently, as they do, have a partisan coloring. Again, it is quite natural that "patriotism," in a time of some national crisis, should cause the official prayer to breathe forth anything but the gentle spirit of love to our enemies which is characteristic of Christianity. The last session of our National House of Representatives, which convened while the Venezuelan excitement was at its height, was opened with the prayer, "Heavenly Father, let peace reign throughout our borders. Yet may we be quick to resent anything like an in-insult to this our nation," etc. The business of a nation is not Christianity; it is not for this that it keeps its standing armies and builds its navies. It is not in pursuance of this that it demands reparation for an injury and satisfaction for an insult. And it cannot consistently hire an individual to pray for that which is contrary to its own policy. But any prayer that is dictated by anything else than the pure spirit of Christianity, is a mockery, and would far better remain unuttered. And it might be added, that any work for souls which is actuated by the love of temporal reward rather than by the movings of the divine Spirit, can only result in far greater harm than good.

The secular public-school system is next brought forward as an evil to be remedied by the proposed "Christian" Amendment; and the "reform" party, pointing to this system, exclaim, "Secular teaching, secular books, secular history, secular science,—every branch, godless, Christless, religionless!" But this is mere assumption. Who can limit or locate the presence of God? Who can tell through what means God may be working? Is not his presence everywhere, indeed, save in sinful hearts which have shut him out by their own volition? May not God reveal himself to the student of the sciences, or of history, in the things which he studies? Does not all nature speak of his power and glory? Ah, it is not the secular books, or the secular teaching, which shuts out God and his lessons of divine truth from the mind; but it is the heart itself which welcomes the truth or turns from it, according as it is controlled by the forces of good or evil.

There is a world-wide difference between the meanings of the terms "secular" and "godless." "Secular" has no reference to religion at all; "godless," on the contrary, means irreligion. The teaching of the discovered laws and phenomena of science is purely secular teaching; but it is not anti-Christian teaching. The laws of nature are the laws of God; and God has made all his works to testify of him. "The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament sheweth his handiwork." Ps. 19:1. And further, we read that "the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they [all men] are without excuse." Rom. 1:20. Let the laws of God and the works of God speak for themselves, and they will never testify against their Maker.

But the religious amendmentists would have in our public schools teachers whose religious qualifications were determined by the State, to teach the word of God as interpreted and construed by the courts, or by some other human authority. They would convert these schools into sectarian institutions, thus making them no longer public, though maintained and controlled by the State. They would open the door for this injustice, in order that God might enter. But God will not walk hand in hand with injustice.

We are asked also to "remember that the logical and consistent friends of secular government are atheists, infidels, deists, Spiritualists, and skeptics generally." This is mere word-painting. The real truth is, as the amendment party must know, that their opponents will when the final issue comes, include all who may find themselves in the position of dissenters from the prevailing religious views. In every land where the government assumes to take charge of religious exercises and teaching, there are numerous dissenters who profess the Christian religion. It could not possibly be otherwise in this age of diversified religious beliefs.

Thou let the National Constitution remain as it is,—the charter of the common rights and liberties of all. Let not any injustice be perpetrated in the name of God; and let religious teaching be left to the home, the church, and the denominational school, free from the compulsion of the civil arm, to be impressed upon the mind by the divine power of that Spirit which alone is able to reveal the things of God, and to guide the human understanding into all truth.
