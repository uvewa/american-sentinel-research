# LOW GROUND ON WHICH SUNDAY-OBSERVANCE IS URGED.

BY REV. A. H. LEWIS, D. D.

No institution rises higher than the average reasons which men give for its existence. If there be both higher and lower reasons supporting it, and the lower reasons be urged to the exclusion of the higher, the institution is correspondingly degraded. This is an inevitable law, against which it is useless to complain. The history of the Sunday question presents some marked illustrations of this truth. The popular interpretation of the meaning of the fourth commandment is, in the narrowest sense, materialistic. That interpretation makes physical rest to be the central point in the matter of Sabbath-keeping. A "rest day once in the week," is as high as the average theory rises. Instead of making the rest secondary, as it really is, to the higher idea of spiritual rest and religious instruction, the order is reversed, and the religious phases of the question are either secondary, or wholly eliminated. Such a view places the whole question on the low, earthly, human plane. Such a conception cultivates the idea that when one has rested from ordinary business or labor, he has sabbatized. Whereas, the higher truth is, that he only has sabbatized, according to the spirit of the fourth commandment, who has rested, that he might thereby attain communion with God, spiritual rest and religious culture.

This low conception necessarily appeals to the lower motives as a ground of obedience; indeed, the popular theory has gone so far that no motive higher than the individual choice enters into the mind of the average man in the matter of Sunday observance. But where anything like authority is sought, it is sought on the lower plane, thus increasing the evil which the conception of sabbatizing already noticed has begun. For instance, it is urged that man's physical health demands rest one day in seven; that this is most conducive to long life; that thus men are enabled to do more work, therefore, to earn more money; that machinery wears longer when permitted to rest; that beasts of burden are more valuable if permitted to rest; that soundness of mind and soundness of body demand periodic rest. It is further urged, that the interests of the commonwealth are thereby served, since the individual health and the productive power, and the economic habits of the individual members of the commonwealth, are all increased by giving the body periodic rest. Even religious teachers often appeal to this line of argument, either because there is no higher conception in their own mind, or because they think the masses can be made to apprehend the low-ground argument, rather than the higher. Whatever reason may induce this appeal, the result is the same in each case,—a low conception, the lowest conception which can possibly be called true, in regard to Sabbath-keeping.

Such arguments and conceptions neither appeal to religious conscience, nor cultivate it. When we add to this the fact, that since the introduction of no-sabbathism in the second century, the great mass of those who have professed Christianity have held to and taught that theory, we have an additional reason why the public mind is conscienceless concerning Sunday. When this no-sabbath philosophy drove the Sabbath from the church, the void which was left was filled (through the action of civil law) by not only the Sunday, but by many other festivals. This shows why the low-ground conception has become the prevailing one, and why the popular appeal is to the lowest arguments. There is no place in the general theory concerning Sunday for the higher argument, or the divine authority. The results which are upon us, therefore, are legitimate.

While there is a degree of truth in these low-ground appeals, more careful investigation is revealing the fact that much of the argument so claimed is not supported by facts. The report of the Massachusetts Bureau of statistics made a few years ago, shows that the effect of Sunday labor in different departments indicates that there is no perceptible loss in physical strength, or in the money earned by Sunday laborers. They get pay for seven days' work in the week, and while some of them would prefer the leisure, none were found suffering in their physical health for want of it. It must be granted that investigation in this direction has not gone far enough, nor been continued long enough, to make a positive argument, pro or con, upon this point. If, however, the popular claim concerning the advantages and disadvantages of Sunday labor were true, with the rapid increase of Sunday labor throughout the land, there would already have come a corresponding decrease in general health, and general prosperity, which has not come, and is not promised by existing facts.
