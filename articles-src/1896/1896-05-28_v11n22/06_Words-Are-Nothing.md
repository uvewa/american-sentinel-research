# WORDS ARE NOTHING.

[New York Herald, May 14, 1896.]

The Christian Endeavors are a very admirable class of people, and on more than one occasion it has been a pleasure to commend their work. They ought not however, to waste valuable energy in the attempt to accomplish the impossible or the unnecessary. There is so much which must be done that it is poor policy to try to do what would be of no special value if it were done.

They have set themselves to the task of having the name of Deity inserted in the Constitution, and of late have sought the aid of certain Methodist and other conventions for the purpose of emphasizing their claim.

But the introduction of the name of Deity in a public document is not of any practical moment. Putting the word "God" everywhere does not put the Spirit of God anywhere. Mere words count for nothing when things rather than words are what we want. If by a popular vote you were to insert the Apostles' Creed into the Constitution it wouldn't make us all Christians.

The Constitution is a document containing a good deal of wisdom, and the men who framed it put into it all they thought necessary to political orthodoxy. They were God-fearing and worshiping men, whose faith and faithfulness compare favorably with our own. They at least did not need the word "God" in print in order to keep them in the path of virtue, public or private. Do we?

It is better to have the thing without the word than the word without the thing. The Endeavors should bend their energy to get what the word stands for rather than insist on the word itself.
