## A NATIONAL SUNDAY BILL.

We made brief mention last week of Senate bill number 3,136 introduced on the 13th inst. by Senator Kyle, read twice and referred to the Committee on Education and Labor. This bill is as follows:—

### A BILL FOR SUNDAY REST.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That no person or corporation or agent, servant, or employé of any person or corporation shall perform or authorize to be performed any secular work, labor, or business to the disturbance of others, works of necessity and mercy and humanity excepted; nor shall any person engage in any play, game, or amusement or recreation to the disturbance of others on the first day of the week, commonly known as the Lord's day, or during any part thereof, in any Territory, district, vessel, or place subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States; nor shall it be lawful for any person or corporation to receive pay for labor or service performed or rendered in violation of this section.

SEC. 2. That no mail or mail matter shall hereafter be transported in time of peace over any land postal route, nor shall any mail matter be collected, assorted, handled, or delivered during any part of the first day of the week: Provided, That whenever any letter shall relate to a work of necessity or mercy, or shall concern the health, life, or decease of any person, and the fact shall be plainly stated upon the face of the envelope containing the same, the Postmaster-General shall provide for the transportation of such letter or letters in packages separate from other mail matter, and shall make regulations for the delivery thereof, the same having been received at its place of destination before the said first day of the week, during such limited portion of the day as shall best suit the public convenience and least interfere with the due observance of the day as one of worship and rest: And provided further, That when there shall have been an interruption in the due and regular transmission of the mails, it shall be lawful to so far examine the same when delivered as in ascertain if there be such matter therein for lawful delivery on the first day of the week.

SEC. 3. That the prosecution of commerce between the States and with the Indian tribes, the same not being work of necessity, mercy, or humanity, by the transportation of persons or property by land or water in such way as to interfere with or disturb the people in the enjoyment of the first day of the week, or any portion thereof, as a day of rest from labor, the same not being labor of necessity, mercy, or humanity, or its observance as a day of religious worship, is hereby prohibited; and any person or corporation, or the agent, servant, or employé of any person or corporation who shall willfully violate this section shall be punished by a fine of not less than ten nor more than one thousand dollars, and no service performed in the prosecution of such prohibited commerce shall be lawful, nor shall any compensation be recoverable or paid for the same.

SEC. 4. That all military and naval drills, musters, and parades, not in time of active service or immediate preparation therefor, of soldiers, sailors, marines, or cadets of the United States on the first day of the week, except assemblies for the due and orderly observance of religious worship, are hereby prohibited, nor shall any unnecessary labor be performed or permitted in the military or naval service of the United States on the Lord's day.

SEC. 5. That it shall be unlawful to pay or receive payment or wages in any manner for service rendered or for labor performed or for the transportation of persons or property in violation of the provisions of this Act, nor shall any action lie for the recovery thereof, and when so paid, whether in advance or otherwise, the same may be recovered back by whoever shall first sue for the same.

SEC. 6. That labor or service performed and rendered on the first day of the week in consequence of accident, disaster, or unavoidable delays in making the regular connections upon postal routes and routes of travel and transportation, the preservation of perishable and exposed property, and the regular and necessary transportation and delivery of articles of food in condition for healthy use, and such transportation for short distances from one State, district, or Territory into another State, district, or Territory as by local laws shall be declared to be necessary for the public good, shall not be deemed violations of this Act, but the same shall be construed, so far as possible, to secure to the whole people rest from toll during the first day of the week, their mental and moral culture, and the religious observance of the sabbath day.

As we remarked last week, this bill is in some respects the most intensely religious Sunday bill ever before Congress. It is entitled "A Bill for Sunday Rest," but the closing words of Section 5 show its purpose to be to secure "the religious observance of the sabbath day," by which is meant Sunday of course.

It is not the expectation of those who have secured the introduction of this bill that its passage can be secured during the present session if at all. Their purpose is to make it the basis of a vigorous campaign something similar to that conducted in behalf of the World's Fair Sunday closing clause. Congress will be overwhelmed with individual and representative petitions, until as was the case in the World's Fair legislation the petitioners from some states will outnumber the entire population.

The "representative" petition was sprung on the country in 1892 by Mr. Crafts, late of the Christian Statesman, now of the National Bureau of Reforms, or more properly speaking, of the national lobby for securing religious legislation by Congress. The scheme was worked in this way: The "petition" was first indorsed by vote of the highest representative body of each of the denominations interested in the matter; and then the entire membership of each denomination taking such action was counted as petitioners. Then presbyters, synods, State conferences, local associations, etc., etc., of the same denominations indorsed the "petition" and thus the entire membership of each denomination was counted again. Then the "petition" was adopted by local congregations, W. C. T. Unions, Christian Endeavor societies, etc., and thus the same individuals were counted again and again until, as before stated, some States furnished more "petitioners" than they had men, women, and children within their borders. We are doubtless entering upon a similar era of "reform."
