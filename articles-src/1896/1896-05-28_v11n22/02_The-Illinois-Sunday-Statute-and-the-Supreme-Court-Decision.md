## THE ILLINOIS SUNDAY STATUTE AND THE SUPREME COURT DECISION.

Last week we referred very briefly to the decision handed down on the 12th inst. by the Illinois Supreme Court, declaring unconstitutional the "Cody law" which prohibited harbers from following their trade on the first day of the week.

This decision is in line with, but goes much further than the decision by Judge Gibbon of the Cook County Criminal Court reviewed at some length in these columns November 28 of last year.

In declaring the statute in question void, Judge Gibbons said:—

> I could never willingly consent to a law which would single out one class of citizens and visit them with penalties and punishment for actions which are innocent in themselves, from which all other classes are exempted.

The inference is that had the act in question been one of general application Judge Gibbons would have sustained it; indeed this is more than an inference, for he said also:—

> I should gladly uphold impartial legislation or—

daining one day of rest in every seven; and if that day should fall on Sunday, it would meet with hearty approval from the great majority of the American people.

The decision by Judge Gibbons amounted to little more than a bid to the Sunday people to secure the passage of a statute of the general and sweeping character referred to,—a "law" that would prohibit not only one class but every class from "actions [on Sunday] which are innocent in themselves."

But the decision of the Supreme Court is open to no such criticism. True, one reason assigned for declaring the statute void is that "the act affects one class of laborers, and one class alone;" but the fundamental reason assigned is that "the barber is thus deprived of property without due process of law, in direct violation of the Constitution of the United States and that of this State."

"The statute declares," says the court, "that it shall be unlawful for any person or persons to keep open any barber shops on Sunday. The owner is prohibited from doing any business whatever during one day in the week. The income derived from this place and his own labor and the labor of his employés is his property, but the legislature has by the act taken that property away from him. The journeyman barber is by the law denied the right of laboring one day in the week. His labor may be the only property he possesses. And yet this law takes that property away from him."

As already stated the court holds that time and business opportunities are property, and declares the act void because it takes from men this property without due process of law. This is both good law and good sense. And when it comes to be realized by people generally that time is property it will be seen how immense is the tribute which, by means of Sunday "laws," the churches levy upon the people! If any man is willing to pay such a tax out of regard for the Divine Being, that is his privilege; but how monstrous is the assumption on the part of the State of the authority to compel such payment!

But this decision does not stop with the barbers. If it is unconstitutional to deprive the barbers of one day each week because time is property, is it not manifest that the State cannot for the same reason deprive any man or set of men by legislative act, of any portion of their time by forbidding them to employ it in labor or business? It certainly is. Certainly no Sunday "law" worthy the name can now be sustained in the State of Illinois.

Indeed according to the decision of the Supreme Court the State of Illinois has never had a law protecting the first day of the week. The court says:—

Under the law of this State, as it existed prior to the passage of the act in question [the Cody law], each and every citizen of the State was left perfectly free to labor and transact business on Sunday or refrain from labor and business, as he might choose, so long as he did not disturb the peace and good order of society.

Just what would constitute a disturbance of the peace and good order of society it of course remains for the courts to decide, but in view of the Supreme Court decision under discussion it is clear that mental annoyance arising from religious bigotry and intolerance cannot constitute a disturbance "of the peace and good order of society" within the meaning of the law. It would seem that in view of the action of the highest court of the State the people of Illinois will be comparatively free for a time at least from the harassing bondage of meddlesome Sunday statutes.
