THE absurdity of the Roman Catholic production of infallibility for the pope from the decisions of a number of fallible cardinals, is paralleled by the "national reform" doctrine that the people, being incompetent to govern themselves, should by their votes evolve a form of government which will be free from the defects of popular government. It would seem that these "reformers" have yet to learn that a stream cannot rise higher than its fountain head.
