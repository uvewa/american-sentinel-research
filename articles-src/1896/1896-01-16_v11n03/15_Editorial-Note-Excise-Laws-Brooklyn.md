We have received a copy of a circular sent out January 9 by several temperance and religious societies of Brooklyn, calling for "a united and emphatic protest" by "the churches in Brooklyn" against the laxity in the enforcement of the excise laws in that city. "We have abundant evidence," it says, "that no fewer than ninety per cent. of the licensed saloons are open on every Sunday and that liquor is sold in many of them to minors and drunkards, and that often the police freely enter these saloons for improper purposes at hours when the law requires them to be closed.

We call attention to this circular because of the frank disclosure it makes of the real purpose of these excise laws, and the object of this protest, by saying: "At the beginning of a now municipal administration, the time is opportune for our citizens who believe in the sacredness of Sunday and in the sacredness of law, to enter a protest against this flagrant violation of the excise laws." Why, then, according to this document, should the excise laws be enforced? The plain answer is, Because Sunday is a sacred day. The sacredness of law is also adduced; but the "law" itself, in this case, rests wholly upon the assumed sacredness of the day; so that this assumption is really the sole support for this demand that the saloons should observe Sunday according to the terms of the "excise laws." In other words, these and all other Sunday "laws" are based upon the assumption that Sunday is a day which ought to be observed by rest and public worship, and therefore the excise Sunday "law" derives all the sacredness it has from the assumed sacredness of Sunday. But Sunday has no sacredness; for God, who alone can impart sacredness, never made it so. He made the seventh day sacred, but no other. Hence a "law" which owes its existence to the popular practice and belief based upon this assumption, cannot be sacred.

Law is sacred. It is sacred because justice and right are sacred. The law of justice covers the whole ground of human legislation; and when that legislation expresses the law of justice upon the point concerned, it is sacred. But when it is contrary to that law, it is certainly not sacred.

The fact that liquor is sold to minors and drunkards is a reason why the saloons should be closed, but it does not call for a protest from those who believe in Sunday sacredness, any more than from those who do not so believe. It is bad—exceedingly bad—that intoxicants should be sold to minors and drunkards; but it is no less bad that they should be sold to young men who are not drunkards, to make them such. It is bad that intoxicants should be sold on Sunday, or on any other day. Sunday prohibition cannot stop intemperance, e en on that day. It can however exalt Sunday—a religious institution—and that is what it does. But no religious institution ought to be upheld by legislation.

Therefore the proper action is to protest against any law that does not aim to "excise" (cut off) the saloon completely. There is no more reason why intoxication and inciting thereto should be prohibited merely on Sunday, than there is why stealing or any other crime, and the inciting of people thereto, should be prohibited merely on Sunday.

Let all crimes be prohibited on all days and at all hours.
