The Rev. J. D. Fulton, author of "Washington in the Lap of Rome," spoke in the People's Temple, Boston, Dec. 15, and gave utterance to some bold and dangerous theories concerning the proper policy to be pursued in view of the antagonism between Americanism and Romanism. That he had the attention of a large audience, and that "his fullest and strongest utterances were applauded to the echo," as appears from the report of the Boston Daily Standard of the following day, are significant features of the occasion.

The theme of Mr. Fulton's discourse was that Americanism is to conquer Romanism, if not by ballots, then by bullets; and that patriots should prepare themselves for a war with either.

"Americanism," he said, "is to conquer Romanism in accordance with the behest of an Almighty purpose." "Before Rome was built or the foundations of London's greatness were laid, the vision of our Republic came into the dream of the king of Babylon. . . .

The dream had to do with five great periods of human history, one of them at the zenith of its greatness and four yet to come. They have come and largely gone. Turkey and the Mohammedan power that has covered the eastern world with its curse, is now tottering to its fall. The kingdom of stone is here in the Republic of the United States, whose greatness is conditioned upon its smiting the image that sets God at defiance."

What the purpose of the Almighty is, as outlined in the prophecy referred to, may be seen from an examination of the second chapter of Daniel. Verses 34 and 35 describe the "stone" and its work as seen in the king's dream, and verses 44 and 45 make it clear that this part of the dream relates to the setting up of the kingdom of God, "which shall never be destroyed," and "shall not be left to other people; but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand forever." The Rev. Mr. Fulton, however, would have his hearers believe that there is divine warrant for viewing the stone which "smote the image upon his feet," as a symbol of the United States, and that which it smites and breaks in pieces, so representing the Roman Catholic Church. His view would no doubt suit the natural inclinations of many Americans; but it is wholly without scriptural warrant, and if sought to be carried out, would revive the worst pictures of the Dark Ages. It is true that the Papacy will be smitten, together with all earthly kingdoms, when God sets up his kingdom which shall stand forever; but the smiting will not be done by any earthly power. There is nothing in this prophecy to justify boastful predictions of the future of this or any other earthly government.

Other prophecies refer no less clearly to the destruction of the Papacy as an act of the power of God. In 2 Thess. 2:3-8, we are told that the Lord shall destroy this "man of sin," "who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God or that is worshiped"—"with the spirit of his mouth" and "with the brightness of his coming." See also Rev. 19:11-20.

Mr. Fulton further said that "the future of this country is conditioned upon the image being struck and broken in pieces by the embodiment of that principle Daniel saw when God placed before him the vision that plagued the king of Babylon. Americanism is the incarceration of the purpose of God. It is his expression and thought concerning government. It is the dynamite force to be used in smashing every image that is the expression of the opposing force arrayed against the spread of truth." Coming then to the question, "Does this prophecy foretell a war of bullets or ballots?" he cited Abraham's example in training those under him both for home duties and for the field of battle, and said: "May it not be our duty to recognize the fact that while we need educated men for the requirements of civil life there may come a time when the ballot will be exchanged for the bullet, and when that hour arrives we shall want in the army something besides Roman Catholics to command our armies and navy, to protect our altars and our homes? Do I hear you say there is no danger? Then there will be no harm done. Americans will not begin the fight, but they will end it; and when Romanism lifts its traitorous hand against the country that has given it shelter, and attempts to make the American people bow down to her image, the stone will smite the image, and then shall come the fulfillment of the prophecy, 'Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron, thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.'"

There are, unfortunately, in this country a large number of speakers and writers besides Mr. Fulton who are doing their best to launch the nation upon an iconoclastic mission of smashing everything that is not in harmony with their conceptions of right and the divine will. And they are forming organizations, publishing papers, petitioning Congress and the State legislatures, and getting the support of statesmen and even of political parties, for the furtherance of their un-American schemes.

Verily, a terrible storm-cloud is hanging over the religious world as well as over the realm of international politics. The time is at hand when, as one writer has said, "Old [religious] controversies will be revived, and new ones will be added; new and old will commingle," and the result will be confusion, hatred, strife, and every evil work. It becomes us now to raise a warning voice against every movement aiming to enforce ecclesiastical dogmas and settle religious controversies by the power of the State.
