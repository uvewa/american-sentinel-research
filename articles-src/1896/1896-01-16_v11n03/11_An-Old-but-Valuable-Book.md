We are in receipt of a copy of a modern but faithful reproduction of the oldest historical literary and devotional work extant. This book contains an authentic account of the formation of this planet, of the origin of the human family, of the great convulsion of Nature which changed the face of the earth, formed our coal beds, and finally locked in the embrace of never-yielding ice lands that originally basked under summer skies. From it we learn of the peopling of the earth, discover the origin of the various races of men, behold the rise of civilization and trace the course of empire as westward it takes its way. And last but not least its pages tell of a new heaven and a new earth one day to spring at the divine flat from the ashes of this present evil world wherein shall dwell only righteousness.

And yet the half has not been told; for this book tells the story of the cross, invites the sinner to repentance, offers pardon, and promises eternal life. The reader need not be told that the work we refer to is the Holy Bible; no other book does all nor a tithe of that which we have here stated, and all other books do any of it only as they draw from this one Book of books. Grand Book! Glorious mission!

But this particular copy of the Bible contains features all of which are not found in any copy of the Sacred Writings. It is self-pronouncing, all the proper names being divided into syllables with diacritical marking. Bound with it are copious helps consisting of illustrations, plates, maps, tables, index, concordance, etc., etc., making it one of the most, if not the most, complete teachers' Bible published. This Bible is made by the International Bible agency of this city, to the manager of which we are indebted for an elegant copy, and who will cheerfully furnish further information upon application. Full particulars, prices, etc., will be furnished also by the Pacific Press Publishing Company, 43 Bond Street, New York.
