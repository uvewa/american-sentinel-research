Or one feature of the proposed Sunday "law" for the District of Columbia, the *Sabbath Outlook* (Seventh-day Baptist) says:—

It grants no rights to Sabbath-keepers unless they "religiously observe Saturday." On any trial under such a law the court must decide what a religious observance of Saturday is! This is the essence of governmental interference in religious matters, an interference which cannot be tolerated under our national Constitution. This provision also leaves the opportunity for grave injustice, under the clause, "As not to involve or disturb others."

This bill is intensely religious, and it transcends the limits of religious liberty in prohibiting all "business or traffic" except the "dispensing of medicines." Why interfere with business on Sunday more than on Monday, except on religious considerations?

There is but one honest answer to the question raised by the *Outlook*, namely, there is no reason other than the religious regard in which the day is held by many.
