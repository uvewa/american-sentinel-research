*[Special correspondence to the American Sentinel.]*

A very extended and interesting contest over the Cody Sunday "law" has now closed, at least for the present, with a complete victory for the friends of religious liberty. Something like three hundred warrants have been sworn out during the past three months, and yet up to the present time there has not been a single conviction under the "law." A more determined opposition to the so-called Sunday laws has perhaps never been made, and a more substantial victory during the entire history of the Sunday agitation has never been gained over the Sunday forces.

The methods pursued by the Sunday-law advocates were those usually pursued by this class of our citizens. Every judge who heard the cases pronounced the crusade persecution, and declared from the bench that the pretended enforcement of the alleged "law" was a disgrace to the officials implicated and tended to bring the administration of law in the State into disrepute. Nearly all of the newspapers, however, contrary to the general expectation, upheld the pseudo law, and defended the Sunday advocates in their endeavors to enforce the statute.

When the controversy had begun to attract considerable attention, Attorney Blakely, the counsel for the association contesting the validity of the statute, advised the people not to pay a cent to any justice as fines, costs, fees, or for any purpose whatever; but merely as peaceable and orderly citizens to go without resistance when the constable took them. Non-resistance would gain for them the approval of the better classes, while non-payment of fines and costs would deprive the persecutors of all gain in their trafficking with the liberties of citizens.

This new movement surprised and at the same time enraged those enforcing the "law." The officials must go without money or it must be furnished by the Sundayists themselves. One of the justices and the attorney representing the informers,—the "spies" or "rubbernecks" as they are termed in Chicago,—had a conference, and they decided to put a stop to any such movement once and for all. Like the Ephesians, they saw that their means of gain would be gone, and so they raised a great hue and cry against Attorney Blakely "violating" the law as well as the people.

"You may either pay these fines or go to jail," were the words addressed to seven of the "criminals."

"We will then go to jail, your honor," was the reply. "We have been advised by our attorney that all fines, costs, and fees, under an unconstitutional statute, such as this is, are illegal, and as citizens who value our liberty we have resolved to stand on our rights. We refuse to pay the fine."

"I am sorry that you are following an attorney's bad advice," said the justice; "but you will have to take the consequences, not I. Mr. clerk, make out orders committing these men to jail."

And they all went to jail, and the justice went along with the constable to see that they got there.

It took until three o'clock the next morning to get out writs of habea corpus, and let the men out on bail; but the men got out just the same, and were thus taken out of the jurisdiction of the justice court into the higher court where they were examined under the writ. When the examination was concluded, the judge was indignant at the justice of the peace, and declared that he was nothing more than a common barrat or and added that if his attorney had advised him to pursue the course he had taken that the attorney should be disbarred from practice. At the motion of Attorney Blakely, the costs and fees for the writs were charged against the offending justice, amounting to $80.50. The decision caused considerable comment and some consternation, but it was effectual in stopping the justices from sending men to jail to make them pay illegal costs under an unconstitutional "law."

After this, some hundred and fifty case were taken before another justice by means of a change of venue, and the other justice after hearing the arguments, declared that the statute was unconstitutional and void, and dismissed the complaints.

The Religious Liberty Association has been taking advantage of the controversy to introduce their literature, and it has received a hearty welcome.

The Sunday forces now having been defeated so effectually under the Cody Sunday "law" have determined to renew the fight under the "law" providing that no work shall be performed to the disturbance of the peace and good order of society on the first day of the week. It is therefore evident that it has been the religious institution and not the barbers, as they pretended that they were so particular to protect by means of "law" and force.

In this movement the churches have been the chief supporters of the Sunday cause, and Victor F. Lawson has contributed $200 to defend the Cody statute in the Supreme Court. Mr. Lawson was one of those fined for disobeying the orders of the court in closing the World's Fair on one Sunday, and it is a very significant fact that those who are engaged in the present contest are the same persons as those engaged, contrary to the desires of the laboring people, in closing the World's Fair on Sunday, two years ago. In every new agitation the same old agitators come serenely to the front, and under some new pretense attempt to foist upon the people the same old dogma of union of some religious institution with the power of the State.
