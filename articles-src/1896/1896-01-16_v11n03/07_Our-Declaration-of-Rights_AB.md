[By Addison Blakely, Ph. D., Lecturer in Political Science and History, University of Chicago.]

In the course of English political development, as in the course of all political development, a thousand times there have arisen disputes between the ruler and the ruled as to the measure of governmental authority. At first, of course, the question arises merely as to particular acts; but as it is seen that each time aggression assumes a new form, the experience results in laying down general declarations of what the law limiting governmental power is. At first, these declarations are fragmentary and disconnected. But, as struggle after struggle goes on, as revolution after revolution takes place, as declaration after declaration is made, these great declaratory documents begin to assume completeness and largely cover the field on which governmental force most commonly trespasses. Thus the law limiting,—I was going to say,—but more properly declaring the limit of the proper sphere of action of government, develops and takes the form on its abstract side in declarations of rights, and in its more concrete form in those institutions which hold the official within well understood limits in the part he takes in wielding the force at the command of the State.

In its unwritten form the law is known as the common law, and in its written forms as Bills of Rights and Charters in England, and as Constitutions and Declarations of Rights in America. The most notable documents embodying this formerly unwritten law, are the Magna Charter of King John, the Petition of Rights of Charles I, the Bill of Rights and Act of Settlement of the Revolution of 1688, the Declaration of Independence of 1776, and the Federal Constitution of 1789.

"The common law of England," says Chancellor Kent, "so far as it was applicable to our circumstances, was brought over by our ancestors upon their emigration to this country. The Revolution did not involve in it any abolition of the common law. It was rather calculated to strengthen and invigorate all the first principles of that law, suitable to our state of society and jurisprudence. It has been adopted, or declared in force, by the constitutions of some of the States, and by statute in others. And where it has not been so explicitly adopted, it is nevertheless to be considered as the law of the land, subject to the modifications which have been suggested, and to express legislative repeal."

"They insisted," says the Chancellor, speaking of the early New England settlers, "that they brought with them into this country the privileges of English freemen, and they defined and declared those privileges with a caution, sagacity and precision that have not been surpassed by their descendants. Those rights were afterwards, in the year 1692, on the receipt of their new charter, reasserted and declared."

Several of the expressions in our Constitutions can be traced back to Magna Charter; and some to a half millennium earlier to the very earliest collections of English law, which would seem to indicate they existed long before we had any transcript of the law at all.

In America, the first declaration of rights made by the colonies collectively was by the congress of delegates which met in New York in 1765. But a more complete and formal declaration was made by the first Continental Congress in 1774, which declared "that their ancestors, who first settled the colonies, were, at the time of their emigration from the mother-country, entitled to all the rights, liberties, and immunities of free and natural born subjects; and by such emigration they by no means forfeited, surrendered, or lost any of those rights; . . . that the respective colonies were entitled to the common law of England," and so on.

"The rules of the common law which confine the discretion of Parliament within the ancient landmarks," says Judge Cooley in "Constitutional Limitations," "are rules for the construction of the powers of the American legislatures; and however proper and prudent it may be expressly to prohibit those things which are not understood to be within the proper attributes of legislative power, such prohibition can never be regarded as essential, when the extent of the power apportioned to the legislative power is found, upon examination, not to be broad enough to cover the obnoxious authority. The absence of such prohibition cannot, by implication, confer power."

"Nor when fundamental rights are declared by the Constitution, is it necessary at the same time to prohibit the legislature, in express terms, from taking them away. The declaration is in itself a prohibition, and is inserted in the Constitution for the express purpose of operating as a restriction upon legislative powers."

Legal rights, therefore, antedate any and all "declarations" of such rights. The term itself shows them to be prior, and that the "declaration" is merely nominal and not creative. The numeration, in formal shape, is merely for emphasis to make doubly sure of their enforcement, and to render a denial of such fundamental rights as difficult as possible.
