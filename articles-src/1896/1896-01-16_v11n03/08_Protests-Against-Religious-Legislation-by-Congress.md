As announced in our last issue, there is now before Congress a bill for a Sunday law for the District of Columbia. This effort to commit Congress to a course of religious legislation has not escaped the notice of all lovers of liberty in this country, and protests and petitions against it are being received from various quarters by those having the bill in charge. The Religious Liberty Association of the District of Columbia have entered protest against the passing of the measure, as follows:—

To the Honorable the Commissioners of the District of Columbia, and the Committees on the District of Columbia of the Congress of the United States.

Gentlemen: We enclose preamble and resolutions passed at a meeting of the International Religious Liberty Association of the District of Columbia in opposition to House Bill 167, introduced by Mr. Morse, of Mass., which is a bill for a Sunday law for the District of Columbia.

There are a number of reasons which might be given why the Commissioners of the District and the Congress of the United States should have nothing to do with any such proposals; but there is one consideration which so far overshadows all others in its importance as to render unnecessary, indeed, the presentation of any other in the same connection. We therefore confine ourselves to this one, and that is—

The bill, in its terms and in its intent, is distinctly religious, and being such it is entirely beyond the jurisdiction of Congress by the First Amendment to the Constitution which explicitly declares that "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof."

1. In its terms the bill is distinctly religious, because in the first clause and in the seventh line it provides that those who are exempted from the operation of the law shall religiously observe Saturday instead of Sunday, thus making the government the judge of the character of the observance of the seventh day of the week by those who profess to believe in the observance of that day.

2. In its intent the bill is religious, because not one of the promoters of the bill would say for a moment that the acts prohibited in this bill were wrong in themselves, or at any other time than on the Sunday; and they are held to be wrong on that day only because of the character of the day, and not at all because of the thing done. In other words, it is the character of the day itself, and not the character of the thing done on the day, which determines the criminality of the action in this bill and all similar legislation. This demonstrates that it is the religious character of the day, and that only, which is held in view in the bill.

By these facts it is demonstrated that the bill, both in its terms and its intent, is distinctly religious. Further than this, the effect of its passage by Congress would inevitably be to involve the National Legislature in the decision of a religious controversy, for the reason that the bill forbids the doing of certain acts on "the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday."

Assuredly your honorable body is not unaware of the fact that there is now rife throughout both the District of Columbia and the nation no inconsiderable controversy over this very question as to which day is the Sabbath. And it is well known by many that the chiefest object of this bill is to get Congress committed to the support of that party which insists that Sunday is the Sabbath. Is it the province of your honorable body or of Congress to decide this question? Yet more than this, if Congress should assume this prerogative and pass the bill declaring Sunday to be the Sabbath, would the question be decided? Would an act of Congress convince the Jew or the Christian Sabbatarian that he was wrong in his reading of the Scriptures, and in his consequent observance of the day which is the Sabbath?

The bill, being religious in its terms, in its intent, and in its inevitable effects, it follows conclusively that Congress is positively forbidden by the First Amendment to have anything at all to do with it.

For, that such is the intent of the First Amendment is evident from the following consideration. Amid the discussions and the interesting and important events that immediately preceded, and in fact led up to, the making of the Constitution as it is as respects religion, this whole question was widely discussed. And James Madison, upon a subject identical with this in principle, published these weighty words which we have adopted as our own:

"We hold it for a fundamental and undeniable truth, that religion, or the duty which we owe to our Creator, and the manner of discharging it, can be directed only by reason and conviction, not by force or violence. The religion, then, of every man must be left to the conviction and conscience of every man; and it is the right of every man to exercise it as these may dictate.

"If religion be exempt from the authority of society at large, still less can it be subject to that of the legislative body. Either, then, we must say that the will of the legislature is the only measure of their authority, and that in the pleatitude of that authority they may sweep away all our fundamental rights, or they are bound to leave this particular right untouched and sacred. Either we must say that they may control the freedom of the press; may abolish the trial by jury; may swallow up the executive and judiciary powers of the State—nay, that they may despoil us of our very right of suffrage, and erect themselves into an independent and hereditary assembly, or we must say that they have no authority to enact into a law the bill under consideration."

For these reasons, briefly stated, but sufficient, we protest against the consideration of this bill; and respectfully submit to the careful consideration of your honorable body, this our remonstrance.

ALLEN MOON, Pres.

In view of the introduction of this bill in the House, and in the Senate of a joint resolution proposing a religious amendment to the national Constitution, the following preamble and resolutions have been presented to the proper congressional committees by the same association:—

Preamble and Resolutions passed by the Religious Liberty Association of the District of Columbia.

WHEREAS, In obedience to the demands of many religionists there was introduced into the Congress of the United States the following proposed legislation: In the House of Representatives on Dec. 6, 1895, by Hon. E. A. Morse, a bill providing for the enactment of a Sunday law for the District of Columbia, and on Dec. 16, 1895, in the Senate by Senator W. P. Frye, a joint resolution proposing an amendment to the Constitution of the United States, for the recognition of Christianity as the common law of the land, and

WHEREAS, The passage of such legislation would commit the government to a system of religion, in direct opposition to the Declaration of Independence and the provisions and guarantees of the Constitution, and

WHEREAS, Civil government has no right to enforce religion, and exists to protect all citizens in their right to be religious or not provided they do not violate the civil rights of others; and rights of citizenship cannot rightfully be made dependent upon whether the person is religious or not, therefore,

Resolved, That the Religious Liberty Association of the District of Columbia do hereby earnestly protest against the consideration by Congress of any matter affecting the religious rights of the people, and appeal to the makers of the civil law to enact no legislation contrary to the provision of the Constitution which declares that "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof," and

Resolved, That copies of this preamble and resolutions be transmitted to Congress and the Commissioners of the District of Columbia.

ALLEN MOON, Pres.
G. C. EMERY, Sec.

The Seventh-day Baptists, also, have prepared the following petition, and are forwarding the same, with signatures, to the committee having charge of the bill for the District of Columbia:—

To the Hon. J. W. Babcock, chairman, and to his associates, members of the Committee on the District of Columbia, to whom House Bill No. —entitled, "A bill to protect the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday, as a day of rest and worship in the District of Columbia," has been referred:—

Gentlemen: We, the undersigned, citizens of the United States, and voters, do hereby respectfully and earnestly petition and pray that the bill named above be "adversely reported" by your honorable body, and for the following reasons:—

1. The National Constitution debars Congress from legislating on religious questions, as proposed in the bill under consideration, e. g., the expressed reason for prohibiting labor, business, etc., on Sunday is purely religious, viz., that it is "the Lord's day, set apart by general consent in accordance with divine appointment as a day of rest and worship," etc. The exceptions named as "works of necessity and mercy" originate from the ancient Jewish law of the Sabbath. Thus it is proposed to determine by statute and court what is proper to do or not to do on "a day of rest and worship," made such "by divine appointment."

2. This bill proposes "class legislation" on purely religious grounds, in that certain persons are exempted, providing they "religiously observe Saturday." In case of trial, the courts must decide in what the "religious observance of Saturday" consists, and upon what grounds it rests.

3. Such a law would do grave injustice to a large number of citizens who deem all days of equal religious sacredness, and also to those who do not deem it a religious duty to observe either the seventh or the first day of the week as a "day of rest and worship." Your petitioners also plead that the provisions of this bill are opposed to religious liberty in general, and to that freedom of thought and action in matters religious which the Constitution guarantees to all citizens, and that its enactment into law would open the way for endless unjust, unobtrision and un-American interference in religious faith and practice on the part of Congress. For these and many other reasons your petitioners pray that this bill be "adversely reported."

We are, of course, heartily in sympathy with this petition, and with the protest and preamble and resolutions here given. Let all lovers of liberty unite in opposition to these dangerous measures now claiming the support of this Government.
