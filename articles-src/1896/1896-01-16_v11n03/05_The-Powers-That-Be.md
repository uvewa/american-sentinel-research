**A SOUTH DAKOTA correspondent asks:**

Can any earthly government be ordained of God that does not recognize God or Jesus Christ or the Scriptures in the constitution of that government? In the Declaration of Independence our fathers declared themselves free from all other power on earth; free from the power of God and his Son Jesus Christ.

This question can be best answered by Dan. 2:37, 38: "Thou, O king, art a king of kings: for the God of heaven hath given thee a kingdom, power, and strength, and glory. And wheresoever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the field and the fowls of the heaven hath he given into thine hand, and hath made thee ruler over them all."

Certainly Natsuchadnezzar ruled in the providence of God; not simply by his permissive but by his active providence. However, we do not hold that the words of Rom. 13:1, "The powers that be are ordained of God," refer to the men, or rulers through whom the powers are exercised, but to the powers themselves; "there is no power but of God." In Deut. 8:18 we read: "Thou shalt remember the Lord thy God; for it is he that giceth thee power to get wealth."

Not only has God given man power, that is, knowledge and ability, to produce that which is necessary for his sustenance, but he has given him power to safeguard the rights with which God has endowed him. Such power, the power of civil government, is absolutely necessary for a race of social moral beings in a state of alienation from God. Sin makes every man selfish, and had God not given to men the right to protect themselves from the aggressions of their fellowmen, one of two things would necessarily have been true; either justice administered by God himself would have been so swift and certain as to have terrorized men and thus destroyed their free moral agency, or it would have been so long delayed as to have afforded no protection to those who had need of it.

The Declaration of Independence does not deny, but on the contrary affirms the power of God, and acknowledges him as the source of all power; not indeed in so many words, but by a necessary inference, when it declares that "all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights." And it is for the purpose of securing these God-ordained rights that "governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed." That is, God having given to men certain rights and given them the power to safeguard those rights, it belongs to them to say into what form of government that power shall be crystallized and by what individual or individuals it shall be administered.

Every man has a natural right to maintain his own God-given rights; but God has created man a social being, and civil society naturally grows out of the nature of man as a social being. It is natural for men to associate themselves together in communities and in States; and when so associated the power which naturally belongs to each individual, the God-ordained power which is implanted in the very nature of every man, is delegated to a few men who are chosen to serve their fellowmen in the capacity of officers. The power is primarily of God; but because that is true, no man has a right to usurp that power over his fellowmen upon the pretext that he has been commissioned of God to exercise the power, any more than Guiteau had to take the life of President Garfield upon the pretext of divine authority; or to exercise the aggregate powers of the people without the consent of the people; and that is what the Declaration of Independence means. The Declaration of Independence is not a denial of the power of God nor of the fact that all power is from God, but it is the denial of the right of any man to usurp authority over his fellowmen.
