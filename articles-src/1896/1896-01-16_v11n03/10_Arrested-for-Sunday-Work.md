A CORRESPONDENT in Indiana writes as follows:—

William Bailey, an employé at the C. & E. railroad shops at Huntington, Ind., owns a house and lot at a small place called Brown's Corner, about seven miles from Huntington. The kitchen roof leaking, the rainy weather made it necessary to repair it at once. Being unable to get a day off, on Saturday, the 14th of December, he sent material for repairing the roof out to the Corner by his wife, and on Sunday went home and did the work. For this he was arrested and tried before Justice Scott Cole, at Huntington, and fined $1 and costs, amounting to $28.30. He refused to pay, and filed an appeal bond. Mr. Bailey is not a seventh day keeper. W. H. LENGEL

The fact that Mr. Bailey is not a Sabbatarian cuts very little figure in this case. The State has no right to require any man to keep Sunday or any other day; and to do so is persecution whether the victim observes another day or not.
