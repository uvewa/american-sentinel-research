REFERRING to our leader of last week, Rev. A. H. Lewis, D. D., of Plainfield, N. J., calls our attention to the fact that the Seventh-day Baptists in their ninety-third anniversary held last August, passed the following resolution:—

*Resolved,* That we extend our heartfelt sympathy to those Sabbath-keepers of Tennessee, Maryland, Georgia, and other States, who have been, or who are now suffering from the malicious application of unjust Sunday laws.

This resolution though nothing more than was to be expected of such a liberty-loving people as Seventh-day Baptists is creditable to them, and certainly entitles the denomination to be noted as an exception to our statement, which however was intended to include only Sunday-keeping bodies. And since the matter has been called to mind we incline to the opinion that a Lutheran Synod somewhere in the West also took similar action.
