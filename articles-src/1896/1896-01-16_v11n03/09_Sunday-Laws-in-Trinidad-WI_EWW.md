THIS colony has had a Sunday law for some time, but it is not severe enough to suit some of the leading churchmen. It permits business places to be open until 9 o'clock Sunday mornings, so that the poor people who have no way of preserving their provisions over night in this hot climate may have opportunity to get what little they are able Sunday morning. And some of them are so poor that they could not get food one day ahead, so the law as it is accommodates them somewhat.

But this is offensive to some who have keener senses of the way in which the day should be kept, and in 1893 they made an effort to "better" the law; but they were not successful,—all honor to the governor for it. The leading ministers of Port-of-Spain assembled and drafted a bill, and induced one of the members to introduce it into the Colonial Council on the 4th of Nov., 1895. It was accepted to be finally acted upon at the next meeting of the Council.

Immediately on hearing of it I sent the following protest to the governor, and about the same thing to three other members of the Council:—

C. J. UVA, Trinidad, Nov. 6, 1895.

SIR F. N. BROOME,
St. Anns, Port-of-Spain, Trinidad.

Your Excellency, Governor of Trinidad and Tobago:

I see by the Port-of-Spain Gazette of yesterday that an ordinance was introduced into the Council meeting on the 4th, by Mr. Alcazer, entitled, "Sunday Trading Ordinance." I have not seen a draft of the bill, but its title indicates that it is likely to be one that will interfere in no small degree with the rights of the people. I beg not to be thought intrusive, nor to blot that your excellency is not fully able to decide such questions in the best interests of your subjects. On the contrary, your decision on a similar question in 1893 fully proves your excellent wisdom, and gives me the more boldness to address you on this issue.

I take the liberty to send you a small publication of the International Religious Liberty Association, of which I have the honor of being the colonial agent for Trinidad.—"The Sabbath Question in the Dominion Parliament,"—which I earnestly hope your excellency will have the time and disposition to peruse carefully, and which I hope will be not only interesting but profitable to you.

Please allow me also to call your mind to a few thoughts which, however, your highness may have entertained before:—

1. This bill is introduced through the instigation of a few of the high ecclesiastics, who, for the purpose of gaining their own ends, of augmenting their own power, pretend to have a great interest in the welfare of the people at large. These men have money enough to purchase their Sunday's provision the previous day, also the ice and ice-cheats with which to preserve it; is it then a small matter to deprive these hundreds of poor people, who must buy on Sunday or go hungry, the privilege of purchasing enough to give them a little comfort? This course is a sure way to make the people hate the day and the government. If the tables were turned what a protest would arise!

2. It is ostensibly to gain a better observance of the "sabbath." But can a law enforcing idleness secure sabbath-keeping? Will the mass of the people who will thus be compelled to abstain from business on one day, have any better idea of sabbath-keeping? Can spirituality be enforced by civil enactments? If a better observance of the Sunday is what is wanted, why do not these men spend some of their energies in teaching the people what true Sabbath keeping is, and get them to observe it from love to God, and not from fear of the civil law? It seems to me, your excellency, as though it was for patronage. Keep the people from secular business on Sunday and they may be more apt to attend religious services. Or, on the part of some of the merchants, they would like to keep the Sunday, but are afraid that if they do and others do not, their business will suffer one day's trade, while their neighbor has that much the advantage of them. In other words, they would like to keep Sunday, but have not enough faith in God to do so if their trade is in danger of suffering a little; so they must make other merchants keep the day too, so they may keep it! The idea that we must compel all others to keep Sunday that we may do so, can be answered in one sentence: We cannot be Christians unless all others are too, so we must make a law to compel them to be Christians that we may enjoy that coveted privilege! I speak not against Christianity, but for it. It is higher than this.

3. It is a religious question, one upon which civil government has no authority from God to act. Where has God ever conferred upon any earthly government the right to make laws for him in things solely spiritual, as this is? Where has he ever commissioned his representatives on earth to make such demands upon any government? To do so is a usurpation by them of undeleated powers; as it would be also on the part of the government to accede to their demands in such matters. It is true that there are some who honestly wish to do something to bring about a better state of things in this matter; but are they not sadly mistaken to think that compliance with such laws is Sabbath-keeping? or even to think that it prepares the way and leads to it? It lowers the standard of religion, as it gives the people the idea that that is Sabbath-keeping, which is not.

4. It will work an evil to the government and prove a curse to the church. The courts would soon have their hands full of criminal cases for spiritual offenses. The subjects would be no better off with it, for they will feel that an unnecessary and unjust restraint is placed upon them, and would stealthily strive to avoid it; and thus they would be learning disobedience, and to resist just authority. It would be to teach them hypocrisy and incivility, and perhaps insubordination.

5. There are Jews and also Christians in this island who religiously observe the seventh day, and feel bound by the same command to work six days. Ex. 20-8-11. It would work great hardships to such were this ordinance passed. It would either deprive them of one-sixth of their time and cause them to violate their consciences (thus making them bad citizens), or, if they were too true to God to disobey him, would bring upon them fierce persecution by those who would be incensed against them enough to enforce the law or enter complaint; for they would have to obey God rather than man; or, losing heart, they would soon become the most irreligious and uncivil and dangerous persons on the island. And can your excellency tell who would sooner enforce the law than those who could find no better arguments to answer the truths of the Bible that the seventh day is the Christian Sabbath and should be kept instead of the first day? And upon whom do you think it would sooner be enforced than upon those who deduce from the Scriptures unanswerable arguments that the seventh day is the Sabbath, and who have courage and religion enough to live out their convictions. A mistaken religious zeal leads to cruel deeds.

Trusting, Sir, that your excellency will have patience with this protest, and assuring you that I remember the exhortation to "pray for kings, and for those in authority."

I am, with greatest respect,
Your obedient servant,
E. W. Webster.

The following is his excellency's reply:—
Government House, Trinidad,
November 9, 1895.

Dear Sir,

I am directed by his excellency the governor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 6th inst., inclosing a pamphlet entitled "The Sabbath Question in the Dominion Parliament."

His excellency has been very much interested in the perusal of your letter, and of the publication you inclosed; and I am to thank you for your views on this important question.

Believe me, Sir,
Your obedient servant,
P. Sec.
E. W. Webster, Esq.

We promise the readers of the SENTINEL that they shall hear of the final action of the Council.
