## THE PEOPLE AND THE SUPREME COURT.

In view of the widespread and continued criticism of what is construed as an attack upon the national Supreme Court by a leading political party in its latest "platform," it is instructive to call in review some action of a similar nature by a political party nearly forty years ago. We refer to an "attack" made on the Supreme Court by the Republican party "platform" of 1860.

The ground of controversy on that occasion was that "in December, 1850, five of the eight judges of the Supreme Court decided that the terms of the Missouri Compromise, which had been observed as good law since 1840, were unconstitutional, and Congress could not prohibit slavery in any of the Territories." In view of this decision the Republican party in their national "platform" for 1860, said:—

The new dogma, that the Constitution of its own force carries slavery into any or all of the Territories of the United States, is a dangerous political heresy, is revolutionary in its tendency and subversive of the peace and harmony of the country. We deny the authority of Congress, of a Territorial legislature, or of any individuals (meaning, doubtless, the Supreme Court), to give legal existence to slavery in any Territory of the United States.

And previous to this, in 1857, just after the rendering of the historical Dred Scott decision, the legislature of the State of New York made allusion to the Supreme Court in these words:—

The safety and peace of the nation require its reorganization, so as to admit into it a fair and equal representation from the free States, according to the ratio of population between free and slave States, which can and ought promptly to be done by act of Congress.

This was not the language of revolution, or of anarchy. It was not inconsistent with republican government; indeed, it was the voice of true republicanism, which declares that government of the people is by the people. It was based upon recognition of the truth that in civil government the people are supreme—the creator superior to the thing created. The Supreme Court could not bind the people; it was not created for that purpose.

While the Supreme Court is entitled to the highest respect from all parties, it is not a body with omniscient wisdom or unlimited power. When it comes to be venerated as speaking with the voice of infallibility, and binding the people in all cases by its decisions, so that to question one of them at any time shall be denounced as revolution and anarchy, we shall then have in this country not a republican government, but a judicial despotism.
