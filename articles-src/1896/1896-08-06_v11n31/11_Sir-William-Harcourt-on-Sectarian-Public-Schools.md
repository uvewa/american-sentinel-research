# SIR WILLIAM HARCOURT ON SECTARIAN PUBLIC SCHOOLS.

[Christian Register, July 23, 1896.]

The attempt to introduce sectarian elements into the English Education bill brought out the withering sarcasm of Sir William Harcourt in his London speech: "If this government, or any government, aspire to deal with the education of the people, I should advise them to steer clear of the bishops. They are most excellent men, but they are the worst possible advisers. I have no doubt they are 'as innocent as doves,' but they are not 'as wise as serpents.' If we are to establish the education of the people upon a sound basis, let us establish it upon national, and not upon denominational, principles. Let us stand by the principle of popular election and popular control. The attempt on the part of the government first to cripple and then to absorb the school boards, is an attempt that has ignominiously failed, and it will not be repeated. The government tried to kill the school boards, and the school boards have killed the government. . . . There remains a good, sound basis of common sense in this nation, and it is that common sense, and not the obstruction of any party, which has destroyed the Education bill of 1896."
