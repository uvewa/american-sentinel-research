## "POLITICS IN HEAVEN."

THERE is abundant evidence just now of the presence of politics in the pulpit, but we deny the presence of any such thing in heaven, although we have the assertion of a Missouri clergyman to the contrary. The latter is the Rev. Mr. McAfee, a professor in Park College, Parksville, Mo. Sunday evening, the 26th inst., the professor preached to the Christian Endeavor Society, in the Second Presbyterian Church of St. Louis, Mo., a sermon on "Christianity and the Political Situation," of which a press report said:—

In conclusion, the speaker urged that politics be brought nearer to heaven and to Christianity. He quoted the Apostle Paul as saying: "For our conversation is in heaven," and begged to be allowed to translate it, "For our politics is in heaven," holding that the silver question or any of the issues that divide the people into parties can best be decided in the light of Christian counsel.

Of course, in trying to preach politics to their congregations from the Word of God, the clergy will have to be allowed considerable latitude of interpretation. But when people arrive at the conclusion that "our politics"—or anybody's politics—is in heaven, or that the currency question is an issue there, they have simply reached a degree of latitude which dispenses with the Word altogether.
