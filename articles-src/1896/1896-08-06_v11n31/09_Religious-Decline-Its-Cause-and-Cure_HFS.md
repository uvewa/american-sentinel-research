## RELIGIOUS DECLINE—ITS CAUSE AND CURE.

BY H. F. SETRING.

"He who does not keep the Sabbath, does not worship God; and he who does not worship God is lost." Never were words uttered by fallible man, containing more truth than those just quoted from a lecture delivered by W. W. Everts of Chicago, in a Sunday convention held at Elgin, Ill. It is the negative way of saying, He who keeps the Sabbath, worships God; and he who worships God is saved. This has most logically led to the conclusion that a revival of true Sabbath-keeping means a revival of true worship.

This conclusion will be denied by no one who believes the Bible: for to obey the fourth commandment by continually remembering the Sabbath, that when it comes we may keep it holy, ever keeps the mind upon God and his law, which enables man to keep his law; for "with the mind, I myself serve the law of God." Rom. 7:25.

Many modern religionists, having arrived at the conclusion that in promoting Sabbath observance, we promote religious worship, have adopted and act upon the old papal principle that the end justifies the means, and think that after admonition and advice have failed to secure the desired end, force can be resorted to. In such a course they ignore the teachings of the One who "spake as never man spake," who said, "If any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not."

Since the Bible does not authorize the observance of Sunday, much less the enforcement of it by law, but like the Constitution of the United States, absolutely forbids all religious legislation, those who formerly were as zealous for the enforced "religious Sunday," for man's salvation, are now clamoring for the enforced "civil Sunday," for the preservation of "peace and order."

The result of such a course can be readily seen. When mere physical rest and idleness are enjoined upon the people by the State, and called "Sabbath-keeping," the influence, instead of awakening the latent consciences of the people regarding the claims of God's law upon them, lulls them to sleep, and so blunts their already dormant consciences, that they soon think they are subject to no law but the civil law, which, if they obey, they have performed the whole duty of man. The old pagan political maxim of Roman government, — *Vox Populi, Vox Dei*,— "the voice of the people is the voice of God,"— is fast being enthroned in the minds of the average American citizen.

Still keeping in view the principle set forth at the beginning, viz.: "A revival of Sabbath-keeping means a revival of worship," how changed is the situation when Sabbath-keeping is viewed in the light of God's word.

When God's true Sabbath, the seventh day, is seen in its proper relation to God and the people—a memorial of one to the other—we will see, instead of men's consciences being blunted regarding God's claims upon them, that they will be quickened, and will render to God the worship that belongs alone to him.

In Psalms 111:4 we read: "He hath instituted a memorial of his wonderful works." — *German Version.* He also tells us in Eze. 20:12 and Ex. 20:8-11 that that memorial is "my Sabbath," "the Sabbath of the Lord thy God." Again he says in Eze. 20:20: "Hallow my Sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between me and you, that ye may know that I am the Lord your God." Then God has given us the Sabbath that by it we should remember who he is—"The Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in goodness and truth, . . . and that will by no means clear the guilty," Ex. 34:6, 7. "No good thing will be withheld from them that walk uprightly," Ps. 84:11. So, then, as long as we remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy, we keep before our minds the loving and benevolent character of God, and the fact that he is continually working for our profit. Had Eve, when tempted to partake of the forbidden fruit, and when told by Satan that "God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened,"— had she remembered that God withheld no good thing from her, she never would have transgressed the direct command of God, but would have known that the restraints that her Father had placed upon them was for their best good. Thus, it is plain that it is failure to remember God that leads to violation of his commands, which are all given in love.

But it is by forgetting the Sabbath—his memorial—that we forget God, for he says that if we hallow his Sabbath, we shall know or remember him. We can therefore see why it was given to man at creation; for it is clear that forgetting the loving kindness and generosity of our heavenly Father, by not remembering his Sabbath, which is the memorial of all that he is to us, is the first step leading in the way of sin.

If therefore, those who profess the name of Christians, and much more those who accept the responsibility of teaching others the way of life, would devote their time and talents to holding up God's true Sabbath, instead of raising a false standard, they would accomplish much more in forwarding Christ's kingdom than they are now doing.

The Lord says, "Hallow my Sabbaths; . . . that ye may know that I am the Lord;" and again, "This is life eternal, that they might know thee, the only true God." John 17:3.

Thus we see why Satan's hosts are arrayed against God's Sabbath, and those who keep it. Is it possible that those who profess to be followers of Christ, have enlisted under the banner of Satan in warring against God's "memorial." Oh! that they might say: "Yea, in the way of thy judgments, O Lord, have we waited for thee; to thy name, and to thy memorial is the desire of our soul." Isa. 26:8. R. V.
