## SUNDAY IN ORTHODOX GLASGOW.

*[New York Journal, July 27, 1896.]*

GLASGOW, July 16.—For the first time since I left New York, a day has come which I have found almost too sorrowful to endure; a day that has crept by on leaden, awful footsteps, while I have sat in a desolate hotel, wondering what crime of an elder day had caused Providence to inflict upon a suffering people the Caledonian "sawbath."

Yesterday afternoon I saw indications of approaching trouble in various signs and portents, whose full significance I utterly failed to comprehend, so busy was I in the pleasures and duties of the moment. Strong gusts of wind swept up the Clyde from the gray, misty sea beyond Arran Island, with sounds of moaning and lamentation that I distinctly recall now as I sit in the sombre smoking room, deserted by all but me, and try to write my impressions of the day that is almost done.

Every public house was filled with men and women, who were devoting the whole of the afternoon and the best part of their week's wages to the task of accumulating loads of whiskey that would carry them pleasantly through the day that lay before them. In comparison with the crowd that scrambled and fell into the compartments of the train that bore me back to Glasgow, the last Saturday night boatload of Coney Island revellers loomed up in my memory as an august, dignified and sober-minded body of citizens. Never in my life have I seen as many juvenile inebriates as I did yesterday, but never before have I seen people preparing for a Scotch "sawbath." On arriving at the Glasgow hotel, which had been fairly populous when I left it in the morning, I found that the guests—well-seasoned revellers all of them—were hurrying away, bag and baggage, in search of more congenial climes.

All these things passed before my eyes, but made no impression on my brain. The writing was on the wall, but I heeded it not.

When I awoke this morning I found that a silence as thick and oppressive as that which makes confinement in a dark cell at Sing Sing a terror to evil-doing convicts had settled upon the town. I dressed and went downstairs, where I found myself alone with my apprehensions.

Before long a servitor appeared, creeping along on tiptoe from the cavernous recess in which he had been lurking, and asked me in a whisper what I would like for breakfast.

"The prisoner awoke soon after daylight, and at seven o'clock sat down to a breakfast served from the warden's table and consisting of fried eggs, beefsteak, toast, boiled potatoes and coffee, of which he partook heartily, listening at the same time to the admonitions of the Rev. Mr. Surplice, the prison chaplain, who had remained in the corridor all night, so as to be within call at a moment's notice, if wanted."

Yes, I would have some eggs and some coffee and toast and a dab of the inevitable marmalade that pervades the breakfast table of the three kingdoms. After that the sheriff, the death warrant, the grim procession across the cold flags of the court yard—

"In ten minutes, sir," said the servitor, in a ghostly undertone, as he departed for the outer regions. I stepped softly through the front door and looked up and down the street. Not a single living creature was in sight. The bright morning sun shone upon a row of square, box-like houses of dull, cold gray, stretching away as far as the eye could reach, and reminding one of the pictures in old-fashioned drawing books designed to illustrate the theory of perspective.

The trees were absolutely motionless; not a bird sang or even stirred in their branches, nor could I hear any distant chiming of bells or cheerful rumble of wheels. I went down the steps to the side-walk, and for the first time in my life since the hookey-playing and apple-stealing period of my career, I shuddered at the sound of my own footsteps. When I say that I could not see a single vigorous column of smoke rising from any of the chimneys that were within the range of my vision, I am stating the simple truth. It is not lawful to keep warm or cook food in Glasgow on Sunday.

. . . The sepulchre in which I was stopping is situated near the centre of the city and remote from any of the regular arteries of travel. I walked a few squares, and then encountered a tram-car—a double-decked affair—moving at a snail's pace, not to the burying-ground, as I supposed, but to a botanical garden which is actually kept open on Sunday as well as on week days. I was agreeably surprised to find the flowers in full bloom, and to learn that the Glasgow ballies allowed them enough moisture to keep pollen and stamen together.

After skulking about the Botanical Gardens for an hour and meeting a few people with sorrow-stricken faces, I returned to the heart of the city, passing on the way two or three churches, from whose interior came the muffled roar of sombre orthodoxy.

I went to the railway station to buy a railway ticket for London, but found it closed and sealed. A bailee who was abroad at that hour told me that it would be opened at 8 o'clock, so that the city might purge itself of Godless foreigners who did not love the Glasgow "sawbath."

After church hours a few birds appeared on the streets, but they did not dare sing. They simply hopped about and picked at things like theologians.

Outside of Glasgow are cool, green woods, in which the birds sing every day in the week; the great river, the Clyde, where the yachts lie at anchor, and mighty steamers are built and launched; broad meadows; . . . cheerful solitudes, that my soul hungered for, but I could not reach them because the trains do not run on Sunday, and there was not a cab to be found anywhere.

About nightfall a few of the inebriates awoke from their all-day slumbers and dispelled a little of the gloom by appearing on the public highway and holding conversation with one another in the broadest Scotch I ever listened to. Encouraged by this indication that I had passed through the worst of the sabbath, I returned to my hotel and began to jot down my impressions of Glasgow.
