# BLESSING THE GROG SHOP.

[Prescot Truth (London, Eng.), July 23, 1896.]

The Russian State has taken over the sale of spirits, and so the spirit traffic becomes a State monopoly. As everything the Russian State does is "Christian" it was fitting that the new departure should be inaugurated last week by religious services in many of the drink shops now transferred to the Crown. The modern "Christian" State blesses what God abhors, and curses that which God has blessed. How could it be expected otherwise when we know that Satan is "the God of this world," and this world is composed of all the kingdoms of men? That is why we pray, "Thy kingdom come."
