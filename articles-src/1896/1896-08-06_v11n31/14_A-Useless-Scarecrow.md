# A USELESS SCARECROW.

[An exchange prints this comment touching the traditional belief in the connection between Sunday desecration and divine judgments, which found voice recently on the occasion of a Sunday disaster on a Western lake.]

A religious paper solemnly tells its readers the gale that wrecked a Sunday excursion on Lake Pepin was a judgment of God. What then are the gales that carry ninety-nine per cent. of such excursions safely on to their desired haven? And what of the Monday gales that wreck churches and drive pious deacons to their cyclone cellars? God does not pay by the day. Nor has he given to any of us the keys to interpret his providences. Let us retire the ancient scarecrow as to Sunday judgments. Crows flock to it with laughter instead of fleeing from it. Sunday excursions are dangerous, but in a deeper sense.
