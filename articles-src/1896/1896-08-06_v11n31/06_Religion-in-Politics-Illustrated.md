## "RELIGION IN POLITICS" ILLUSTRATED.

RECENTLY we alluded to the position of Hon. William McKinley, the Republican nominee for President, on the question of Sunday enforcement. And now the chief Republican manager, Mr. Mark Hanna, puts himself on record in the same manner by declaring that Sunday shall not be desecrated by Republican campaign work if he can prevent it. A press dispatch dated Chicago, July 26, to the New York World says:—

M. A. Hanna, Chairman of the Republican National Committee, issued an order last week that the rooms of the committee in Chicago should be tightly closed on Sunday.

To-day the rooms were tightly locked. A few local politicians who had not heard of the order attempted to enter but failed.

Perry Heath, head of the literary bureau, came down and looked over the mail, but did no business.

Mr. Hanna says he will have Sunday closing in New York, and proposes to enforce sabbath observance in the campaign so far as it is in his power. It has been the custom of the Republican National Committee heretofore to work every day in the week.

Mr. Hanna is evidently bent on taking his religion into his politics, and is giving an illustration of what "religion in politics" means. If all the rest of the politicians would now also take their religion into politics, each insisting that the campaign should be conducted in accordance with his particular religious views, the phrase would be illustrated still further. It is evident that it is not synonymous with the idea of honesty and justice in politics.
