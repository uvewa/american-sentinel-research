## THE POWER TO OBEY.

BY J. F. BALLINGER.

"For we know that the law is spiritual." Rom. 7:14.

The reason we know that the law is spiritual is because it was spoken by a spiritual being. Says Jesus, "The words that I speak unto you, they are spirit and they are life." John 6:63. "And the Lord spake unto you out of the midst of the fire; ye heard the voice of his words. . . . And he declared unto you his covenant which he commanded you to perform, even ten commandments; and he wrote them upon two tables of stone." Deut. 4:12, 13.

We know that this is the law that Paul refers to in Romans 7:14, which he calls spiritual; for in the seventh verse he refers to the tenth commandment and says: "I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet." Therefore the law of which one commandment says, "Thou shalt not covet," is a spiritual law. A carnal law could not come from a spiritual being.

This spiritual law when received in the heart by faith in Christ brings to the receiver a spiritual life, or in the words of the apostle, he is a "partaker of the divine nature." This divine or spiritual nature is wrought in the individual by the Spirit of Christ. "The spirit is life because of righteousness," that is, the Spirit of God writes the law of righteousness in the heart, and as "the law is life," this puts the individual in possession of "the life of God" in the soul, and by this he becomes "the epistle of Christ," "known and read of all men."

Any attempt on the part of any person to obtain a spiritual life without the Spirit of God is but to clothe himself with "filthy rags," and is a sin in the sight of God. "For whatsoever is not of faith is sin," that is, any effort on our part to obey a spiritual law without faith which brings the Spirit of God, is to reject the gospel of Christ which is the power of God to save men, and in which alone is the righteousness of God "revealed through faith." Then for any human power to try to compel obedience to a divine or spiritual law is to assume the power and prerogative of the Holy Ghost; and this is to put man in the place of God. It is the very "mystery of iniquity."

Says one, "We agree with you that the civil government cannot enforce the spirit of the law, but may it not compel obedience to the letter of the divine law?" We answer, No. To compel obedience to any law would be to destroy the individual's power to disobey. Just as long as a man has power to do evil he can do it, and the government cannot hinder him. We know that men have the power to commit any crime in the calendar if they choose to do so and the civil rulers cannot help themselves. Are not crimes being committed every day, and why do not the civil rulers stop them if they have the power to do so?

To compel obedience to the law the government must have the power to prevent men from violating it. But for civil rulers to prevent men from violating the law they must know beforehand that they are going to commit the deed; to do this they must be able to read every man's thoughts and know what they are premeditating, and even then they could not prevent the individual from violating every duty that he owes to God.

All they could do would be to confine the person whom they knew to be premeditating the crime and prevent him from trampling on the rights of others. But as it is impossible for civil rulers to know what a citizen is going to do, therefore it is impossible for them to compel him to obey. All that the government can do is to punish the person who violates the law; but this cannot reform the criminal; he may choose to harden his heart on account of the punishment and meditate revenge, or he may choose to reform his life and become a better man; but the reformation depends wholly upon his own choice and not upon the power of the government.

This fact is plainly shown in Paul's reasoning upon the duties of the civil ruler and the citizen in Romans 13. In verses 3 and 4 he says: "Wilt thou, then, not be afraid of the power? Do that which is good. . . . But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid." Here we see that the individual is left to choose to fear the rulers and do good and have praise of the same, or he can choose to do evil and suffer the penalty; but in either case it is left to his own choice. If he chooses to do evil, all that the minister of vengeance can do is to "execute wrath upon him that doeth evil."

But for the government to execute wrath upon the sinner will never "take away the stony heart" out of his flesh and give him "a heart of flesh," nor cause him to be "born of water and of the spirit," nor make him "walk after the spirit and not after the flesh." Neither will the execution of the penalty upon the criminal cause him to "love God with all his heart" or to "worship him in spirit and in truth," nor "love his neighbor as himself;" and where these conditions do not exist there is no reformation of life.

It is true that man may be intimidated, or afraid to commit crimes for fear of the "avenger of wrath," or for fear of the pains and penalties that will be inflicted upon him if he invades the rights of another. And this is all the power any civil government ever had or ever can have to prevent crime. They can compel obedience only by intimidation in executing the penalty. Take away entirely the fear of punishment from the minds of the people, and whose life, property or reputation would be safe? Not any. Nothing but the power of God in the gospel which is the love of God in the gift of his Son, and the exercise of faith which brings the spirit without the works of the law, can produce a reformation in the life and character of the individual.

How foolish then to talk about "putting God in the Constitution" and "Christian citizenship by civil law" and "Christ entering civil law through the gateway of politics." How such "propositions," "resolutions" and "bills" must sound in the ears of the heavenly beings! Methinks the angels must weep over such manifest departure from the divine plan to save men.
