## SUNDAY CRUSADE AT GROVELAND, MASS.

The Sunday crusade has broken in upon the public peace in the village of Groveland, near Haverhill, Mass. Close to the village is a very popular summer resort, called "The Pines," largely patronized by laboring people who cannot afford a vacation at the seaside. Here on Sundays and other days came those who sought a change from the atmosphere of town and city, and enjoyed a trolley ride through the country to the resort, where they could obtain refreshments and listen to a band concert on Sunday afternoons.

All went quietly and pleasantly until Sunday, July 19, when several apostles of the Sunday crusade visited the resort for the purpose of getting evidence against persons engaged in secular business on the grounds. The result of their spying was that several residents of the village were fined $10 each for violating the "sabbath." A clergyman of the village, Rev. Louis Berry, testified at the trial, and was largely instrumental in securing the convictions. So indignant were the people of Groveland made by the affair that they hung the clergyman in effigy to a beam of the Groveland bridge, where it was allowed to remain for several days. The Haverhill Bulletin, from which we gather these facts, adds: "The result can hardly be imagined, but the town is in an uproar over the occurrence, and the feeling against the minister and his colleagues is intense. Interesting developments are likely to follow, as several citizens were heard to remark that the affair was not settled by any means."

That clergyman stood before the people of his village as an ambassador from God, representing Him who said, "My kingdom is not of this world." As such his business was to persuade men to become reconciled to God. But what has he done? How much influence will he now have with the people of Groveland in seeking to win them to Christ? How much has he lessened his chances for saving souls in that community, and the chances of some, if not many, of the latter of ever being saved in the kingdom of God? Instead of drawing them nearer to God and salvation by the power of love, he has driven them further away by the force of the civil arm.

This is what clergymen do every time when they step out of their God-appointed place of ambassadors, to act the part of taskmasters in forcing the people to a certain line of conduct by civil enactments. What account will they render for this in the day of God?
