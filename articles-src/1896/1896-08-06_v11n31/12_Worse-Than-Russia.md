# WORSE THAN RUSSIA.

[The Truth Seeker, July 25, 1896.]

Every American, even those who are "patriotic," must feel the force of the rebuke administered to our law-makers by a Russian Jew who, with three fellow craftsmen, was recently arrested in Williamsburg, N. Y., for working on Sunday. Said he:—

When we were in Russia, a despotic country where the Hebrew is hated, we were allowed to work on Sunday, because our Sabbath is the day before. We came to America, thinking it was a free country, but we find that the laboring man is more of a slave here than in Russia.

Americans are easily satisfied who can boast of a sort of liberty that is denounced as tyranny by a subject of the Czar.
