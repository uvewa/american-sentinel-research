# THE WRONG STANDARD.

[Catholic Review (N. Y.), Aug. 1, 1896.]

SAYS the Independent: "This [Christian Citizenship] was the topic of a score or more of addresses Thursday evening last at the Christian Endeavor convention. We could wish that far more attention could be given to it. The leaven of an old heresy that religion and politics, religion and business, religion and amusements are antithetic terms needs to be overcome. Men refer to the sphere of religion as though it were a limited sphere, touching no other relations or activities in life. When anybody speaks about members of the Christian Endeavor Society becoming interested in civil affairs, it is as though some great sacrilege were proposed. 'What! carry religion into politics? The next thing will be to carry politics into religion!' And the way this is said shows that those who say it believe it to be the redactio ad absurdum, that it would bring ruin dire upon the Church, and that to dip the Church into the dirty pool of politics, would be a baptism of the devil. . . . The great need of the world is that God should be everywhere and constantly present. We want God in our business as well as in our churches; in our amusements as well as in our devotions; in our politics most of all."

But when the Catholic bishops of Canada recently acted on the principle here so correctly advocated in favor of the Christian Endeavorers, the same Independent declared: "The Catholic papers of the Province of Quebec have all signed a management instructing Roman Catholics that it is their duty to vote for the Conservative candidates. That is a somewhat high-handed measure, but nothing more than might be expected among French Canadians. Such official interference is bad politics and bad religion, and it will weaken the links which connect not a few Catholics with the Church." The Independent has two weights and two measures.
