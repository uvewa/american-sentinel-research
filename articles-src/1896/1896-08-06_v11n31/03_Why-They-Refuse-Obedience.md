## WHY THEY REFUSE OBEDIENCE.

In number 30 we gave, at some length, evidence showing that the Adventists who have been imprisoned in Tennessee and elsewhere for violation of the Sunday "laws," hold not only that the fourth commandment enjoins abstinence from labor on the seventh day of the week, but that it also forbids a like observance of any other day; and that for this reason, and for this reason only, they subject themselves to imprisonment by working on the first day of the week.

The persecuted Adventists hold that the Roman Catholic Church, the Papacy, is the persecuting power described in Dan. 7:25, 26, and parallel texts, and that the Sunday-sabbath is the badge of its power. Commenting on Dan. 7:25, Dr. Albert Barnes says: "Can any one doubt that this is true of the Papacy? . . . Indeed, the slightest acquaintance with the history of the Papacy will convince any one that what is here said of making 'war with the saints' (verse 25), is strictly applicable to that power, and will accurately describe its history."

This is the view generally entertained by Protestants, not only of the application of Dan. 7:25, but of many other scriptures. But one feature of the prophecy is very generally overlooked. Dan. 7:25 not only says of this power that he should "speak great words against the Most High," and "wear out the saints of the Most High," but also that he should "think to change times and laws," evidently of the Most High. This prophecy, the Adventists believe, is fulfilled in the "change" of the Sabbath by the Papacy. The Romish Church boasts of having made the change, and appeals to that fact, and to the acquiescence of Protestants in the change, as proof of her power to establish feasts and holy days, and to command their observance "under sin."

## Change of Day and Change of Reason for Observing It.

That the Sabbath has been changed so far as it is possible for man to change that which God has established, all are agreed; but when it comes to stating the reason and manner of the change, there is not the same unanimity of sentiment. Some have endeavored to show that it was by divine authority; but for this position there is no warrant in the Scriptures; moreover, the very nature of the Sabbath law forbids the idea that it should at one time enforce one day and at another time another day.

The fourth commandment sets forth explicitly the reason for enjoining the observance of the Sabbath, namely, the creation of the world, and God's rest on the seventh day of the creation week; and to change the day must, of necessity, change the reason for its observance. And to change the reason for an institution is to entirely change the institution itself, or rather, it is to destroy one institution and establish another in its stead. And this is just what has been done as far as man could do it, in the case of the Sabbath; for instead of the seventh day being kept as a memorial of creation, we have another day kept for another reason.

## The Change Made This Side of Christ and the Apostles.

That this change was made this side of Christ and the apostles, is thus confessed by an adherent of the Sunday-sabbath:—

The selection of Sunday, thus changing the particular day designated in the fourth commandment, was brought about by the gradual concurrence of the early Christian Church; and on this basis, and on none other, does the Christian sabbath, the first day of the week, rightly rest.—Christian Work, Jan. 8, 1885.

In order that none may misunderstand what is meant by "the early Christian Church," we supplement this quotation by another from the same paper, under date of Feb. 18, 1886, as follows:—

We hear less than we used to about the apostolic origin of the present Sunday observance, and for the reason that while the Sabbath and Sabbath rest are woven into the warp and woof of Scripture, it is now seen, as it is admitted, that we must go to later than apostolic times for the establishment of Sunday observance.

## Neander's Testimony.

This latter quotation shows clearly that the Christian Work does not think that the apostles, nor the church in the days of the apostles, had anything to do whatever with the change; and in this it is manifestly correct, as can be demonstrated by the most reliable historians. We have room in this connection for only a single extract, and until that is controverted (and it never c. n. be), it will not be necessary to cite any other proof. Neander, of whom "McClintock and Strong's Cyclopædia" says that he is "universally conceded to be by far the greatest of ecclesiastical historians," gives this pointed and candid testimony:—

The festival of Sunday, like all other festivals, was always only a human ordinance, and it was far from the intentions of the apostles to establish a divine command in this respect, far from them and far from the early apostolic church, to transfer the laws of the Sabbath to Sunday. Perhaps at the end of the second century a false application of this kind had begun to take place; for men appear by that time to have considered laboring on Sunday as a sin.—Rose's Neander, page 100.

This is a plain statement. But the fact remains that the change has been made; and if Christ and the apostles did not make it, how was it accomplished? If there is no divine authority for the change, what authority is there for it? And if it was not introduced in the days of the apostolic church, when was it brought in?

## The Papacy Did It.

In answer to those questions Adventists say the Papacy made the change not only without divine authority but in direct violation of the divine law; and that to observe the day, is, in effect, to recognise this apostate power as above God, who instituted the Sabbath. But it is objected by some that, as the Sabbath was changed at least as early as the fourth century, whereas the earliest date assigned by Protestants for the establishment of the Papacy is A. D. 538, it is not possible that the Papacy changed the Sabbath a century before it (the Papacy) had an existence.

But let those who make this objection remember that the Papacy was the result of growth. It did not spring into being in a day, nor did it attain full stature in a century. As early as A. D. 54, the Apostle Paul wrote:—

For the mystery of iniquity doth already work; only he who now letteth will be, until he be taken out of the way. And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming. 2 Thess. 2:7, 8.

This, as all Protestants agree, is a reference to the Papacy, or at least to the apostasy which culminated in the Papacy. The fact is, that instead of being established in A. D. 538, the papal power attained its majority at that time. Its infancy and youth were far back of that date, and not a little of its work was done before that time. In his history of the "Early Church," page 591, Killen says of the bishop of Rome:—

In the third century the chief pastor of the Western metropolis must have been known to the great officers of government, and perhaps to the emperor himself. Decius must have regarded the Roman bishop as a somewhat formidable personage when he declared that he would sooner tolerate a rival candidate for the throne, and when he proclaimed his determination to annihilate the very office.

At this time the bishop or pope of Rome exercised power over only a part of the church, but his power was the same in kind, if not in extent, that was exercised by his successors two centuries later. Those who deny that the Papacy changed the Sabbath, on the ground that the change was effected before that power had an existence, only show how limited is their knowledge of the history of the first great apostasy, and the development of the papal power.

## Pagan Features in the Papacy.

Protestants all agree that the papal system has in it many features borrowed from paganism; and just as surely as it has, Sunday-keeping is one of them. Every Bible student knows that the Scriptures contain no hint of the change of the Sabbath by divine authority; scores of first-day writers have acknowledged the fact; ecclesiastical historians of note have repeatedly said that "the festival of Sunday was always only a human ordinance." Do Adventists not justly accuse "the mystery of iniquity," which, even in Paul's day, was working for the corruption of the Church, with the sin of thinking to change the laws of God, especially the fourth commandment, as foretold by the prophet Daniel? And do they not also do well to obey God rather than man, even when to do so involves civil penties?
