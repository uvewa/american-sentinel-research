THE Christian Statesman, of May 2, 1896, says: "To plead for liberty, so far as the civil law is concerned, to play base ball on the Lord's day, because that is a matter of religion or irreligion, is worse than to plead for Mormon liberty as a matter of religious conviction to violate the seventh commandment with the abominations of polygamy." This has the ring of genuine Puritanism, which counted almost no crime as quite so bad as indulgence in worldly recreation on Sunday.
