The political situation is an enigma and presents the same aspect no two days. The government's position as briefly stated by its minister of government is: "The government cannot to-morrow show the clemency that it did yesterday." The government tells the people that "it keeps its promises and guarantees the liberties it recognizes." What these liberties are the reader shall judge for himself, from the statement of facts herewith given.

The former constitution granted many liberties not allowed by the present one, which by its terms, and under certain conditions, permits the president to exercise "extraordinary powers." This, to a certain extent at least, makes him equal to a king. By other specifications he is placed in a position which leaves him practically free from responsibility for his actions. The extraordinary powers, it is asserted, have been used to advance party interests and curtail the liberties guaranteed by the constitution.

A large class of citizens demand a return to the strict letter of the constitution as it now is. To secure this end they have organized political clubs opposed to the present regime. Whether they exist for any other purpose than to secure a full vote at the elections, which take place during the next four weeks, I am unable to say. It is certain, however, that they are not viewed with favor by the ruling party, but are regarded as revolutionary organizations. Another thing is also very evident, that if the elections are left to take a free and unobstructed course, others will be chosen for the places occupied by the present rulers.

There is a factor in the struggle that many of the people do not recognize, and that factor is the Roman Catholic Church. She may pose in the United States as the champion of civil and religious liberty, but her claims would have to be discounted considerably more than one hundred per cent. in this country in order to arrive at their true value. Those who are struggling for greater liberty think that they are good Catholics, and would not say anything to injure the church, regarding her as their friend. But does she regard them as her friends? By no means. Did she not, only a year ago, excommunicate and curse all who would not do her bidding? She certainly did in a circular issued by Bernado, Archbishop of Bogota, May 6, 1895, and printed in the SENTINEL June 27. The Archbishop's circular was only a prelude to the following circular just issued by the government:—

Circular No. 656.

Bogota, Republic de Colombia, April 4, 1896.

OFFICE OF THE MINISTER OF GOVERNMENT.

To the Governors, Department Commanders, Chief of Police, and Commanders of Military Posts:—

The Government has desired to surround, with all classes of guarantees, the important right of suffrage, and to this end its agents have been instructed.

But that which it has done to guard the rights of the citizen and fulfill a duty, some classes, who do not understand what it is to discharge a duty in an election, have taken as a sign of impotency or weakness on the part of the government. The sound of war, the hasty movements of warlike organizations, exist already in various parts of the republic. These do not tend toward a peaceful discussion. They are forerunners and producers of various disorders. The press already adopts a shamefully-insulting tone calculated to fire and stir up the mind, and it hardly ever fails to be a forewarning of a revolt. It appears as though a considerable part of our people, strangers to the practices of a republic, were totally incapable of peaceable electoral contests.

Confronted by such a situation the government cannot remain a silent and inert witness. It keeps its promises and guarantees the liberties it recognizes, but it does not confound, neither will it permit others to confound right with abuse, suffrage with sedition, in the revolutionary organizations at the voting places.

If on one hand it is not disposed to limit or restrict electoral rights, on the other hand it is prepared to suppress with energy and rigor the disorders that are announced as already existing in various parts of the republic on account of the elections. Public order and peace are above all else, and it is the government's duty—and it will perform it—to preserve these at whatever price; it will vigorously use the means that are in its hands to that end, although deploring that in a republic which appeared to be entering upon a settled life, such conflicts still arise.

Now, if these constant enemies of law and order have not learned from the recent severe chastisement given them, and intend again to renew armed resistance and rebel against the government. . . . the government cannot to-morrow use the clemency that it used yesterday. It must kill once and forever that revolutionary hydro and exterminate completely the virulent, loathsome ulcer of anarchistic liberation of Colombia.

You, the immediate agents of the government, will follow your former instructions upon this subject; but in no case must be tolerated the above-mentioned abuses. On the contrary, you will make use of the means that are at hand to arrest and hinder them wherever met, reporting your actions to this office.

Your obedient servant,

MANUEL CASARIANCA,
Minister of Government.

As I stated in the article referred to, printed in these columns June 27, 1895, the Roman Catholic Church in this country is the "essential element of social order." It is a well-known fact that the Roman Church has condemned through its head, the Pope, every idea and doctrine favoring civil or religious liberty. This fact is overlooked by those who are working for more liberty, or it may be unknown to them. It is certain that they do not recognize it as applying to themselves. They are honest in the belief that they are not working against the church when trying to obtain more civil liberty, but simply against the political organization known as the Conservative Party. For the church to plainly say to them, You have no more a part with me, would be to place her at once at their mercy, for those who are seeking more liberty are vastly in the majority. They would at once know who is their foe; but as it now is, they think her their friend, and she permits them to do so for the sake of gaining her own ends. Let us examine the part the church has been playing.

Under the former constitution Church and State were separate, but the religious leaders were not satisfied, and at last succeeded in organizing a revolution which proved successful. The former constitution was abolished and a new one made, in which, while appearing not to have any part in the affairs of the government, it really has control.

The first move on the part of the church was to get "God into the constitution," by inserting these words in the preamble: "In the name of God, supreme fountain of all authority." Now the church's claim that the Pope is God's representative on the earth, and that he is "Lord of the earth, the Master of the Universe;" that "the Pope is all in all, and above all, so that God himself and the Pope, the vicar of God, are but one consistory," really placed the State in the hands of the church when the name of God was admitted into the constitution.

The next step was to proclaim that the Holy Apostolic Catholic religion was the religion of the nation, but that the church was not an official one. This was done in Article 38 of the constitution, which also binds the government to protect and cause it to be respected as the "essential element of social order." Still not satisfied, a treaty had to be made with the "Holy See," and by its terms the church was reconciled with the civil powers of Colombia. But where in history do we read of the Roman Church being satisfied with the civil power, excepting where the civil rulers were subject to the authority of the church?

In the last presidential elections, Mr. R. Nuñez was chosen president, and Mr. M. A. Caro as vice-president. A little less than two years ago President Nuñez died. Since that time Vice President Caro has discharged the duties of president, but has always signed as "vice-president in charge of presidential affairs."

Mr. Caro has all along desired to become the president, and in harmony with Articles 123 and 127 of the constitution, temporarily resigned, on March 12 of this year, and his successor, General G. Q. Calderón, on the same day duly took charge of his post. Gen. Calderón immediately sent a circular to the various governors, from which is quoted the following points:

We shall endeavor to faithfully carry out the laws in harmony with the Constitution; . . . to be strict, rigid, and economic in matters of finance; to provide for the retirement of the paper money; . . . to reestablish the circulation of gold and silver; . . . to continue doing . . . the constitutional duty of protecting and causing the Holy Apostolic Catholic Church to be respected as the essential element of social order of the Republic; to advocate the establishment of public education upon this firm basis.

The reception accorded the proclamation, as well as that given to the General, indicated that he had struck a popular cord.

I will only add a brief comparison between the condition of the country while under a government in which the Church and State were separate, and that under which the Church has in fact been the ruling spirit.

Under the former, entire civil and religious liberty existed; the press was free, and freedom of thought and speech was enjoyed; gold and silver was the money in use; national credit excellent at home and abroad; education compulsory only in the sense that all must go to school a certain number of months during the year; prosperity and advancement was on every hand. Under the present, gold and silver has been replaced by a depressed paper money which requires more than $2.50 of it to equal one dollar of American gold, while before, the money of the country was often worth more than United States gold. National credit is all but gone; the debt is on the increase, with the greater part of its interest unpaid; with the educational institutions in the priests' hands, and after ten years' trial the rising generation rates lower in education than the former did; poverty has taken the place of prosperity; freedom of speech and press is restricted to the tolerance of the ruling party. My unhappy country, when wilt thou be free? When will peace and happiness reign within thy borders, and prosperity fill thy bosom? When? The dying echo replies, "Only when thou hast learned that thy foe has been her who has so long enjoyed thy love, thy confidence, and thy bounties."
