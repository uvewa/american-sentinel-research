A COMMUNICATION received May 6 from Mr. C. D. Wright, a Seventh-day Adventist, living in Walnut Ridge, Ark., states that one of his neighbors—an influential man and prominent church member—had gone to town threatening him with arrest for Sunday work. Consequently Mr. Wright was in hourly expectation of being taken into custody by the sheriff.
