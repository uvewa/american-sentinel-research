Ford's Store, Md., May 15, 1896.

EDITOR AMERICAN SENTINEL: I drop a few lines to inform you of the persecution here at Ford's Store.

Alick Dodd and myself, both Seventh-day Adventists, have been arrested for Sunday work. The road men took Brother Dodd's bridge up on Saturday at the foot of his lane and left it up, so that he could not get out on the public road without replacing the plank. He replaced them Sunday and was arrested. I live near the M. E. Church, and while looking round a little on Sunday, picked up two or three roots and tossed them upon a pile of such rubbish in my own lot. For this I was arrested, charged with two offenses—breaking the Sunday law, and disturbing public worship. I was at least one hundred and thirty feet from the church, and did not make any noise.

Both Brother Dodd and myself were brought up for trial, but waived examination, and were bound over to the Circuit Court, as I would not be tried by the magistrate because he had expressed his feelings toward our people in my presence, and I knew he would not do justice.

The accusers are as usual the class leader of the Methodist Church, and members of his flock for witnesses. Brother Dodd's hearing was on the 11th of May, and mine was on the 13th.

W. A. MANSFIELD.
