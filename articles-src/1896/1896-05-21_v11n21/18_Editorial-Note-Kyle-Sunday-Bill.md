THE most radical, far-reaching and openly religious Sunday bill ever yet before Congress was introduced into the Senate of the United States on the 13th inst. by Mr. Kyle, "by request." The bill is quite long, and was received by us too late for publication this week. We will print it next week with appropriate comment. The terms "Lord's day" and "religious observance," "religious worship," etc., are freely used in this bill, and but little attempt is made to disguise its real character.
