THE Congregationalist, not without good reason, has apprehensions as to the wisdom of settling church quarrels by special legislative acts. It refers especially to a quarrel in the First Church of Lowell, Mass., which has been before the public for some time.

The Lowell church, like most of the Congregational churches of New England, is formed of a church and a society. The society holds the property, and makes contracts with the pastor. The church is a religious organization, existing in association with the society. Membership in the society, according to the laws of the Commonwealth, may be determined by such by-laws as the society may adopt. In the Lowell case there has been a conflict between the church organization and the society.

The resignation of the pastor was first accepted by the society and then by the church. Afterward, however, the church rescinded its action. As the church was unable to secure a sufficient representation in the society to change the result of the society's vote, the quarrel was carried into the legislature, when a law was passed giving members of the Lowell church the right to membership in the society without the formality of a vote by that organization.

Without attempting to pass at all upon the merits of the difficulty between the church and the society, we believe that it is a dangerous precedent to carry church quarrels into the legislature. It would be much better to settle them by arbitration, and, if that cannot be done, by the courts. It is a question, too, whether the act of the legislature is constitutional, whether it does not interfere with the right of every religious society to prescribe its own conditions of membership.
