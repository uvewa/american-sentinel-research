The article published in this number, "God in the Constitution," is of unusual length, but we do not believe that it will be passed over by any who begin reading it. It is worthy not only of careful perusal, but of study, showing, as it does, that opposition to the so-called Christian amendment is perfectly consistent with the highest reverence for the divine attributes.
