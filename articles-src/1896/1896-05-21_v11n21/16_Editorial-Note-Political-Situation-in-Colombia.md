"THE Political Situation in Colombia" will be read with interest by all. It is apropos of the effort now being made in this country to "put God into the Constitution," and shows how the official recognition of religion must necessarily be so interpreted as to put political power in the hands, if not of a church, at least of a church party.

The Roman Catholic Church is not the official church of Colombia, but as the representative of Christianity, that church is guarded and protected as the conservator of social order. In our own country the National Reformers have declared that when the religious amendment shall have been adopted, the church will interpret the Scriptures, which will then be the fundamental law of the land, and the government must respect that interpretation. The situation will then be practically what it is to-day in Colombia. This fact gives special point and interest to this article.
