THE Supreme Court of Illinois on May 12 passed upon the validity of the "Cody law" of Illinois, which prohibited barbers in that State from exercising their vocation on Sunday. The court declared the "law" to be contrary to the Constitution of the United States and also to that of the State of Illinois, inasmuch as it sought to deprive a class of citizens of their property (in the form of their labor) without due process of law. The court also held that this "law" "is not calculated to promote the health, comfort, safety, and welfare of society, and hence cannot be regarded as an exercise of the police powers of the State." This decision places Illinois in line with California and Missouri in respect to this form of Sunday legislation.
