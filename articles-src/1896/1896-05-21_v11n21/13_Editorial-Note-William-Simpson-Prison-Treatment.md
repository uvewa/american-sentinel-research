We print on another page a letter from Mr. Simpson, the Adventist minister imprisoned in Chatham jail, Ontario, for quiet Sunday work that interfered with nobody. This man was locked in his cell all day Sabbath, May 9, because he refused to chop wood. He is required to wear the striped clothes of a convict, and is limited to a diet of dry bread because he is unable to eat the miserable skilly prepared for the prisoners.

The same day that Mr. Simpson was kept in his cell as a punishment for refusing to break the fourth commandment, a constable went to the meeting-place of the Adventists for the purpose of arresting Mr. Howe, another Seventh-day Adventist minister, who he supposed was to preach there that day. We do not understand that any of these men have made any effort to keep away from the authorities; they have simply gone about their business as ministers, and have not felt under obligation to go out of their way for the sake of being locked up. These things are done in the 19th century and not in the 15th or 16th, though they sound amazingly like records of the doings of the officers of "justice" in those days. The picture on page 163 shows the prison in which Mr. Simpson is confined, and which will shortly be the home of one or both of his brother ministers, convicted at the same time that he was of the heinous(?) offense of doing some preliminary work on Sunday toward laying the foundation of a new church, late last fall.
