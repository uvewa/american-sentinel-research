THE Supreme Court of Georgia has rendered a decision in the cases of Messrs. McCutchen and Keck, Seventh-day Adventists, arrested in Gainesville on Nov. 19, 1893, for doing work on Sunday. They were tried before the mayor of the city, on the charge of violating a city ordinance, and by him adjudged to be guilty and sentenced to pay fines of fifty dollars each, with costs, or work ninety days on the streets.

The Supreme Court has now reversed the decision, holding that a city ordinance forbidding disorderly actions and "unnecessary noise within the corporate limits, . . . calculated to disturb the peace, quiet or good order of the city," was not violated by the quiet work done inside a building by Messrs. McCutchen and Keck on the day of their arrest, or by the mental disturbance caused in some minds by a knowledge of the fact that the work was being done; also holding that the mayor had exceeded his authority in trying the cases, he having power only to hear and commit to the city court cases for trial. The decision therefore does not touch the question of the rightfulness of Sunday labor; but doubtless it is not less welcome to the defendants.
