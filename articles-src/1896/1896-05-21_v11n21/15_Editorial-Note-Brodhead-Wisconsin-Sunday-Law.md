COMMITTEE No. 3, "Sabbath" Observance, Brodhead Link, Civic Association, have given notice through the local papers of that place of its purpose to strictly enforce Section 4595 of the Wisconsin Sunday "law," which is as follows:

Any person who shall keep open his store, warehouse or workhouse, or shall do any manner of labor, business or work, except only works of necessity and charity, or be present at any dancing or public diversion, show or entertainment, or take part in any sport, game or play, on the first day of the week commonly known as Sunday, shall be punished by fine not exceeding $10; and such day shall be understood to include the time between the midnight preceding and the midnight following the said day, and no civil proceeding shall be served or executed on said day.

Of course, as is usual in such cases, the motive of the so-called Civic Association is purely benevolent! It would not interfere with any religious liberty for the world!! It only proposes that the people shall keep Sunday for their health, and incidentally for the benefit of the churches and especially of the contribution baskets.
