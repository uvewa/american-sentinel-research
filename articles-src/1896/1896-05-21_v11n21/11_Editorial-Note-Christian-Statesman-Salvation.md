THE Christian Statesman, of April 25, says that Jesus Christ "has heard our prayers for pardon as a nation, and has saved us by his death on Calvary from the just consequences of our national sin." But the Scripture says that "God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life." John 3:16. This means individuals, not governments.
