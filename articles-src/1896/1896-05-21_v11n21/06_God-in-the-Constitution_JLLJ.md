### The Preamble as It is and the Proposed Amendment.

The Preamble to the Constitution of the United States runs as follows:—

We, the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.

There is now pending before Congress a resolution, introduced by Representative Morse, of Massachusetts, proposing an amendment to this Preamble, which will introduce a parenthetical clause immediately after the phrase, "We, the people of the United States," which runs as follows:—

Acknowledging Almighty God as the source of all power and authority in civil government, the Lord Jesus Christ as the Ruler of nations, and his revealed will as the supreme authority in civil affairs, in order to form, etc. etc.

This resolution, introduced early in the session, was referred to the Judiciary Committee. This committee, on the 11th day of March, appointed a hearing, at which time arguments pro and con were presented relating to the amendment. Two hours' time was allotted, but over four hours were consumed. Being in Washington at the time, I was invited to be one of the speakers to present the argument against the amendment.

### Who are Urging the Adoption of the Proposed Amendment.

The amendment was ably urged by a large committee of clergymen representing various denominations, but receiving its executive energy apparently from an organization created expressly for the purpose with its headquarters at Pittsburgh, and representing chiefly, I think, the United Presbyterian fellowship. This movement is backed largely by the organic strength of the Young Men's Christian Association, the Young People's Society of Christian Endeavor, and the Woman's Christian Temperance Union organizations. The cause has its published organ and has called into being a considerable literature.

### The Gauntlet the Amendment Must Run.

Should the Judiciary Committee report favorable and the resolution win its way by a two-thirds vote, through both Houses of Congress, it will then require a ratification on the part of three-fourths of the several States before it becomes a part of the Constitution.

There does not seem to be the slightest chance that this resolution will ever successfully run such a gauntlet. Indeed, it is not probable that it will ever be started on the race. It will probably meet its death at the hands of the committee, but the consecrated earnestness, the scholarly ability, on the part of the few who urged it in Washington, the intense interest manifested on both sides in the discussion, the anxiety on the part of the organized Christian churches of our land, the natural interest of the human soul in the permanence and potency of religious truth and power, justifies, as it seems to me, my taking the subject into this desk and occupying this hour in trying to tell you why I, a minister of religion, one who fain would deepen the thought of God, increase reverence for Jesus, and add to the intelligent power of the Bible, would oppose with all my might, this introduction into the Constitution of the United States, such a verbal recognition of God, Christ and the Bible.

---

### A Cheap Substitute for Piety and a Make-shift for Devotion.

In the first place, if the amendment is all true, it does not make it more true by putting it in print at the head of the Constitution which few people read, which is itself a creature of interpretations and applications. It is one more cheap substitute for piety, a make-shift for devoutness; it is adding the sin of hypocrisy to whatever error and infidelity may abound. Whatever we think of God, he is something more than the Saxon word of three letters which we use as a symbol.

However we may interpret the phrase, "Lord Jesus Christ," the putting of it into the Constitution in a bracketed sentence, does not make him "Ruler of Nations," and the leaving of him out does not unmake his kingship. However we may think of the Bible, it is not one whit the more or one whit the less authoritative in "civil affairs" because it is declared to be such in a parenthesis thrown into the Preamble of the Constitution.

### It Would Make the Bible an External Fetish.

The actual result of such an amendment would be only to contribute to that debasement of the Bible which makes it an external fetish such as it already is when lying lips kiss it, when with solemn oath they assume responsibilities which they proceed at once to desecrate and violate. It is a fetish when hands foul with violence touch it in courts of justice as they swear the truth and proceed to outrage the same. This movement on the part of religion to enhance its dominion and to increase its power, is a movement backward towards the primitive sources of religion when sanctity was vested in certain things, some holy place, some sacred memento, some mystic phrase.

The lucky stone the African wears round his neck, the talisman which is supposed to ward off diseases, the texts mumbled in front of battle that victory may be obtained, the pious phylactery worn on brow or arm, the ceremonial value of water or wafer, the soul-saving power of Koran, . . . were all instinct in their own time and place with religious emotion; all still suggest pathetically the gropings of the human heart towards its ideal, the hunger of soul for peace and adjustment; but it is all religion on its lower plates, religion, may we hope, largely in its outgrown form, and this attempt to legislate a nation into devoutness, to exalt Jesus into regal position by a resolution, and to make a book biblical by an act of Congress, is, in so far as it is sincere, kindergarten spirituality, a movement of the baby soul of mankind, which in the very effort to express itself, and before the formula is found the thing to be formulated has moved on.

---

### It Represents the Unholy Delusion of Unrighteousness.

In so far as this movement is not sincere it represents the unholy delusion of the unrighteous. It is a profane touching the cap to the name of God that Godless lives may be less suspected. We have too much of this printed piety, too much religion on the book and not enough religion of the life. Whatever the revealed will of God may be, or wherever you look for it, it is not a thing of linen paper and calfskin.

Admit it for the time being that all the creeds implied by the formula of the amendment are true, the so-called "Apostles," the "Nicene" and the "Athanasian." Admit for argument's sake, that Jesus Christ is the "Ruler of Nations," and that the "Bible is the revealed will of God," why add insult to injury, mock with more empty phrases the unappropriated truth? If it is true, the place to begin to enforce that truth lies nearer home than the Constitution of the United States of America. If these phrases thus used have power, let us by all means begin by inscribing them on the inside flap of our pocket books; let the stationers print the phrase at the beginning of the business-man's day-book and ledger; suppose it be inscribed on the walls of the dining-room, in the private library; let the Board of Trade be opened tomorrow morning by the clear announcement of the words of amendment: "Acknowledging Almighty God as the source of all power and authority in civil government; the Lord Jesus Christ as the Ruler of Nations and his revealed will as of supreme authority in civil affairs," we go forth to do business. If there be potency in such declarations, let them be tried nearer home.

### Legislative Piety has been Tried in a Limited Way.

This legislated piety, foreign as I hope to show, to the genius of the United States, still has been tried in a limited way. The silver coin of the United States bears the legend—"In God We Trust,"—but the gambler builds his silver pile and stakes it upon the throw of the die, knowing that if he wins another loses unrighteously just the same. "In God We Trust," says the coin which buys the maddening draught which takes the place of the child's bread and the wife's dress. "In God We Trust," says the coin of the extortioner, the coin that jingles in the pocket of the man who has turned to bank deposits the lives of the pale men and women of the sweat-shops, who has crowded his employés to the wall, refused to reason and denied them the right of a hearing and the protection of the modern right arm of justice, arbitration.

No; self-seeking Congressmen and unholy legislators cannot "put God in the Constitution." They cannot make Jesus Christ the "Ruler of nations," and they cannot make themselves to be heard on the question of what is the "revealed will of God;" not though such a phrase in the Constitution might carry the question to the Supreme Court of the United States.

### "I Oppose this Amendment Because It Does Not Seem to Be True."

But as a minister of religion I oppose this amendment because it does seem to be true. To me the thought of God is too profound to be expressed by any word to which is to be given legislative sanction. . . . God, the sum of excellence, the maximum of potency, the synthesis of all reality, is not empanelled in man-made constitutions, because he has written himself further back in the maker of constitutions. He is to be found only where there is liberty. He is to be felt only where there is fraternity. He is declared only where there is integrity. "Liberty" and "Fraternity" and "Integrity" are the bigger names of God. Says Emerson, "If you want to save the name of God multiply its synonyms." Says Bartol, "I sometimes love to say 'Allah' that I may escape the word and find the thing." If there was any uncertainty as to God's relation to the Constitution of the United States as first passed, that ambiguity was settled in the very first amendment which came in force in 1791, five years after the adoption of the Constitution, which runs as follows:—

Congress shall make no laws respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.

## God Already Recognized in the Constitution.

Put these words with the high words of the original Preamble, viz., "To establish justice," "to insure domestic tranquility," "to promote the general welfare," "to secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and to our posterity," and we have recognition of God which the amendment proposed belittles and dwarfs. . . . The United States began in the Declaration of 1776 that declared "all men free and equal." In its Constitution of 1786 it pledged itself to "justice and liberty." In 1791 it bound itself anew to the divine law of liberty by declaring that no "establishment of religion should ever be enforced by law and no prohibition of the free exercise thereof should ever be countenanced." For that nation now to incorporate these ambiguous phrases into its Constitution would be to prove recreant to its high claim, disloyal to all its last pledges.

## The Promoters of the Amendment Frankly Admit Intolerance.

I am not asserting more than is warranted concerning these phrases. Before the Judiciary Committee, these people in whose interest and by whose request the amendment was introduced, frankly admitted that they desired to make this Government organically a "Christian" government and when asked by one of the representatives, whether under this amendment a Mohammedan or a Jew could consistently qualify for a seat in the legislative halls of the nation, they frankly admitted that they did not see how he could. When asked if logically under this amendment a Jew or Seventh-day Baptist who religiously interprets the Bible as making Saturday the seventh day of the week the holy day and not Sunday the first day of the week, could be permitted to exercise their religious conscience by resting on the seventh and working on the first day, their answer was, "Yes, if it was indoors or out of sight where it could not offend Christian conscience." Question,—"Could such a one plow corn in his own corn field on Sunday?" Answer,—"I doubt if he could. I do not think he ought to be allowed to."

## Let Us Rise to Where God Is.

Let us leave unanswered the pitable conclusion. Let us rise above this soul-cramping discussion. Let us flee the battle of words. If these are the methods by which God is to be established in the hearts of men and his will to be incorporated in the statutes of our land, let us rise to some "Godless" heights where God is. Let us flee the word that we may be in communion with the infinite spirit, forget our Satire speech and give over the attempt to articulate the sonorous Hebrew. We do not know how to say it in Sanskrit. Greek and Latin may be dead languages to us. Let us for the time being confess that we have no name for the nameless Power that reveals himself most mightily in our passion to be like himself, boundless, free; reveals himself most powerfully in the age-long hunger for equity, in the thirst for justice. If this is the establishment of "Christ's kingdom among nations" let us flee to some Christless realm where cross and creed fade and fall that the blessed brother of Nazareth may speak to us as he did to that hungry hearted water carrier of Samaria, "Verily I say unto you, not in this mountain nor in Jerusalem will ye worship the Father, for God is a spirit and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth."

## A Phrase More Mocking than "This Is the King of the Jews."

Irreverent hands placed over the thorn-crowned form on the cross, the scoffing legend, "This is the King of the Jews," and the helpless limbs and bleeding side testified to the irony. Has it come to this, that at the end of nineteen centuries, well-meaning and reverent hands will place over that brow still bleeding, the more mocking phrase, "This is the Ruler of Nations"? He the non-combatant, the "Ruler of Nations," whose boasted strength lies in their death-dealing armaments, their floating warships and bayoneted battalions? He who said, "Blessed are the peace makers," the "Ruler of Nations" whose boast is war? He whose doctrine of brotherhood was exemplified in the parable of the good Samaritan, the "Ruler of Nations" whose splendor rests upon inadequately paid labor and the iniquitous distribution of the products of labor? He, the compassionate, who raised the sinful from the dust, wrote the record of her sins in the tide-washed sands, but wrote the record of her intrinsic purity, her abiding womanhood with indelible ink upon the everlasting heart of humanity, the "Ruler of Nations" resting in debauchery where woman's virtue is made to witness to man's arrogant pride, the persistent tears of the one matched with the arrogant smiles of the other?

And again, think of God's revealed will the supreme authority in civil affairs?? Get the "revealed will" from any source you choose, who dares say God's will is revealed in civil affairs until civil affairs themselves assume more Godlike aspects?

## We Want the Things, not the Name.

After all, my heart warms to these stalwart Presbyterians. Their desire is our desire. We want "God in the Constitution," but we want the things, not the name. We want justice, sacred justice, God's rectitude and equity which it is the expressed purpose of the Constitution to establish, established. We want the general welfare which it promises to promote, promoted; and this is realizing the God already in the Constitution. For if not, God is not justice and liberty. If he does not "vouchsafe the general welfare," then we want this something more than God in the Constitution, and we can have it by realizing the splendid ideals of the fathers set forth in the Preamble of our Constitution as it is. I do not know what a "Christian" nation may be or may not be. I have never dared used the word "Christianity" in your presence without some explanation or interpretation, because I am always afraid that unless thus guarded, "Christianity may be so interpreted that there is something bigger than Christianity, something more fraternal, something more loving, something more patient, a religion more hospitable to the kindling words which have thrilled the non-Christian world, something more conscious of the pathos revealed in the blind gropings of the myriad pagans who also have stumbled on altar stairs and climbed with naked, bleeding knees the ragged rocks that lead to the temple heights of self-sacrifice; to-day I mean this something larger, and this nation means something larger.

## Equal Right for All,—Christian, Jew, Mohammedan, Pagan, Infidel,

This never has been and God grant that it may never be a nation that in its statute books, its economic privileges, its intellectual horizon or in its ethnic hospitality, is rimmed by the historic reality or the ecclesiastical and the theological ideal known as "Christianity," for scarcely does Jesus of Nazareth come within the pale of this Christianity. Certainly the Jew and the Samaritan, Greek, Roman, Moslem, and Buddhist, aye, the commonplace unideal familiar nonpagan on our streets, the infidel and the agnostic, the skeptic and the scientist, and still more the poor everyday, threadbare sinner of the avenue or the alley,—those men and women whom we know and deal with, they, thousands of them, are not Christian either in a theological, an ethical, or philosophic sense, but they are members of the great family of man and citizens of the United States of America. They must be protected by its laws, must be eligible to its privileges on the same footing as every other citizen. A million lives were sacrificed to vindicate this principle of liberty in the United States on its physical and corporeal side. We struck the manacles from off the black limbs under the inspiration of the ideal set forth in the Constitution of the United States. There are ten times one million men who will lay down their lives rather than allow the shackles that were struck off from black limbs to be fastened to white souls in this country. If there be but one Moslem whose heart is moved to celestial beatings by the word, the fame or the name of Mohammed within the limits of these United States, the entire resources of the Government from the President down to the humblest policeman on our streets, is at the service of that Mohammedan to secure his God-given rights as written in the constitution of men, the constitution of the universe first, and in the Constitution of the United States afterwards. Let me not be theoretic or fanciful. If there is but one hard-headed, and if you please hard-hearted infidel who by the best use of his judgment and honest resources of his own soul, is compelled to say, "I know no God, I honor no Jesus, and I have found no Bible," still that man in his isolation, in his mental barrenness and spiritual poverty, if you will, is a citizen of the United States with a right to his opinion, a right to the liberty of his mind as of his limb, and the United States must guard his rights, else it is a greater infidel and has proven atheistic to its own divine affirmation of God, an affirmation made in the most Godlike words that human lips can frame, the most God-revealing words that dictionary has ever yielded; and these words are to-day in the Preamble of our Constitution,—"Justice" and "Liberty." God is in the Constitution and will stay there until we make it a document of injustice, change it from being a magna charta of spiritual liberty, to a petty charter of slavery. We cannot keep God out of the Constitution except by putting the word "God" into the Constitution in such a way as to infringe upon individual rights, to the menace of spiritual liberty, to the reproach of human brotherhood.

We Want no God that Can Be "Put in" or "Taken Out."

Oh, friends, a god that can be "put in" or "taken out" of the printed document is no god upon which the soul may rest with a sense that it is cradled in infinity. Well does Bishop Trench say:—

If there had anywhere appeared in space,
Another place of refuge, where to flee,
Our hearts had taken refuge in that place,
And not with thee.

For we against creation's bars had beat
Like prisoned eagles, through great worlds had sought,
Though but a foot of ground to plant our feet,
Where thou wert not.

And only when we found in earth and air,
In heaven or hell, that such might nowhere be,
That we could not flee from thee anywhere,
We fled to thee.

A Personal Appeal.

I have made my point. I have preached my sermon. Let me cease here, but not without a personal appeal to each one of you. It is more than a freak of language that applies the word "constitution" to the fundamental document of the government and the foundation organism of your life and mine. How is it in regard to our "constitutions," yours and mine? When the red blood courses joyously in the veins, when pure air finds its way through sound tiseness to kiss these red rivers into vigor and vitality, then God is in our physical constitution. When by sins of omission and commission the rivers grow stagnant and the red stream darkens, then we put God out of our physical life.

So in the life of the soul, when love courses joyously in all the chambers of the soul, when thought touches love into vitality, when God is in the heart, the life of the soul is God-life; but when selfishness or indolence causes love to languish and the streams of usefulness become fostering pools, then we have lost the life of God in the soul, we have missed him out of our "constitution." He is to be sought in the body, in the soul, in society and in the state of indirection. We may miss him when we pursue him. We must find him when we forget him in our divine quest for that in which when we live in those things which are eternal, we find the highest manifestations of that spirit and the noblest expressions of that power.

Destroy the False that the True May Live.

"Kill Buddha" was the motto of that Buddhistic sect which our friend Rinca Ringa Hirai of Parliament of Religion memories, belonged to. "Kill the Buddha" of form, "kill the Buddha" of doctrine, kill the official Buddha, kill the sacerdotal Buddha in order that Buddha, the spirit of gentleness, Buddha, the prophet of humanity, Buddha of the pitying hand, Buddha of the inquiring mind may be found. So with Christ, the official; Christ the dogma; . . . Christ the stately "Ruler of Nations" in the words of the resolution; let him be killed, pass out of our statute books, wither in our creeds, fade in our minds, that Jesus the tender lover of babes, Jesus the compassionate brother of the fallen and stained, Jesus the shepherd of the lost, Jesus the inspirer of the discouraged, Jesus the advocate of the poor, Jesus the open-handed brother of humanity, the splendid prophet of justice, may live more and more abundantly.

Sweet thought of God! now do thy work
As thou hast done before;
Wake up, and tears will wake with thee,
And the dull mood be o'er.

The very thinking of the thought
Without or praise or prayer,
Gives light to know, and life to do,
And marvelous strength to bear.

Oh, there is music in that thought,
Unto a heart unstrung,
Like sweet bells at the evening time,
Most musically rung.

Tis not His justice or His power,
Beauty or blest abode,
But the mere unexpended thought
Of the eternal God.

It is not of His wondrous works,
Not even that He is;
Words fall it, but it is a thought
Which by itself is bliss.
