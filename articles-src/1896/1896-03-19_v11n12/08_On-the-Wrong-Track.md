### ON THE WRONG TRACK.

The would-be reformers who are trying to Christianize this nation through the agency of civil law, are on the wrong track. They should be devoting their energies to the spiritual welfare of the Church, instead of trying to force religion upon the masses. The spiritual interests of the Church are in great need of attention. But our self-appointed and self-heralded "reformers" care nothing that the lamp of piety burns dimly in the sanctuary, while they with carnal weapons seek to gain control of worldly governments. Says the Christian Instructor:—

We cannot but feel that the sappers and miners are busy at work under the foundation of our Christian system. They do not proclaim their object, and perhaps many of them are not aware of what will be the result of their present operations. . . . They belong to orthodox churches, and are supposed to be feeding the sheep of Christ with pure doctrine. And yet by their learned criticisms upon the Scriptures they are doing more than open. Indels to shake the foundation of faith and bring the Lord Jesus into contempt.

The New York Observer takes note of this utterance with the remark: "This may seem severe language; but that there is some warrant for it is patent to multitudes of intelligent and reverent souls." This is certainly so. It is painfully patent to lovers of piety and the pure doctrine of God's word, and it is also patent to multitudes of others who find in it an opportunity to point the finger of scorn at the Church and make light of sacred things.

The spiritual condition of the Church—in its confusion of multiplying sects and diversities of doctrine—is alarming, and aptly expressed by the prophetic utterance, "Babylon is fallen." God's word is criticized in the pulpit; sermons upon political and municipal reform topics are dealt out to the multitudes perishing for the bread of life; fairs and festivals, parties and ridiculous shows, desecrate the house set apart to the worship of God, and furnish revenue for his treasury in lieu of the offerings prompted by love. Upon every point of truth there is division; upon error* alone is there unity. And yet we see this divided and fallen Church entering the domain of civil government to dictate reforms to "the powers that be" in the affairs of municipal, State and national legislation. "Physician, heal thyself"!
