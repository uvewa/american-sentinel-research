SHALL EXECUTIVES IGNORE VOID STATUTES?

(By Addison Blakely, Ph. D., Lecturer in Political Science and History, University of Chicago.)

The statements now and then made in certain quarters that it is the duty of the executive to enforce law as he finds it, but not to construe it, in the light of political history, is absurd. All government was originally carried on by one department. In the early stages of the evolution of the State, one institution answered all the purposes of the State. The executive department defined law, applied the law, and executed the law; but as experience showed that this one-man power was extremely liable to oppose justice, the modern idea of three grand departments, each being a check upon the other, sprang into existence. First, there was the king, then the counselors of the king, and finally, the differentiation of these counselors into the judicial and legislative departments.

But law is separate and distinct from each of these three departments of government. The law is over them all, and each is amenable to the law. The idea that the legislature is the creator of and above law is, in the light of political evolution, absurd. The truth of the matter, as drawn from political history, is that the legislature defines what law is. The judiciary applies the law to the particular case at issue. The executive enforces the law as it has been applied. All three departments are under the law, and the action of each must be governed by law.

Each officer, therefore, whether legislative, judicial or executive, swears that he will support the law and act in accordance with its provisions. Each official, therefore, swearing to support the law, must have some understanding of it in order to support it; and his understanding of it becomes, to him, the law. In other words, in order to support it he must have some idea of what he is to support; and this "idea" of what the law is, is, in legal parlance, termed "construing" it. Every man, therefore, who has an idea of what law is, construes the law, and any one denying the right of an executive officer to construe the law would deny his right to have any idea of what the law is. He must either be an ignoramus or non compos mentis. The mere statement of the case reduces the proposition to absurdity.

The executive, therefore, must construe the law and totally ignore void statutes, and the law will hold him accountable for any palpable neglect in refusing so to do. A case in Mexico recently came to the writer's notice. A judge, in a fit of anger, passed the death sentence upon a man absolutely contrary to all law and reason. The executive, through sympathy with the judge, or out of ignorance, executed the sentence according to the order of the judge. The case necessarily attracted a great deal of attention. It had hardly become known, however, before both the judge and the executive officer were arrested for murder, and were condemned accordingly. The justice of the sentence must be conceded, for otherwise there could be no official conduct of a judge which would be ground for impeachment. If he is to be the sole judge of what the law is, his decisions could not be appealed from; but in our system of government there is no such thing as absolute independence vested in any official. The legislature passes upon the acts of the judiciary and the executive by a limited power of impeachment; the executive passes upon the acts of the legislature and judiciary by means of a discretion in the enforcement of law, and the judiciary reviews the acts of the legislature and passes upon the acts of the executive by means of its judicial procedure. In this way each department exercises certain checks and balances over each of the other departments, though acting within a sphere of its own, and yet at the same time by virtue of the nature of this limited control, the independence of each is maintained. This is known in its perfection as the American system of checks and balances.

One of the most notable instances of the relation of the executive to the judicial departments came prominently into view during Jackson's administration. Chief Justice Marshall rendered a decision contrary to Jackson's idea of what the law was in a certain case; and when the sentence of Marshall was brought to Jackson's attention, he said: "John Marshall has made his decision, now let him enforce it." It is needless to add that the decision of the court was not carried out.

The very purpose of the differentiation of government into three departments was to effect this result. It was to subject every decision of government to review by persons looking at the matter from different points of view. The purpose was to afford protection to any who might suffer from the action of some one department by having the action reviewed by some other department. Whenever the executive becomes the mere machine of the judiciary the life and object of our present system are gone. There might as well be but one department of government as three departments doing merely the work of one. Government exercises a power that is almost absolutely despotic, and for this despotic power to be used by any one man or any one set of men is manifestly opposed to the purposes of the framers of our Constitution, and to the whole theory of republican government.

It is therefore evident that it is the duty of the executive to pass upon the constitutionality of statutes at all times. It is therefore the duty of the executive officer to refuse to enforce any unconstitutional Sunday statute on the ground that it is unconstitutional, no matter what may be the pressure brought to bear upon him.

In swearing to support the Constitution, in the eyes of the law he refuses to enforce or even to recognize as law any statute contrary to the constitution which he swears to support. It is therefore just as much a duty for the executive officer to pass upon the constitutionality of a Sunday statute as it is for the judiciary officer, and he has no more right to arrest persons under an unconstitutional statute than had the Mexican executive officer to execute a man under the illegal and despotic decree of the Mexican judge.

Jackson's idea of constitutional law is the only one that the American people can logically accept. Any other idea is opposed to our whole system of law and theory of government. The law on this point is very tersely stated in the following decision from the Supreme Court of Kansas:—

"It is claimed by counsel for plaintiff in error, that the point raised by instruction is, that inferior courts and ministerial officers have no right to judge of the constitutionality of a law passed by a legislature. But is this law? If so, a court created to interpret the law must disregard the constitution in forming its opinions. The constitution is law,—the fundamental law,—and just as much to be taken into consideration by a justice of the peace as by any other tribunal. When two laws apparently conflict, it is the duty of all courts to construe them. If the conflict is irreconcilable, they must decide which is to prevail; and the constitution is not an exception to this rule of construction. If a law [statute] were passed in open, flagrant violation of the constitution, should a justice of the peace regard this law [statute] and pay no attention to the constitutional provision? If that is his duty in a plain case, is it less so when the construction becomes more difficult?"

CIVIL government pertains only to that which the term itself implies—that which is civil. The purpose of civil government is civil, and not moral. Its function is to preserve order in society.
