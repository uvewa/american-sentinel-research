A DANGER SIGNAL. WHAT WILL THE END BE?

BY H. F. PHELPS.

DEMANDS for religious legislation have been very urgent for some years. When these are seen to be futile, threats of political boycott follow. And now demands are being made for open declaration as to the religious faith and standing of officials and political aspirants.

Governor McKinley, although acknowledged as "a staunch Methodist and an active worker in the Methodist Church," is denounced as "a shouting Methodist on Sunday and a political wire-pulling demagogue the rest of the week," because he gave a position of trust to a Roman Catholic, which certain religios- political schemers thought should have been given to a Protestant. And some are also demanding that Mr. Reed shall publicly avow his religious proclivities, and thus in effect bid for political support on the strength of his religion, as though religion were a thing for barter, a thing of the head and not of the heart.

But the latest in this line is that which occurred in St. Paul, Minn., recently. A meeting was held in the interests of better Sunday observance, led by Mrs. W. W. Nicholas, State President of the W. C. T. U. Representatives were present from several organizations and denominations: the Street Mission; Christian Endeavor Mission School; the Baptist Young People; the Christian Citizenship and Law and Order Leagues; the Epworth League; the Woman's Christian Temperance Unions; with several ministers, some of whom advocated "a strictly Puritan sabbatic."

It seems that Senator Nelson, of Minnesota, has been receiving protests from some of his constituents against the passage of certain bills now pending in Congress, involving religious legislation. And as the servant and representative of his constituency he has presented these protests in Congress, to which act these latter day "reformers" take exception. The report says:—

A protest was made by all present against the action of Senator Nelson, March 2, when he presented petitions at Washington of citizens of Minnesota against Sunday observance legislation. It was decided to appoint a committee to write to Senator Nelson, asking him to state more clearly his views, the union giving him the benefit of the doubt.

It is one of the rights of the American citizen to petition or protest against any measure presented in our legislative halls; and it is the duty, and often the pleasure of their representatives to receive and present such. But these religious zealots would deny this right of protest.

But do not these people know, can they not see, that all these demands that public officials and political aspirants shall define themselves upon religious matters are violations of the spirit of the National Constitution, which says, "No religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or position of trust under the United States"? Do they not know that they are requiring a religious test?

And do not these people know that such a course is only opening the way for even the most contemptible, time-serving politician to declare himself religiously and enter the churches? And are they ready and willing to extend the right hand of fellowship to such a these?

It is encouraging to know that all of our representatives are not time-serving politicians, but that some would rather return to private life than yield the principles of religious liberty under such class legislation as is constantly being urged forward.
