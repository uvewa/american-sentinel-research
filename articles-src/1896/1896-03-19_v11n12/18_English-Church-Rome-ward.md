The trend of the English Church Rome-ward may be plainly seen in this fact stated by the London Echo: "Father Black states that the number of the Anglican clergy in England and Scotland now engaged in hearing confessions is between 1,200 and 1,500; while the number so engaged fifty years ago might safely be reckoned under a score."
