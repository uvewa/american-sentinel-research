A SEVENTH-DAY ADVENTIST at Pleasant Plains, Ala., has been indicted and will be placed on trial about the 27th of April for "forcing his children to labor on Sunday." The said children are all old enough to be members of the Seventh-day Adventist church, and work on Sunday from choice, but that makes no difference. Being minors the law does not permit them to have or to exercise any conscience; nor would the case be materially different if they were of age. The secret of this charge is that Alabama has no "law" forbidding voluntary Sunday work by the individual, hence the only way to reach this Adventist is by prosecuting him for "compelling" his children to work.
