THE San Francisco Examiner recently printed the murder statistics of the United States from 1886 to 1895, inclusive. The figures showed that the increase in this terrible form of crime has been steady and rapid, there being in 1895, 10,500 homicides,—ever seven times as many as were chronicled in 1886. And the indications for 1896 certainly do not now lead us to hope that we have reached a turn in the tide. Yet while the powerlessness of law to suppress the worst form of crime, or even to prevent its increase, is thus demonstrated, some religious "reformers" are pointing us to human law as a remedy for immorality and sin! Legislators are being urged more and more to pass laws which will Christianize the nation! It is all delusion and folly. If murder cannot be suppressed by law, much less can an individual or a nation be made Christian by the same power.
