### MORE SUNDAY SELFISHNESS.

[New York World, March 9.]

ALBANY, March 9.—The proprietors of a small theater in Brooklyn have found it necessary to give Sunday concerts because a rival establishment does so.

The venture is not profitable, and in order to be rid of annoying competition they persuaded Senator McNulty to introduce a bill putting an end to all Sunday entertainments of any description anywhere in the State, and to all public singing, except in churches. This bill is still in the Codes Committee.
