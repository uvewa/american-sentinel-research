In its regulations for its adherents during "Lent," the Catholic Church manifests its attitude toward the temperance question by the following, published "by order of his eminence the cardinal," in the Catholic Mirror (Baltimore), of February 29: ". . . Those who avail themselves of this indult are not allowed to use flesh meat and fish at the same meal, and they are earnestly exhorted to perform some other act of mortification, such as abstinence from intoxicating liquors." Yet the Catholic Church in this country favors the Sunday excise law.
