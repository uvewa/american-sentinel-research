### JOINING HANDS WITH THE PAPACY.

It is a sorry spectacle to lovers of civil and religious freedom whom Protestantism, in the persons of its leading representatives, stretches out the hand to the Papacy for an alliance with that religious despotism in the "battle for righteousness" against "atheism" and "lawlessness." Such spectacles are becoming more and more frequent. One of the latest was presented in Columbus, Ohio, on Sunday evening, February 23, when a leading "Protestant" minister of the city, Rev. J. C. Jackson, delivered a eulogy upon the Catholic Church, closing with these words, as reported in the Ohio State Journal, of February 24:—

Then there is the noble stand the pope and the church has taken in the encyclical upon the labor question. There is much, also, that might be said in praise of the Catholic attitude on the social purity question, and in the divorce reform. She is one of the main anchors of the family in our American life. In the temperance reform the trumpet of the Baltimore Council gave a clear sound; and in Ohio and other States her bishops are rendering hearty and valuable service. On the Sabbath question, what a noble utterance was that of Mgr. Seton, of Jersey City, when we were having our struggle in the "Greater New York."

I wish now, as a Protestant minister, to say to my fellow churchmen, that in the struggles for morality and reform which are ahead of us in this country, we will need all the help from Catholics we can get. If they are treated as they ought to be, treated as fellow-Christians and members of the same household of faith, we will find their 10,000,000 of people coming into like with us; and in all probability furnishing the decisive force that shall win the battle for righteousness. We are now facing foreignism, atheism, and lawlessness of all sorts. None but fools will slight those sincere and godly Catholics who are naturally our best allies.

It is one thing to join hands with Roman Catholics upon the plane of their own individuality, and quite another thing to unite with them when acting under the direction of "the church." In the latter case it is simply a union with the Papacy,—with a religious system which is altogether unrighteous.

While we should have only words of welcome for the Catholic people of our land, as individuals, in every good purpose and work, no support whatever can properly be given the unchristian system under which they have the misfortune to be in bondage. But when support is sought from the Catholic bodies in our land, it is the support of the Papacy that is asked, and it will be given in that way which will best serve the interests of the Papacy in this country.
