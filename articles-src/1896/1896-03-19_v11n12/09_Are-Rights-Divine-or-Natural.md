'ARE RIGHTS DIVINE, OR NATURAL?'

UNDER this heading, the Truth Seeker, of this city, takes exception to the view advocated by the AMERICAN SENTINEL, and asserts that rights are natural, and not divine!

One of the Truth Seeker's propositions is this: "Our rights co-exist with our bodies." Certainly they do. But does this disprove that they are divine in their origin? By no means. God did not create man, and then at some future time by direct revelation endow him with rights; but he created him a social, moral being, and in that very act of creation made inherent in him certain inalienable rights, "among which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness." "We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights." This was recognized one hundred and twenty years ago as a self-evident truth by Thomas Jefferson, a Liberal, but is to-day denied by the Truth Seeker, and apparently for no better reason than unwillingness to recognize an intelligent Creator.

It is true, however, that human rights are not a matter of revelation; that is, they are not dependent upon revelation; they are self-evident, because they exist in the very nature of man.

We unhesitatingly, and without compunction of conscience, reduce to abject servitude the lower orders of animals, and compel them to serve us. Why have we not the same right to do this with our fellowmen, who are perhaps not our equals in point of intellect? Simply because by creation they are our brethren. "All men are created equal." The difference which now exists is due to environment, to heredity, and other causes. But these unfortunate members of the race have the same inherent rights that their more fortunate fellows have.

It is true also, that while rights are not dependent upon revelation, that they are most generally and most fully seen and protected where the light of revelation shines most clearly. Every man who learns that he is morally responsible to God, realizes within himself that he must be left free to discharge that responsibility according to the dictates of his own conscience; that as no man can answer for him to God, so no man has the right to dictate any course of action to him in things pertaining to God. The tendency of moral responsibility is to develop manhood in man, and to that cause more than to any other is due the degree of liberty which is enjoyed in the world to-day.

It was the declaration of independence, adopted by the German Princes at Spires, that made possible the American Declaration of Independence. Profoundly impressed with the truth of their individual responsibility to the Author of their existence, the German Princes asserted their right to freedom in all things relating to God; and to-day we enjoy liberty of conscience because of the recognition of the great principle which they asserted.

We marvel that anybody should deny, or care to deny, moral responsibility, or the divine origin of human rights. We confess that we cannot appreciate the emnity against God that denies his instrumentality in such matters.
