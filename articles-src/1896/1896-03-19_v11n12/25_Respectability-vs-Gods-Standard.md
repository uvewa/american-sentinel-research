RESPECTABILITY is the world's standard of morality. It is the morality of outward forms—of human custom and law. God's standard of morality, on the other hand, is his divine law of ten precepts, which represents the morality of his own life. It is sad to see the churches of our land turning from the power of God's law to that of man's law,—abandoning God's standard of morality for that of the world.
