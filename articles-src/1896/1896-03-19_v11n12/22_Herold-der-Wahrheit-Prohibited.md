THE Herold der Wahrheit, a Seventh-day Adventist journal published in Hamburg, has been prohibited in Russia, where it had quite an extensive circulation among the German colonists. As the Herold is wholly devoted to the presentation of Scripture truth, and has no political complexion whatever, this action of the Russian government amounts simply to an effort on the part of man to block the pathway of God's saving truth. As such it is a piece of folly; for God has said, "My word . . . shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it." Isa. 55:11. This has proved true through all ages of time; but earthly governments seem never able to learn the lesson.
