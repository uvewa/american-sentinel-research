## THE HARMONY(?) OF ERROR.

The following extracts from "Our Mail Bag," in the *Christian Herald and Signs of Our Times*, the first under date of Aug. 1, 1894, the other under date of June 5, 1895, afford an excellent illustration of the harmony(?) of error:—

Victoria Dodd, Denison, Iowa. How should Sunday be spent by those who profess to be Christian people?

Fannie E. Crewe, Mass. Is there any command given after the resurrection of Christ to keep Sunday or any day holy?

They should obey the divine command to refrain from all labor and secular things, and devote the day to the service of the Almighty and to physical rest and recuperation. To spend the whole or even part of the day in the reading of newspapers or secular literature is a violation of the spirit of the injunction. Attendance at the house of worship and a hearty compliance with the religious ordinance instituted by the Church, are among the privileged and should never be neglected. These are among the "means of grace."

The New Testament does not mention any explicit command being given after the resurrection. From the early Christian writers we learn that the observance of the Lord's day was universal in the Church. It was not observed, however, as the Jewish Sabbath, with restrictions and penalties, and with minute regulations as to what should, and should not be done on that day. Some Jewish converts wanted to compel the Gentiles to keep Saturday holy, according to the Jewish law, as some people are trying to do still; but the Apostle Paul wrote that they need give no heed to such teachers, and to let no man judge them as to the Sabbath. Col. 2:16.

This is the sort of blowing hot and cold that becomes necessary in attempting to sustain the false sabbath while rejecting the true.

If there is no divine command for Sunday, and there certainly is none, by what right does the *Herald* say of Sunday: "They should obey the divine command to refrain from all labor," etc., on that day?

Self-stultification could scarcely be more complete than it is in these two answers. The first assumes a divine command for Sunday observance; the second admits that there is no such command, and that Sunday does not take the place of the Sabbath.

The lugging in of Col. 2:16 in this connection is in perfect keeping with the consistency shown in these two answers. The 17th verse states plainly that the days concerning which the apostle was writing were the festivals belonging to the typical system: shadows of things to come.
