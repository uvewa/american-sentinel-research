DOINGS IN WASHINGTON.

The National Reform forces are playing a desperate game in Washington. At the hearing on the Sunday bill for the District on the 2nd inst., they utterly failed to put in an appearance, apparently letting the whole thing go by default. But, as intimated in these columns last week that they probably would do, they secured a private hearing before the House Committee for the District of Columbia on the 6th inst.

On this occasion W. F. Crafts, and a number of ladies, belonging to the "Woman's Sunday League of America" appeared before the committee in behalf of Sunday legislation.

On the fifth inst. a substitute for the Morse Sunday bill was introduced into both houses of Congress: in the House by Mr. Wellington, of Maryland, and in the Senate by Mr. McMillan, of Michigan. The following is the text of this bill:—

A BILL

To protect the first day of the week as a day of rest and worship in the District of Columbia.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That it shall not be lawful for any person to keep open any place of business nor maintain a stand for the sale of any article or articles of profit during Sunday, excepting apothecaries, for the dispensing of medicines, and undertakers, for the purposes of providing for the dead, or others for the purpose of charity or necessity; nor shall any public playing of football or baseball or any other kind of playing, sports, pastimes, or diversions disturbing the peace and quiet of the day be practiced by any person or persons within the District of Columbia on Sunday; nor shall any building operations or work upon railroad construction or other labor, except works of necessity and mercy, be permitted upon said day; and for any violation of this Act the person offending shall, for each offense, be liable to a fine of not less than five dollars nor more than fifty dollars, and in the case of corporations there shall be a like fine for every person employed in violation of this Act laid upon the corporation offending.

Sec. 2. That it shall be a sufficient defense to a prosecution for servile labor on the first day of the week that the defendant uniformly keeps another day of the week as holy time and does not labor upon that day, and that the labor complained of was done in such a manner as not to interrupt or disturb other persons in observing the first day of the week as a day of rest and worship.

Mr. Crafts spoke in favor of the substitute which differs from the original principally in that it does not assert any divine authority for the first day of the week.

Mr. Crafts told of the Sunday "laws" in force in the States, and held that Sunday is recognized under the federal laws. The President is exempted from the necessity of signing bills on Sunday, the statutes require suspension of studies at Annapolis and West Point, and these, together with similar requirements, make forty-six State and federal acknowledgments of Sunday. Sunday is an inheritance from our fathers which should be observed as a principle of government.

This is an excellent illustration of the readiness of some people to take a yard if you give them an ell. The law provides that students at Annapolis and West Point shall not be required to study or recite on Sunday, and this fact is urged as a "reason" why everybody else should be forbidden to work that day!

The hearing on the 11th inst. before a committee of the House, on the proposed religious amendment, was one of more than ordinary interest. The time allotted was two hours, the same to be equally divided between the friends and opponents of the measure. The Reformers were to have half an hour to open their case, then those who opposed the amendment were given an hour. The advocates of the amendment having half an hour in which to close.

The first half hour was used to little purpose, as nothing new was developed.

The principal speech against the amendment was made by Rev. Dr. Lewis, of Plainfield. Dr. Croftut, of Washington, Mr. Putnam, of New York, Mr. Jenkins Lloyd Jones, of Chicago, General Burney and Attorney Abraham, both of Washington, also spoke against the amendment. Mr. Allen Moon, president of the International Religious Liberty Association, yielded his time to Dr. Lewis, which gave the doctor the principal speech, as it gave him double time, which was used to good advantage.

Prof. Coleman, of Philadelphia, undertook to close the argument for the Reformers, but he was soon swamped with questions from the members of the committee, and yielded the floor to Dr. McAllister. This was the signal for the committee to turn all their guns on him, and instead of occupying but two hours, the hearing occupied about four hours. This was of no advantage, however, to the friends of the amendment.

If there was anything lacking to confirm the members of the committee in the belief that the amendment should not be reported favorably, it was furnished by Dr. McAllister. Representative Lewis, of Kentucky, who showed himself thoroughly familiar with the Sunday Mail Reports written sixty-six years ago by Hon. Richard M. Johnson, led out in asking Mr. McAllister hard questions. Mr. Lewis secured from the doctor an admission never before made in a public hearing, namely, that the Reformers desire that every theological question shall be the subject of congressional enactment under the proposed amendment, and also that they intend that if Congress and the courts decide that Sunday is the sabbath, that everybody shall be compelled to keep it without any regard to their religious belief.

"When the hearing closed," remarked a bystander, "it was perfectly evident that the National Reformers had not a friend left on the committee," and it is perfectly safe to say that there is not the slightest danger that the resolution proposing this amendment will be reported favorably by this committee.

We expect to give our readers further details as soon as we receive an official report of the hearing.
