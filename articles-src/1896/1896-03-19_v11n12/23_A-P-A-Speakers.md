A CORRESPONDENT in Pennsylvania writes us of an A. P. A. lecturer, who said recently, that he believed that the time was not far distant when every Protestant preacher who would not spread the American flag over his pulpit and preach patriotism would be invited to step down and out and take a seat in the audience.

"Another A. P. A. speaker," says our correspondent, "discussing the objects of the society, said, 'We want America for Americans; and we want one religion in America, and that the American religion.'"

Our correspondent wrote to the latter speaker, asking him if the A. P. A., as an organization, would indorse such sentiments. The reply was that he spoke only for himself, and that not all A. P. A.'s would go so far as he went, but that he believed that all would prolong.

Of such sentiments our correspondent very pertinently says: "I can see nothing but Romanism in them." And there is nothing but Romanism in them. We do not believe that such utterances correctly represent the A. P. A. If we are to have a religious despotism in this country it might as well be the despotism of the Roman Papacy as of an image to it.

What the American people need to know to-day is the power of the gospel, the sufficiency and supremacy of the word of God, and the right of private judgment. Christian liberty, and not organized despotism, is the foe of Papacy and of priestcraft, under whatever name it appears.
