We have not heard the result of the Adventist trials in Lake County, Tennessee, at the time of going to press with this paper, but doubt not that the accused were promptly convicted.

The Adventists do not deny working on Sunday. They do deny that such work is in any proper sense a nuisance, but they make no attempt to conceal the fact that they regard Sunday only as one of the six working days. They feel that the fourth commandment leaves them no option in the matter: they must remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy. God has by his divine commandment separated one day of the week from all the others, and duty to God requires that all who would obey him shall respect that distinction. This the Adventists do in all good conscience by treating the seventh day and it alone as sacred to rest and worship. To do otherwise would be to put no difference between the holy and the profane and so to deliberately sin against God.

The work which these people do on Sunday does not disturb others, it does not prevent others from keeping the day if they so choose; it offends only religious prejudices and for this they are punished by the State of Tennessee.
