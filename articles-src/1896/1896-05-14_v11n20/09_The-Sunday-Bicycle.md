THE SUNDAY BICYCLE.

In the last issue of the Volunteer Gazette, says the New York World, Commander Booth has written the following in reply to questions by volunteers as to whether it was proper to ride a bicycle on Sunday: "It is all right to ride the bicycle on Sunday. It is better to work the pedals than to work the trainmen on the cars."

This is a simple case of one man being conscience for another, which constitutes the essence of poppy. That is a very easy way of settling religious questions, but also a very poor way. It calls for no exercise or development of conscience, no investigation of truth in the pages of divine revelation. God's plan is that every person should be guided by the dictates of his own conscience, and that conscience should in every case be educated and guided by the word of God, unfolded and impressed upon the mind by the Holy Spirit. But when a man sits in the place of God, dictating to others what is right and what is wrong, conscience is stifled, religious growth ceases, and the whole moral nature is deadened. The same results follow when a civil government usurps the place of conscience in dictating religious duty. Popery is the religion of human nature. Christianity is the manifestation of the divine nature.
