SUNDAY NEWSPAPERS AND SUNDAY WORK.

[Twentieth Century, April 16.]

EVERYBODY knows, because it is evident and has been stated over and over again, that the Sunday newspaper entails no labor on the sabbath day [Sunday] on the part of its employés. The Monday papers give rise to Sunday labor. The Methodists in their recent conference were, therefore, a trifle precipitate in denouncing Sunday newspapers "because the employés of the newspaper are robbed of their sabbath rest." The Methodists also condemned Sunday newspapers generally, and demanded legislation to suppress them.

THE Outlook says that "if every minister, Protestant and Roman Catholic, Christian and Jew, orthodox and heterodox, should preach an annual sermon" upon the duty of putting honest men in office "the clarifying effect would be as sudden as it would be surprising."

The Sun very properly says that no such effect would follow; and adds: "In spite of all their preaching, the preachers have not yet produced agreement as to the application of religious principles to other matters than politics. They have not yet succeeded in bringing about unity of opinion among the churches. How, then, can Dr. Abbott expect that they will accomplish that surprising result in a field where the difference of sentiment is sharper and bitterer than anywhere else, save in the special sphere of religion itself?"

The Sun is quite right. There is an immense amount of humbug about the claims put forth in behalf of the church as a political factor.
