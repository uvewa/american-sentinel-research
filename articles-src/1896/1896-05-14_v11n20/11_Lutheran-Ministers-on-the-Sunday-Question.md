LUTHERAN MINISTERS ON THE SUNDAY QUESTION.

[New York Sun, May 6, 1896.]

The ministers of the Lutheran churches in Jersey City issued yesterday a formal declaration of their views on the Sunday closing question. The declaration is signed by the Revs. J. C. Luehrs of St. Johannes's Church, E. Burkhard of Zion Church, J. C. Petersen of St. Matthew's, A. Stockert of St. Paul's, and C. B. Rabbord of Christ Church. The declaration says:—

"We, the undersigned pastors of the Lutheran Church in Jersey City, members of the Evangelical Lutheran Ministerium of the State of New York and adjacent States and counties, herewith publish our principles concerning the so-called Sunday question. We believe the Christian Sunday is hallowed whenever God's word and the preaching of the gospel is not despised, but deemed holy and willingly heard and learned. We believe that such a sanctification can never be effected by the law, for the law has no power to regenerate and sanctify.

"We, as Christian citizens who are to be subject to the powers that be ordained of God, do recognize the law now existing, according to which all saloons shall be closed on Sunday in order to affect a greater sanctification of the day, as valid and binding, and do herewith counsel all Christian citizens for conscience' sake and in view of their responsibility before God to faithfully obey the law so long as it may stand. We deny this law any power to promote a true and God-pleasing sanctification of the day, as well as the ability to make the hearts of men better or holier. We honestly believe that the law in its present form fosters hypocrisy and sham, and opens a wide door for much that is unholy and morally wrong, instead of promoting the moral welfare of the community, the object for which laws are generally believed to be made.

"We herewith express our deep loathing at the manner in which this law has, at times, been enforced. We brand the spy system, dissimulation, and deceit which are sometimes employed to entrap by officers as belonging to the morally, most reprehensible acts of which a morally responsible, not to say Christian, person is capable.

"In reply to the solicitations to join the movement designed to legally enforce the sanctification of Sunday by bringing a pressure to bear upon our city authorities, we do most emphatically protest against the confounding of Church and State which is thereby involved. We believe that in a country where Church and State are separate and distinct bodies, the Church may indeed promote civic virtues by using the means God has given her, but we do not concede her the right to employ weapons of her own choosing, and therewith demand from the authority ordained of God the enforcement of laws promulgated by the State.

"In conclusion we declare ourselves uncompromising opponents of a Sunday devoted to riotous living and unruly practices, and we will ever, by virtue of our office as rightly-called ministers of Jesus Christ, and in conformity with the spirit of the mother church of Protestantism, preach, protest, and battle against such a day."
