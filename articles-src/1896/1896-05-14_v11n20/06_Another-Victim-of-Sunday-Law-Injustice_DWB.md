ANOTHER VICTIM OF SUNDAY-LAW INJUSTICE.

BY D. W. BEAVIS.

The law as to the case of State of Alabama vs. W. J. Hasty, "for Sunday breaking," is as follows:—

Any person, who compels his child, apprentice, or servant to perform any labor on Sunday, except the customary domestic duties of daily necessity or comfort, or works of charity must, for the first offense, be fined not less than ten, nor more than twenty dollars, and for the second, or any subsequent offense, must be fined not less than twenty nor more than one hundred dollars and may also be imprisoned in the county jail or sentenced to hard labor for the county, for not more than three months."

The indictment:—

State of Alabama. Henry Co. Circuit Court at Columbia. Fall Term, 1895.

The grand jury of said county charge that before the finding of this indictment William J. Hasty did compel his child to perform labor on Sunday which was not the customary domestic duties of daily necessity or comfort or works of charity, against the peace and dignity of the State of Alabama.

On April 30 this case was called before Judge Foster, and the defendant was tried and convicted for compelling his child to perform labor on the first Sunday in June, 1895.

The State brought three witnesses to prove that the child did work on that Sunday. These witnesses testified that they saw the child in the field plowing with the defendant, but did not know whether the father compelled him to plow or not. They simply saw him plowing; did not know how old he was. They knew he was a member of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, and that he kept Saturday for the Sabbath. They had been up the river and were on their way home, looking over the crop, when they saw the defendant forcing his child to plow.

The State then put the child on the stand as a witness. He said he did plow on the Sunday in question, but that he did it of his own free will—that his father had never asked him to work on Sunday—that he was a Seventh-day Adventist by profession and a member of that church, and that he worked every Sunday, having kept the day before as he believed the Bible enjoined upon him to do—he claimed a right to work on Sunday in compliance with the command, "Six days shall thou labor"—that he was in his eighteenth year, and that he was accustomed to suggesting and planning the work on the farm, and that he himself proposed to plow a certain field of peas on the day in question.

The attorney-general asked the witness if the defendant would allow him to work on his farm on Saturday. Witness did not know as to that, but he did know that the defendant could not compel him to work on Saturday. The defendant did not testify, and had no witnesses, only those of the State.

The State's Attorney, Richard H. Parks, entered enthusiastically upon his argument for the prosecution, using the well-known theory that Sunday laws have no part in religion, and that in this country all can believe and worship as they please, but they must obey the civil laws. He argued on the presumption of the law in that when the minor did an act jointly with the parent the law presumed that it was done by the authority and the direction of the parent; and that in this case it was the duty of the defendant, in the face of the law, to compel the child to refrain from labor on Sunday.

Hon. R. H. Walker, of Columbia, who volunteered his services in the defense of the defendant, took up the religious nature of the Sunday law, contradicting Mr. Parks as to its being only civil law, and tracing it back to the time of Constantine in A. D. 321, proved it to be a leading means of the union of Church and State at that time, and to be still upon the statutes of most every State as a relic of the Dark Ages. Mr. Walker took the position that the Sabbath and its observance belong alone to God; that in the command to "Render to Cesar the things that are Cesar's, and to God the things that are God's," we are forbidden to render it to the State, to whom belongs neither the institution nor the right to command its observance, even to minors; and that for the State to force, by law, the observance of a day that God did not set apart for worship, was to force its subjects to disobey God; that God set apart the seventh day of the week (Saturday) for the Sabbath, and commanded its observance, and as that was the most ancient law on this subject and given by God himself, whose right it was to establish it, and as this law has never been repealed it is binding upon all to this day, and that legislation upon the Sabbath question was not only religious legislation, but was unconstitutional and therefore void.

Mr. Walker then explained that the intent of the Alabama Sunday law was merely to protect the rights of minors and servants who desired to observe Sunday when employed by those who were not under the restraints of said law themselves. That if a minor or servant did the work of their own free will the law could not hold that they had been compelled to do it. The following extracts from the judge's charge to the jury will bear out this interpretation of the law:—

It is not whether the boy of the defendant worked on Sunday, but whether the defendant compelled him to do so, that is, did he force him to do such work. Before the jury can reach a conviction of the defendant in the case, they must believe, from the evidence beyond all reasonable doubt and to a moral certainty, that the defendant compelled him not to work on the first Sunday in June, 1895; and unless this has been proven by evidence to the exclusion of every reasonable doubt, the jury should acquit the defendant. If the jury should believe, from the evidence, that the minor son of the defendant worked at the time, as said by the State, of his own volition, and not compelled to do so by the father, then the defendant could not be guilty, and it would be the duty of the jury to acquit the defendant.

Notwithstanding this charge and the above testimony in the case, the jury was only out a few minutes before they gave a verdict of "guilty," placing the fine at $20, the limit of the law. To this is added the cost of $31.70.

The defendant refused to give bond for cost and fine, and was placed in jail until he can be taken to the mines, where he will be forced to work it out at 30 cents per day. As the sheriff turned the key on the defendant, there was an exciting scene just outside the enclosure of the little old wooden jail. Some burst into tears as they exclaimed: "My God, I hate to see that!" Others offered to pay $5 to get him out, pronouncing such treatment to a good and honest man a shame and disgrace. Old comrades, who had served in the confederate army with the defendant, shed tears freely and swore that they would kick the jail down, while others gloated that the defendant was where he was, they being to a large degree the means of his imprisonment. Altogether there was a lively discussion of the principles involved, with various conceptions of justice and law being enthusiastically expressed.

Note: A telegram received just before going to press says: "Friends paid Hasty out. He was held only two days."

All lovers of justice and liberty will breathe a little freer to know that this innocent man is not to be compelled to labor in the mines under the nefarious contract system in vogue in Alabama; but this fact does not lessen the injustice of the verdict.—Editor Sentinel.
