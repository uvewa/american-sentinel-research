THE Evening Standard, of Leavenworth, Kans., had this in its issue of the 27th ult.:—

The New York World states that on April 11 Chester Gordon and wife, Adventists, were brought into Little Rock, Ark., handcuffed together and put in jail, having been convicted in Eagle Township of keeping Saturday instead of Sunday. For a crime so heinous they ought to feel grateful to the indulgent and forbearing people of that State that they were not hanged, drowned, roasted or boiled in oil. The Turkish Government ought to be severely rebuked by this Government for allowing Christians to be persecuted over there on account of their religious belief. How thankful we Americans ought to be that we live in a land where the generous and liberalizing influences of Puritan toleration permit us to enjoy so wide a measure of religious liberty.

The irony of this item is quite excusable, but fortunately for the good name of the State of Arkansas, her people were not in sympathy with the outrage perpetrated upon this honest couple, and the governor of the State ordered their release at once upon hearing the facts, as stated in these columns two weeks ago.
