AN educational bill now before the British Parliament provides in one of its sections that "if the parents of a reasonable number of the scholars attending a school shall ask that religious instruction be given their children, the managers shall, so far as is practicable, whether the religious instruction in the school is regulated by any trust deed, scheme or other instrument or not, permit reasonable arrangements to be made for allowing such religious instruction to be given, and shall not be precluded from doing so by the provisions of any such deed, scheme or instrument." But the appropriation of public money for the teaching of that which must necessarily be of a sectarian character, cannot be made right by being desired by a "reasonable" portion of the people concerned. A "reasonable number" in such a case would have to be all the people in any way concerned with the operation of the school.
