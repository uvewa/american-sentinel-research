# Uncertainties Log - v11n20 (May 14, 1896)

## Page 5, Article "The Sunday Bicycle"
- **Issue:** OCR rendered "poppy" in source
- **Context:** "...which constitutes the essence of poppy."
- **Transcribed as:** "poppy"
- **Confidence:** LOW
- **Reason:** Should likely be "popery" based on context (religious discussion), but preserved exactly as OCR rendered it per transcription rules. The next sentence discusses sitting "in the place of God" which is characteristic of popery.

## Page 5, Article "Christianity Means Honesty"
- **Attribution:** Article footer states "* Written by the late Ed. J. H. Waggoner, in 1887."
- **Author assigned:** Joseph H. Waggoner (JHW)
- **Note:** "Ed." is an honorific (Elder), not part of first name

## General Note
All text has been preserved exactly as it appears in the OCR source file, including any OCR errors or unusual spellings. The source OCR appears to be of high quality with minimal errors.
