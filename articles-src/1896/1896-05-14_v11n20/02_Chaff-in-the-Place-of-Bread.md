CHAFF IN THE PLACE OF BREAD.

From many of the "sermons" preached nowadays from our orthodox pulpits, one would receive the impression that we have reached a time when the simple gospel of salvation through faith in Christ had become secondary in importance to themes of city politics and government. The great question to be considered from the pulpit, if we may judge from appearances, is not the establishment of the law of God in the heart of the individual, but the enforcement of some human law—and particularly the Sunday "law"—is view of a manifest tendency on the part of some to disregard it.

The question of Sunday observance was the theme of discourse with two prominent clergymen of Jersey City on Sunday, May 3. These were the Rev. C. Raboteau, Baptist, and Rev. I. W. Hathaway, Presbyterian. The former, as reported by the New York Tribune, of May 4, gave a scathing denunciation of official inaction in enforcing the Sunday law, concluding with the words, "More pressure, brethren! More pressure until it touches the sore spot. A little less soft soap and more pressure." It is possible that some in his audience who had come hungering for spiritual food, may have felt a simultaneous wish for a little less husks and chaff, and a little more of the bread of life.

The Rev. Mr. Hathaway's discourse dealt more with the nature and obligation of the Sabbath institution, but was not lacking in admonitions concerning the duty of Christian men to see that the Sunday law was strictly enforced. Concerning the Sabbath instituted at creation, he said: "It was given to man in the very beginning of time, and so is universal law. It was given to man for his moral and spiritual life. A ceremonial or a civil law may be made and repealed, may serve its time and cease to be; but a moral law is a part of the essential nature of man and of God, and is just as essential to man's moral and spiritual being as the air for his lungs or food for his body. We must remember that this law is found in the Decalogue, the eternal moral law, which can no more be annihilated than can God himself cease to be."

This is true, and worthy of being continually borne in mind by every individual on the earth. But the trouble is that so many people, even in the churches, are, like the speaker, entirely at variance with this truth in their religious practice; observing not the seventh day, which God blessed and set apart for mankind, but the first day, which as a sabbath day is solely an institution of "the church."

But following this statement of truth, the speaker made the amazing assertion that "in this wicked world the moral law must be enforced by civil enactment." How can anyone suppose for a moment that such a thing could be! Can the divine be upheld by the human, or the infinite be grasped by the finite, or holiness be enforced by that which is of the earth? The law of God "is holy, and just, and good;" it is as holy, and as broad, and as high, as God himself. The fountain of civil law is, at its best, defiled by the taint of worldliness and sin. As well

might it be expected that a fountain could send forth at once both sweet and bitter water, as that the moral law can be enforced by civil enactments. If the moral law were left to be enforced by such means, it would fall infinitely short of being enforced at all.

No less incredible is the statement which immediately followed this utterance, that "without civil law there would be no sabbath worth the name." The person who inclines to such a view should turn to Genesis and read the account of the institution of the Sabbath at creation. He will find that it was in no way related to or dependent upon the "civil law." It was—and is—the rest of God, by him hallowed and blessed, and by him made to-day a blessing to everyone who will observe it. The Sabbath is essentially spiritual, and as such is independent of all civil enactments. No man can be prevented by civil enactments from enjoying communion with God, which is the essence of true Sabbath-keeping, as set forth in Isa. 58:13, 14.

It is well, of course, that under proper circumstances the people should be urged to do all in their power to maintain honesty, decency, and justice in the affairs of the government with which they are identified. But let this not be done by clergymen acting professedly in their capacity of ministers of the gospel of Christ. Let not the flock of God be fed upon the chaff of the "beggarly elements" of the world. Let not the people be taught that the gospel of God is a scheme for the regeneration of earthly governments through the power which they themselves must exercise; but that it is "the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth" (Rom. 1:16); that its salvation is salvation from sin and death, and its government and kingdom not such as can be evolved from amidst the sin and selfishness of this world, but the glorious government and kingdom of God, which will be set up on the new earth, after this world with all its earthly kingdoms shall have passed away, and will endure forever and ever.
