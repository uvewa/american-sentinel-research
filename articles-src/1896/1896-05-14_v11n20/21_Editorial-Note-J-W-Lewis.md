J. W. LEWIS, the Seventh-day Adventist now in the Lake County (Tenn.) jail at Tiptonville, writes us that he is now very kindly treated; but in reply to our inquiry he says that when first arrested last November during the very cold weather that marked the early winter, he was locked in an iron cage in a room without fire and without sufficient clothing, and was nearly frozen to death. He thinks he will never recover from the effects of the barbarous treatment he received on that occasion. He makes no complaint, however, and gives us this information only because we asked him for the facts.

The law of Tennessee is very explicit as to the care of prisoners, stipulating that they must be comfortably housed; that they must have good food and sufficient clean bedding to insure comfort.

But while the Sunday "law" is rigidly enforced it is notorious that this law for the protection of helpless prisoners is habitually violated by sheriffs and jailers, and nobody feels under any obligation to enforce the law for the protection of prisoners simply "because it is law!" The world's stock of humbug is not yet exhausted.
