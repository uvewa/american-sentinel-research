THE BARBERS' SUNDAY LAW OF CALIFORNIA [DECLARED UNCONSTITUTIONAL.

The cause of religious legislation has received a backset in California by the recent decision of the State Supreme Court, declaring the "Barbers' [Sunday] Law" to be unconstitutional. This "law" was enacted not long since in response, ostensibly, to a demand from the barbers, based upon the hardship of being compelled to carry on their business seven days in the week. In the endeavor to create sentiment in favor of Sunday legislation, much is made of the alleged involuntary servitude of the working men to the exactions of employers and of the public, which demand the continuance of labor throughout the entire week; but the view taken by the court was evidently different from that held up before the people by the word-painters who are agitating for Sunday enforcement. Among other things the court said:—

This law was made to protect the laborer from the capitalist; but it is not easy to see how it does so. It deprives a man of the right to labor and to enjoy the fruits of his toil. It is a curious law for the protection of labor which punishes the laborer for working; yet that is precisely what the law considered does.

Certainly, any person who wishes to labor upon the first day or any other day of the week, should be allowed the privilege of doing so by a law the purpose of which is to protect labor. There is no protection of labor in a law which compels a person to be idle when he wishes to work, or punishes him for honest, manly toil.

It is not clear how, in a country where all involuntary servitude is illegal except in the case of criminals, there can be any real need of protection for labor. What is wanted in this country, as in most other countries, is a more general opportunity to engage in honest, remunerative toil, and not the curtailment of such opportunities as there are. Not more idle men, but more employed men, is what the country needs. Its idle men constitute already one of the chiefest menaces to its welfare.

Sunday legislation is class legislation of the

most pronounced type. It is legislation in favor of a particular class, who believe in Sunday as a day of rest; and it is legislation which forbids a certain kind of business upon grounds which would include all kinds, thus making an unjust discrimination. Upon this point the court said:—

In a law such as this no reason has been shown why the followers of one useful and unobjectionable employment should be debarred from the right to labor upon certain days and not on others. When any such class is singled out and put under the criminal ban of such a law as this the law not only is special, unjust, and unreasonable in its operation, but it works an invasion of individual liberty—the liberty of free labor which it pretends to protect.

The fact that the distinguishing feature of the "law" was that it gave prominence to the first day of the week as a day of rest, clearly shows that the real protection aimed at was protection for a religious institution; and the same is true of every Sunday "law" in existence to-day.

We trust that this decision will do something to stay the rising tide of religious legislation which threatens to sweep away the liberties of the American people.
