The article on page 156, "Another Victim of Sunday-law Injustice," shows very forcibly how hollow is the pretense of respect for "law" on the part of many who demand its enforcement against Seventh-day Adventists. Hasty's conviction was in flagrant violation of law. His real offense was differing from his neighbors in religious faith and practice.
