It is said that the Chinese Government has, at the request of the French Minister, Monsieur Gerard, expunged from the laws of the empire all restrictions upon the propagation of the Christian religion. This is well; but unfortunately in many parts of the empire not much attention is paid by the mandarins to the policy and laws of the central government.
