THE example of the Lutheran ministers of Jersey City, in declaring their uncompromising hostility to "the movement designed to legally enforce the sanctification of Sunday, by bringing a pressure to bear upon our city authorities," as set forth on another page, is one which we trust will have a salutary effect upon ministers and church members of all denominations. The union of Church and State which the movement involves is clearly visible to them, and should be so to all candid, thinking minds. The evils of the spy system, also, which the movement encourages, and which is stimulated by the appeals of ministers to their congregations to aid in securing the conviction of Sunday desecrators, are worthy of consideration by all admirers of upright, honorable, Christian conduct. Such things do not become natural features of any movement actuated by Christianity.
