Rev. WILLIAM SIMPSON, one of the three Seventh-day Adventist ministers recently sentenced to imprisonment at Chatham, Ont., for doing work on Sunday, was taken to Chatham jail by the sheriff on May 5. The period of his incarceration will be forty days. The reader will remember that this case was quite fully discussed in our issue of April 2.
