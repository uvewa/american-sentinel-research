NO PRINCIPLE VIOLATED IN RELIGIOUS MARRIAGES.

A correspondent writes us as follows from Watertown, Wis.:

Please give light on the following points:

The position is taken by some, that the principle of total separation of Church and State is encroached upon in the marriage ceremony as performed by the clergy. The reasons given are these:

1. It is a civil duty because authority is given by the State.

2. It becomes a religious duty if the clergyman performs the ceremony; and because preaching and praying as well as sacred hymns form a part of the ceremony.

Therefore it becomes a union of Church and State, say they. Please explain.

A SURSCRIBER.

So far as the State is concerned, marriage is simply a civil contract to be regulated by civil statute in accordance with the laws of our being, in such a way as to guard the rights of the contracting parties, their offspring, and the community.

But while marriage is a natural, civil, social relation revealed in the great Book of nature, written in the very constitution of the human family, so that they naturally enter into it; it is also the subject of divine revelation. God has seen fit to throw around it the sanctions and safeguards of his revealed will. It is the duty and privilege of Christians to recognize the divine institution of the marriage relation by connecting with the marriage contract such religious services as seem to them fitting; and for the State to forbid this would be despotism.

In some countries the Roman Catholic Church has secured the enactment of laws forbidding all civil marriages and requiring that all marriages be solemnized by the church. This is one extreme; the other would be to forbid religious marriages and require all marriages to be performed by a civil magistrate.
