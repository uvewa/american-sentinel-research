PREACHERS OBJECT TO SUNDAY CYCLING.

The people shall not work on Sunday, neither shall they play, is the sentiment of the so-called Sabbath Protection League of Boston, as is witnessed by the following from the Boston Herald, of April 28:—

Sunday cycling was under consideration as the principal topic of interest before the meeting of the directors of the New England Sabbath Protective League at Wesleyan Hall yesterday afternoon, and, although no definite action was taken on the subject, an effort to reduce it will be made in the near future.

The officers of the league do not object to the exercise itself any more than they do to walking or to riding in a carriage, but they propose to use all the influence they possess to discourage "club runs" on the Lord's day. These runs they regard as dangerous influences. They think they attract many, not merely from divine service, but from any observation of the day which is not more secular in its result than the manner in which they observe any other day of the week.

The opinions of the members of the league on this subject are reinforced by letters from persons who are not members of the league, and some of whom are not even church members, protesting against the manner in which many of these cycling organizations conduct themselves on the sabbath. They claim that the bicyclers not only rob the day of all its sacredness, but transform it into a huge holiday.

The league officers have not yet formed any plan by which to counteract this evil, as they consider it, but they will probably issue a circular appeal to the several clubs, asking them to refrain from these runs, and if this is not successful, they may attempt to obtain some legislation to control it.

The secretary of the league, Rev. M. D. Kneeland, reported that interest in the work of the league is

spreading, and that he has received requests to advocate its ideas in various cities throughout New England. He is now speaking from three to six times a week in the interests of the league, and expects to have a heavy moral backing in this as well as in several other projects which are in contemplation.

It is evident that nothing short of a complete code of Blue Laws will satisfy the advocates of a civilly-enforced religious Sunday.
