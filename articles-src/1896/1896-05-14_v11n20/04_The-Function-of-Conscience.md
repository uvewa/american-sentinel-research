THE FUNCTION OF CONSCIENCE.

The moral monitor of every man is his conscience. This monitor is implanted in man's very nature, and the importance of its office cannot be overestimated. It should at all times exercise the fullest control over the individual life. Whatever tends to interfere with its action, by depriving it of its power, lessens the individual's moral worth, and in the same degree his capacity for usefulness in society. An individual with no conscience is mere personified selfishness, a menace to every right of his fellow- beings, and isolated from every ordained purpose of human existence.

Conscience cannot constitute a moral standard of right and wrong; but its monitions are nevertheless to be always heeded. The moral standard is the word of God; and by this word conscience must be directed and enlightened. Whatever the individual knows of that word, or of right and justice from whatever source, conscience seeks to enforce in his life. Conscience is always fully abreast of the individual's knowledge of moral truth. The one who is obedient to all the dictates of conscience, is living up to all the light he has.

Conscience, however, does not respond to every force that seeks to govern the individual, but only to that which can bring conviction to the mind; and to seek to govern men by any other means, is to do that which must result in harm. Man was given a conscience and endowed with reason in order that he might be governed through his own free will. Mere force is not the proper means of government for reasoning beings. It is true that civil government operates by force and not by persuasion; but civil government is based upon reason, and its machinery and laws are such as reason sanctions. And conscience dictates obedience to all that which reason requires. It is the right of men everywhere to require that all legislation should be reasonable; it is their right to live under a government by the principles of which reason and conscience are not sought to be fettered. It is their right to secure such government, even at the cost of revolution.

When any individual is forced to do that which is contrary to reason and the dictates of his conscience, an injury is done to his moral nature. When conscience is violated, its vitality is impaired; and from unwillingly violating his conscience under pressure put upon him by others, the individual erelong demands to the point of voluntary disregard of its dictates, in which condition he is entirely unfit for usefulness as a citizen, and becomes a menace instead of a blessing to society and to the State.

The State wants citizens who are conscientious,—whose actions in all things are governed by regard for the rights of their fellows, and a sense of accountability to the final Judge of all the earth. To this end it is necessary that its laws shall be reasonable and just. "Law" must not be set above reason and justice, even though its repeal be speedily anticipated. Conscientious regard for the right is the best guarantee of the individual's worth as a citizen; and in order that this regard may be as deep and as widespread as possible, the government must be careful that its forces work in harmony with those reasonable and intelligent convictions of right with which conscience is inseparably connected. Otherwise there will speedily spring up in the minds of the people a contempt for law and a distrust of the machinery of government to secure the rights and blessings to which they feel themselves to be entitled.

He who surrenders his own rights, cannot be expected to defend the rights of others; and he who violates his own conscience cannot be expected to regard the consciences of others. "Laws" to compel the conscience—such for example as "sabbath laws"—cannot but operate detrimentally to the State. Law must be based upon the principle of the protection of rights; based upon any other principle, a "law" will invade rights instead of protecting them.

A nation will wax or wane in the scale of true prosperity in proportion as its government approximates to that perfect form under which the minds and consciences of men are left without restraint in the exercise of their natural and proper functions.
