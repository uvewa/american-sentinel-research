A RELIABLE German paper is authority for the statement that the Vatican was strongly in favor of the Italian campaign against the Abyssinians, who lean toward the Greek Church and have for years resisted the efforts of Rome to bring them over. The Vatican, it is said, had a large number of Roman Catholic missionaries ready to follow the Italian army if the latter had been victorious.
