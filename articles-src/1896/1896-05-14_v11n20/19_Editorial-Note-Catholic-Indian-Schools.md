THAT it is the precedent and principle of State aid to her institutions which the Roman Catholic Church values in the matter of government appropriations for her Indian schools, more than the money itself, is evident from the fact that the yearly appropriation of $250,000 could be borne by the 6,000,000 Catholic communicants in the United States at an expense to each communicant of less than five cents per annum. The Catholic Church is not suffering from poverty, in this country or any other; and her fight for the continuance of governmental aid is made with a view to the tremendous advantage to be reaped later on from an established precedent by which the government is virtually committed to the support of the Catholic Church.
