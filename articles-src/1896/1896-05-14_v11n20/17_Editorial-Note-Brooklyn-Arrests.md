THE Evening World, of the 4th inst., says: "The first arrest ever made in Brooklyn under Section 266 of the Penal Code, which prohibits manual labor of any kind on Sunday, was that of two men employed in a factory in Greenpoint, made yesterday.

"The men, Charles Baronen and Frank Schraneo, are Hebrews, and work for Davis Frank, a manufacturer of iron bedsteads, at 104-108 Calyer Street. . . . The men were held for trial by Justice Lemon in the Ewen Street Police Court."
