# IS IT TRUE CHRISTIAN ENDEAVOR?

A RECENT step taken by the "Law and Order League" in Jersey City for the purpose of securing evidence against Sunday liquor sellers in that city, has been to secure young men and boys of the Epworth League and Christian Endeavor societies, to visit the saloons on Sunday and sample the beer and whiskey, in the guise of customers. For this course the league has been severely criticised, which criticisms, says the New York Sun, of June 1, called out a champion of the league in the person of the Rev. Dr. John L. Scudder, pastor of the Tabernacle, who prefaced his Sunday evening sermon by some remarks in answer to the question, "Should Christian Endeavors do Detective Work?" In these prefatory remarks the speaker said:—

There is only one way to get the evidence, and that is to order up the liquor. This was a severe cross for many Christian men to bear, and many refused when spoken to on the subject, for entering saloons is essentially distasteful to Christian Endeavors; but modern Christians are not cowards, and they realize that Christianity involves cross-bearing and fighting disagreeable battles for righteousness' sake.

Is it true Christian endeavor and Christian cross-bearing to enter liquor saloons and call for and taste the various intoxicants for sale, for the purpose of getting evidence against the seller? True Christian cross-bearing is denial of self; and while it may be claimed that these were acts of self-denial to the persons selected to perform them, it cannot be truthfully said that Christian self-denial ever calls an individual to handle the devil's fire. The inspired warning, "Go not into the way of evil men," applies to all. The best of men are not above temptation, and especially may his be said of young men and boys, such as make up the membership of these societies. Vice is naturally abhorred at first sight, but—

"Seen too oft, familiar with her face,
We first endure, then pity, then embrace."

We shall be much mistaken if these young people can continue to enter the haunts of vice and put the devil's fire in their bosoms without receiving injury. The "cross" involved in such an act tends naturally to become eliminated as the act is repeated. The "battle for righteousness" in behalf of others, becomes a struggle for the masters with the demon of self within.

Nor is the object to be attained by this detective kind of "Christian endeavor" one which is at all contemplated in the bearing of the cross of Christ. For the bearing of his cross is not for the purpose of imposing civil pains and penalties upon any, but in order that the bearer may himself become a partaker of the divine nature, and spiritually identified with Christ. See Gal. 2:20.

Some other remarks of Dr. Scudder in this connection are fraught with unhappy significance. Speaking of those who had criticised such methods of opposing evil on the part of the church, he said (italics ours):—

They would have the church fold its hands in holy contemplation and discourse somniferously about the hereafter, and the moment live Christians leap in the arena and fight sin along practical lines they inform us we are transgressing our proper limits. But it so happens that we discredit them as a source of authority, and consider them a point or two off in their theology. They little understand the virile nature of twentieth century religion and its determination to maintain righteousness by positive and aggressive methods. We understand our business and need no points from law-breaking saloon keepers and their backers and sympathizers.

In this language it is plainly implied that the plain preaching of the Word of God is not a practical way of fighting sin. But the Scriptures tell us that it is a practical way and the only way to battle with sin successfully. They tell us that the power of the word of God is infinitely greater than the power of man. See Ps. 33:6, 9; Eph. 6:17; 2 Cor. 10:3–5; Heb. 4:12. The battle is already lost when we have reached the conclusion that the preaching of the all-powerful Word is not the only successful way of contending with unrighteousness.

The language quoted also implies that "virile" Christianity manifests itself by such methods of procedure as these which have substituted the machinery of the civil power for the word and grace of God in the combat with sin; for it is always against sin that Christianity wars. But our country may well sigh for more of that Christianity exhibited in the godly lives of our old-time ancestors, who had implicit faith in God's word and knew nothing about such methods of "Christian endeavor" as those lately devised in the interests of "law and order."

In concluding, Dr. Scudder said, "Law and order are not meaningless words, and a combination of churches is an organization not to be trifled with." As a political power, no doubt a combination of churches is "not to be trifled with." The churches have shown already, on several occasions, what their power is when combined for the purpose of securing legislation from Congress and other political bodies. But are politics and civil government the proper sphere of the church of Christ? While the church combination is showing that as a political power it is "an organization not to be trifled with," we may be sure that it is accomplishing but a trifling amount in the work of evangelizing the world, set forth in Christ's great commission to his followers.
