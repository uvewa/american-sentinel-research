FROM A MEMBER OF THE PROHIBITION CONVENTION.

Sistersville, W. Va., June 2, 1896.

Editor SENTINEL: The resolution respecting protection for the Sunday, adopted by the National Prohibition Convention last week, before the bolt, and which was retained by the bolters, evinced a drawing towards religious liberty more than ever before.

It evinces a preference to use the language of protection rather than compulsion. I objected to it, however, because it did not give assurance of equal protection. Also, in view of the general thought that protection involves compulsion to observe the day; that this was not clear of that imputation. I preferred the action of the other faction, to say nothing, rather than make a declaration that has lurking in it the possibility of a "civil sabbath."

I made efforts to have the following amendment substituted:—

Every man should be protected equally in his right to one day of rest in seven, whichever day he holds; not by compulsory sabbath laws, but in freedom to worship God.

Several who favored this, thought that the other was about the same thing. The intense interest in the question that divided the convention held every one from giving that scrutiny to the matter of Sunday legislation that may be secured for it when free from such pressure.

The National Reform Association members are generally Prohibitionists. They are, however, a much smaller factor in the party than the friends of religious liberty have usually supposed. The utterances of the party voicing their views, have been made because of the organized persistent effort on their part, and default of effort on our part to thwart it. Wherever there has been a small protest from friends of religious liberty in Prohibition conventions, it has generally modified or wholly thwarted the efforts against us.

G. H. LYON.
