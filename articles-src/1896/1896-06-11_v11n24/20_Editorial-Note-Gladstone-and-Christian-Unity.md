PRESS dispatches announce that Mr. W. E. Gladstone, the English ex-premier, has come forward as an advocate of "Christian unity," by means of papal recognition of the validity of Anglican orders, having written a long letter on the subject to Cardinal Rampolla. The Pope, it is said, has directed an inquiry into the subject, whereupon Mr. Gladstone declares that he regards this gracious attitude on Leo's part as "in the largest sense paternal, and one which he will ever cherish with cordial sentiments of reverence, gratitude, and high appreciation." It would be needless to state who is the gainer in such transactions.
