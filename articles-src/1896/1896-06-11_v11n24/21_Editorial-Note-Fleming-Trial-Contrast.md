As we note the fact brought out by a press reporter in connection with the Fleming murder trial, now in progress in this city, that the prosecution refused to call upon the stand the young daughter of Mrs. Fleming as a witness against her, we call to mind by way of contrast the course pursued by the prosecution in the trial of W. D. Dortch, a Seventh-day Adventist, of Springville, Tenn., for having done secular work on Sunday. In the former case the prosecution said it would be inhuman to make the child testify against her own mother. But in the case of the man arrested for desecrating Sunday, the prosecution made every effort to compel Mr. Dortch's young son to act the part of a witness against his father.
