THE Sunday-law question is being vigorously agitated in Louisiana. It seems that a movement is on foot to secure the repeal of the "law," and the Sunday-keeping churches are rallying to its support. Memorials to the legislature are being circulated and signed asking not only that the "law" be maintained, but that it be enforced. This fight was not inaugurated by the International Religious Liberty Association, but now that it is on, representatives of the association are doing all they can to render the people intelligent in regard to the principles underlying all religious legislation.
