## PROHIBITIONISTS AND THEIR PLATFORMS.

The Prohibitionists of the country held their national convention in Pittsburg, Pa., on the 27th and 28th ult. The result must certainly have been a disappointment to all in sympathy with the Prohibition movement.

The convention resulted in a division of the party, two tickets being placed in nomination, and two platforms adopted. The candidates of the regular Prohibition Party are: Hon. Joshua Levering, of Maryland, for President, and Hon. Hale Johnson, of Illinois, for Vice-President.

The "bolters" organized what they call the "National Party," their candidates being Rev. C. E. Bentley, of Nebraska, for President, and J. H. Southgate, of North Carolina, for Vice-President.

The regular Prohibition platform as printed in the Voice of June 4, is as follows:—

### THE PROHIBITION PLATFORM.

We, the members of the Prohibition Party, in national convention assembled, renewing our declaration of allegiance to Almighty God as the rightful ruler of the universe, lay down the following as our declaration of political purpose:—

The Prohibition Party, in national convention assembled, declares its firm conviction that the manufacture, exportation, importation, and sale of alcoholic beverages has produced such social, commercial, industrial, and political wrongs, and is now so threatening the perpetuity of all our social and political institutions, that the suppression of the same by a national party organized therefor, is the greatest object to be accomplished by the voters of our country, and is of such importance that it, of right, ought to control the political actions of all our patriotic citizens until such suppression is accomplished.

The urgency of this course demands the union without further delay of all citizens who desire the prohibition of the liquor traffic; therefore be it

deceived. That we favor the legal prohibition by State and national legislation of the manufacture, importation, and sale of alcoholic beverages. That we declare our purpose to organize and unite all the friends of Prohibition into one party, and in order to accomplish this end we deem it of right to leave every Prohibitionist the freedom of his own convictions upon all other political questions, and trust our representatives to take such action upon other political questions as the changes occasioned by Prohibition and the welfare of the whole people shall demand.

To this was subsequently added this plank on motion of Mrs. Ella A. Boole of this city:—

"Revolved. That the right of suffrage ought not to be abridged on account of sex."

The platform of the National Party, as published in the Voice of the same date previously referred to, reads as follows:—

The National Party, recognizing God as the author of all just power in government, presents the following declaration of principles which it pledges itself to enact into effective legislation when given the power to do so:—

The suppression of the manufacture and sale, importation, exportation, and transportation of intoxicating liquors for beverage purposes. We utterly reject all plans for regulating or compromising with this traffic, whether such plans be called local option, taxation, license, or public control. The sale of liquors for medicinal and other legitimate uses should be conducted by the State without profit and with such regulations as will prevent fraud or evasion.

No citizen should be denied the right to vote on account of sex.

All money should be issued by the General Government only and without the intervention of any private citizen, corporation, or banking institution. It should be based upon the wealth, stability, and integrity of the nation. It should be a full, legal tender for all debts public and private, and should be of sufficient volume to meet the demands of the legitimate business interests of the country. For the purpose of honestly liquidating our outstanding coin obligations we favor the free and unlimited coinage of both silver and gold at the ratio 16 to 1 without consulting any other nation.

The National Constitution should be so amended as to allow the national revenues to be raised by equitable adjustment of taxation on the properties and incomes of the people, and import duties should be levied as a means of securing equitable commercial relations with other nations.

The initiative and referendum and proportional representation should be adopted.

Having herein presented our principles and purposes we invite the cooperation and support of all citizens who are with us substantially agreed.

The original report on the Committee on Platform before the "bolt" made no mention of Sunday or of Sunday "laws." The minority report, however, contained this:—

Eighth: All citizens should be protected in their right to one day's rest without opposing anyone who conscientiously observes any other day than the first day of the week.

The minority report was, by vote of 492 to 310, made a part of the report of the Committee on Platform. But this Sunday plank does not appear in either platform, as published in the Voice.

Mr. G. H. Lyon, of Sistersville, W. Va., a member of the Convention, writes us, however, under date of June 3, that this plank was retained by the "bolters," in which case it is a part of the platform of the National Party.

We have stated these facts without comment simply for the information of our readers, and shall discuss those planks of the two platforms bearing upon religious liberty, at another time.
