THE recent decision of the Supreme Court of the United States affirming the constitutionality of the "law" of Georgia which prohibits the running of freight cars on Sunday, does not of course touch the question of the right of the State to forbid Sunday labor by private parties; but it does show a tendency on the part of the Court of last resort to sustain Sunday legislation as a whole. We shall have more to say on this subject as soon as we shall have procured a copy of the decision.
