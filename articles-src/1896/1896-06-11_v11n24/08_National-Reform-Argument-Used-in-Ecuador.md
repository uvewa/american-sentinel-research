## "NATIONAL REFORM" ARGUMENT USED IN ECUADOR.

The Panama Star and Herald, of May 23, prints the following:—

Great consternation prevails in Ecuador, owing to the recent earthquakes, which partially destroyed the town of Porloviejo and some others. The Conservatives have seized this opportunity to dilate on divine retribution and to work up the religious fanaticism of the people against the present administration, asserting that God shows his anger by permitting such awful calamities to befall the people who support Alfaro. Their efforts in this direction seem, however, to have miscarried, for the people appear to be determined to have a government that will not defraud and oppress them.

The argument is just as good in Ecuador as it is in the United States.
