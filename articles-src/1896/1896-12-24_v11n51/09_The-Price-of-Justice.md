[New York Journal, December 10, 1896.]

The mere fact that a galaxy of what are picturesquely described as $50,000 a year lawyers are defending the so-called Railway Trust against the attacks of an $8,000 a year United States attorney-general, ought not to affect the outcome of the suit. Surely the Supreme Court—in whose entire infallibility a majority of the nation has lately declared belief—cannot be dazzled by the monetary worth of legal talent. The attorney-general is an able lawyer—perhaps not himself in the $50,000 class, though his predecessor was. Does anybody think that if the $50,000 Olney were prosecuting this case on behalf of the Government the Trust's chances for victory would be less?

It is the fashion to deplore the smallness of the salary of the attorney-general, and to contrast it with the liberal pay which corporations offer to successful lawyers. But it is the fashion also to insist that in this free and equal democracy the courts know no difference between rich and poor, and that justice is equitably meted out without reference to the wealth of the suitors. Clearly the complaint and the boast are incompatible if the man who can pay his lawyer the biggest fee stands the better chance of success.

We do not recall any mere political criticism of the Supreme Court so stinging as this apprehension that the mere array of highly paid legal talent in opposition to the attorney-general may affect its decision. The apprehension has been expressed not only in this case, but time and again when such distinguished attorneys-general as William M. Evarts, Edwards Pierrepont, Wayne MacVeagh, and Benjamin H. Brewster, appeared on behalf of the State.

The justices of the Supreme Court are supposed to know the law. They are selected from the ranks of the most distinguished lawyers of the nation, and are believed to be acute enough to detect sophistry in any argument. Their dictum is final, and must not be cavilled at, lest the irreverent critic be branded as an anarchist. But it appears that to suggest that the litigant who can hire the most expensive lawyers stands the better chance before the Supreme Court, or any other court of the United States, is not only not regarded as hostile criticism of the courts, but is looked upon as merely an obvious fact.

A very curious estimate the people seem to put on courts as courts of justice.
