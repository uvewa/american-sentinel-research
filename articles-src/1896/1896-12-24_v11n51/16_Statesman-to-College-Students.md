THE Christian Statesman of December 12, announces that "many presidents of colleges have written to us, . . . sending a selected list of twenty names of worthy students" to whom the Statesman will be sent this winter.

It hopes "to reach at least 50,000 [college students] before the winter is over." What are you doing, reader, to extend the circulation of the AMERICAN SENTINEL?
