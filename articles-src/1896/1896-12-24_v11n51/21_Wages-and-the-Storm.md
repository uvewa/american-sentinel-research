In the late big storm in this city a man perished because he had no shelter, although he had worked the day before. When his employer saw him dead, he exclaimed, "Why, that's Louis Bressler. He went to work for us yesterday. We would have paid him today if he had not died." The Lord has said, "The wages of him that is hired shall not abide with thee all night until the morning." What untold blessings would come to the poor if only those who have it in their power would do as the Bible says.
