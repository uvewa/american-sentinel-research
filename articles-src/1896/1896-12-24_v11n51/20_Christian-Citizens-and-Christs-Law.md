The Union Signal says that "It is believed that this is a good time for Christian citizens, irrespective of party or denomination, to come together and consider their duty in the light of Christ's law." Yes, that is believed by a large number of people: and we most heartily wish that they would do it. And until all can get together, we wish such as do meet would really do this. It would work great changes and do immense good.
