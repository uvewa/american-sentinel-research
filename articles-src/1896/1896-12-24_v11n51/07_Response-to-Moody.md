Mr. Moody's questions deserve answers. He asks, Shall our religious newspapers and our pulpits keep their mouths closed like "dumb dogs that cannot bark" to warn people of approaching danger?" The answer is that they are doing it. And the probability is that they will continue to do it, because they do not believe that there is any approaching danger. How can anybody be expected to warn people of approaching danger when he does not believe any such thing?

Mr. Moody believes that the Lord is coming again to the world, and that He is coming soon. And this is the truth. He therefore knows that there is the greatest possible danger to all who are not prepared now to meet the Lord. Mr. Moody and every one else who really believes the soon coming of the Lord can warn all people of approaching danger. But if Mr. Moody or anyone else should attempt to emphasize this great truth in the Independent, he would probably find even that paper questioning it and saying that there is no danger. Yet if not the Independent, it is certain that nine-tenths of "our religious newspapers and our pulpits" would do so. How then can they warn people of this approaching danger?

Mr. Moody and a few others can declare in genuine faith, as he did the other day in this city: "God will come in judgment to this world. . . . This world is getting darker and darker; its ruin is coming nearer and nearer; if you have any friends on this wreck unsaved you had better lose no time in getting them off."

This is all true. And whether you have any friends on the wreck or not, so long as there is a single human being on this wreck unsaved you had better lose no time in getting them off.

Again we say this is all true, the word of God says it, and Mr. Moody and a few others believe it and so can work in faith, and work effectually. But we ask, How many of "our religious newspapers and our pulpits" believe any such thing as that "this world is getting darker and darker," and that "ruin is coming nearer and nearer"? It can with perfect safety be said that hardly one in a dozen of them believe it. They preach the very opposite of this. They proclaim that the world is growing better and better and more and more light, and that it will continue to do so until an indefinite millenium shall be ushered in with a perfect blaze of world-wide glory. How can people who cling to such views as this, lift up their voice like a trumpet to warn people of any approaching danger?

Mr. Moody asks "Have we no care for the multitudes of souls going down to perdition every year while we sit and look on?"—Ah! but who does not know that now in leading theological seminaries, in many pulpits, and in some religious papers, it is a largely debatable question whether there are any souls, much less multitudes, going down to perdition? True, the word of God says that "God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth on him should not perish;" that "he that believeth not is condemned already;" that "he that believeth not shall be damned;" and that without God and without Christ they have "no hope." And Mr. Moody and some others believe this, and so can work in all earnestness to get people to believe the gospel that they may be saved from perdition. But when there are so many, and the number constantly growing, who through the new invention of "the larger hope" do not really believe that there is danger of anybody going to perdition, how can they preach the gospel of Christ which is given to save men from perdition?

He asks whether the things about which he inquires are the result of the Modern Criticism. Yes, Brother Moody, it is. The word of God is given to be believed to the saving of the soul. But when it is only criticised to the destruction of both it and the soul, what other results can be expected? It is "the Word" that is to be preached. It is "the Word" that is able to save the soul. It is "the Word" that is to build up the believer and give him an inheritance among all them that are sanctified. But when that Word is criticised instead of being believed, how then can it save the soul of that critic? And when his own soul is not saved, how can he preach salvation to others? He does not know what it is, how can he preach it?

Yes, Brother Moody, these things are precisely "what the matter is."

Yet for all this we do not see how they can possibly resist Mr. Moody's exceedingly modest plea that "the churches be open every Sunday night for the preaching of the gospel." When the churches are built, and occupied, and exempted from taxation, expressly under the profession that it is all for the preaching of the gospel all the time, assuredly it is the least possible thing that they could be asked, or that they could allow, that the Gospel shall be preached there one hour each week.

We sincerely hope that the religious papers, and all others if possible, will help him to "send that cry all over the country."
