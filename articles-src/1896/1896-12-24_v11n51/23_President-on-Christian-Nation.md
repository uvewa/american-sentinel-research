A Washington, D. C., correspondent sends us the following: "A delegation of members of the Anti-saloon League called on the President and had a conversation with him with reference to proposed religious legislation. They referred to the criticisms that had been made in the papers with reference to his Thanksgiving proclamation; and as they reported in their public meetings, the President said emphatically that this is indeed a Christian nation, and it was only a matter of time when everyone would have to come to accept the situation." Evidently it was due to no oversight on the President's part that his Thanksgiving proclamation for 1896 read as it did.
