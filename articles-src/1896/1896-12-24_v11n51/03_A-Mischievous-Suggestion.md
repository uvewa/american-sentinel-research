The following has been published as having been spoken by Governor-elect Pingree, of Michigan, in an interview:

I don't believe in these great fortunes. Here are the Vanderbilt's, with their $100,000,000 apiece. That means an income of at least $5,000,000 and perhaps more. Figure that down, and it means an income of about $12,000 a day.

"Think of it!" declared the mayor, raising his hands above his head; "one man having an income as large as that of 15,000 of his fellow-citizens combined. I believe we ought to have some kind of a law regulating those things. It seems the Constitution won't let us have an income tax and won't let us have an inheritance tax. I guess the Constitution needs amendment to it, so we can do something.

"They talk of limiting the number of hours in a day's work. Why should not the amount of money that any one can pile up be limited? After they get so much let the accumulations be turned over to the Government to lessen the taxes of the people."

"What is your idea of a proper sized fortune?" he was asked.

"I haven't made up my mind on that yet. When Carter Harrison died he left $350,000 to each of his children and gave the balance of his fortune to charitable objects, saying he thought $350,000 enough for any one man to have."

We do not doubt that what is here professed will actually be put into practice yet. It was done both in Rome and in France in the days which we have before mentioned.

As Mr. Pingree says, there is talk, strong talk too, and there has been for years, of limiting the number of hours in a day's work. Now to the man who is dependent upon his day's work, that day's work is his capital; and to limit the number of hours that he may work in a day, is certainly to deprive him of just so much of his capital. And if this shall be done to the day's worker, why shall it not be done also to the millionaire?

This argument is all right from the premises; but what we should like to know is, Why should the number of hours in a day's work be limited? Why should not every man be left perfectly free to work as many hours in a day as he may choose to work? To limit the number of hours a day that a man may work who chooses to work, would be nothing less than an arbitrary and despotic use of power. And to limit the amount of wealth any man may possess would be nothing less.

There are a number of questions suggested by Mr. Pingree's observations. He says that after the rich ones "get so much, let the accumulations be turned over to the Government to lessen the taxes of the people." But under such conditions as this, how could Mr. Pingree be sure that there would be any accumulations after the limit was reached? It is hardly to be supposed that men would conduct a business merely for the pleasure of turning over to the Government the accumulations. Would he also try to compel them by law to carry on the business after the limit of their own wealth was reached, so that the Government could have the further accumulations? These questions belong with those propositions.

It is true, Mr. Pingree has not positively fixed yet in his own mind just what is the proper limit of wealth: though he seems to incline to Carter Harrison's estimate of $350,000. It is easily enough 16 to 1, however, that there are more than 350,000 men in the United States who are positive that this limit is vastly too high—so long as other people have the money. And, admitting the correctness of Carter Harrison's judgment as to what was best for his sons, and just how much of his wealth he would bestow upon each of them, can anybody be perfectly sure that he was so firmly fixed in the opinion that $350,000 was enough for any one man to have, that he would have been willing for the Government to appropriate all his accumulations above that sum? There is room for considerable difference between a man's views of what is best for him to do with his own money, and his views of what other people or the Government may do with it.

But even suppose that all the accumulations of all the people in the United States above $350,000 each were "turned over to the Government;" it would still be under the control of men, as "the Government" is only a certain set of men—who then can be perfectly sure that this money would be used to any better purpose by the men who would then control it, than it is used by those who now control it? Is it true that no such thing was ever heard of as jobs and extravagances on the part of officials of the Government? Is it the testimony of universal experience that men may be loose or tricky in money matters only until they get into office, but that then they are certain to be strictly honest and upright?

Now we are not defending or excusing the ways of the rich: we are simply calling attention to the serious defects in Mr. Pingree's proposed plan of dealing with them. It is true that many of them are using their wealth in ways that are only wildly and foolishly extravagant. Too many of them are lavishing their money on dogs and cats living and dead, while human beings are perishing within easy reach from their doors. Hundreds of them are gorging themselves at gorgeous feasts, while thousands are fairly starving all around. Thousands of them exhaust themselves in the very dissipation of pleasure, while misery stalks before their eyes everywhere. They cut the wages of their employés from ten to twenty-five per cent. in order that their own income of hundreds of thousands may not be cut at all.

All this is true, "and pity 'tis 'tis true," and it is increasing every day. And the more there is of it, and the longer it continues, the more hatred will be aroused against those who do it, the more men there will be making capital of it by suggesting such schemes as we are now studying, and the nearer will come the day, till at last the day will have certainly come, when the discontent will burst all bounds and the rich will "be for booties" and will "weep and howl for the miseries that shall come upon them."

But though all this is true, no such scheme as Mayor Pingree suggests, nor any that will be for the purpose applied, can ever remedy or relieve the difficulty a single particle. Each scheme applied only becomes a greater evil. It has been so always; it will only be so again. The only possible remedy is that prescribed by the Lord. Those who are rich, let them become poor for Christ's sake; and those who are poor let them "be patient unto the coming of the Lord. Behold the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath long patience for it, until he receive the early and latter rain. Be ye also patient; stablish your hearts; for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh."
