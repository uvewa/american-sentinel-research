BY DWIGHT L. MOODY.

TO THE EDITOR OF THE INDEPENDENT:

IN a recent issue of your paper I saw an article from a contributor which stated that there were over three thousand churches in the Congregational and Presbyterian bodies of this country that did not report a single member added by profession of faith last year. Can this be true? The thought has taken such hold of me that I can't get it out of my mind. It is enough almost to send a thrill of horror through the soul of every true Christian.

If this is the case with these two large denominations what must be the condition of the others also? Are we all going to sit still and let this thing continue? Shall our religious newspapers and our pulpits keep their mouths closed like "dumb dogs that cannot bark" to warn people of their approaching danger? Should we not all lift up our voice like a trumpet about this matter? What must the Son of God think of such a result of our labor as this? What must an unbelieving world think about a Christianity that can't bring forth any more fruit? And have we no care for the multitude of souls going down to perdition every year while we all sit and look on? And this country of ours, where will it be in the next ten years if we don't awake out of sleep?

I wish some of you editors of the influential papers, who are in close touch with the ministers and churches, would tell us what the matter is. Is this the result of what they call the "Modern Criticism" of the Bible? Is this a specimen of the better times, when we would get rid of the old stories about Moses writing the Pentateuch, and the sun and moon standing still, and the fish swallowing Jonah? How much of all this is owing to the politics our ministers have been preaching lately, and the talks on the Labor question, and the stereopticon shows on Sunday evenings, and all these other things that have been driving out the blessed gospel of Jesus Christ? When ministers go into preludes on current topics, how can they expect any afterludes of conversions?

Do Christian editors and ministers in these days believe in conversions as they used to do?

Won't your great paper please answer this question? I hear of some men in high places who talk as tho all that was a thing of the past. "It's education now that men want," not salvation; is this the fact? Are the churches going to turn over all the work of saving men to the Salvation Army, and the Volunteers and the Rescue Missions? I know of a city, of about 50,000 inhabitants, where it seems to be the common talk that if a man wants to find Christ he must go into the Young Men's Christian Association to find him. What a shame that churches should be run on such a plan that that kind of thing could be said!

I am pleading just now every chance I get for all our churches to be open every Sunday night for the preaching of the gospel. I wish our religious papers would help me send that cry all over the country. It is time we gave up the abuse of the opportunity in substituting temperance meetings and Sunday-school concerts and Endeavor rallies and all that kind of thing, right enough in their place, but not the one thing needful; workingmen and their families often can't get out but once on Sunday, and that is in the evening; why then should not they have as good a chance to hear the gospel as other people? Why should they be put off with that kind of an apology for a church service which is often seen?

Let some change of this character be brought about with the Week of Prayer at the beginning of the new year. Let the ball be set a-rolling then, and it will gain large momentum before spring, and there will be great results. Won't you please help all you can, in every way, to get the churches praying and preaching and working for souls?
