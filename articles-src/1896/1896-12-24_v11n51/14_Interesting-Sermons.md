A prominent clergyman of New York City, Rev. Madison C. Peters, says that the remedy for non-attendance of church members at the house of worship on Sunday, is to make the Sunday sermon more interesting than the Sunday newspaper. Certainly; this is the only legitimate way, though it may not be the easiest way for the preachers. The effort made by the latter to suppress the Sunday newspaper is a virtual confession that they are unable to compete with it in producing that which will interest the people. It is just as true now as it ever was, however, that the power of the word of God is infinitely greater than any power that can be exercised by the Sunday newspaper or any other means that is of earth. If preachers would only stop trying to compete with the Sunday paper in the line of that which the latter contains and on the plane where it stands, and turn to the simple preaching of the divine Word, their work would be attended by "the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth," and the world might again see with wonder three thousand people converted by one sermon, instead of one person converted by three thousand sermons.
