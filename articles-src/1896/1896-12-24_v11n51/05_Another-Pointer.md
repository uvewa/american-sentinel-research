It is quite generally known that Senator Quay is one of the shrewdest politicians in the country. It may be that in the following statement his sincerity is nothing more than political; yet it plainly shows that he sees the way the tide is setting and is taking his bearings accordingly:—

"I am opposed to the entire . . . theory that organized wealth shall dictate high office and so take possession of the Government.

"No league of business men or other men based upon wealth can erect a governing class in this country. In the United States Senate we have millionaires and business men enough to serve all legitimate purposes. Senators are needed who have no specialties, but who will act for the interests of the country in gross without special affinities.

"The people most deserving of representation and most in need of legislative protection are the farmers, the small storekeepers, the artisans and the laborers, and I stand by them and against this so-called league. I go into the barricades with the bourgeoise and the men in blouses.

"There must be less business and more principle in our politics, else the Republican party and the country will go to wreck. The business issues are making our politics sordid and corrupt. The tremendous sums of money furnished by business men, reluctantly in most instances, are polluting the well springs of our national being."
