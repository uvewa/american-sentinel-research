John G. Wooley calls the Bible "King James's version of the Constitution of the United States." This is a mistake. Our English Bible is the King James version of the Constitution of the Kingdom of God. The United States is not the Kingdom of God, and never will be. It is not even a kingdom of men. It is a republic of men.
