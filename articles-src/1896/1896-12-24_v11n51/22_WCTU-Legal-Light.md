Under the heading "Enforce the Laws," the Union Signal says that "more requests came the past year for legal light than for any other one thing; for that matter, more than all others put together." But what good is legal light to Christians? The light of life is what men need, Christians and all others. And it is written, "He that followeth Me, shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life." But as, in the work of the W. C. T. U., more requests are made for legal light than for all other things put together, it would appear that in that work they are following this other thing more than they are following Christ. The Signal considers this "a hopeful sign." It may be a hopeful sign of the thing they have in view; but as for anything pertaining to Christianity, it is everything else than a hopeful sign.
