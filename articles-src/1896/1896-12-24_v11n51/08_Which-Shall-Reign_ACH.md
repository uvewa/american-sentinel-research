BY ALBERT C. HOPKINS.

I saw, recently, a picture of the assembled society of Christian Endeavor, standing in the foreground and flooding with fresh color and young life, the long and broad steps of the national Capitol, a more welcome advent than that of Coxey's army, indeed a most imposing, significant and magnificent spectacle.

I read, too, in connection with it, the statement that it was and is the avowed purpose of this Christian Endeavor, to promote and establish "the reign of Christ on Capitol Hill." This statement and avowal is, doubtless, open to several different interpretations.

What shall we understand by "the reign of Christ in the national Capitol?" It is fit that we carefully consider what is its best meaning. If the spirit of Christ, the full justice, the willing personal sacrifice, the large religious freedom, the all-embracing fellowship and love, that truly represent the Christ, shall come to reign in the minds and thoughts of those who make and execute the laws at the national Capital, then only will the true Christ reign on Capitol Hill.

It is justly feared, however, that this is not the interpretation of the Society of Christian Endeavor. Evidently it needs to be said and recognized, that any effort on the part of professed Christians to force their religious views into the Constitution and the laws of the United States—whose proposed new and true name is the United State—is not a Christian but an unchristian endeavor. Such action will not promote, but certainly and seriously retard and prevent, the reign of the true Christ on Capitol Hill.
