In a letter to The Church, Boston, lately, on "The Relation of the Catholic Church to American Institutions," Cardinal Gibbons said:—

The American nation is a Christian nation — is manifest from its Constitution, from its tradition, and from its observance of certain holiday as Thanksgiving and Christmas. Now it is this very Christian spirit that the Catholic Church tries to strengthen in every way possible. Convinced that in her alone resides the fullness of divine revelation, she desires to draw all to herself through the sweet bonds of charity and religious persuasion.

And that this work of drawing all to herself is being steadily and persistently carried on, the following dispatch is in evidence:—

Rome, Dec. 16.—It is learned on excellent authority that the pope will probably renew negotiations with the United States for the creation of an American legation to the Vatican.

His Holiness has not any greater hopes of succeeding with President McKinley than with President Cleveland but he takes those steps by way of homage to a principle which, according to the Vatican, must sooner or later triumph.

As President Cleveland has declared that "it is only a matter of time when all will have to accept the situation" of this being "indeed a Christian nation," Rome can be depended on to do her part in seeing that "all will have to accept the situation."
