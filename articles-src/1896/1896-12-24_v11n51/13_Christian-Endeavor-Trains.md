We would never have thought of crediting the following to Dr. Wayland Hoyt, yet it is quoted as from his pen by the Golden Rule of December 10:

The old prophecy says that holiness to the Lord is to be written on the bells of the horses. The nineteenth century fulfillment of the prophecy is the emblazoning of railroad trains with devotion to Jesus Christ.

The allusion is to the train-loads of Christian Endeavurers going to their conventions, each wearing a badge which proclaims him or her to be a Christian. History records that the "Christian" Emperor Constantine fulfilled this same prophecy—as he asserted—by taking some nails from the true cross—genuine of course—and having them made into bits for guidfng the horse which he rode on State occasions. And there is as good ground for believing that Constantine fulfilled the prophecy, as for believing that it can be fulfilled at all by outward show.

The quotation shows how even the best minds become "fighty" when filled with the intoxicating idea of "Christian citizenship."
