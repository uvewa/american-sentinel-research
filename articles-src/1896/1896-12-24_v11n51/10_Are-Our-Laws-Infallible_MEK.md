BY M. E. KELLOGG.

LAWMAKERS generally see and promulgate correct principles, putting them into the form of law; but prejudices are often stronger than laws, and, under what seems to them to be peculiar and extraordinary circumstances, the persons who make laws based on principles of justice will sometimes justify actions contrary to the principles they have accepted and embodied in the law. Justice looks good to them in principle, as seen in the aggregate; but if it is applied in a way that conflicts with their strong prejudices, in a way they did not conceive that it could be done when they accepted the principles, they rebel at their own actions, or try to make an exception in the general application of the principles.

Thus many people who affect to believe in equal religious rights for every religious sect to preach and make converts wherever its missionaries can gain a hearing, actually limit such liberties to certain privileged churches and sects; and should a Mormon missionary, or a preacher of some other (to them) obnoxious sect, come into their vicinity, they would feel it to be the proper thing to ignore the principles of religious liberty which they have themselves accepted, and, with violence if necessary, drive the hated sectarian from their midst.

Those who do this, while claiming to accept the principles of religious liberty and to obey the laws of their State which accord liberty of conscience to all, really ignore both the law and the principle of justice upon which it is founded, and establish, as far as they can, a national religion, including in it those sects which they think should be protected or tolerated, and rigorously excluding all others.

In opposition to this common course of action toward the Mormons, we are pleased to see the following from the editorial columns of the Christian Advocate, of Nov. 19:

The question is started whether Mormons should be suppressed by law in the United States if they attempt to promote the spread of Mormonism; and whether, if mobbed, the authorities should protect them.

So long as the Mormons do not teach the violation of the laws of the State, they are entitled to all the liberties enjoyed by the most orthodox Christian sects. Exclusive of polygamy, their religion is not as demoralizing as modern Spiritistism, nor any more absurd; and while such unsettlers of the foundations of morality, to say nothing of religion, as Ingersoll are allowed free speech, there is no consistency in interfering by law with any teacher of religion, unless he advocates treason or the violation of the statute laws. This country has committed itself to free speech, freedom of the conscience, and freedom in religion, with all their consequences for good and evil, subject only to restrictions of universal application; and their application to freedom in religion is totally independent of the natural or supernatural origin thereof. But if Mormons teach polygamy and practice the same, they are amenable to the law just as they would be if they taught and practiced "free love."

We said that we were pleased to see this article; and we are. The question of the relation of the State and State laws to the former practice of polygamy by any Mormon, is correct. The practice of polygamy is a civil wrong, and, as a civil wrong, the civil law has a right to prohibit it.

But while this position of the Advocate is correct, there is in this article another general principle apparently laid down, which, while right as applied to polygamy, may be very dangerous as applied to some other things. It asserts that "there is no consistency in interfering by law with any teacher of religion, unless he advocates treason or the violation of statute laws." This rule, once adopted, would justify the State in interfering by law against any teacher of religion who taught something which some law of the State condemned. Now for State law to be right in every case, it would be absolutely necessary that the laws of the State should be so perfectly in harmony with the purest principles of justice that they condemn all evil, and nothing but evil, and promote all virtue, and nothing but virtue. And that is to say that the laws of the State must be absolutely perfect and infallible; and this in regard to religion as well as to civil affairs! Will anyone presume to say that such is the condition in any country in the world? Such a theory, carried out to its logical sequence, would deify the State, and change the greatest questions in morals and ethics from "Is it right?" to "Is it the law?"

The question of "Is it law?" has been used many times to serve the besest purposes, but the more important question "Is it right?" has, in numerous instances, been the mainspring of great and beneficent reforms.

To see how this principle has worked, it is only necessary to recall the days immediately preceding the great civil war in this country. When the Constitution of this nation was adopted, slavery was strongly intrenched in certain States of the Union. In those States it received the cordial support of the people as a whole, including the members of the various churches and their clergy. As the people of other States did not lock with such favor upon slavery, there was a fear that some State at some time might become an asylum for runaway slaves, and hence, to protect the interest of the slave-holder, the following carefully-worded article was made a portion of the United States Constitution:

No person held to service or labor in one State, under the laws thereof, escaping into another, shall, in consequence of any law or regulation therein, be discharged from such service or labor; but shall be delivered up, on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due.

The word "slave" is not here used, but slavery was meant; and in harmony with this section of the Constitution, a special law was passed by Congress in 1793 providing for the recapture of slaves. As time progressed and the evil and sinfulness of slavery became more clearly apparent, the law was not obeyed: many Christians holding that it was a Christian duty to assist in securing slaves, and aiding them on their way to Canada. So much of this was done that in 1850 a new and more stringent law to the same effect was enacted by Congress. This law was known as the "Fugitive Slave Law." But it also was disregarded, and the friction arising over this and other features of the slavery question led to the great anti-slavery movement, the formation of a new party, the election of Lincoln and the extinction of slavery.

During those stormy days preceding the war, many Christians paid little regard to the Fugitive Slave Law. Yet is was the law, and based on a clause in the Constitution, the highest law of all for the nation. They believed that the law was wrong, and hence disregarded it. Time has justified, and posterity approved, their conduct. But if law were the only criterion, those men were wrong, and deserving of severe condemnation and punishment; for, in the most persistent manner, they advocated the "violation of the statutes."

Another later illustration of the danger of allowing the "statutes in such cases made and provided" to be the rule of conscience may be seen in the law of Florida known as the "Sheats' Law." This law made it a penal offence for anyone to teach negroes and white children in the same building. The Christian Advocate, in its issue of Nov. 5, referring to this law, says that "the missionaries who were directly affected by this discriminating and unjust legislation disregarded it for the most part;" and evidently approves their conduct in so doing. That law has now been declared void by the Supreme Court of that State. But if law is to be obeyed blindly, irrespective of the greater question of whether it is right or wrong, the Sheats' Law, as well as the Fugitive Slave Law, should have been scrupulously obeyed. Of course whoever violates a law must expect to take the penalty, whether the law is right or wrong; but often the violation of an iniquitous law is the best and perhaps the only means of calling attention to it, and securing its modification or repeal.

To say that all the laws that now exist in regard to civil affairs, even in our own country, are absolutely right would stretch one's credulity to the utmost. But how much greater danger there is that laws relating to religion are decidedly wrong; for in making such laws the State is entirely outside of its province, and under such circumstances it cannot fail to be wrong. In support of this conclusion evidence might be drawn from the history of every nation under the sun from the earliest times down to our own day.

Our own country has afforded many illustrations of this truth from colonial times until the present generation. Some of these laws have been repealed, others have died from disuse—yet exist in an atrophied form; others, like the laws for the observance of Sunday, still remain, and their votaries claim for them the same infallibility which has been believed in the past to sanction other unjust religious laws of the same nature which long ago were consigned to oblivion.

Extirely to eliminate religious laws from our statute books would greatly simplify the question of law and obedience as related to civil affairs, and would be a great step toward the attainment of the probably unattainable ideal of civil law—absolute perfection. At the present time no one can truthfully say that this ideal has been achieved.

As long as all men do not see their religious duties precisely alike, and as long as the religious ideas of certain persons are enforced by civil law, we may expect that there will be those who will not accept the idea of the infallibility of the State and State laws. And should they be accused of violating these laws, which menace their religious rights, they will say, as did certain ones of old whom we all delight to honor, and who were similarly charged, "We ought to obey God rather than man."
