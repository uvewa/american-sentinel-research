The New York Journal defends the Sunday newspaper upon the ground that general acceptance of an article demonstrates its worth. As the Journal is defending the Sunday paper against a religious class who would have it suppressed on the ground that Sunday is the Sabbath, it makes use of logic which cannot well be assailed from the "orthodox" standpoint. "We recall," says the Journal, "that a few weeks ago the Rev. Lyman Abbott defended democracy while attacking the theory that government exists by consent of the governed. He said that government by the majority of all was right not because of the implied consent of the minority, but because the majority of the people were more likely to act in accordance with divine law than an individual, as in a monarchy, or a class, as in an oligarchy, would be. Now a majority of the people in New York read a Sunday paper. Hence—but we will leave the logical conclusion to the clergy."

A majority of those professing the Christian religion sanction the first day of the week as the Christian Sabbath; and in the absence of any divine sanction for the same, this fact is advanced as convincing proof that Sunday is indeed the true Sabbath. The logic of the Journal in support of the Sunday newspaper is "orthodox," and must be accepted by all who appeal to popular custom in support of the first-day sabbath.
