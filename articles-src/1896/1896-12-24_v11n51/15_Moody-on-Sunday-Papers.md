EVANGELIST D. L. MOODY said, recently, in answer to a query from the New York Journal, that the publication of Sunday newspapers is a violation of the divine commandment to keep holy the Sabbath day. If Mr. Moody had only quoted the text which forbids newspaper publishing or other work on the first day of the week, his reply would have been of intense interest to the whole religious world. But for some reason he omitted to do this,—perhaps because he believes in following a precedent established by other popular preachers. So the public are left to take Mr. Moody's word for it, —unless they are willing to believe that the Creator means just what he says in the Sabbath commandment, viz., that "the seventh day is the Sabbath."
