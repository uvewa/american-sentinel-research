[Reading (Pa.) Herald.]

The clergymen who believe it is meet to turn their pulpits into lecture platforms and proper to convert their sermons into stump speeches were out in full force on Thanksgiving day. They took occasion to gloat over the late Republican victory and to rub it into the poor defeated Democrats in splendid rhetorical periods and rich bursts of eloquence. Some of their hearers, who had gone to church for religious and not political purposes, walked out during the sermonizing, and a good many others were ready to do so.

It would appear that there are still many pulpiteers in this land of the free who find the contents of the Bible too circumscribed, and who must needs seek themes for their effective discourses in other fields. Whatever excuse there may have been in the very unusual campaign that is now happily ended for proclaiming national honor and upholding popular probity in the pulpit, there is no excuse for an offensive partisanship on the minister's part to-day. To haul out the issues of a dead-and-gone campaign, and to flaunt them in the faces of the defeated as a cause of thanksgiving, is neither generous, just, nor prudent. It is decidedly inappropriate. It is entirely unnecessary. It will not advance the cause of Christianity. It cannot help the affairs of the nation.
