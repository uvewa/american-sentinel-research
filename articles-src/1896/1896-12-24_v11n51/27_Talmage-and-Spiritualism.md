In a sermon not long ago Dr. Talmage said that he was not a Spiritualist. His sermon Sunday, December 6, on "Heaven and Its Employments," proves that he is now very much of a Spiritualist. The veil that he mentions in the former sermon as growing thinner and thinner between this world and the spiritual world, will soon be so very thin that he can communicate with his departed friends who, he insists, "are much more alive than they ever were."
