[The Evangel and Sabbath Outlook, Feb. 29, 1896.]

SURE interesting figures as to the condition of the Roman Catholic Church in England, Scotland and Wales are given in the Catholic Mirror of February 8. These figures show that in England and Wales there are seventeen bishops, including the "Vicar Apostolic" of Wales, and in Scotland seven more; the total of priests in Great Britain is 3,014, and they serve 1,700 churches, chapels, and missions. Besides these, there are resident in England one archbishop, and two bishops of titular sees (in partibus). The Catholic faith is professed by 41 peers of England, Scotland, and Ireland, by 53 baronets, by 15 privy councillors, by 3 English and 67 Irish members of Parliament. The estimated Catholic population of the United Kingdom is nearly five millions and a half—namely, England and Wales, 1,500,000; Scotland, 365,000; Ireland (according to the census of 1891), 3,550,000. Inclusive of British North America, Australia, India, and British colonies and other possessions, the total Catholic population of the British Empire is estimated at about ten millions and a quarter. The increase in Scotland is strongly marked. In the chief Scotch city, Glasgow, in the early part of the century, a Catholic church was unknown. Now there are about twenty church edifices, some of which, for size and architectural beauty, will compare with any church in the city.

In Europe and America Roman Catholicism is surely regaining the ground once held by Protestants.
