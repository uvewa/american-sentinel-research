BEFORE another number of the AMERICAN SENTINEL goes to press, five Seventh-day Adventists of Lake County, Tenn., will have been called to answer before the District Court at Tiptonville for violating the statute-entrenched "sabbath" of that State.

It is not denied that these men are honest and conscientious. It is not asserted, except as a legal fiction, that they disturb anybody by their Sunday work. The "annoyance" and "disturbance" held to constitute the "nuisance" for which they are indicted, is confessedly only that mental unrest experienced by every bigoted mind in the presence of dissent from any cherished dogma of religion.

History is simply repeating itself in Tennessee. In some Roman Catholic countries Protestants are required to remove their hats before the "host,"—a bit of consecrated "bread" supposed to have been changed into the body of the Lord. A refusal to do this is held to be a breach of the peace, because it tends to provoke such a breach. In Tennessee Seventh-day Adventists are required by "law" to show a difference they do not feel for a portion of time, namely, the first day of the week, held by the majority to represent the Lord's power, and a refusal to do this is held to be a nuisance, because of the mental annoyance occasioned and because of the "pernicious" example.

Said Judge Hammond in one of these Tennessee Sunday cases:—

Sectarian freedom of religious belief is guaranteed by the Constitution [of Tennessee], not in the sense argued here, that King, as a Seventh-day Adventist, or some other as a Jew, or yet another as a Seventh-day Baptist, might set at defiance the prejudice, if you please, of other sects having control of legislation in the matter of Sunday observance, but only in the sense that he should not himself be disturbed in the practice of his creed.

Again Judge Hammond says:—

The courts cannot change that which has been done, however done, by the civil law in favor of the Sunday observers. The religion of Jesus Christ is so interwoven with the texture of our civilization and every one of its institutions, that it is impossible for any man or set of men to live among us and find exemption from its influences and restraints. Sunday observance is so essentially a part of that religion that it is impossible to rid our laws of it.

Such reasoning reminds one strongly of the "justification" of intolerance in other ages and in other lands. The crucifixion of the Lord Jesus Christ was regarded by the judges of his day as civil necessity. "Jesus," says Prof. George D. Herron, in the Arena for March, "was brought to his death by those accounted the best and wisest of their day; by the religious teachers, and the prudent men of the State. While the Romans consented to his death, that they might be rid of an over-religious troubler and fanatic, the leading Jews demanded his crucifixion for blasphemy and treason. To the political and religious authorities his words had outraged, this death of shame seemed the fit ending of Jesus' life. They nervously thought themselves well done with the man, with their interests conserved and saved."

The persecution of the early Christians was "only enforcing the civil law." The religion of paganism had become so woven into the texture of the then existing civilization that it was impossible for the Christians to live among the Romans and "find exemption from its influences and restraints."

In the emperor was merged the State. He alone represented the divinity of the Roman Empire. The Christians' refusal to recognize in him that divinity or to pay respect to it in any way, was held to be open disrespect to the State. The Christians' denial of the right of the empire to make or enforce any laws touching religion or men's relationship to God, was counted as an undermining of the authority of government. As it was held that religion was essential to the very existence of the State, and that the State for its own sake, for its own self-preservation, must maintain proper respect for religion; when Christianity denied the right of the State to exercise any authority or jurisdiction whatever in religious things, it was held to be but a denial of the right of the empire to preserve itself.

Except in cases of the open violence of the mob, all that was done in any instance by the Roman authorities was to enforce the "law." If the Christians had obeyed the "laws," they never would have been persecuted. But that was the very point at issue. It was not right to obey the "laws." The "laws" were wrong. To obey was to cease to be Christians. To obey was to dishonor God and to deny Christ and consent that mankind should be deprived of the blessing of both civil and religious liberty, as well as to forfeit for themselves eternal life.

If religion be properly a matter of State, and rightfully a subject of legislation, then there never was any such thing as persecution of the Christians. And what is more, there never has been in all history any such thing as persecution on account of religion. If religion be properly a subject of legislation and of law, then it is the right of the State to make any laws it may choose on the subject of religion; and it is its right to attach to these laws whatever penalty will most surely secure proper respect for the religion chosen. And if the legislation be right, if the law be

right, the enforcement of the law under whatever penalty cannot be wrong. Consequently if religion be properly a matter of the State, of legislation, and of law, there never was and there never can be any such thing as persecution on account of religion or for conscience' sake.

But if religion be not a proper subject of legislation, then to enforce a Sunday "law" as the "law" is being enforced in Tennessee, is as truly religious persecution as was enforcing the "law" against the Christians in the Roman Empire.
