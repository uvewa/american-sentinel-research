The March number of the Arena is of exceptional value. Among the articles deserving special mention are "Mexico in Midwinter," by Justice Walter Clark, LL.D.; "The Bond and the Dollar," by John Clark Ridpath, LL.D.; and "Why the South Wants Free Colnage," by Senator Marion Butler. One does not need to agree with the views of the

writers of these articles in order to be benefited by reading them. The money question especially is one of absorbing interest, because of what is involved in it. This country is now passing through a crisis the outcome of which no man can foresee. Senator Butler's article especially is significant as indicating the trend of the times.
