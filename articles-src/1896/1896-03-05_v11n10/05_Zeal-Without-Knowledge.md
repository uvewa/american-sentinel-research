The following proclamation was issued by the Mayor of Bridgeton, N. J., to the people of that city, February 15:—

I, E. Milford Appelgate, Mayor of the City of Bridgeton, believing that every movement in this city tending to elevate the character of our citizens should receive the endorsement not only of the churches and Christian people, but the civic authority as well, and knowing full well, that "righteousness exalteth a nation," and therefore a city, and that "sin is a disgrace to any people," do hereby call upon the citizens of our city, as many as will, to observe Tuesday, Feb. 18, 1896, as a day of universal humiliation for sin and repentance toward God, and that united prayer be made throughout the entire city, that men and women that do wickedly shall turn in this time to God.

I would also ask that between the hours of 2 and 3 P. M., the business men of our city close their doors and resort to a place of prayer and seek that a universal revival shall visit our beloved city.

E. MILFORD APPELGATE, Mayor.
Dated Feb. 15, 1896.

Certainly there can be no objection to a person's seeking the Lord for righteousness, and we do not question the motives of the Mayor of Bridgeton in issuing this proclamation. But good motives and zeal are often accompanied—in religious matters—with little knowledge, for lack of which "the people perish." So it is in the case of this proclamation.

In the first place, Mr. Applegate had no more authority as the Mayor of Bridgeton to issue such a proclamation, than had any private citizen, for the simple reason that no such authority was delegated to him by his election to office. No authority to direct men in religious matters pertains to the office of mayor of a city, or to any civil office whatever. Any assumption to the contrary tends directly toward a union of Church and State.

In the second place, the authority to direct men in religious exercises, and the power to make their efforts successful in the way of seeking him, belongs to God alone. Any such proclamation, to be effective, must be based upon the word of the Lord; that word must be the arousing and convicting power which moves the people in every effective and genuine turning from sin to righteousness. But this proclamation is based simply upon the word of the mayor of the city. We do not say that it will accomplish no good; but it is certainly much better calculated to accomplish harm than good, not only because such an assumption of authority by a civil magistrate tends toward a union of Church and State, but also because it is in keeping with the marked tendency of the times to look to human authority and power for a moral reformation rather than to the authority and power of the Word, and to erect human standards of righteousness in the place of the divine.

What is meant to be the practical effect of the "endorsement" of the "civic authority" is not quite clear; but such endorsement may naturally be supposed to carry with it the force of the civil arm. Otherwise it would be difficult to assign any meaning to it; and certainly it must logically tend in this direction. And this also implies a union of Church and State.
