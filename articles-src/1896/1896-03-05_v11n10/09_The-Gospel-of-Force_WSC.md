BY W. S. CHAPMAN.

Mr. W. F. CRAFTS, in a late Sunday lecture in the city of Wilmington, gave his audience a most complete and forcible illustration of the scope and aim of Sunday legislation. In order to the better impress his ideas, he presented them in story form. He said in substance:—

Barbers are among the best of Sunday-law observers. A little girl said to her father one day: "Father, why do you work seven days in the week? Why do you shave people on Sunday? Why don't you make them all come on six days, so that you can rest the other day?" The idea struck the man to be a pretty good one, and so he at once visited the other five barbers in the place, and suggested the advisability of all closing shop on Sunday. He found four of them willing enough to do this, but the fifth was a black sheep ("there is always a black sheep in every place"). This man said, "Why should I close my place on Sunday? I am no Christian; I never go to church, nor am I interested in religion. I prefer to stay in my shop Sunday—why should I close it? He could not be prevailed upon to close up, so the other five were compelled to keep their places open, or run the risk of losing their customers: because if they closed up and Smith kept open, it would work something like this:—

"A. B. reaches home Saturday evening all tired out with a hard day's work. Off comes his heavy boots, and the tired feet are soon in easy slippers. It is a stormy night, and the rain and hail beat against the window. The man suddenly remembers his must be shaved; he feels very reluctant to going out again that night. It is so stormy and he is so tired; he wishes his barber would work on Sunday—but—'why, there's Smith! he keeps his shop open on Sunday! I'll stay home tonight and have Smith shave me in the morning!'"

Now, according to Mr. Crafts, the remedy for such a state of affairs is in a "civil Sunday law." It is all nonsense, he says, to suppose that Sunday legislation is for the purpose of compelling people to go to church. Its office is purely civil, and he explained the civil character in the balance of his story.

The other five barbers finding persuasion a failure tried coercion. A lawyer unearthed a blue law—"that grand watch-dog"—against work on Sunday, and set the "dog" (the law) on the man, quickly bringing him to terms. Now all six barbers have a chance to rest on the "sabbath" day.

Such is the gospel of force which Mr. Crafts presents in the name of Jesus. He appeals to his audience, not from the standpoint of the love of God, but from the selfish position of personal gain. Others are to be forced to remain idle rather than his business interests shall suffer. What is an honorable pursuit on any other day of the week is to be declared a crime on Sunday.

Thus a premium is to be placed on idleness, and the American people become a nation of hypocrites, forced, by the terror of the law, to yield an outward and unwilling observance to a dogma of the Papacy.

Paul sought to win men by presenting the love of God, so melting their hearts, thus making them obedient. Mr. Crafts would gather the multitude to his side and then set "watch-dogs" (Sunday laws) upon the little minority, compelling them, through fear, to yield their conscience up to his dictation. According to Mr. Crafts, minorities have no rights. Personal liberty he ridicules as an absurdity. He compared a man crying for personal rights to a foreigner coming to this country, and because he had heard it was the land of the free, impudently bumping himself against another man's nose, the result being that he is knocked down. The man bumped against represented the majority; the man felled by the blue the minority. The saddest feature of the whole lecture was the evident fact that the lecturer seemed to be carrying the sympathies of his audience with him. Many an honest soul is being deluded by these sophistries, and aiding this wicked scheme to deprive us of our civil and religious liberty.
