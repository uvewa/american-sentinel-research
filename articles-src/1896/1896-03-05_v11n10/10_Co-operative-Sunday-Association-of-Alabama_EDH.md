BY E. D. HASSELL.

The American Sabbath Union has at last extended its work to the State of Alabama. An auxiliary organization has been formed with the name that heads this communication. In response to a call sent out by the vice-president of the American Sabbath Union, representing Alabama, a gathering of forces for Sunday protection and enforcement took place at the First Presbyterian Church, of Montgomery, the capital city of the State, on the night of February 20.

Dr. E. P. Davis, pastor of this church and also the official mentioned above, presided at the meeting. The address of the evening was upon "The necessity of the Lord's day, as a day of rest and worship," by Bishop H. M. Jackson, of the Episcopal Church. Some of his positions would delight the most ardent National Reformer. His highest ideal was a union of Church and State with the principles of "Christianity" permeating and controlling every department of government. It was even of greater importance, he said, for the government to place a quarantine protection about the soul, than to guard the physical life of its citizens. It was absolutely necessary to have a day for rest and worship set apart by the government, and the day of the vast majority must be selected.

Following this address, the work of organization was attended to. The basis and object of the association was read, which was a transcript of that adopted by the parent society. All who could conscientiously indorse these principles were eligible to membership. The enrollment of members went actively and smoothly forward, until the Episcopal rector, Dr. Powers, inquired somewhat more fully into the purposes of the society. It was apparent that the objectionable features were to be kept back, if possible. He was told that the details were left to the individual conscience, and nothing was designed to infringe upon the rights of conscience. As soon as it was ascertained that the society expected to exert its influence to legislative halls, he stated that he could not cooperate with them.

This was one surprise, but a greater one was to follow.

Dr. Geo. B. Eager, pastor of the First Baptist Church, arose to declare his position. He agreed with Dr. Powers that legislation cannot improve the morals, and declared that he could not indorse the political methods of the American Sabbath Union to secure sabbath observance. Election of officers followed, and were pretty well divided among the various denominations.

The next morning the second meeting was held with a slim attendance. Two addresses were delivered; the first by Rev. F. F. Mangum, D. D., of the Methodist Episcopal Church, on "The Lord's Day Divine in its Origin and Permanence," and the other by Rev. J. P. Morgan, of the Protestant Methodist Church, on the "Sabbath and the Family."

As stated on the programs, an opportunity was given for discussion of the subjects presented, and Dr. Eager was on his feet at once. It was then discovered that the discussion was confined to members of the association, unless permission was given. By vote, Dr. Eager was granted an opportunity to speak, though one dissenting voice was plainly heard. He stated that he could not become a member, because of some propositions in their basis of organization, which declared that the Sabbath was of universal and perpetual obligation, and that the authority of the fourth commandment was "transferred to the Christian sabbath or Lord's day, by Christ and the apostles." This he declared was an assumption, and had been reiterated by the various speakers. The Sabbath ended at the cross,* and the Lord's day was a distinct institution, not deriving its authority from the Decalogue. He challenged any one to produce scriptural proof of a change of the Sabbath from the seventh to the first day of the week. In the apostles' times, and during the first century, both days were kept, but gradually the observance of the Sabbath ceased. If they stood on the assumption of the binding authority of the Decalogue, they were inconsistent, and could not meet the position of the Seventh-day Adventists. He delivered some telling blows against the religious legislation methods of the society.

Referring to the Church-and-State theory presented the night before, Dr. Eager said that there was hardly a meeting of this kind, but what there was some one to present just such ideas, which indicated the drift and tendency of the movement. Already the halls of Congress and State legislatures had been entered by representatives of the American Sabbath Union, and a standing committee or lobby was kept at Washington to influence legislation in accordance with their plans. This was a course which, if pursued, would place this country in the hands of the Catholics, and restore the Inquisition. For himself, he was not willing to take one backward step in that direction, nor give up one jot or tittle of the precious boon of freedom of conscience. This sabbath legislation was asking

* The SABBATH cannot agree with Dr. Eager in this proposition. "The Sabbath was made for man," i.e., for the race, "and for the facts of creation, and strives of directions from the fourth commandment. Being enjoined in the Decalogue it must exist as long as they are exists; and of the divine code, Art. 5 of the "Baptist Manual" says: "The law of God is the eternal and unchangeable rule of his moral government; and it is the one great end of the gospel to bring fallen man into unfingered obedience to his God's; holy does the Earth follow." That the Sabbath will not pass away even with the end of the present world is evident from a comparison of Isa. 66:22, 23, with 3 Factor 3:10-13.

Rev. J. H. so generally relied upon to prove Sunday sacredness, does indeed show that the Lord has in this dispensation a day which he calls his own. But that it is not Sunday is easily shown. Following the Protestant rule of interpreting the Scriptures, explaining each text by other and clearer texts, we are not left in doubt upon this question, of imparting Ex. 30:8-11 with Isa. 58:13, and Mark 2:23, only one conclusion is possible, namely, that the Sabbath of the Old Testament, the seventh day, is the Lord's day of the new. — EUCOM.

Congress to settle a religious controversy, for there was quite a class of citizens who kept the seventh day, and the government had no right to recognize the sabbath of one class more than another. He mentioned the Hebrews and Seventh-day Baptists, and said that some of the Seventh-day Adventist brethren were present listening to all their arguments. He was in favor of promoting observance of the Lord's day in the family, in the church, and in society at large, but not by the unlawful and unchristian method of civil legislation.

Some little time was taken up in discussion by different ones, and for a short while it seemed that confusion would reign, but order was restored. The secretary, a Baptist minister, from an adjoining town, stated his position just before leaving, as duties called him away. He thought there was plenty of work without going to the legislatures, and he hoped their labors would be crowned with such success that they would not need to ask for the aid of civil laws.

The closing meeting was held that night. The principal address was to have been about the "Sabbath and Civil Law," by Rev. A. J. Dickinson, an able Baptist minister from Selma. This was looked forward to with considerable interest, but he did not come. Rev. John Barbour, a Presbyterian divine from Birmingham, considered the subject, "The Sabbath or the Saloon—Which?"

In his closing remarks, the president expressed his pleasure concerning the work that had been accomplished, and thought that the association was started on its career with bright prospects and a hopeful outlook.

Thus Alabama joins the ranks with other States to promulgate the religion of force instead of the gospel of love and persuasion; and the outcome will surely be persecution, a trampling upon the rights of conscience of the minority, and the restoration of the Papacy, or a formation of its living image.

It is cheering to hear some raise a note of warning, and it is time for defenders of liberty to speak forth boldly and plainly, that the people may see the dangers that are rapidly gathering right in their midst, and be prepared for the solemn but inevitable issue.

Now is the time for all true Protestants to show their colors and not hesitate in exposing the evils that will result from Church and State union, which is being brought about by the various sabbath associations of the land.
