[From the World of Feb. 28. For editorial comment we last page of this paper.]

ALBANY, Feb. 27.—The great petition of the German-American Citizens' Union, containing 115,000 names, in favor of the Chamber of Commerce bill to submit to a vote of the people of cities of the first class the question of Sunday opening, was presented to the Legislature to-day.

Among the New Yorkers present were Rev. Dr. W. S. Rainaford, rector of St. George's Church; Rev. Dr. J. H. Rylance, rector of St. Mark's Church; Carl Schurz, Gustav Schwab, President Jeroloman, of the Board of Aldermen, and Thomas A. Fulton.

John B. Pannes, President of the German-American Citizens' Union, said that the petition represented the wishes of a cosmopolitan and heterogeneous people, who were different in creed and in habit from the people of other parts of the State.

Dr. Rainaford denied that the opening of

saloons on Sunday was a moral wrong. The charge that it was a violation of religious principles was, he said, ignorant and misleading. The dwellers of the tenements needed places to meet on Sunday, and it was ignoring their needs to close the saloons, for they have no better places to go. The majority of educated Christian men were coming to the belief that they cannot get the tenement people to go to church by closing the saloons.

In closing Dr. Rainaford said:

"If by holding up my finger I could close every saloon in New York City on Sunday, I would not raise it. You are making criminals by the present system."

Mr. Schurz said it was not a question of business, but a question of justice to the common people. He predicted that the police would in one year relax from the nervous strain under which they were now working.

Dr. Rylance said in part:

"By the present system you are making infidels. The poor people want none of the religion that is not based on equal privileges to rich and poor. The Decalogue has nothing to do with the laws of Jesus Christ to-day."

Mr. Fulton announced that Dr. Parkhurst and R. Fulton Cutting approved the bill, except that they wanted to forbid the selling of distilled liquors on Sunday.

The opponents of Sunday opening will be given a hearing.
