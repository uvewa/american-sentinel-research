We have not yet heard the outcome of the case against Ira Babcock, of Lego, N. C., for Sunday work, but have learned some facts concerning it which are of interest.

The complaint upon which Mr. Babcock was arrested was as follows:—

Ira Babcock did unlawfully, willfully violate the Lord's day, commonly called Sunday, by working and mowing down weeds, and cutting brush in the woods, riving boards, cutting wood, burning brush along a church road along which persons went and came to religious worship, and said work was done in sight of the church and in hearing distance thereof. So that being a continual violation of the sabbath contrary to the form and dignity of the statute in such cases made and provided, and against the peace and dignity of the State.

Sworn to before me the 15th day of January, 1896.
J. A. FULSELLY, J. P.

Deft. bound over to Court.

The facts are that the work complained of was done ever one hundred rods from any public road. There is, however, a foot-path through the farm which is used to quite an extent. The church mentioned in the complaint is one hundred and ten rods from where the work was done.

The defendant really did only a part of the work charged. Three witnesses testified before the justice of the peace that they saw him riving boards* on Sunday. The fact is that the young man never made a board in his life.

The defendant, however, worked on Sunday and does not deny it. But it is an open question whether there is any statute in North Carolina prohibiting ordinary labor on Sunday. There is, however, a statute against disturbing public worship, and when this case turned up in the Circuit Court it was found that the charge had been changed, and the indictment, instead of being for Sunday work, charges that the defendant "on the twelfth day of January, in the year of our Lord, 1895, with force and arms, at and in the county aforesaid, did willfully and unlawfully interrupt and disturb a certain assembly of people there met for divine worship, within the place of said meeting, to wit, at Hickory Grove, in the said county, by cutting weeds, burning brush, making boards, mowing weeds, working and making a loud noise near and in sight of said church, contrary to the form of statute in such cases made and provided and against the peace and dignity of the State."

That one man should do not only in one day, but during the short time occupied by a religious meeting all the work charged in this indictment is absurd, and shows very plainly the animus of the prosecution. As before stated, the original charge was not disturbing public worship, but violating the "Lord's day." But inasmuch as it is doubtful if any such charge as that could be maintained under the North Carolina statute, when it was brought into the District Court, the charge is that of disturbing public worship, by work done one hundred and ten rods from the place of meeting!
