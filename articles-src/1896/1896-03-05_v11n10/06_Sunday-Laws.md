[The Bible Echo, Melbourne, Australia.]

On account of the many prosecutions and imprisonments of conscientious observers of the Bible Sabbath in the United States of late, under the various Sunday laws existing there, the Christian Intelligencer urges that there should be an "immediate revision" of these laws, and "a clause added exempting from penalty all persons who observe the seventh day of the week as a day of rest and worship." But no such general revision or addition is likely to be made. More than this, if the laws were just, none such would need to be made. No one should be exempted from just laws. The fact that Sunday laws, when enforced, come in conflict with the conscientious convictions of God-fearing men, is sufficient proof of their character. Conscience and the fear of God lead men to keep the law of God, and laws which interfere with such men must themselves be opposed to the law of God.
