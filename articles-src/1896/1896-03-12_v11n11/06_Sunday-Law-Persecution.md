We have received from the International Religious Liberty Association a tabulated statement of the cases of the prosecution of Seventh-day Adventists under Sunday "laws" of the various States and countries from 1878 and to the present time.

The following is the number of Sabbatarians arrested for Sunday work each year:—

|  Years. | Arrests. | Cases.  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  1878 | 3 | 3  |
|  1880 | 1 | 1  |
|  1882 | 2 | 2  |
|  1885 | 9 | 9  |
|  1886 | 16 | 16  |
|  1889 | 3 | 3  |
|  1892 | 11 | 11  |
|  1895 | 11 | 14  |
|  1894 | 23 | 31  |
|  1895 | 47 | 62  |
|  1896 | 5 | 5  |
|  Total, | 131 | Total, 157  |

The following States have been or are involved in this inquisitous business:—

Alabama, Arkansas,
California, Florida,
Georgia, Illinois,
Maryland, Massachusetts,
Michigan, Mississippi,
North Carolina, Ohio,
Pennsylvania, Tennessee,
Texas.

The foreign countries in which arrests have occurred are England, Switzerland, New South Wales, Manitoba, and Ontario.

The total number of cases in foreign countries are 17, leaving 130 occurring in the United States. At this writing nine cases are pending in the lower courts. One hundred and sixteen cases have been brought to trial; 27 have been dropped before trial on account of exemption clauses; in five cases no arrests were made; in two or three instances the indicted parties had removed to other States before the indictments were secured; in one or two instances, only the surname was given and the warrants were never served because they were too indefinite. Of the 116 cases brought to trial 109 resulted in conviction. Four cases have been dropped after conviction; twenty-five have been appealed to higher courts.

In three cases occurring in Australia the sentence was the payment of a fine, or in default to sit in the public stocks. These fines were never paid and the sentences were never carried out because the authorities had no stocks.

The total fines and costs in these cases amount to $3,269.69; total number of days served in prison, 1,438; days served in chain-gangs, 445. "As a result of the hardships endured in confinement," says the report, "the death of two men was hastened, and several have not recovered from the effects of bad food and ill-treatment."

In a very large majority of these cases the work complained of was of such a nature that it could not possibly afford anybody just ground for complaint. It was not work that involved anybody else or required anybody else to labor; nor was it work that interfered in any way with the rest or quiet of other people. For the most part it has been farm work done by individuals upon their own premises, and in a large number of the cases, was only observed by those who made it their business to spy upon the Adventists.

But notwithstanding these facts some deny that these prosecutions are in any sense religious persecution. The claim is that it "is only enforcing the law." But, as the AMERICAN SENTINEL has repeatedly stated, with the exception of isolated cases of mob violence, that is all religious persecution has ever been. The persecution of the Christians under the Roman Empire was only the enforcement of civil "law." Indeed some of the Roman governors and emperors were as reluctant to enforce the "laws" against the Christians as are some of the judges and sheriffs in the United States to-day. But they held that the "law" must be enforced, just as kind and "good-hearted" men hold to-day in the United States and in other countries.

The trouble is with such "laws." Statutes that can be used as engines of persecution ought to be repealed or declared void by the courts as they are in fact. It is a well-established principle of law that rights do not originate with the State or with the Government; and that they exist independently of statutes; and that when any pretended law invades natural right it is void in the very nature of the case.

That statutes which imprison honest men for doing honest labor, and that interfere with the rights of any person, are unjust and oppressive, must be evident to every man who will honestly put himself for a few moments in the position of one who is thus prosecuted. Let the ardent Sunday-keeper imagine the conditions reversed; let him imagine himself required by statute to rest habitually upon some day not regarded by him as sacred, and he will certainly conclude, if he is honest with himself, that such a regulation is unjust; and that as far as law can properly go is to forbid anything that interferes with the equal rights of others. And that is all the Adventists of the United States and other countries demand. They do not ask exclusive privileges, but they claim equal rights.
