The Western Watchman, a Roman Catholic paper of St. Louis, says:—

If we mistake not, the House will give the Catholic Indian schools their appropriation just as it gave the Catholic institutions of the Capital theirs. Some members of the House, mostly A. P. A.s, are fools all the time; all the members are off a little sometimes; but the whole House will not stay crazy all the time.

It seems hardly likely that this prediction will be realized. The element in Congress opposed to such appropriations is too strong. The Catholics will probably have to support their own denominational Indian schools in the future.
