"WHAT strange and wicked use," remarks a London paper, "of the word Christian is being made. A dispatch tells this news of a disturbance in Crete. Some Christians murdered two Turks. In revenge some Turks murdered two Christian families. 'As soon as the news was known the Christians of neighboring villages assembled and attacked the Turks.'"
