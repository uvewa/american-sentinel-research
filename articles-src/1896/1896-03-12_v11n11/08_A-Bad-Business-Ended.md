ATTEMPTS have been made during the last few years to stop the appropriation of moneys from the United States Treasury for the support of sectarian schools among the Indians. It would seem that at length these efforts are successful. On Monday, February 24, the House of Representatives ordered, by a vote of 93 to 64, that all appropriations for such schools be stricken from the Indian appropriation bill. This shows that less than one-half of the full House (356) voted, but it is not likely that the Senate will disturb the decision of the House, or that the majority will be changed by any subsequent action. The vote was taken directly on the merits of the question, after frequent discussions through a series of years, and it will stand. It is a happy ending of a long dispute, which ought never to have been raised.

Under the wise and forward movement in dealing with the Indians, started by General Grant's "peace policy," various Christian denominations were asked to assist in educating the Indian youth. In many cases the Christian schools were already established, and the Government availed itself of them in its educational work, assigning pupils to them from the reservations, and paying so much per capita for the pupils, or in lump sums to the managers of the schools. The evils of the system soon became manifest, and the public sentiment of the country began to show itself against this form of union between Church and State—the use of public funds for the support of sectarian schools. From the beginning the Roman Catholics received the lion's share of these appropriations, and they worked the scheme for all it was worth. From 1886 to 1895 (ten years) the sums appropriated for these "contract schools," as they were called, amounted to $4,767,436, of which the Roman Catholics received no less than $3,100,060, while all others, representing fifteen denominations and some private institutions, received only $1,667,000. The Roman Catholics were so eager and insolent that they hurt their own cause, and thus indirectly aided in effecting its overthrow.

Gen. T. J. Morgan, when he was Commissioner of Indian Affairs, took the ground that these appropriations for sectarian Indian schools should be diminished as rapidly as possible, and wholly cease at the earliest practicable day, the Government meanwhile to provide schools of its own for all Indian children, after the pattern of the common schools of the country. This policy, bitterly antagonized by the Roman Catholics, has now been formally indorsed by the House of Representatives.

The autumn conferences of the "Friends of the Indians" at Lake Mobonk did much to crystallize and solidify a true public sentiment on this subject. In successive years their "platform" approached a clear and unequivocal utterance, until finally it was affirmed that no Christian denomination should receive public funds for its mission schools among the Indians. No one who was present will soon forget the scene when, after long and high debate, this resolution was moved by a noble Quake seconded by an Episcopalian Bishop, and sustained in a strong and fervid speech by an eminent Methodist.

Nearly two years ago (June 7, 1894), when the Indian appropriation bill was before the House of Representatives, Hon. William S. Linton, of Michigan, sought to have the appropriations for these sectarian schools stricken out. He pleaded strongly, and set forth an array of cogent facts in support of his argument, but he was defeated by a vote 158 to 58 (136 not voting). Afterward the Secretary of the Interior was directed to reduce expenditures upon contract schools by twenty per cent. of the sum thus expended in the previous year, until such schools should become extinct. Mr. Linton has bided his time. Two years ago he told the House that they would not dare to neglect the warnings that were abroad. They rejected his advice then, but they have given heed to it now. It was on his motion that, on Monday of last week, the appropriations for contract schools were stricken from the bill, and an amendment inserted prohibiting the Secretary of the Interior from spending any of the money appropriated for education in a sectarian institution. All Protestant denominations had withdrawn their requests for such aid, or, like the Baptists, had never asked it.* The Roman Catholics stood alone in continuing the demand, and asked for more than $250,000 from the public treasury for the current year. Sixty-four members of the House were willing to give it to them, but the system is dead.

The duty of the Christian churches to the Indians now become more imperative than ever. These "wards of the Nation" must not suffer because righteousness has prevailed in Congress. The Government will, in some form, provide secular education for all; but evangelistic work, and all to which it leads, must be pressed with redoubled energy.

* We are sorry that it is so; but facts compel us to state that the Baptists did for a time, through Henry L. Morehouse, of this city, Secretary of the American Baptist Home Missionary Society, receive money from the American Baptist for the support of denominational schools. Mr. Frank C. Armstrong, Assistant Commissioner of Indian Affairs, replying to an inquiry upon this subject, Sept. 15, 1894, said:—

"I find records of contracts from the year 1879 to 1884, between this office and Henry L. Morehouse, of New York City, Secretary of the American Baptist Home Missionary Society, for the Freedmen of the Choctaw and Chickasaw Indians, in the Indian Territory, as follows:—

"In 1879, 6 day schools at $80.3 for six months.

"In 1882, 1 boarding school and 8 day schools at $2,250.

"In 1885, 1 boarding and 8 day schools at $2,750.

"In 1886, 4 day schools at $750, and again in the same year for 5 schools at $1,300.

It is true these sums are small and were not for Indian schools, but that does not alter the principle in the least. The fact remains that the Baptists received public money for denominational schools, and the proper thing for them is to candidly own it.—Evrens Davronn.
