A RELIGIOUS paper, not intentionally hostile to the principle of separation of Church and State, recently published a question from a subscriber, which, with the answer, may be of interest to the readers of the SENTINEL.

The subscriber asked, "What right has the President of the United States, or the governors, to appoint days of thanksgiving?" and adds, "Is not that so much of union of Church and State?" In reply the editor says:—

The above almost reminds us of the saying that some people stand up so straight that they lean over backward. What wrong would there be, we wonder, in the President's, or any one else's, suggesting a day of special thanksgiving? Those proclamations are only suggestions. Those who observe Thanksgiving day in a proper spirit do so not in obedience to the behest of the State, but because thanksgiving and praise belong to God, and certainly nothing would be more fitting than to see a whole community uniting in giving thanks to God for mercies and blessings received. And there is no one who can more appropriately suggest the day than the man who stands at the head of the community. The laws of our country compel no one to observe the day; it is wholly voluntary, and, to our mind, is quite an appropriate institution, if it be observed in a proper way.

The above editorial contains food for much careful thought.

1. It is most certainly our duty and privilege to render praise and thanksgiving to God. And it is well for the people to unite at specified times in these exercises. But why should the President of the United States make the appointment? Why should he be regarded as the religious "head of the community"? If politics and religion are not mixed, if Church and State are not united, why should political power or civil authority place a man at the "head of the community" in religious affairs and exercises?

The answer to these questions is obvious. To say that a man should appoint a day of thanksgiving because he "stands at the head of the community" is to assert that he "stands at the head of the community" in a religious sense. And to say that he stands thus because he is president or governor, is to assert that civil and religious influence and authority belong together; but this is union of Church and State.

2. But it is said, "Those who observe Thanksgiving day in a proper spirit, do so not in obedience to the behest of the State," etc. Then nobody observes it properly save those who have heard nothing about the appointment, or, having heard, have paid no attention to it. For whoever adopts a certain day because of the President's official announcement, is certainly observing the day in obedience to the behest of the State. If people do not observe the day in obedience to the behest of the State, why is it that they always happen(?) to select the same day the State has appointed? There was nothing in nature or revelation which indicated Thursday, November 28, 1895, as a day of special thanksgiving, yet in all parts of the country many laid aside their work on that day; and it would not be far from the truth to say that all who did so were led to that act by the President of the United States. Guided solely by their desire to worship God, they would have been as likely to have selected any other day as to select the one appointed by the State.

3. But "those proclamations are only suggestions." On this point, Thomas Jefferson says:—

I consider the Government of the United States as interdicted by the Constitution from intermeddling with religious institutions, their doctrines, discipline, or exercises.

But it is only proposed that I should recommend, not prescribe, a day of fasting and prayer. That is, that I should indirectly assume to the United States an authority over religious exercises, which the Constitution has directly precluded from them.

It must be meant, too, that this recommendation is to carry some authority, and to be sanctioned by some penalty on those who disregard it; not, indeed of fine and imprisonment, but of some degree of proscription, perhaps in public opinion. And does the change in the nature of the penalty make the recommendation less a law of conduct for those to whom it is directed?

It would be useless to ask the chief executive officer of the State to make such an appointment unless his words were intended to carry some weight. At present the penalty may seem light, but it is, nevertheless, a penalty. The man who refuses to give respectful attention to the "suggestion" of the chief representative of the people, will be "peculiar," "unpatriotic," "fanatical," "too straight in the back," etc., etc. And he will soon become aware of the fact that the community would treat him more cordially if he would act like other people.

4. At the present time the National Reform Association is laboring energetically to secure an amendment to our National Constitution which shall acknowledge Jesus Christ as ruler of this nation and the Bible as the supreme law, thus placing "all Christian laws, institutions, and usages on an undeniable legal basis in the fundamental law of the land." This can result in nothing less than a complete union of Church and State, and the people, instead of reading the Bible for themselves and receiving the interpretation which God by his Spirit impresses upon their minds, will be compelled by law to accept human interpretations, and thus to follow man instead of God.

These so-called reformers claim that there has always been a union existing between religion and the Government, but that there has been practically no acknowledgement of the fact in the Constitution. This acknowledgement they are working to secure; and they have been so far successful that the bill for the proposed amendment is actually before Congress at the present time. And one of the proofs which they bring to show that the Government is already religious, and that they therefore have an historical basis for their movement, is the fact that Thanksgiving proclamations are annually issued by the President of the United States. It can not be denied that this basis has existed and does exist; but there are those who protest against both the wicked proceeding of the "reformers" and the basis upon which it rests.

The reader will call to mind how very tolerant and generous was Constantine when he began to make official suggestions about Christian observances and doctrines, but these suggestions soon became stern commands backed up by terrible penalties.

The camel of Church and State has for some time been thrusting his nose into our National Tabernacle in the form of Thanksgiving proclamations, army chaplaincies, appropriations of money to religious societies, etc., and he now claims the right not only to walk in bodily, but to receive ample recognition in the National Constitution. He should not be tolerated in the slightest degree. It is impossible to stand up too straight on this subject.
