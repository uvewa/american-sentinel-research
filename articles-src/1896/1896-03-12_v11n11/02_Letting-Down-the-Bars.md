The demand on the part of many styling themselves Protestant, that the state should teach religion in its schools, opens the way for a counter demand from the Roman Catholics that the state should bear the expense of all the secular instruction given in their schools. And one demand is as consistent and can be urged with as much propriety and with as much force as the other. And this latter demand is being urged. A Catholic despision, which waited on Lord Salisbury the first week in December, declared that Roman Catholics would never rest until the whole expense of the secular education of their schools was borne by the state. When Protestants begin to mix up secular and religious affairs, and demand the assistance of the state in teaching religion, they are letting down the bars, and they must not be surprised if others follow where they have led the way.
