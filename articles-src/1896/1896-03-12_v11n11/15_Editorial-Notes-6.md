FEBRUARY 21st, Rev. C. J. Oehschlaeger (Lutheran), of Richmond, Va., was invited by the State Assembly, through its clerk, to officiate as chaplain for the House for the day. He declined the invitation, saying:—

I do not believe in opening a promiscuous political body with prayer. The promiscuous character of the body makes it an abuse of prayer, and the political character of the body makes it an unnatural union of Church and State. I, as a Christian, and any member of the body as a Christian, can privately pray for the sessions, but the State which that body represents has nothing to do with prayer.

If there were more ministers with the good sense of Mr. Oehschlaeger, there would be less of governmental religion and probably more personal piety in the world.
