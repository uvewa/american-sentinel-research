MARCH 2, the House District Committee gave a hearing on the Sunday rest bill. This bill, introduced by Mr. Morse, of Massachusetts, provides:—

That on the first day of the week, known as the Lord's day, set apart by general consent in accordance with divine appointment as a day of rest and worship, it shall be unlawful to perform labor, except works of necessity and mercy, and work by those who religiously observe Saturday, if performed in such a way as not to involve or disturb others; also to open places of business or traffic, except in the case of drug stores for the dispensing of medicines; also to make contracts or transact other commercial business; also to engage in noisy assessments or amusements for gain, or entertainments for which admittance fees are charged; also to perform any court service, except in connection with arrests of criminals and service of process to prevent fraud.

Sec. 2. That the penalty for violating any provision of this act shall be a fine of not less than $10 for the first offense; for second or subsequent offenses, a fine not exceeding $50 and imprisonment for not less than ten nor more than thirty days, and one year's forfeiture of license, if any is held by the offender or his employer.

Sec. 3. That this act shall take effect upon its passage.

This bill was referred to the commissioners of the District of Columbia, who, after granting a hearing upon it, refused to recommend it for passage.

Its friends then besieged the District Committee of the House, who granted a hearing of two hours, the time to be divided equally between the friends and the opponents of the measure. This arrangement did not suit the advocates of the bill, however, and they were conspicuous alone by their absence. It is said, however, that they will demand another and a secret hearing.

## The Bill Religious.

House bill No. 167, said its opponents, provides "that on the first day of the week, known as the Lord's day, set apart by general consent in accordance with divine appointment as a day of rest and worship, it shall be unlawful to perform labor," etc. If the claim herein set forth, they argued, is well founded, this is the best reason in the world why the Congress of the United States should have nothing whatever to do with it. Can man add anything to that which is divinely appointed? The most that man has ever done is to mar the work of God. Should not we be content with absolute liberty, such as all enjoy who choose to observe Sunday? If the day is divinely appointed, God is able to protect his own day, and the Government may safely confine itself to the business of regulating civil things.

It was to keep legislation within the sphere of things civil that the founders of this Republic put in the First Amendment this prohibition: "Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof." The bill under consideration is clearly in conflict with this provision of the fundamental law, in that it both proposes a religious establishment and prohibits the free exercise of religion. It proposes to establish a day of rest and divine worship for one class, and prohibits to all who dissent from this establishment, the free exercise of the God-given right to worship according to their conscientious convictions. If this bill is enacted into law, the proscribed class will be completely at the mercy of the believers in the established Sunday, and they may deal with them as they see fit.

## A Guarantee of Absolute Freedom in Matters of Religion.

If the provisions of the Constitution and the First Amendment mean anything to the American people and the world, they are a guarantee of absolute freedom in matters of religion, so long as that freedom does not lead to incivility. The bill under consideration is essentially a violation of this principle. It proposes to place in the hands of one religious party the power to determine just how much or how little labor may be performed by another religious party on a day regarded as sacred by the one and not by the other, although the labor or acts are not crimes in themselves. It proposes also to place it within the power of the favored class and the courts to judge of the religious character of the person to be exempted, thus giving to this favored class a complete monopoly in religious matters.

## A Difference Between Liberty and Toleration.

Dr. Schaff, in his book, "Progress of Religious Freedom," wisely says: "There is a wide difference between toleration and liberty. The one is a concession and the other is a right; the one is a matter of expediency and the other is a principle; the one is the gift of man the other the gift of God." In a free country nobody wants to be tolerated for his religious opinions, or sacred convictions. "Toleration is an intermediate state between religious persecution and religious liberty." Religious liberty is founded in the sacredness of conscience, which is the voice of God. Liberty of conscience requires liberty of worship as its manifestation.

## Toleration Presupposes an Establishment of Religion.

An act of toleration always presupposes an establishment of religion by law, and the right of the State to control public worship. Toleration may proceed from necessity or from policy, and may be withdrawn at the will of the State, or when the necessity for it ceases to exist. The American idea is that "all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness." This is infinitely above the sentiment that prevails in the Old World, and unfortunately finds supporters in the New, that liberty is only for the favored few, all others being proscribed or tolerated according to the liberality of the party in power.

There never was a community in which uniformity of religious sentiment existed.

## False Zeal in Religion.

has always led men to seek the power of the State to enforce their opinion upon those holding different views. The State should punish crime by whomever committed, but the State has no right to create crime out of that which is laudable in itself, because the act or thing is done on time by some regarded sacred.

Since the United States declared for absolute religious freedom, it has exerted an influence upon all the nations of the earth, and the tendency has been toward that high and exalted principle. But if this greatest of all nations shall relinquish that which above all has made her great, then she will lose her moral power over the nations, and like the states of South America will descend to the level of other Church and State governments.

## The American System is a Free Church in a Free State.

This is the American solution of the problem of ages. Not one of the governments of the Old World ever rose higher than the theory of toleration. De Tocqueville, the French statesman, said of America, "There is no country in the whole world in which the Christian religion retains a greater influence over the souls of men than in America." All this is the result of the fact that religion is free and not forced. "The church needs, and should ask nothing from the state; . . . she commends herself best to the world by attending to her proper spiritual duties, and keeping aloof from political and secular complications." "She can only lose by force and violence, she can only gain and succeed by spiritual weapons of truth and love." He is no true friend of his country, who would wish to see the religious freedom guaranteed by the Constitution narrowed in its operations, or who would favor any measure tending to such result.

Such were the arguments in substance urged before the committee, and it is believed that they were not without weight and that a majority of the committee is not favorable to the bill.
