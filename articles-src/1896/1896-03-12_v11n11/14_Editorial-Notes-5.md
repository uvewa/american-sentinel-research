MARCH 4, Archbishop Kenrick, one of the most widely-known Roman Catholic prelates in the United States, died at St. Louis in the ninetieth year of his age. Archbishop Kenrick was one of the two members of the Vatican Council of 1870, who opposed the dogma of papal infallibility. It is said that but for his opposition to the will of the papacy upon that occasion, he would have been made a cardinal in November, 1892, "as a crowning feature of the golden jubilee of his election to the bishopric." A very able argument against papal infallibility has been published, and is said to have been delivered by Archbishop Kenrick before the Vatican Council. This, however, has been denied. As some of our readers doubtless remember, this matter was published in these columns, Aug. 30, Sept. 6, and Sept. 13, 1894, but only upon its merits. We have no reliable information as to its authorship.
