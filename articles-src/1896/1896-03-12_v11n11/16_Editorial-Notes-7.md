MARCH 4, a hearing was given by a committee of the Senate at Albany on bills for Sunday opening of saloons in New York. A number of ministers and other representatives of the religious forces of the city were present and protested against the passage of any such measure.

Col. Benjamin F. Watson, Chairman of the Legislative Committee of the Church Temperance Society, said he was pained to hear no mention of God and his commandments by the clerical gentlemen who favored the bill. The fourth commandment, "Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy," has something to do with the government. Will you abolish the fourth commandment in the interest of liquor sellers?

Colonel Watson did not attempt to show wherein the fourth commandment applies to Sunday; he only assumed that liquor-selling was worse on Sunday than on other days; that it was a violation of the law of God on Sunday, and of course by necessary inference it is perfectly legitimate and moral upon other days! It is thus that arguments for Sunday-closing exalt the saloon by making it respectable and even necessary in itself, and evil only on Sunday.
