Another religious measure before the New York Legislature is a bill introduced by Senator MacNulty, of Brooklyn, prohibiting on Sundays "performances of plays, operas or minstrels, whether in costume or not; also, monologs or singing, except in religious ceremonies." Commenting upon this measure the World says:—

This would prevent the recitation of the Declaration of Independence on Sunday, or the singing in public of the noblest music by the greatest singer, "except in religious ceremonies."

Another New York paper suggests that "a law providing that the citizen should each week pay to the church one-seventh of his earnings would give us only another phase of the robbery that is contemplated by Sunday laws and perpetrated under their sanction. If the workman and business man were compelled to labor on Sunday and give that day's wages to the ministers, the iron would enter a little deeper, perhaps, than it does now, but they would have just as much money for the week's exertion as now when they are forbidden to earn any on that day. It might be better, on the whole, if the church took its one-seventh in that manner, for then, not having a day of idleness before them on the morrow, fewer laborers would squander their week's wages in dissipation on Saturday night."
