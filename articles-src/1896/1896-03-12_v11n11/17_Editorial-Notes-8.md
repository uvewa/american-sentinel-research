The first Congregational Church at Lowell, Mass., is in trouble and is trying to get the legislature of the State to settle some of its difficulties. Recently some of the gentlemen connected with it went before the legislature asking to have a bill passed regulating the membership of the church. This bill, as printed in the Lowell Citizen, of February 28, runs as follows:—

Hereafter any member of the First Congregational Church of Lowell, Mass., above the age of twenty-one years, who hires and pays for a pew or sitting in said church, may be, and act as a member of the society of the First Congregational Church, after first giving notice in writing to the clerk of said society that he is a member of said church and that he rents and pays for a seat in said church, and upon the filing of such notice, and signing the roll of membership of said society, the person giving such notice shall have and exercise all the rights of a member of said society.

It does not appear just how discipline is to be enforced in this church after this proposed bill shall become a law. It would seem, however, that if the qualifications of members are fixed by law, if the church should desire to withdraw the hand of fellowship from any member it would have to do so by regular civil proceedings in the courts. Of course, this is quite in keeping with the various measures of religious legislation being urged in several different States. It is, nevertheless, a little in advance of anything else which we have seen seriously proposed.
