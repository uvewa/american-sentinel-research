REPRESENTATIVE KOSTER, of this city, has introduced into the Assembly a bill to exempt from taxation the real property of ministers and priests to the value of $1,500. It seems scarcely possible that such a measure can procure the support of any considerable number of representatives. The fact that it has been seriously proposed, however, is significant.
