Speaking upon "Christian Citizenship" at Washington, D. C., July 8, 1896, Bishop Alexander Walters, D. D., of Jersey City, N. J., said:—

In the olden times the Church and the State were one. Abraham was not only the head of the Hebrew nation, but the head of the Hebrew church. While we do not believe in the matter in that particular form, we do believe that every department of our Government should be controlled by the principles of Christianity.

This language can mean nothing less than that the Church should dominate the State.
