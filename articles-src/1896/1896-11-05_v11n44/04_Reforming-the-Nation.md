# REFORMING THE NATION.

[Bible Echo (Melbourne, Australia), Sept. 23, 1896.]

One of the wildest notions that was ever conceived by man is the idea of reforming the nation without reforming the people composing it. And yet many apparently wise and intelligent men to day seem to entertain this idea. They talk and act as though by some magic stroke of policy, by some act of Parliament or the like, the people may all be made Christians. To deal with the people individually they think too slow a process, and virtually a hopeless task. The work must be done by wholesale. The inconsistency of such a theory is thus grotesquely expressed in a modern publication, under the heading, "Took a Smaller Job:—

"He drank, chewed, an smoked, an was likewise profane;
He got angry on small provocation;
So he gave up the job of reformin' himself,
And went in for reformin' the nation."
