"Cardinal Satolli is a theologian," says the Western Watchman, of the 15th inst., "and as a theologian cannot subscribe to the doctrine that Protestantism is better than no religion at all. Organized Protestantism is organized hostility to the Church of God. Far better that people should be left to natural religion and that traditional Christianity that has remained to them after the wreck and ruin of the sixteenth century than that travesty on revelation known as Protestantism." Weak-kneed Protestants who have been extending the hand to Rome and bidding her Godspeed as one branch of the great army of the Redeemer, should paste this in their hats for future reference.
