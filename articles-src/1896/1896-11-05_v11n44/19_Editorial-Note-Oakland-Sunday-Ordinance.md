The Board of Supervisors of Alameda County, Cal., in session at Oakland, October 19, refused to pass a Sunday ordinance demanded by the popular minister of the county. M. C. Wilcox, editor of the Signs of the Times, was present and spoke in opposition to the ordinance. The San Francisco Examiner, of the following day, thus briefly summarizes his remarks: "Mr. Wilcox said he was there to protest against the passage of the measures proposed by the memorial. He declared that it was entirely a religious matter, and un-American. He also said that everybody did not agree that the present day observed was the Sabbath, and he thought it unfair to the Adventist and the Hebrew to make him accept the day. It was not a question of whether the day was sacred or not, but of whether a legislative body should pass a law making one day sacred."
