## NEWS AND NOTES.

**THE** Evangelical Alliance of the United States has suggested a "Quiet Day" to be observed at an early date, in view of the perplexities, difficulties and dangers which characterize these closing years of the century.

**A LONDON** journal reports that "a missionary of the London Missionary Society, recently arrived from Madagascar, says that the Jesuit policy, under the French administration, is to get the Protestant missionaries out of the island by fair means or foul."

**THE** Catholic Standard and Times (Philadelphia), of October 31, reports a "political sermon" by Cardinal Gibbons, delivered in a Baltimore church, in which the latter avoided an indorsement of any political party, but urged the voters present to refuse to buy or sell votes, and to vote for the best man.

**THE** recent marriage of the Princess Helene of Montenegro to the Crown Prince of Italy, was the occasion of a most pronounced snubbing of the king and queen of Italy by the pope. Being a Catholic wedding the ceremony and accompanying arrangements were in the hands of the Church, and when King Humberto and his wife arrived they found no arrangements made to receive them, and were obliged to take seats in the body of the church like ordinary persons. Mgr. Passicelli, who officiated, upon being asked to explain, said that the details were arranged by the pope, who considered their majesties to be no part of the ceremonial. In addition to this the customary prayer for the royal house was omitted, a fact which greatly added to the astonishment and anger of the king and court.

**THE** Independent (N. Y.), of October 29, notes with adverse comment the fact that the General Assembly of the Southern Presbyterian Church has entered into a contract with the city of Fredericksburg, Va., by which the latter will aid the Assembly's Home and school in that city. The Charleston Presbytery has taken exception to the Assembly's action.

**A PRINCIPLE** in the creed of the Reformed Presbyterian Church in this country, forbids the exercise of the elective franchise, because the National Constitution does not recognize God. Yet on a recent occasion at Walton, Ulster County, N. Y., when the question of allowing or forbidding the sale of liquors in the town was to be decided, Reformed Presbyterians voted with the rest, the result being a victory for prohibition. But a vote for prohibition under the present Constitution is an acknowledgment of the propriety of voting under it for all good measures which can properly become subjects of civil legislation.

**THE** following quotation from President Woodruff, of the Mormon Church, given in the Deseret News, a Mormon journal of Salt Lake City, is regarded as significant relative to the question of Mormon abandonment of polygamy:—

> After the passage of the Edmunds law forbidding the practice of polygamy there was a great deal of talk as to what was to become of the so called abandoned wives, and Congress was induced to appropriate $300,000 to build a home for them. I believe the institution never had but one family, and that this was gotten at the special request of the officers.

This is regarded in some quarters as convincing proof that polygamy has not been abandoned.

**THE** following "election prayer" was prepared by Bishop Satterlee, of the Episcopal Church, and was made in Episcopal churches generally on Sunday, November 1:—

> Most gracious God, we humbly beseech Thee, for the people of these United States in general, that Thou would deepen in them a sense of their responsibility as citizens of the Commonwealth; to graft in theft hearts the convictions that the right of suffrage is a trust from their country and from Thee, and to direct and prosper all their actions at this present time to the advancement of Thy glory, the good of the Church, the safety, honor and welfare of the people; that all things may be so ordered and settled by their endeavors upon the best and surest foundations; that peace and happiness, truth and justice, religion and piety may be established among us for all generations.

This is the first time in the history of the church in America that such a step has been taken.

**ANARCHY** cannot proceed to greater lengths than to set at naught the laws of the Almighty.
