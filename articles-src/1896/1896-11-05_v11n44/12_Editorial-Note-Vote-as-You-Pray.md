"Vote as you pray," is an expression often made of late, but liable to be made the medium of gross error. We are taught to pray, "Thy kingdom come; Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven;" but that kingdom cannot be ushered in by means of the ballot. The plane of Christianity is altogether above any level to which even the highest human power can attain.

No person can "vote for Christ" until the latter shall have become a candidate for political office. But he was never such a candidate while on earth, and we have no evidence that he has changed in his purposes since the days of Pontius Pilate. On the contrary, we know that his gospel has the same method of propagation now as then, and that Christ himself is "the same yesterday, and to-day, and forever." Again, if we are to "vote for Christ," we must nominate the candidate, as well as vote for him. We cannot be bound in such a matter by the action of political parties.
