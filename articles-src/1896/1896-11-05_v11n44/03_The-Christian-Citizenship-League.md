## THE CHRISTIAN CITIZENSHIP LEAGUE.

From the Christian Citizen, the organ of the National Christian Citizenship League, published in Chicago, Ill., we gather the following information relative to the character and aims of this organization:

Christian citizenship is more than reform; it is regeneration.

It is more than the ethics of politics; it is the science of righteousness.

It maintains that the State is as truly sacred as the Church, should be governed by as high principles and should recognize God as the source of all authority.

It demands as high character in the ministers of God (Rom. 13.3.4) who occupy our legislative and executive chairs as in the ministers of God who occupy our church pulpits.

It regards all public evils primarily as enemies of Jesus Christ and calls for a union of the friends of Jesus against them.

It believes that but two ways lie before our country, one leading to anarchy, the other to the application of gospel principles to public affairs.

It is the voice of one crying in the wilderness of public sins, "Prepare ye the way of the Lord," measure all things by the rule of absolute righteousness rather than that of "policy" or "expediency," cast out everything contrary to the will of Christ.

About three years ago, the National Christian Citizenship League was organized to promulgate the above principles. It knows no party, creed, nationality or sex, but seeks to unite all the friends of Jesus against his enemies. From its headquarters at 153 La Salle St., Chicago, it sends out large quantities of literature and many able speakers. Through its agencies many local victories have been won over the saloon and other public evils. It is organizing local leagues wherever called for and State departments in various States. Its mission is to serve and to preach the "old Gospel" as applied to public affairs.

It is evident that Christian citizenship, as here set forth, contemplates a condition of things above and beyond that which can be realized through human wisdom or power. For it must be admitted that "regeneration" and "righteousness" cannot be a product of human effort. The possession of civil power cannot contribute in any way to their realization. Yet the Christian Citizenship League seeks to accomplish its purposes through the direct instrumentality of the ballot.

"It maintains that the State is as truly sacred as the Church, . . and should recognize God as the source of all authority." But the only recognition of God which can be pleasing to him is that which comes through faith in Jesus Christ. "Without faith it is impossible to please him," writes Paul, "for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a reward of them that diligently seek him." Heb. 11:6. A recognition of God which possesses any saving virtue must be something more than that acknowledgment of him given by the devils, who "believe and tremble." James 2:19.

But the State cannot exercise faith, and hence cannot make any proper or acceptable acknowledgment of God. Faith is for the individual only. Through faith we become acquainted with God so that we can recognize him as he is. Any other recognition of him could not meet with his approval.

The State speaks through its laws. Its recognition of God must therefore be by law. And if by law, it cannot be of faith. The character of State legislation is determined by the composition of its legislature, which in turn depends upon the vote of the people. But voting is not a religious act; it is the exercise of a civil right, which Christians and non-Christians possess and exercise alike. Hence there can be no true recognition of God through the ballot.

Faith is given to secure salvation. If the State can exercise faith, it can be saved. But if it cannot exercise faith, it has no business to concern itself with religion. Salvation, however, in the Christian sense, is a meaningless word considered apart from the individual; for Christian salvation means always salvation from sin. But all sin lies at the door of the individual. Sin never will demand other than an individual accounting. The Church of God cannot save the individual member of it who is a sinner; much less can be hope for salvation through his connection with the State.

The scheme of State recognition of God, therefore, is altogether Utopian so far as any Christian purpose is concerned. Its significance is wholly of an antichristian character. For State recognition of God, by law, means enforced religious observances on the part of those subject to the State, if it means anything at all. But enforced observances are not of faith, and "whatsoever is not of faith is sin."
