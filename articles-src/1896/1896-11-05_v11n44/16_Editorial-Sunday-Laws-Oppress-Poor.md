The article on page 348, "How Sunday Laws Oppress the Poor," describes an arrest which illustrates perfectly the oppressive character of such statutes.

This poor woman was arrested, not for wronging her neighbors, but for an honest endeavor to keep her sick husband and her helpless children from starvation.

She was wronging no one; she was preventing no one from resting or worshiping, but she was violating a "law" designed to guard, not human rights but to prevent the "desecration" of a day held to be sacred by those having control of legislation.

In common with every other human being this poor woman had an inalienable right to earn an honest living for herself and family; but the State, at the behest of the prevailing religious sentiment, takes away this right for one day of the week, thus compelling her to pay tribute to the extent of one seventh of her time to a religious institution, and this notwithstanding the seemingly ample constitutional guarantees of religious liberty which are the boast of the American people.

Again, this woman might have sold cigars, or tobacco in any manufactured form; she might have sold fruit, or candies; she might even have kept a Raines law "hotel" and have served liquors with "meals," and not been subject to arrest; but for selling a bit of cloth she is haled to prison, is detained from her sick husband and little hungry children all night and a considerable part of the next day, and is released only because a tender-hearted judge disregards an unjust law in the interest of humanity.

But let not the reader think for a moment that the injustice is in the circumstances: the injustice is in the law; the circumstances simply compel the recognition of the iniquity in spite of religious prejudice and preconceived opinions. The injustice would have been just as great had the peculiar circumstances been different. All so-called "laws" for the protection of Sunday ought to be abolished. It is the business of the State to protect the people, not days.
