# RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION IN STATE SCHOOLS.

[From the New Zealand Baptist, August, 1896.]

The position and attitude of Nonconformists in England when Forster introduced his Education bill in 1870 are being repeated by us to-day, for the question of "religious instruction in schools" finds us confused, divided, and blind to the great issues at stake. Unless we promptly close our ranks and present a solid front to the clericalism and intolerance involved in the present agitation, the probability is that in a few years we shall find ourselves in the weak position Nonconformists occupy in the present crisis in England. The question concerns us as Baptists, more than any other denomination, for we have ever been foremost in the fight for liberty of conscience and toleration in matters of religion. Now, I think I shall be able to prove that the proposed innovation,—the teaching of religion by agents of the State,—violates some of our most sacred principles, sapping the foundations of some of the fundamental truths which lie at the basis of the Nonconformist position.

There are two main principles accepted universally by Baptist churches, viz:—

1. Liberty of conscience.

2. The noninterference of the State in matters of religion.

In the course of the article we shall see how the proposal affects these principles.

The question at issue is not the merit of any proposed text-book, but the acceptance or rejection of broad, generally-accepted principles. The question is not "Will it benefit us?" but "Is it right?"

I shall state my case by a series of propositions, to which no Baptists can rightly object.

1. The State has no right to interfere in matters of religion.—It is because we recognize this principle that we oppose the establishment of any sect or church by the State. We demand that religion shall be free and unfettered by any connection with a secular State. It was because of this principle that Baptists in England preferred to go to prison rather than to pay rates in aid of the Established Church. Whatever may have been obscure to our Baptist "fathers," this principle has never been lost. They realized, and we realize, that religion is a spiritual thing, and therefore beyond the reach of any secular power; so when the State stoops to patronize or strives to coerce, we reply, "Hands off. This is God's affair, for religion is free, voluntary, and sacred." Why, our very position as Nonconformists is a protest against State interference.

Are we not agreed so far? Well, do you not see that the teaching of religion by the State in the "day schools" is a direct interference in religious matters? By so doing, the State presumes to enter into a region forbidden by the spirit of religion and by our own belief. Logically, if we allow the State to day to further the interests of religion, we have no right to complain if the State tomorrow does its utmost to hinder the interests of religion. Once admit the State's right of interference, and we give ourselves away, placing ourselves at the mercy of the State.

2. We have no right to give religious instruction by enforced taxation.—In the spiritual realm there must be no coercion, all must be done of free choice, willingly, gladly. This is one of our reasons against a Church establishment by act of parliament. No church dreams of taxing its members for the advancement of religion by act of parliament. We recognize that whatever we do or give is not a matter of law but of conscience. Now, our schools are maintained by enforced taxation; all having to contribute alike, irrespective of their belief, whether Christian, Atheist, Oriental, etc.; so, consistent with our principle, we maintain that you have no right to apply this money to religious instruction, which you must do if you allow religion to be taught in the schools. Further, is it not clear if we allow religion to enter the schools that we give this principle away; for if the State is to establish the school for religious purposes, why not establish the Church for the same end? If we allow it to establish the one, we have no reason to object if it establish the other. If a religion cannot be maintained without the secular arm, then it is unworthy of maintenance, and the sooner it die an ignominious death the better.

3. Religious instruction can only be given by competent teachers.—Competency here implies conversion; so religious teaching can only be given by the religious. For the irreligious to undertake this work would be sacrilege and unholy presumption. We recognize this principle in all our churches. We would not dream of letting a non-Christian occupy one of our pulpits; and yet, by this agitation, we purpose handing over to our school teachers (about 60 or 70 per cent. of whom are not Christians) the religious instruction of our young. Could inconsistency go further? I deny the right of any section—large or small—of the community to make a "conscience" clause. It is an unwarranted and invidious interference with the teacher's religious belief. No State has the right to ask me what I believe. My belief is too sacred to be at the mercy of the State.

4. We have no right to compel anyone to receive religious instruction.—What applies to the teachers applies with equal force to the scholars. Why should an invidious distinction be made between child and child in State schools maintained by every section of the community?

5. There must be uniformity of belief before there can be uniformity of religious instruction in the schools.—A little consideration will soon make the fairness and honesty of this proposition evident.

The State is made up of many bodies—religious and non-religious,—some of which are widely divergent in belief and practice. There are Protestants (including Unitarians), Roman Catholics, Theosophists, the Chinamen, with their Buddhism or Confucianism, etc., etc. All these bodies contribute equally to our State schools. Then what right have we to use this money to enforce the religious belief of a particular body? Where is the fairness and justice of the proposal? The comparative worth of the religious belief does not enter into the question at all.

Could a Buddhist honestly subscribe to any religious text-book we might frame? This dishonest compromise of outward uniformity has broken down in England, and the attitude of the Roman Catholics proves that it will break down here. So keenly sensitive are the Catholics to the impossibility of any compromise, that, rather than be a party to it, they maintain their own schools out of their own pockets. And every other nonconforming body has equal ground for protest. The only other possible supposition is, that the creed of each religious sect be taught in turn; but the absurdity of this prevents serious consideration.

6. Is it just to compel non-Christians to pay for the extension of our religious belief, just because we happen to be in the majority? —Do you not see that we are forcing them into an immoral position—to support what they do not believe? Is it's right use of the freedom and tolerance so many of our fathers purchased with their life's blood? We lay great stress upon our liberty of conscience, but have not they equal right to equal liberty? Whether their belief be right or wrong in no way affects the issue. Neither is it a question of majority or minority, but of justice and tolerance. If ninety-nine per cent. vote in favor of religious instruction in State schools, its enforcement is quite as immoral as if but one per cent. were in favor of it. Once you admit the right of the majority to rule in religious matters, whatever religion happens to be in the ascendant will have the right to enforce its tenets on the community by State aid.

After all, it is the old heresy, that you can make a nation religious by act of parliament. It has been tried down the centuries in various forms, but always with the same result—ignominious failure.

Now, consider these six propositions, which are based on some of our most sacred principles, and you will see what your duty is in the present crisis—to maintain in all its integrity and purity the heritage of freedom handed down to us by the fidelity and sacrifice of our fathers. The fact that Baptists have contributed more perhaps to the cause of religious freedom than any other denomination, except the Quakers, ought to be a sufficient inspiration to resist to the utmost the attempt now made to undermine our principles by the plausible pretext of an "Irish Text Book." Admit the "Irish Text Book," and sectarianism, with all its intolerance and bigotry, is made possible. How firmly then should we resist the intended encroachments on the freedom of our State schools.

If those who so persistently inform us that the colony is doomed unless a system of religious instruction be introduced into our schools, would utilize a little of the energy now wasted in declamation in making the most of the present facilities for religious instruction, they might be able to postpone the day of doom.
