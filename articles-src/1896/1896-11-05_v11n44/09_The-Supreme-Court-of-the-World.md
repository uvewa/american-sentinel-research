## THE SUPREME COURT OF THE WORLD.

[This article from the San Francisco Chronicle, of October 12, should have appeared last week, but was overlooked in making up the pages. For our comments upon the claims of the papacy voiced by Mr. Yorke, the reader is referred to an article on the second page of the SENTINEL of October 29.]

**ST. FRANCIS CHURCH** was crowded to the doors last night to hear Rev. P. C. Yorke discuss "The End of Controversy."

Father Yorke began his address with a reference to the differences that had arisen, civil and religious, in modern society. It was necessary, said Father Yorke, that there should be a court of last appeal in all strife, and that court must be, by an elementary process of reasoning, "the party known as the church of Rome.

"God made his supreme court almighty and all-knowing," said Father Yorke. "He sent his apostles into the world to decide disputes and end controversies. 'Go ye, therefore, unto all nations,' said our Lord. He authorized them to say what was so and what was not so. And so the end and arbiter of all controversies is the Christ that moveth about us and abideth with us. He is the Judge to whom we can take all our differences. He is the Magistrate at whose feet we can lay all our quarrels, and from whom we can expect fair treatment, man to man.

"The apostles spoke with the authority of Christ; for was it not said that he that believed them believed Christ? The Lord intended that his apostolic church should continue until the end of time.

"The authority for these claims of the Roman Catholic Church is well known. At least it ought to be, for it has been repeated many times in the past eight months. The Lord said unto Peter, 'Thou art Peter, and upon this rock will I build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.' There surely ought to be no misunderstanding of this text, and yet theologians have discovered that there are no less than three hundred and fifty different interpretations of it.

"This power of deciding controversies was admitted by everybody to be in the province of the Roman Catholic Church for 1,500 years. For 1,300 years nobody ever questioned it. During all that time the world acknowledged the church of Rome as a court of last resort and final appeal. Even after the Reformation set in its leaders still yielded to Rome the functions of arbiter. And surely that period of undisputed possession of a function is good ground for the church basing its claims to be the supreme court of the kingdom of Christ.

"No other church but that of Rome has ever claimed this right. One would think that other smaller churches, and they are many, would have the effrontery to set up a claim to this power, but they did not. They knew too well that their doctrines fluctuated like the winds.

"When the infallibility of the pope was announced the people laughed and said the pontiff had gone daft. Yet infallibility only means faith in the decision of the supreme court. If Christ established his supreme court it must be infallible. What's the use of having a religion if you are not sure of it? And thus the infallibility of the pope is the logical result of an elementary process of reasoning."
