The advocates of "National Reform," "Christian Citizenship," etc., seek to find in the French Reign of Terror an argument in favor of uniting "religion and the State." But the less said about this feature of French history the better for their cause. A corrupt national religion was one of the principal factors in making the Reign of Terror possible.
