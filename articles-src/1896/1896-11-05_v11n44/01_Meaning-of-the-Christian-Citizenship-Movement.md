## MEANING OF THE "CHRISTIAN CITIZENSHIP" MOVEMENT.

At the late international Christian Endeavor convention held in Washington, D. C., Rev. William Rader, of San Francisco, voicing the sentiment of the convention, said:—

Taking an interest in politics does not mean that the minister of the gospel should bring politics into the pulpit, but it does mean that he should take his pulpit into politics. It does not mean that he should bring politics into church, but it does mean most emphatically that the Church should be translated into political power.

Unfortunately, this language did not express merely the private opinion of the speaker. It did not announce a doctrine which he felt called upon to apologize for or to sustain by argument. It was but a statement before the convention of the "Christian Citizenship" idea, to which the "Christian Endeavor" movement stood already committed.

This doctrine of the church in politics has been heard before, in the councils of the "National Reform" movement, and has already borne fruit in State and national legislation. The significance of the situation to-day lies in the fact that the banner of "National Reform" is now borne aloft at the head of a vast army which represents the working strength of nearly all the churches combined. The "little leaven" has leavened the whole lump. The "Christian Citizenship" movement is not confined by denominational limits. All the leading Protestant bodies have contributed to its ranks, and are represented there by the very flower of their membership. Fired by the enthusiasm of youth, but guided by the counsels of mature years, this vast organized expression of outward Christian union stands girt for the conflict with the "enemies of Christ," and the cry of its leaders is, On to Washington.

That Congress will be besieged the coming winter by this "Christian Citizenship" host in the interests of religious legislation, there is not the slightest room to doubt. And worst of all, there is grave reason to doubt whether the outcome will be other than capitulation. The World's Fair Sunday legislation of 1892 furnishes a precedent for conclusions upon this point.

The advocates and exponents of the "Christian Citizenship" movement seek to quiet any possible public apprehension concerning its character and aims, by the statement that it seeks no union of Church and State, and does not mean the introduction of politics into the church. But upon these points they are able to draw distinctions where there is no practical difference.

We are plainly told, however, that the "Christian Citizenship" movement does emphatically mean that "the Church is to be translated into political power." There is, it is true, some difference between this result and the introduction of politics into the Church, but it is rather technical than practical. The Church, as represented by this organization, does not mean to become the ally of any political party; but it is her intention to become a political party herself. Were the Church to become merely a political ally it would be bad enough, but nothing could be worse than political domination by the Church in the interests of no party but herself.

What the Church seeks to-day is religious legislation. To secure this she will fill political offices with candidates of her own choosing. Those whom she does not elect she will intimidate with threats of political opposition. She will dictate the vote of her adherents. And thus will she stand "translated into political power." That is what the phrase means, and that is the meaning of political organization within the Church.

When the Church shall express her will through a political platform, control the vote of her adherents, and cast that vote for men of her own selection, she will be in every practical sense a political party. Politics will have become one branch of her Christianity.

It is denied, of course, that the Church will engage in politics as a Church. But whether as a church or not, it will be as a religious body, politically organized for religious purposes. It matters not that no distinctively denominational vote is contemplated, or that there is no intention to array one religious body against another by any denominational alliance with a secular power. The essence of Church and State union consists in the exercise of civil power for religious purposes, without reference to differences of religious belief. The evil of such union lies not in a discrimination in favor of one denomination against others, but in the damage which results to all parties from the administration of religion through civil force. The union of religion with the civil power must be through the Church, and must mean a union of Church and State if it means anything at all.

Human power cannot become an ally of Christianity. The power must be of God. The gospel is "the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth." Rom. 1:16. Apostate "Christianity" has always allied the power of man with tradition, which is the word of man. The power of God, on the other hand, is inseparable from God's word. The power of man will not unite with the Word of God, or the power of God with the word of man. Tradition seeks an alliance with human (the civil) power, because it would otherwise be entirely powerless.

A religion which seeks alliance with human power cannot be Christianity, however high its claims, or however numerous its adherents. It may retain the forms of Christianity, but it is shorn of the divine power, which alone can give spiritual life. This counterfeit, which possesses no life-giving and soul-satisfying power, is palmed off upon the people, and the result is spiritual darkness and death. This is the real and gigantic evil in a union of Church and State.

We are now told that "the Church is to be translated into political power," and we are surrounded by the most convincing evidences that the statement is true. The translation is in full progress before our eyes. The Church is stretching forth her hand to grasp the power which she sees almost within her reach. And for what purpose does she want this political power? It is for the purpose, as she tells us, of ushering in the kingdom of God. Political power is wielded for the purpose of shaping legislation. The Church, therefore, through the "Christian Citizenship" movement, seeks for translation into political power in order that she may control civil legislation in what she deems the interests of the kingdom of God. She desires to enforce upon all men "the laws of Christian morality." One of her chief aims is to "preserve the sabbath." To do this she means to secure both national and State legislation to enforce the observance of Sunday. And whatever else among religious observances or moral practice may be deemed necessary to the establishment of Christ's kingdom, will likewise become the subject of legislation.

All men ought to be good. They ought to be followers of Jesus Christ. But the majority are not Christians, even by profession. Very many are open violators of moral precepts. This is a sad state of things, but it cannot be remedied by human law. Why? Because the root of the evil is in the heart. The testimony of God's Word is that the heart of man is by nature at enmity with God's law. It is selfish, and there is no power in man to change its nature. Human legislation cannot touch the heart. It can only regulate the outward conduct. One power alone can change the heart, and that is the power of God, operating through faith in Jesus Christ.

It may be asked, Will it not be an advantage to regulate the outward conduct of ungodly men by human law? Certainly it will, in those matters which involve the maintenance of human rights, but not in the matter of religious observances. And why not? Because a religious observance is only hypocrisy and a mockery of God without faith; and human law cannot supply the faith. Open disregard of the Sabbath is very bad, but it is not so bad as a hypocritical, forced observance of the Sabbath; and the same principle applies to any other of God's moral requirements.

These considerations make clear the gigantic evil which is involved in this attempt to usher in the kingdom of God through the exercise of political power by the Church. The result will be the ushering in of a state of things exactly opposite to the reign of righteousness and peace. And this ushering in is now at hand. The situation is one which calls for active, earnest, prayerful and immediate effort on the part of all those who know the meaning of gospel liberty.
