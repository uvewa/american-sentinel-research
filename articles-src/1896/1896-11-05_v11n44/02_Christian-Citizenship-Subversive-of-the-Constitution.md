## "CHRISTIAN CITIZENSHIP" SUBVERSIVE OF THE CONSTITUTION.

The purpose of the founders of this Government was to place all men on an equality before the law. We are warranted in believing this both from the language of the Constitution and from the Declaration of Independence. The latter expressly declares that "all men are created equal, and are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights," while the former provides that "all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States, and the State wherein they reside." A further provision of the Constitution is that "No religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States."

But the "Christian Citizenship" movement, so-called, purposes to change all this; not indeed by changing the wording of the Constitution, but by overriding it, practically, and establishing not only a religious test as a qualification for office, but a religious test of citizenship itself.

In a "Christian Citizenship" meeting, held in Washington, July 8, 1896, Rev. Wm. Rader, of San Francisco, Cal., said, as quoted in the "Official Report":

The possession of rights does not constitute true citizenship, which properly assumes that a right is only efficient when rightly used, and that a man is no more a citizen because of the constitutional authority afforded him by the Constitution than he is an artist because he owns the brush of Rubens or the chisel of Angelo. What are known as American rights, such as free speech and political suffrage, are the political instruments of Christian men: they are not ends, but means to an end; they are the instruments of political righteousness, the legal opportunity of a Christian man to practically apply this Christianity to the State. Citizenship, then, is more than the political authority to cast a ballot; it is the moral ability to cast it right in the interests of the kingdom of God, and according to the Christianity of Jesus Christ. Voting is a Christian function.

We are not disposed to deny that every man who casts a ballot is under moral obligation to act conscientiously in so doing, just as much so as in any other business matter. The man who acts politically acts for the public, and he is just as much bound to act for the best interests of the public, according to his judgment, as he is to act for what he believes to be the best interests of a mercantile or other business firm of which he may be a member.

But we cannot grant that voting is a Christian function in any other sense than that which we have explained. The rule of the Christian life is, "Whether ye eat or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God." It is clear, therefore, that a man who votes, equally with the man who eats or drinks, or who engages in any business, must do so to the glory of God. That, however, does not make voting a Christian function any more than it makes tilling the soil, or conducting commercial enterprises a Christian function. These things may all be done by Christians,—may be done to the glory of God,—but they are not Christian functions. For if they were, only Christians would have a right to engage in them. For instance: Baptism is a Christian function; but only a Christian has the right to administer baptism, or even to receive it. Partaking of the Lord's supper is a Christian function, but only a Christian has the right to partake of it. But under American law all men are equally entitled to participate in the affairs of government.

But "Christian Citizenship" seeks to change all this, and to establish for the citizen, as we said before, a religious qualification; therefore, in spirit and intent so-called "Christian Citizenship" is opposed to the Constitution of the United States, and would subvert it.

The purpose of the founders of this Government, as before remarked, was to prevent class distinctions, to put all men on an equality before the law, so that there might not be classes as there were and are in European and other countries. But "Christian Citizenship" would undo the work of the fathers of the Republic, and would establish a special class, enjoying special privileges. It is true that this class might not be created by law, and their special privileges might not be guaranteed to them by constitutional provision; but these privileges might be none the less real, and the Constitution be none the less surely subverted.

True Christianity asks for nothing of this kind. The fundamental law of the Christianity of Christ touching social relations is: "All things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them." Christianity seeks no special privileges for its adherents. It asks no monopoly for itself; and the pseudo-Christianity which assumes arbitrary control in matters of Church and State is not Christianity but is only an exhibition of human selfishness.

God is glorified in the proper use of all his gifts to men. He is glorified by the farmer who tills the soil, sows the seed, guards his growing crop from injury, and who finally with thankful heart reaps the harvest which God has given him through the operation of natural laws. The Creator would not, however, be glorified by the man who would misuse the soil, the seed, the rain, and the sunshine, by endeavoring to produce results contrary to the ordinance of God.

In like manner the citizen, who is likewise a Christian, glorifies God by using civil government for the purpose for which it was ordained, namely, for the conservation of human rights.

The gospel is the power of God unto salvation, and he who, leaving the gospel, the power of God, seeks to save men by the power of the State, dishonors God, no matter how much or how fervently he may say, Lord, Lord.

Let the Christian vote, if he can do so, conscientiously; but let him remember that he is no better before the law than any other citizen; that he is entitled to no more consideration at the hands of the public; and that he has no more right to use the civil power to compel others to believe or to practice as he does, than unbelievers have to use civil power to compel him to believe and to act as they do.
