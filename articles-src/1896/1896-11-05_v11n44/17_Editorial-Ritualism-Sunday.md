A correspondent of The Examiner (Baptist of this city) says, in an article published in that paper, October 15:—

When the Ritualist movement started in England, with its robes and posturing and candles and incense, and even the elevation of the consecrated bread while the heads of the people were reversibly bowed, it was a mystery to a Baptist how any one could even pretend a scriptural warrant for all this. But the Ritualist argument was very simple, and very cogent, if you would but grant a single premise—"Whatever the Scripture does not forbid may be done, if it is to edification." The Scripture does not forbid candies, incense, etc. We find them to be to edification. Therefore we may enjoy them. The whole ritualistic superstructure is built on that single proposition. But as Baptists we do not admit it. We hold that for ordinances and church order we must have an express warrant in the command or example of Christ and his apostles.

Will The Examiner or its correspondent cite "an express warrant in the command or example of Christ and his apostles" for substituting Sunday for the original Sabbath? We have no sympathy with Ritualism, but think it about as defensible as the dogma of Sunday sacredness.
