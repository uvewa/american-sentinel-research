## WHAT DOES IT MEAN?

EDITOR AMERICAN SENTINEL: During several years past we have had in our city a "Ministerial Union," comprising nearly all of the ministers of the Evangelical churches, meeting once a month to discuss matters pertaining to the religious welfare of the people.

A few weeks ago they decided to reorganize upon a broader foundation, change the name to "Ministerial League," and in one sense, to enter upon a more liberal policy as to their work. They therefore decided to extend an invitation to the ministers of all denominations, including the Catholic clergy, in particular, to join the league. According to the papers they met yesterday and formed the league, comprising about all of the Protestant ministers; but not any of the Catholic clergy were represented.

There seemed to be much disappointment that the Catholics were not present. The matter was fully discussed, and it was shown that a committee had visited the Catholics and were informed that it would be impossible for them to attend if there were any devotional services whatever, even so much as opening with the Lord's prayer. It was thought by some that they should at least open their meeting with the Lord's prayer. A vote was taken, which stood 17 to 14 against opening even with the Lord's prayer. "The main idea of those who voted to reject the proposal," said a city paper, "was to show to the Catholic clergy of the city how willing the Protestant pastors are to dispense with anything which would prevent them from joining the organization."

They then proceeded to adopt a constitution and by-laws which were in part as follows: "Its objects shall be the cultivation of civic righteousness in our community by an insistence upon the close and vital relations between Christianity and the proper administration of municipal affairs and all matters of general interest and moment in the commonwealth and general government.

"Its objects shall also be to discuss matters of common interest pertaining to the religious welfare of our community, and generally to watch and guard our common church interests, that they may have proper recognition and influence in moulding and shaping public sentiment and the practical, ethical affairs of our city."

Now will you kindly explain to us through the columns of the SENTINEL what all this means, so that the people of our city may understand it?

We have read it over several times; it sounds like the voice of ministers, but we don't really know what hand there may be behind it.

If the ministers are so much interested in our community, certainly the community should be interested in what the ministers say and do. And as they speak sometimes in language that we do not understand, we appeal to you to interpret the constitution for us so that we may know what they propose to do.

We would like to know also why these Protestant ministers are solicitous as to the cooperation of the Catholic clergy in their reform work, so far as to surrender all religious devotions in their meetings in order to gain the attendance of the Catholics.

They (the Protestants) do not say anything about trying to convert these clergy from the errors of Catholicism; there must be some other object in view.

Will you please give some information or word of prophecy that will instruct the people as to the meaning and consequences of this movement inaugurated by the ministers, if carried out to its full intent and purpose?

Very respectfully,

P. P. LANE.

Worcester, Mass., Nov. 24.

We think the matter printed in the present number of the AMERICAN SENTINEL gives a complete answer as to the intent and purpose of all such movements as described by our correspondent.—EDITOR.
