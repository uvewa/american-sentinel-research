CIVIL LAW VS. RELIGION.

BY GRANT ADKINS.

We can scarcely comprehend how that men who are seemingly ardent advocates of "liberty of conscience" and of the Christian motto "do unto others as you would they should do unto you," can in any sense whatever ally themselves with any who are clamoring for a law that will enforce upon the minority the religious opinions of the majority, and still claim that everybody ought to be allowed to worship God according to the dictates of one's own conscience.

It does seem that any one could see by a moment's reflection that any civil law that will discriminate between citizens, and will concede to a corporation, a body of men, any right that it would not allow to an individual, is a wicked and unjust law; yet such is the character of all Sunday laws.

The pastors of this city have of late had much to say on "The proper observance of the Sabbath," two sermons having been preached by two of the leading Presbyterian divines. After this the matter was brought before the Pastors' Union, and all present were free to say that the law must be rigidly enforced, and that the Sunday newspaper was a detriment to the youth and the church. To show their disapproval, many of them decided to withdraw their church announcements from Sunday editions and print them on Saturday.

One of the divines said to the writer: "It is not so much the work that is being done on that day, but it keeps them busy so that they can't attend church services."

That is the secret of the whole affair. It is not so much that they entertain love for Sunday, as it is to get men to go to church. But of late I could not see much difference between the Sunday political paper and the Sunday political sermon. I would go to church and hear political issues discussed per and con. But it was just this morning that a man who guides an editorial pen, said: "Let the minister make his sermon as interesting to men as the Sunday newspaper, and they will not need a law to stop their publication."

A minister stated in the presence of the writer that "the Sunday paper was such a temptation to him that if it came to his house he could not help but read it, and therefore was in favor of its suspension." We could not help wondering if He who is able to keep us from falling, and will not suffer us to be tempted above that which we are able to bear, could not give grace enough either to bear the reading of the Sunday newspaper, or else to let it alone. Let a man's heart be full of the love of God, and of that which he believes is right, and no newspaper that he disapproves will have any effect on him whatever.

We give below a letter from a leading attorney at-law, stating how he views religious legislation. We could give more, but this presents about the same thoughts that the rest contain:—

Rev. GRANT ADKINS:

In my judgment any connection between Church and State is utterly repugnant to our Constitution.

I believe religion is purely a matter of conscience with which the State and the Federal Government has no business to meddle. I am for this reason emphatically opposed to appropriations of the public money to be used in maintaining sectarian schools and elementary institutions of any character.

I am equally opposed to any scheme that tends to discriminate between the beliefs of a Hebrew and a Christian, a Catholic, or a Methodist, a believer or an agnostic. To provide "a Sunday law," is to my mind an indirect assumption by the Government of canonical jurisdiction, because such a law would be a decision upon a matter of religious doctrine upon which Jews and Christians, Baptists and Adventists, have divergent views. A decision upon a matter of doctrine must be rendered in the forum of the conscience rather than in the halls of Congress.

Yours truly,

N. C. MACNULT.

We are glad that all men have not lost the spirit of genuine religious liberty.
