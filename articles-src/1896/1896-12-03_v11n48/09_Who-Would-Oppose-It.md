## WHO WOULD OPPOSE IT?

SUPPOSE an effort were made to revive the old law making it compulsory to partake of the Lord's supper, who would most strenuously protest against it? It is safe to say that it would be those who most clearly discerned the spirituality of God's service. Such would rightly abhor dragging men to the Lord's table to act a lie, and would consider the law an outrageously wicked one. So, too, if those who favor Sunday laws really believed that keeping Sunday was a spiritual act, they would be protesting against such laws.—Present Truth, London.
