From the Department of the Interior.
Washington, D. C., Nov. 18, 1896, Hon.
David R. Francis, Secretary of the Interior,

in sending his regrets at not being able to attend a banquet in Kansas City, Mo., closed his letter with the following statement of an important truth:—

"If some legislation is not enacted to check the growing influence of wealth and to circumscribe the powers of the trusts and monopolies, there will be an uprising of the people before the close of the century which will endanger our very institutions."
