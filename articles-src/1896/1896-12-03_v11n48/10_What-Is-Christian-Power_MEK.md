## WHAT IS CHRISTIAN POWER?

BY M. E. KELLOGG.

THE New York Independent of November 12, contains an article on "Islam and Christianity," which has near its close the following very striking and suggestive sentence: "We have no more right to dethrone the Sultan in order to make it easier for Turks to become Christians, than the Turk has to present to the Armenians the alternative of Islam or death. But we have a right to insist that Christian power shall be used for protection of those who hold to the Christian faith."

The query which arose in our mind when reading this sentence was, What is Christian power? And the answer which came to us, from our understanding of the Word of God, was that Christian power, properly so called, can be no other than the power of Christ. At the first this power was manifested by Christ. He healed the sick, cured the blind, raised the dead, and, what is more remarkable, gave to his disciples power to triumph over the evils in themselves. It was his intention that his work should be carried forward by his disciples after his ascension to heaven, that they should be his representatives in holiness and power even as he had represented the Father. "As my Father hath sent me, even so send I you." "Ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth."

Witnesses of what?—That he is the Christ, the Saviour, and that he saves men. Could they do this of themselves? No indeed, and hence at the same time that he told them what their duty and calling were to be, he assured them that divine power—Christian power—for the accomplishment of their task would be given them. "All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. Go ye therefore, and teach all nations." Again: "But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses," etc. Nor could they go until this Christian power was given them: "And behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high."

Much more evidence might be adduced, but this is sufficient to prove what Christian power is. It is the power of the Holy Spirit which comes from heaven and works in and through the disciples of Christ in a marked manner for the purpose of carrying on the work of Christ in the earth, and in the same manner that he worked.

Should we further ask for the precise moment when Christian power was the strongest, truth would compel the statement that it was when a hundred and twenty disciples of One who had been crucified as a malefactor were assembled in the upper room. The manifestation of Christian power at that time is thus described: "And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting. And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them. And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance." Here was the fulfillment of the promise to His disciples, "Tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high."

The power of the Holy Ghost, as revealed directly in some of its various ways of working, is Christian power. Christian power is manifested in the Christian religion. It certainly is not manifested through the power of States or governments. There never was a period in all the history of Christianity when Christian power was so manifest, so far-reaching, and so powerful, as during the first century after the ascension of Christ. So powerful was it that the empire of Rome began to fear for its own overthrow, and struck back at the Christian power in cruel acts of persecution which only hastened its own downfall. Christian power was all-conquering then. It had no army of soldiers, no fleet, no munitions of war; yet it went forth "conquering and to conquer." Its weapons of warfare were not carnal, but, at the same time, they were "mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds; casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ." This is Christian power. We may go further, and say that it is the only Christian power.

But is this the conception of Christian power which is referred to in the Independent? Not at all. Real Christian power, the Christian power recognized in the Scriptures, is not meant. On the contrary, by the expression "Christian power," the Independent means the worldly, mortal, cruel, military power of England, France, Russia, Germany, and the United States. We grant that there is power in these nations. But to accept the idea that the power of manifestos, ultima-

tums, armies, and battle ships is Christian power is, to us, a virtual denial of the power of Christ. The power of the British army is in no true sense any more a Christian power than is the power of the Turkish army. An army of Mohammedans may be truly called a Mohammedan power, because Mohammed taught and justified the use of the sword in the propagation of his doctrines; but no army of soldiers can be a Christian army, or represent Christian power, because the Author of the Christian religion declared against the use of violence in the propagation of his religion, or for any other purpose. All war is unchristian. It cannot, therefore, be a manifestation of Christian power. But this war-like power, national power, the power of armies and battleships, is just what the Independent means by the term "Christian power" in the quotation we are considering.

Another sentence from this article will prove this: "The Moslem Turks feel that, for the present at least, Islam is more powerful than Christianity." This is measuring Christianity and the power of Christ by the Mohammedan standard.

The Independent further says: "The battle royal of Christianity is to be with Islam. The other great religions are to be met with argument, persuasion. Islam must be met by force. . . . Power is the one quality of religion which they [the Mohammedans] appreciate, and they will yield their faith only as they become convinced that it has met its superior in strength."

Justice to the Independent demands the statement that in this same article it denies the intention of using force against Turkey for the compelling of individual Moslems to accept Christianity; yet indirectly it asserts this very thing, when it calls for this force to be employed for the destruction of Turkey as a nation, that individual Mohammedans may see and recognize the power of Christ and so be led to become Christians! It says distinctly: "For centuries the Sultan has represented to the Moslem world, the element of power. . . . To drive him from that vantage ground would be to give a fatal blow to the system itself, and thus release from its thrall many who are already in doubt, but are held by fear from acknowledging that doubt."

If this idea of Christian power, of Christian progress, is to prevail; if the "battle royal" between Christianity and Islam is to be fought with gun, bayonet, and battleships in order to humble Turkey, that Moslems may more readily become Christians by recognition of Christian power,—then it matters very little to true Christianity which power gains the victory. The Christianity of the one is little above the Mohammedanism of the other. Brute force alone is glorified. Moslems converted to Christianity under such influences would be no better men as Christians than they were before as Moslems. They would simply transfer their allegiance and faith from one cruel, brutal power to another. Indeed they would not be converted to Christianity at all, but to a power which violates every principle of the religion it professes to sustain.

National Christianity, which many so admire, has nothing to commend it above Mohammedanism. Turkey is as bad a product of Mohammedanism as the world ever saw, but to day she is not equal in national crimes to Spain in the days of the Inquisition, or France at the time of the St. Bartholomew massacre.

The question might here very properly be asked why Islam cannot be met and influenced by the same means that other religions are met and conquered. The answer of the Independent is that Islam respects nothing but force. But if the application of force is a correct principle, why confine it to national affairs, or to the relations of the so called Christian powers to Turkey? Men who respect nothing but force are not confined to Moslem countries. They are found everywhere. Argument and persuasion have utterly failed in their cases. Why, then, should they not be coerced? These questions let in the light upon the whole plan of national Christianity, and the use of this so-called Christian power.

It is not Christian power. Nations, like individuals, may steal the livery of the court of heaven that they may better serve their own interests or some high church party. Let the nation interfere to protect its citizens in Turkey, if they are in danger; and in the name of a common humanity let them interfere to prevent the killing of the revolutionary Armenians, if they will. But why try to throw the mantle of Christianity over their actions? Why, as an authority and justification of their conduct, invoke the name of Him who once said to one of his over-zealous followers, "Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword"? Why call a course of action Christian, when it is distinctively forbidden by the Author of Christianity? Why—unless because the virus of a national religion, a governmental religion, a union of the Church with the State, has, by false teaching, been inoculated into the very lifeblood of the national sentiment so thoroughly that a touch of the nation's pulse reveals its presence.

Is it any wonder that the power of Christ is so little manifested in the popular Christianity of this day, when that Christianity has such an erroneous idea of what Christian power is; and when, lacking the true power, it tries to take and utilize another power in its place?
