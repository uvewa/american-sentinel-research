The Catholic papers, from Boston to San Francisco, are extravagantly exultant over the defeat of Congressman Linton, of Michigan, in the late election. Mr. Linton is not the only member of the present Congress who was defeated; so that there is nothing serious in that. Although Mr. Linton has done noble work in behalf of sound Constitutional principle during the two congressional terms that he has had, we have no idea that either he or anybody that favored him ever attached to it a hundredth part of the importance that these extravagant exultations show that the Catholics all over the country gave to it.
