## THE NEW KINGDOM OF GOD.

IN 1894, the writer attended a convention in Williamsport, Pa., called to celebrate the one hundredth anniversary of the enactment of the present Pennsylvania Sunday law. The convention was composed largely of members of the National Reform Association, an organization originated by the Reformed Presbyterian Church for the purpose of securing an amendment to the national Constitution recognizing Christ as the ruler of nations and the Bible as the basis of all legislation.

On being introduced to the promoter of the convention as one who opposed his movement, the following conversation in substance followed—

National Reformer—I am surprised that you people who claim to be Christians oppose our movement.

Answer—We oppose your movement because we are Christians and in the interests of Christianity.

National Reformer—But why do you oppose it?

Answer—We oppose it because it is an attempt to reinstate the theocratical form of government instituted by the Lord in the days of Moses, when the Lord governed by direct revelation of his will. This order of things has been abrogated by the word of the Lord as recorded in Exe. 21:25-27; and every attempted theocracy since that time has lacked the essential element of a true theocracy—it has lacked the true Theos—that is, it has lacked the true God. In the place of God it has put man. As a result we have the pages of history stained with the records of persecution, carried on in the name of God and professedly in the interests of the kingdom of God.

National Reformer—God never changes. He governed Israel by means of a theocracy and that is the form of government he desires to establish in America.

Reply—True, God does not change, but men do. And because of the perverseness of men, God has declared that the theocracy "shall be no more until He come whose right it is," and then he declares, "I will give it Him." Not until Christ comes from heaven and destroys all earthly kingdoms, and all wicked men, and melts the earth with "fervent heat," and burns up the last trace of man's wicked works—then, and not till then, will the Lord establish a theocracy in the earth. When Christ came he distinctly declared, "My kingdom is not of this world," and refused to be made king.

National Reformer—When Christ came the government was a monarchy. Had it been a republic like our government or like the republic of Israel it would have been different.

Reply—The government of Israel was not in any sense a republic. The people did not select the rulers. Moses and Aaron were chosen by the Lord. The subordinate rulers were chosen by Moses at the direction of the Lord. The people did not make their own laws. All their laws were given by the Lord directly or through Moses. But leaving this point; Who is to take the place of Moses in the kingdom of God which you propose to set up here in America? The elements of the kingdom of God were God, Moses and the people. In your contemplated kingdom, who will occupy the place of Moses and receive the law from God and enforce it upon the people?

National Reformer—The Christian people will occupy the place of Moses.

Reply—But who are the Christian people that are to succeed Moses? There are many who claim to be Christian. There are Roman Catholics, Episcopalians, Methodists, Baptists, Presbyterians, Adventists, etc.,—who will rule for God in the place of Moses?

National Reformer—The Christian people of the country.

Reply—But who are the Christian people that are to rule for God? If they are yourself and the members of your association, where are your credentials? Moses had credentials from God and showed them to the people. Where are yours?

At this point the conversation was abruptly closed by the departure of the National Reformer, but insisting as he walked away that "the Christian people should rule in the proposed kingdom of God in America."

Some readers will doubtless smile at the absurd position of this member of the National Reform Association and think to pass the matter by with the remark that it is the wild scheme of a few well-meaning, but misguided, Scotch Presbyterians who have brought with them to this country some of their old Covenantor notions of government.

If these dangerous theories of government were confined to the minds of this small Presbyterian sect, the situation would not be so serious; but, astonishing as it is true, the great Christian Endeavor Society has committed itself to these same views.

It is proposed by them to establish the kingdom of God in America now, as the following quotations from the official reports of addresses at annual conventions clearly show:

The objective point of Christianity as taught must be changed. This, not other worldliness, must become the motive for action. The consummation of Christianity is not in a "happy land, far, far, away," but in this real, old sin-curved earth; nor is it to be looked for in the distant visionary "good time coming" or the "sweet by and by," but in the "near now and now."

The Christian church must be made to realize fully the spirit and purpose of Christ. Christ came not to establish a church, but a kingdom. The establishment of the kingdom of heaven on earth was the object of his mission.

But how is this kingdom of heaven to be established for the Lord in the earth by these Endeavorses? This way:

To the Christian Endeavorer politics means an

institution of righteousness, and party but the scaffolding around the rising kingdom of God. Politics, government, parties are not ends, but means.⁸

But how will these Christian Endeavorers make use of these political parties as "means" with which to establish the kingdom of God on the earth? Here is the answer:—

We mean to lay hands on politics, we mean to wash politics clean and clothe her in white raiment and make her an obedient handmaid to the Great King.⁹

But how is politics to be purified? By purifying the individual politician by preaching the gospel to him, the Christian's only purifying power? No, it is to be done this way:—

There must be about a million votes in these societies, or those who will vote very soon. . . . The number of such voters is going to increase mightily as this work goes on and our country will soon hear from them at the polls. . . . I want to serve notice on them [the politicians] now, that the time is drawing near when they will discover that a political revolution has occurred, and they will be found coming home from Washington and our State capitals out of a job.⁴

And who will get their jobs?

What is my work as a member of the good citizenship committee? It is to enthrone Christ in every town and city in the State, to have every mayor and every councilman a Christian, then Christ will rule.⁴

Christians must rise up in the interests of righteousness and take control of civil affairs.⁴

Influential Christian legislators must be chosen by Christian citizens.⁷

The boss must be supplanted by the patriotic good citizenship chairman.⁹

It will only be when Christian men . . . are elevated to places of trust and honor, and landed as heroes by the patriotic sentiment of the Republic that Christian citizenship will have reached the scene of its claims and the government will become in fact as well as in name a Christian government.⁹

When the managers of this movement have washed "politics clean" and clothed it in white raiment, by having themselves elected to office and made rulers for God, do they actually intend to attempt to enforce the laws of God by means of human statutes? The answer follows:—

We have a right to make and enforce human laws that shall call for the observance of the laws of God.¹⁰

But how do these "rulers for God" in this "kingdom of God," propose to find out the will of God:—

So it is with our nation. It is a world model and a century's wonder, and our Father has permitted many worldly agencies and many political parties to garnish its rising glories hitherto. But to-day we are entering the cloud line; we are marshalling for final victories, victories which only purified hearts and consecrated hands can win. The undertaking of to-day will bring us to the unapproachable curtains of Sinai; and all things worldly must pause while the children of God ascend alone to receive new laws from God's highest achievement in earthly government.¹¹

From all this it is seen that the powerful Christian Endeavor Society proposes to establish the kingdom of God on earth: that this it proposes to do by means of politics, by having its own members elected to office as the vice-rulers of God. Having done this they propose by human enactments to force upon all the people their own interpretation of the laws of God as the will of God. Did the papacy ever do more?

There are honest, conscientious Christians among them who "know not what they do," but what they are doing is none the less fatal to that which has been our nation's glory—religious freedom. Who in church councils, who in the councils of State, will have the courage to raise the voice of warring? B.
