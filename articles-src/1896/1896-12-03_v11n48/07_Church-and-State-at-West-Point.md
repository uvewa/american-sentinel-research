### CHURCH AND STATE AT WEST POINT.

The Catholic Standard and Times says that it is a "rule of the service" "at West Point that graduates [cadets?] of the academy must attend divine service on Sundays;" and that the Government "does provide an official chapel and pay a chaplain for non-Catholics." This is the ground of the application of the Catholics for permission to build a meeting house on the Government reservation. They say that as the rule requires the cadets to attend divine service, and the Catholic cadets cannot attend Protestant service; that as the Government provides a chapel for the Protestant service, it is only fair and a very small thing, that the Catholics should be allowed on the reservation to provide themselves a chapel for the benefit of the Catholic cadets.

The Standard and Times acknowledges that "very fine reasoning" upon the rule requiring attendance of the cadets at divine service, "if carried to its logical conclusion, must result in the inference that this is an unconstitutional provision, in view of the clause separating Church and State." But it argues that "unconstitutional or otherwise, there it is; and the Government is bound to give effect to its own regulation by providing means for holding divine service;" and that as the Government provides Protestant service, it is little enough that it allow the Catholics room there to provide themselves a place for service. And if the unconstitutional rule and its consequence is to stand, assuredly the reasoning of the Catholics is just. Indeed, under the existing circumstances, if as stated, it would be no more than just if they asked

the Government to provide at its own expense, a chapel and a chaplain for Catholic service as it does for Protestant service.

However, this whole matter simply shows how that in spite of the Constitution, the whole national system has become honeycombed with the encroachments of a State-supported religion, each particular instance of which is used as a precedent and ground for further encroachment. Oh! that the world might for just once behold a Christianity so genuine and consistent that it would despise all such ungenerous ways!
