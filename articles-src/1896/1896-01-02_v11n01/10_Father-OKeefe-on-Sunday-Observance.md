# "FATHER" O'KEEFE ON SUNDAY OBSERVANCE.

As promised, we reprint in this issue the letter of the Rev. M. O'Keefe on Sunday observance, to supply the numerous calls received for the same after its first publication.

In the Baltimore Methodist of Nov. 21, appears what is termed, "A Sufficient Reply" to this letter; but which is no reply at all so far as concerns the justification of Sunday observance or the enforcement of Sunday laws. No attempt is made by it in this direction, further than to quote a letter purporting to have been called out from another Catholic priest in answer to his coreligionist, and dealing mainly with the question of the Sunday saloon. As concerns this, we are, as we have often stated, in favor of a closed saloon on Sunday and on every other day of the week.

"Father" O'Keefe replies again through the Catholic Mirror of Dec. 7, noticing the absence of any effort on the part of his Protestant opponents to sustain Sunday keeping and Sunday enforcement from the Scriptures, and repeating the charge of Protestant inconsistency in pursuing a course contrary to the example of Christ and the apostles, and to the teaching of that Book which Protestantism proclaims its only guide in spiritual things. Referring to this fellow-priest, whom he deemed such only in pretension, he says:

What living Catholic priest is there who does not know that Protestantism has, contrary to its fundamental principles, abandoned its sole acknowledged teacher, the Bible, on the Sabbath question, and, guilty of a double apostasy, gone over, bag and baggage, to the teaching and practice of the Catholic Church? In putting the question, I must make honorable exception. I refer to the Seventh-day Adventists. They are the only consistent Protestants on earth. They follow the teachings of their Bible by keeping the Sabbath enjoined by God and their acknowledged guide, only to be fined, punished and imprisoned by their fellow Protestants even in the State of Maryland, for their consistency, whilst their prosecutors have shamefully abandoned the very principles for which they punish them.

"Father" O'Keefe is not the only Catholic who has pointed to seventh-day observers as the only consistent Protestants. "Father" Elliott, a "Paulist" priest, who has come into close contact with the former in Michigan and elsewhere, while he bitterly denounced them, said he thanked God that consistent Protestantism was narrowed down to one small sect.

As stated elsewhere, we are not in sympathy with the manner of expression used by "Father" O'Keefe in his arraignment of inconsistent Protestants. We have no sympathy with anything like a spirit of bitterness or railing, and prefer to see the truth stated free from any mixture of this kind. We published his letter because it emphasizes, by the testimony of a Roman Catholic through the organ of Cardinal Gibbons, a truth which every Protestant ought to know; namely, that the Bible gives no sanction to Sunday keeping or Sunday enforcement, and that consistent Protestantism is therefore separate from either one. As a testimony to this truth, we trust it will serve a useful purpose.
