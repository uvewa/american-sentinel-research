# A RELIGIOUS AMENDMENT PROPOSED.

Thus early in the first session of the 54th Congress, have the National Reformers secured the introduction of the following joint resolution proposing the establishment of a national religion and the adoption of a national creed:

## JOINT RESOLUTION

Proposing an amendment to the Constitution of the United States.

Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, ("two-thirds of such House concurring therein.). That the following amended form of preamble to the Constitution of the United States be submitted for ratification by conventions in the several States, which, when ratified by conventions in three-fourths of the States, shall be valid as a part of the said Constitution, namely:

## PREAMBLE.

We, the people of the United States (acknowledging Almighty God as the source of all power and authority in civil government, the Lord Jesus Christ as the ruler of nations, and His revealed will as of supreme authority in civil affairs) in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, ensure domestic tranquillity, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.

It may be asked, In what way would this establish a national religion and adopt a national creed? The answer is, the adoption of this proposed amendment would be to make so-called Christianity the national religion; the "revealed will" of the Lord Jesus Christ the national creed—not indeed really his revealed will, but that will as interpreted by the Government, just as a portion of it has already been interpreted by Congress in the Sunday closing clause of the World's Fair legislation, by the adoption of which, for the reasons given, the fourth commandment was interpreted as enjoining Sunday observance.
