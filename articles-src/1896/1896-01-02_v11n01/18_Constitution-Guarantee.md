The Coöperative Age, of St. Paul, Minn., noting in its issue of Dec. 19, some of the facts of the persecution of Seventh-day Adventists in Maryland and Tennessee, says: "The Constitution of the United States guarantees to every citizen of the country the right to worship God according to the dictates of his own heart. We are beginning to wonder what 'guarantee' means.

"It has come to pass in this 'free' country that in many States a man who worships God according to the Bible is a criminal.

"Is it not about time to curb the fanatics who seek to force others to worship God according to an intolerant bigot's notion or suffer imprisonment as heretics?"
