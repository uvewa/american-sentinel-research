The city of Tacoma, Washington, has passed an ordinance forbidding any barber shops to be open for business on Sunday. A barber named Krech said it seemed curious to him that the barber shops which wanted to close on Sunday had to have an ordinance before they could do it, and announced that he would keep his shop open as usual. He did so and was arrested and convicted. He appealed his case to the higher court, but the Sunday law was sustained. Of course if barbers can be rightfully forbidden to do business on Sunday, other tradesmen can be likewise restricted; so it will be in order next for the city to pass an ordinance commanding the closing of all places of business on the first day of the week. Only give the germ contained in this barbers' ordinance a chance to grow, and the upas tree of religious legislation will spring up speedily.
