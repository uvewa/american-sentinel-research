Speaking in regard to the principle which is believed to be at stake in the present controversy of this country with Great Britain, the New York Sun of Dec. 25 says:—

General Sherman spoke of war as hell; and unquestionably it is an infernal business, with its horrible destruction of life, the cruel physical suffering and mental anguish it causes, and its frightful waste of the fruits of industry. But there is something worse than war and more disastrous, and it is the sacrifice of principle by a nation in order to avert war.

But what about the sacrifice of the great principle of religious freedom—the very foundation principle of our national structure—which is going steadily on month by month, and year by year, as evidenced by such spectacles as that of eight honest and conscientious citizens serving in the chain-gang (seen in Tennessee last summer) for no other "crime" than that of setting apart the seventh day of the week, as enjoined by the law of God? Should there be anything done to preserve this principle?
