# "THE BREATH OF THE PURITAN."

[By Addison Blakely, Ph.D., Lecturer in Political Science and History, University of Chicago.]

In this Sunday agitation we have often heard our Puritan ancestors praised for the position they took on Sundayism. An eminent divine, inspired by his feelings of antagonism to Sunday activity, sometime ago uttered the meaningful words, "Oh, for the breath of the Puritan." These words have peculiar force in this connection, for in no thing were the early settlers more peculiar than in their radical ideas on Sundayism. That utterance, therefore, prompted the writer to collect the following "breath of Puritan law," prefacing them with a similar "breath" from Virginia:

A VIRGINIA "BREATH."

PENALTY OF DEATH FOR NON-ATTENDANCE AT CHURCH ON SUNDAY.

Every man and woman shall repair in the morning

to the divine service and sermons preached upon the sabbath day, and in the afternoon to divine service, and catechising, upon pain for the first fault to lose their provision, and the allowance for the whole week following;¹ for the second, to lose the said allowance and also be whipt; and for the third, to suffer death.²

Whoever shall absent himself from divine service any Sunday, without an allowable excuse, shall forfeit a pound of tobacco; and be that absenteth himself a month shall forfeit 50 lbs. of tobacco.³

SOME "BREATHS" FROM MASSACHUSETTS.

Further bee it enacted that whosoever shall pro- phane the Lords-day by doeing any servill worke or any such like abuses, shall forfeit for every such default teen shillings or be whipt.⁴

PRESUMPTIOUS SUNDAY DESCRIPTION TO BE PUNISHED BY DEATH.⁵

9. This court taking notice of great abuse, and many misdemeanors, committed by divers persons in these many ways. Profaning the Sabbath or Lord's day, to the great dishonor of God, Reproach of Religion, and Grief of the spirits of God's People.

Do therefore Order, That whosoever shall profane the Lord's-day, by doing unnecessary servils Work, by unnecessary travelling, or by sports or recreations, be or they that so transgress, shall forfeit for every such default forty shillings, or be publicly whipt; But if it clearly appear that the sin was proudly, Presumptuously and with a high hand committed, against the known Command and Authority of the blessed God, such a person therein despleting and reproaching the Lord, shall be put to death or grievously punished at the Judgment of the Court.

10. And whosoever shall frequently neglect the public Worship of God on The Lords-day, that is approved by this Government, shall forfeit for every such default convicted of, ten shillings, especially where it appears to arise from negligence, Idleness, or Prophanesis of Spirit.

PENALTY FOR TRAVELING ON THE LORD'S DAY.

To prevent prophanation of the Lords-day by foreigners or any other unnecessary travelling through our Townes on that day; It is enacted by the Court that a fitt man in each town be chosen unto whom whosoever hath necessity for travelling on the Lords-day in case of danger or death or such necessities occasions shall repairs and making out such occasions satisfying to him shall receive a Ticket from him to pass on about such like occasions which if the traveller attend not unto; It shall be lawful for the Constable or any man that meets him to take him up and stop him until he be brought before authority or pay his fine for such transgression as by law in that case is provided: and that if it after shall appear that his plea was false then may he be apprehended at another time and made to pay his fine as aforesaid.¹

2 This was at the time the Virginia plantation held all things in common; and if the sabbath was not observed according to the requirements of the government, all supplies were cut off.

3 "The first settlers [of Virginia] were emigrants from England, of the English Church, just at a point of time when it was flushed with complete victory over the religions of all other persuasions. Possessed, as they became, of the powers of making, administering, and executing the laws, they showed equal intolerance in this country with their Presbyterian brethren who had emigrated to the Northern government. Several acts of the Virginia Assembly, of 1655, 1661, and 1695, had made it penal in parents to refuse to have their children baptised; had prohibited the "unlawful" assembling of Quakers; had made it penal for any master of a person to bring a quarter into the State; and ordered those already there, and such as should come thereafter, to be imprisoned till they should abjure the country, provided a milder penalty for the first and second return, but death for their third. If no capital executions took place here, as did in New England, it was not owing to the moderation of the church, or spirit of the legislation, as may be inferred from the law itself; but to historical circumstances which have not been handed down to us."

6 "The Book of the General Laws of the Inhabitants of the Jurisdiction of New Plymouth, collected out of the records of the General Court, and lately revised, and with some connotations and additions, established and disposed into such order and in the same manner as general use and benefit, and published by authority of the General Court for that jurisdiction, held at Plymouth, the sixth of June, abandon, 1671.

7 "The tithingman also watched to see that 'no young people walked abroad on the eve of the sabbath,' that is, on a Saturday night (after sundown). He also marked and reported of those 'who [ye at home,' and others who 'prohibited, and were making time on the Lordess Duke,' all the 'sons of Belial strutting about, setting on fences, and otherwise demurating the day.' These last two classes of offenders were first admonished by the

Whosoever shall profane the Lord's day, or any part of it, either by sinful servils work, or by unlawful sport, recreation or otherwise, whether wilfully or in a careless neglect, shall be duly punished by fine, imprisonment, or responsibly, according to the nature, and measure of the sin, and offence. But if the court upon examination, by clear, and satisfying evidence find that the sin was proudly, presumptuously, and with a high hand committed against the known command and authority of the blessed God, such a person therein despleting and reproaching the Lord shall be put to death, that all others may fears and shun such provoking rebellious courses.⁸

tithingman, then 'sett in stocks,' and then cited before the Court. They were also confined in the cage on the meeting-house green, with the Lord's Day Sleepers. The tithingman could arrest any who walked or rode too fast a pace to and from meeting, and he could arrest any who 'walked' or rode unnecessarily on the sabbath. Great and small alike were better to commit to the notice from the Columbine, Orefried of December, 1789, abundantly proven. It is entitled 'The President and the Tiding man.'

"The President (George Washington), on his return to New York from his late tour through Connection, having missed his way on Saturday, was obliged to ride a few miles on Sunday morning in order to gain the town at which he had proposed to have a new structure, and to have however, be was met by a tithing man, who commanding him to stop, demanded the occasion of his riding: 'and it was not until the President had informed him of every circumstance and promised to go no further than the town intended that the tithing man would permit him to proceed on his journey.' Earle's "Sabbath in Puritan New England," pp. 74, 75.

Though some of the orders intended for present convenience may probably be hereafter altered, and imposed requires other Laws added. London 1638." Reprinted at Hartford, 1878. The laws of the adjoining colonies were copied from the laws of Massachusetts, which accounts for their likeness here, although I have transcribed the Plymouth laws from a book of a later date.
