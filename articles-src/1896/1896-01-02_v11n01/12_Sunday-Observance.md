# SUNDAY OBSERVANCE.

Letter From Rev. M. O'Keefe on this Subject.

[From the Catholic Mirror, Baltimore, Md., Nov. 9.]

IN response to an invitation to attend a meeting of ministers in Towson, Father O'Keefe replied as follows:—

Towson, Baltimore Co., Md.,
Oct. 23, 1895.

REV. MESSRS. J. FRED HEISSE, W. G. CASSARD, and C. E. GUTHRIE.—Gentlemen: I am in receipt of your esteemed favor of the 19th instant, courteously inviting me to attend a meeting in the lecture room of the M. E. Church, Towson, at 2:30 P. M. to-morrow, as follows:—

REV. M. O'KEEFE—Reserved and Dear Brother: The violations of the Sunday laws in your county is flagrant. The exposure of guilty parties is arresting attention. We desire a conference of the ministers of the county. Please meet us in the lecture room of the Towson M. E. Church, at 2:30 o'clock, next Thursday afternoon, Oct. 24. Sunday laws must be enforced. Come. Do not disappoint us.

Your Brethren,

J. FRED HEISSE.
W. G. CASSARD.
C. E. GUTHRIE.

October 19, 1895.

In reply, I would beg leave to say that whilst fully appreciating the courtesy extended me as a clergyman residing in the county, I am at loss to conjecture whether the invitation may be regarded as referring to me as a citizen or clergyman, or as both combined. Anyhow I regret to be obliged to state that I could not conscientiously participate in a discussion of the infraction of the Sunday laws.

Holding no office under the civil law, whether as judge, magistrate, sheriff, squire, bailiff, constable, detective or spy, paid or unpaid, I could not help regarding myself otherwise than as an officious intermeddler in the legitimate business of the proper officers appointed to execute the laws, and who would very naturally regard my action as a gratious piece of interference in their legitimate calling.

The above officials under county commissioners are the responsible officers entrusted with the duty of taking due cognizance of all such violations, and, doubtless, are as willing and ready as they are competent to bring all violators of the law to condign punishment. Hence, as a citizen of this great republic, I am amenable to the laws enacted by the people's representation for the benefit and happiness of the masses, and as one of the number, I highly appreciate and duly enjoy with undisguised gratitude the temporal blessings assured to every law-abiding citizen under that glorious flag of ours, which is the synonym of that genuine and plenary liberty attainable nowhere else on this planet.

Nevertheless, as a citizen neither the holder of nor aspirant to any office, State or Federal, I am happy and contented in the role of a private individual, neither invited nor aspiring to a participation in the control or management of public offices. Nor does my position as a recognized minister of the Christian religion seem to call for, or warrant any such interference. I hold in such esteem the divine calling I so unworthily represent that I would never, during my long life, avail myself of the right to register my vote for one or other political party; nor am I ever likely to do so, unless, indeed, that the ghost of "Sam"—defunct Knownothingism—should once more develop itself in A. P. A.ism or other kindred, dark-lantern conspiracy, as it did in the earlier fifties only to be crushed to powder by the voice and votes of an indignant people, uncompromisingly jealous of their liberty, religious as well as civil.

It is not, then, with me a question of right, but one of expediency as to whether I could consent to mire my priestly robes in the turbid and foul waters of muddy politics.

Hence, as a clergyman, I question the propriety or expediency of interfering, indirectly even, in the execution, or rather failure (if it prove so), on the part of officials to execute the Sunday laws, which are of a purely civil character.

As representatives of Christianity, we occupy a very questionable, nay, highly mortifying position, viz: to be obliged to acknowledge that the moral power of the Christian religion is lamentably inadequate to reform, measurably at least, the morals of its votaries without having recourse to the aid and interference of the civil law by imposing civil pains and penalties; thereby, publicly confessing the mortifying and shameful failure of Christianity to compass one of the chief ends of its institution and mission, viz: the culture of the moral law in the heart of Christians. For the above reason, and others equally cogent (had I time to unfold them), I am reluctantly compelled to forego the pleasure which a meeting with my fellow citizens for discussion of the question named in the invitation would afford me.

Deeply impressed with the above views, during a long life as citizen and clergyman, I regret that our views as to the object of the meeting do not harmonize.

As a Catholic clergyman, I have ever been an earnest and steadfast advocate of Sunday observance; and I may say, too, without ego-tism, a life-long impersonation of total abstinence, and whilst I sincerely regret the use of intoxicants, I never could consent to be in touch with those who, in their rank fanaticism, would rob man of that God-given freedom which would be to him an inalienable gift and treasure. Two wrongs never made a right: and the drunkard and the fanatic are equally a nuisance—the latter the more dangerous of the two.

Whilst dealing with the question, I publicly own that I have never but once in my life tasted liquor, and then whilst presumably in the jaws of death from yellow fever, my physican admonished me that death was inevitable, unless I consented to use a mini-julep—the vomit, the last stage of yellow fever, having set in. I then touched liquor for the first and last time during a life fast verging on the three-score and ten.

Before closing this letter, I would call attention to a distinction between violation of the divine and civil law. The latter enacts a penalty from the man who sells liquor on Sunday, on conviction, and should intoxication result to the individual, he is amenable to the law of God for his complicity in the crime of drunkenness, not because of Sunday, for the same guilt attaches to any other day. Were he and his victims Catholics, they are both before God guilty of the additionable crime of desecration of the Lord's day. This is the result of an overt act of disobedience to the voice of the Church, commanding her children to keep the Sunday "holy," God commanding us to hear her voice. But, reverend sirs, let me admonish you that no Protestant, true to the principles of his religion and conscientiously obedient to his teacher, the Bible, need ever have misgivings as regards the freedom of Sunday; nay, more, his teacher is consistent in impressing on him in every page of the New Testament as well as of the Old, that God has appointed the Sabbath or Saturday as the day set apart by him for his worship.

Our Saviour, whilst on earth, kept no other day; and we learn that for over thirty years after his death, the Acts of the Apostles record the fact that the Apostles consistently kept their divine Master's Sabbath (the Sabbath which the Jews have kept ever since for over eighteen centuries, they having the same teacher, the Bible, as you have) according to the practice and teachings of Christ and his apostles, without modification, as testified by the New Testament from Matthew's Gospel to the Revelation. This statement is absolutely true and unsusceptible of successful contradiction; imagine, then, my surprise on reading in the city papers yesterday of the anomalous and self-stultifying position occupied by you, as accredited ministers of the Christian religion, assuming the role of . . . spies—a self-constituted smelling committee—for you represent no civil office whatsoever, laying snares and traps to inveigle the unwary that you might drag them before the civil courts for violation of a purely civil law, forbidding the sale of liquor on the first day of each week. On what grounds, may I ask, can you justify such proceedings? How were these people interfering with you in the practice of your religious acts? Place your finger on any page of your acknowledged divine teacher, the Bible, and show the world the proof that, on your own principles, they had violated any ordinance of the Christian religion. I hereby denounce your conduct in this matter as not only highly reprehensible, but as being in direct violation of the revealed will of God as taught by your Bible.

You had succeeded in getting a verdict against them before the civil courts for transgression against the civil law. I now in the presence of the public pronounce you, on your principles, guilty of the grossest misdemeanor, thousands of times over, against the divine law.

When, let me ask, have you, even once, in your lifetime, kept the command of God: "Remember the Sabbath-day to keep it holy"? Which day is the Sabbath? I answer, the last day of the week, the day kept by God himself, and for that reason assigned by him for observance by man, the Sabbath or the day kept by the Redeemer and his apostles whilst they lived on earth.

You pose before the world as models of Christian morality, and behold every week of your lives you are guilty of gross violation of one of God's most positive precepts, "Remember the Sabbath," etc. Let me illustrate in order to prove God's earnestness in this respect: "And it came to pass, when the children of Israel were in the wilderness; and had found a man gathering sticks on the Sabbath-day; that they brought him to Moses and Aaron,

and the whole multitude. And they put him into prison, not knowing what they should do with him. And the Lord said to Moses: Let that man die, let all the multitude stone him without the camp. And when they had brought him out, they stoned him, and he died as the Lord commanded." Num. 15:32-36. Such, Rev. Sirs, was the punishment meted out by command of God to a man who was guilty but once of an infraction of the law of the Sabbath, whilst each one of you is guilty of a similar desecration of the Sabbath (Saturday) each Saturday of his life—and this on the unerring testimony of your own teacher, the Bible. "Out of thy mouth I judge thee thou wicked servant."

Nor has God's counsels changed by the exercise of infinite patience. He can afford to abide his time for the vindication of his authority and contempt of his commands. The precept, "Remember the Lord's day to keep it holy," is as obligatory now as it was in the Old Law, as in the instance above quoted. Can you offer the slightest pretext or palliation for your abandonment of your teacher, the Bible, which enjoins absolutely the keeping of that day, kept by God himself first, after the creation? You pursued the violators of the civil law unrelentingly and did not cease, until you secured a conviction. How, may I ask, will you fare when cited before the divine Tribunal, and compelled to confess from the pages of the divine Record, which you boast of as your guide and teacher, that you have never once obeyed the Sabbath precept, and that you stand to-day before God, heaven and earth as the most unmitigated Sabbath breakers on earth? Do I exaggerate in the slightest degree the unscrupulous antagonism to the law of the Sabbath evinced by you every week of your lives? Not in the least. And for the purpose of leaving you not a shadow of excuse, I herewith present each of you two pamphlets containing the countless proofs of your apostasy from the teachings of the Bible, your sole and recognized teacher. I defy you to disprove these pamphlets. Observe silence with regard to them, and the public must conclude that you rank, as I have already designated you, amongst the champion Sabbath breakers on earth, as the pamphlets, based on God's Word, your guide, prove you to be.

I have no sympathy with violations of the civil law, but when men are hunted down by self-righteous, self-constituted . . . spies and detectives, whose record as violators of one of God's most positive precepts is unquestionable, I am reminded of Satan rebuking sin.

I will now conclude with the word of rebuke spoken by our divine Saviour (Matt.7:2): "And why seest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye [the violations of the civil law] and seest not the beam in thy own" (the life-long career of a Sabbath breaker)? "Or how sayest thou to thy brother: Let me cut the mote out of thy eye; and behold a beam is in thy own eyes? Thou hypocrite; cast out first the beam out of thy own eye, and then shalt thou see to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye." Remove the beam before you search for the mote.

Having assigned you your true position as champion biblical Sabbath breakers, whilst I have shown that the victims of your self-righteous, arrogant and unjustifiable persecution, were merely violators of the civil law, a crime insignificant compared with yours, I close this correspondence with the sincere hope that you will reopen it with a manly effort at self-vindication. Count on a reply.

M. O'KEEFE,
Catholic Pastor, Towson.
