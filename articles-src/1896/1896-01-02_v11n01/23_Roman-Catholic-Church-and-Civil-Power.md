"Father" O'Keefe's position as to the correct attitude of the Church toward the civil power and toward civil authority cannot be successfully assailed. Nor have the Baltimore ministers attempted to assail his position. We have no right to question this priest's sincerity in the matter, so far as his own practice is concerned, but his letter to these Protestant ministers is a fearful arraignment of the policy which his own church has pursued, in every age and in every country. The Roman Catholic Church has sought and obtained the aid of the civil power wherever she could, and this is freely admitted in standard Roman Catholic publications. A "Catholic Dictionary," published in this city by Benziger Bros., "Printers to the Holy Apostolic See," says of the Inquisition:—

The duties and powers of inquisitors are minutely laid down in the canon law, it being always assumed that the civil power will favor or can be compelled to favor, their proceedings. Thus it is laid down that they "have power to constrain all magistrates, even secular magistrates, to cause the statutes against heretics to be observed," and to require them to swear to do so; also that they can "compel all magistrate and judges to execute their sentences, and these must obey on pain of excommunication;" also that inquisitors in causes of heresy "can use the secular arm," and that "all temporal rulers are bound to obey inquisitors in causes of faith."

Cardinal Gibbons, in "Faith of Our Fathers," page 269, quotes from that eminent Catholic theologian, Becanus, the statement that "religious liberty may be tolerated by a ruler when it would do more harm to the State or to the community to repress it." "This," the cardinal says, "is the true Catholic teaching on this point."

"Father" O'Keefe very properly and justly arraigns the preachers to whom he writes on the charge of inconsistency in transgressing the fourth commandment, the only Sabbath law in the sacred Scriptures; and they have made no attempt whatever to reply to him upon this point, nor are they likely to do so. But it is in vain that "Father" O'Keefe or any other Roman Catholic, or any number of Roman Catholics pose before the people as advocates of total separation of Church and State, and non-interference in politics; for, as we have seen, it is and always has been the policy of that church to control and use the civil power, wherever possible, to further the interests of "the church."
