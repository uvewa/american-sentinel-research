# What of the Future?

What the present Congress will do it is of course impossible to tell; but indications are not lacking that it is ambitious to make a "reform" record. Already there has been introduced into both the Senate, and House, the joint resolution which we print on page 6; but even if adopted, this proposed amendment would add but little to what we already have in general orders, religious proclamations, the practice of employing chaplains, State and national statutes, and judicial decisions.

Judge Brewer's dictum of Feb. 29, 1892, that this is a "Christian nation," while theoretically without force as law, has practically nullified that portion of the First Amendment which declares that "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof." Being a "Christian nation," it follows that the "Christian" religion is the religion of the nation, and that its institutions are to be protected because they are "Christian." Such was probably the most potent argument (aside from threatened political boycott) urged in behalf of the World's Fair Sunday-closing clause. But be this as it may, the trend of events in this country and in the world cannot be mistaken. Everywhere the Papacy is being exalted either in its own proper character, or by the adoption of its institutions, dogmas and methods.
