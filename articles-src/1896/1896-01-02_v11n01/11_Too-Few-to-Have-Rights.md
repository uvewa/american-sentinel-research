# TOO FEW TO HAVE RIGHTS.

Such is the meaning of the decision rendered by the British Home Secretary (London), in the case of the International Tract Society, located on Holloway Road, in that city, the prosecutions of which for Sunday labor we have several times mentioned. Recently the society addressed to the Home Secretary the following appeal:

The Board of Directors of the International Tract Society, Limited, beg respectfully that you will allow them to call your attention to the following facts, showing the operation of the Sunday clause in the Factory Act in the case of our printing works, situated at 451 Holloway Road, N.

By the seizure of machinery and material to satisfy fines imposed for allowing certain women and young persons to work on Sunday we are compelled to close the factory.

For six years in our present factory our work was allowed to proceed without interference. Visiting inspectors recognized the fact that the spirit of the Act was complied with, and that the violation was only technical. We being observers of the seventh day of the week, and all our employés being of like faith, our works have been entirely closed on the Sabbath, and opened on Sunday.

Further, had we been able conscientiously to sign the Jewish exemption form, we might have continued without interference. But we are Christians—the International Tract Society, Limited, being one of the publishing branches of the Seventh-day Adventist denomination—and cannot truthfully enter ourselves as Jews under the Act. Thus the administration of the law discriminates against us as Christians, forbidding that which would be allowed us did we falsely declare ourselves Jews.

We have not been contending for our rights nor for our convenience in doing business. But God's right to our obedience to the fourth commandment is not ours to surrender, nor can we obey that commandment to keep the Sabbath holy and at the same time keep the Sunday—an institution established by human authority in opposition to the Sabbath—even as we could not serve God and at the same time recognize other gods. In effect the law has sought to compel us to recognize a religious institution which loyalty to the law of God requires that we should not observe.

We acknowledge the uniform courtesy of her majesty's inspectors who have taken this new departure regarding our relation to the Factory Act, but we have felt it not disrespectful to address you this note of remonstrance against the action of a law by which the work of our factory is stopped and our factory employés deprived of this means of earning a livelihood. In the act these are named as "protected persons," but by the operation of the act they have been shut out from their work.

We respectfully submit that this is an injustice not contemplated by the framers of the act.

This appeal was published in the London Daily Graphic, of Dec. 5, from which we take it. In the Graphic of Dec. 17, appears the following reply from the Home Secretary:

Whitehall, 13th Dec., 1895.

SIR,—With reference to your letter of the 1st inst., drawing attention to the operation of Section 31 of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1878, in as far as it affects the printing works of the International Tract Society at 451 Holloway Road, I am directed by the Secretary of State to acquaint you that the matter has already received his very careful consideration; but, as the law at present stands, the Seventh-day Advent-

ists cannot be exempted from the penalties consequent upon a breach of the factory laws as to Sunday labor. The Secretary of State does not think the numbers of the sect afford any hope or reason for legislation to alter their position.

I am, Sir,
Your obedient Servant,
KESELM E. DUBBY.
The Secretary, International Tract Society,
451 Holloway Road, N.

Thus it appears that these Christian seventh-day observers are refused justice and freedom of conscience on the ground that they are few in number, and this too by one of the world's great "Christian" nations. If they were able to cast any considerable vote, so as to be a power in politics, then it would be quite proper to let them have their rights! We are living in the closing years of the nineteenth century, but everywhere it is evident that men still have more respect for might than for right.
