# PERSECUTION AT DARRELL, ONTARIO.

BY J. G. LAMSON.

On Sunday, Nov. 3, 1895, three ministers. A. O. Burrill, P. M. Howe, and William Simpson, having rested the day previous according to their belief, were engaged in slacking lime, preparatory to the erection of a church building for the Seventh day Adventist denomination at Darrell, Ont. These ministers had been preaching at or near Darrell for some time, their ministry had borne fruit, and it was decided to erect a house of worship. The ire of the neighboring church people was aroused, and they set spies to watch whether the Adventist ministers would labor on Sunday.

Ontario has what is known as a "Lord's Day Act," it being copied almost verbatim from the statute of King Charles the Second, which was first enacted about eighteen years after the Cromwellian period,

This statute provides that "a person shall not do any worldly labor, business, or work of his ordinary calling on Sunday." The labor of the ministers was certainly not of their ordinary calling, but it was an easy matter for the prosecutors to overcome this; for it was alleged that they did work of a worldly nature of "one of their ordinary callings."

Under this information sworn to in the case of one of the ministers, testimony was offered showing that the ordinary callings of the men were those of laborer, carpenter, or mason. Witnesses were very willing to swear to this, but every one of them swore positively that they did not know that these three men were ministers, in spite of the fact that two of them, at least, had preached for three months in succession in the neighborhood of Darrell. The witnesses admitted attending the meetings that the Adventist ministers had held, and yet all the witnesses swore positively that they did not know that the defendants were ministers.

The complaining witnesses went twenty-two miles in order to get the matter before a justice where there was a prospect of conviction. The city of Chatham, with several magistrates, queen's counsel, and the County Court, were passed by, and the prosecutions were taken to Hidgetown, twenty-two to twenty-four miles away. The cases were tried Dec. 5th, and the remaining two Dec. 12th, the decision in the last case, that of the farmer, being reserved for seven days, bringing the decision for that one, Dec. 19.

The three ministers were convicted and sentenced to pay fines, ranging from ten to twenty dollars, and in default of fine, forty to sixty days in jail.

An appeal has been taken in the three cases of the ministers, while the farmer's case was dismissed, it having been decided several times that farmers do not come within the statute.

In speaking of the testimony given by one of the witnesses (a student for the Methodist ministry who sometimes preaches), one of the attorneys for the prosecution said: "It is inconceivable that a man who is studying for the ministry of a rival denomination should be so zealous to enforce laws against these people, and have nothing but the honor of the British law in mind. Were he an honest man he would enforce all law equally with this one against a rival denomination."

At the close of the trials of the ministers, several leading citizens expressed their abhorrence of such proceedings, and such a manifest travesty of justice. "It is to be regretted," said one, "that these people are not permitted to worship God as they choose, and then go quietly about their work upon Sunday, if they want to."

There was not a word of testimony to the effect that the work done by the defendants had disturbed any one in the least, except in their religious feelings. One testified that he was pained; another that his religious "scruples" were wounded! The witnesses who testified to the last expression, upon being questioned by the attorney, admitted that had he stayed away from the place where the work was being done, it would not have hurt him at all.

The witness in these prosecutions gets half the fine, if one is paid. This may add somewhat to the understanding of why the prosecutions were begun.

The cases will come up on motion to quash in the high court in Toronto, some time in January or February, and it is to be hoped that the honorable court will be able to weigh, impartially, the questions at stake, and remember that her majesty, Queen Victoria, issued a proclamation in 1858, in which she said:—

Firmly relying ourselves on the truth of Christianity, and acknowledging with gratitude the solace of religion, we disclaim alike the right and the desire to impose our convictions on any of our subjects. We declare it to be our royal will and pleasure that none be in anywise favored, none molested nor disguisted, by reason of their religious faith or observance, but that all shall alike enjoy the equal and impartial protection of the law; and we do strictly charge and enjoin all those who may be in authority under us, that they abstain from all interference with the religious belief or worship of any of our subjects, under pain of our highest displeasure.

Not only should the court have in mind her

majesty's government, but they should also remember that before God they will be held accountable for any obstacle they may lay in the way of any being who is a free moral agent in his worship of God. They should remember that it is impossible that any man can delegate to any other man the right to say whether he shall worship God or not. Neither is it within the power of any individual to say how another individual shall worship God.

Absolute religious liberty alone, and positive silence on the matter of religious laws, is the only way by which a government can place it beyond the power of any fanatic to inflict persecution upon his fellow-beings.
