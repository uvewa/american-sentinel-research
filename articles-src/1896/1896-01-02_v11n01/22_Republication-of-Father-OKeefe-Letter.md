We reprint on another page "Father" O'Keefe's letter to certain "Protestant" preachers of Baltimore, in reply to an invitation to participate in a meeting in the interests of legal Sunday enforcement. This letter first appeared in the Catholic Mirror, the official organ of Cardinal Gibbons. This fact, rather than the name of the writer, gives it significance. The reason for republishing this letter is a demand for copies of it which we were not able to supply when it first appeared in our columns.
