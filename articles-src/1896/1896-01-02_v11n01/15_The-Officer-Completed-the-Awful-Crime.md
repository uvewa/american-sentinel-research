# THE OFFICER COMPLETED THE AWFUL CRIME.

[New York World, Dec. 16.]

A FARMER named Schwab, living in Bronxdale, bought a fine milch cow in the East forty-sixth Street stockyards Saturday afternoon. Schwab wanted his cow before Monday, and at 6 A. M. yesterday Solomon Beck, a young man living at 107 East Fifty-second Street, was sent to deliver her. The animal was made comfortable in the box of a big express wagon, and Beck started for Bronxdale. He drove through four police precincts passing dozens of policemen unmolested and had arrived within a half mile of Schwab's barn when Patrolman Dermody, of the Tremont station, stopped him.

"Don't you know you are breaking the law?" he asked.

"No," answered Beck.

"Where are you taking that cow?" asked the officer.

"Over to Schwab's farm," responded the driver, smiling at what he supposed the policeman meant to be a joke.

"Don't laugh," said Dermody, "I'm in dead earnest. By delivering that cow on Sunday, you are breaking the Sunday law and I'll have to lock you up."

With that he jumped in beside Beck and ordered him to drive to the station house. The sergeant received the complaint, and Beck was locked up.

"What shall we do with the cow?" asked Dermody.

"You'd better go over and deliver it yourself," said the sergeant, and an hour later the blascous arrived at Schwab's farm with the cow.
