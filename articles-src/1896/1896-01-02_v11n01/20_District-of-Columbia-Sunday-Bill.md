December 6, Representative Morse, of Massachusetts, introduced into the House a bill entitled, "A bill for the protection of the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday, as a day of rest and worship in the District of Columbia." The text of this bill is as follows:—

Be it enacted by the Senate and the House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, that on the first day of the week, known as the Lord's day, set apart by general consent in accordance with divine appointment as a day of rest and worship, it shall be unlawful to perform any labor, except works of necessity and mercy and work by those who religiously observe Saturday, if performed in such a way as not to involve or disturb others; also to open places of business or traffic, except in the case of drug stores for the dispensing of medicines; also to make contracts or transact other commercial business; also to engage in noisy amusements for gain, or entertainments for which admittance fees are charged; also to perform any court service, except in connection with arrests of criminals and service of process to prevent fraud.

Section 2. That the penalty for violating any provision of this Act shall be a fine of not less than $10 for the first offense; for second or subsequent offenses a fine not exceeding $50, and imprisonment for not less than ten nor more than thirty days, and one year's forfeiture of license, if any is held by the offender or his employer.

Section 3. That this act shall take effect upon its passage.

Drs. H. H. George and W. F. Crafts are both working for the passage of this bill.
