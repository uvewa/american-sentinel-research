# NATIONAL REFORM CONVENTION IN BALTIMORE.

As noted in our last issue, the National Reform Association held its annual convention in Baltimore, Dec. 12-14. The attendance was small, but as the real work of the association is done by means of local meetings, addresses before churches and colleges, and by the dissemination of National Reform literature, its influence cannot be measured by the number attending its conventions.

Among the speakers present were Rev. W. F. Crafts; Rev. J. M. Foster, of Boston; Rev. David McAllister, editor of the Christian Statesman; and Rev. R. C. Wylie, of Pittsburgh.

Mr. Foster is "a stalwart of the stalwarts" among National Reformers, and at the conclusion of his address Rev. C. A. Fulton, pastor of the Immanuel Baptist Church in which the convention was held, and who presided at this particular meeting, rose and said: "I have accepted an invitation to preside over to-night's meeting, but if I thought for an instant that the gentleman who has spoken represented the views of this gathering, my own feelings and my conscience would compel me to decline to take any part in it."

Dr. McAllister rose and assured the pastor that every word spoken in the conference was simply a personal expression of the speaker and could in no wise be taken as a declaration of the association. This satisfied Mr. Fulton, and the discussion was ended for the time being. And this notwithstanding the fact that Mr. Foster has for years been prominent not only upon the National Reform lecture platform and pulpit, but as a writer for the Christian Statesman. However, the doctor need not have made his disclaim of responsibility for Mr. Foster's sentiments so broad, for Mr. Fulton is reported by the Baltimore Sun as saying subsequently: "When I spoke Thursday, after an address of Rev. J. M. Foster, of Boston, I was in favor of this part of his remark [the "Christian" amendment], but opposed his idea that Christians should refrain from voting until the Constitution is so amended."

A protest against the National Reform scheme was received from Mr. E. Livesey, a citizen of Baltimore. It was in part, as follows:

The purposes of the National Reform Association are thoroughly revolutionary, as they are to change entirely the character of our Constitution. This Constitution was wisely framed by the fathers of this Republic. The name of God was omitted because they wished to establish religious liberty and a purely secular form of government; Church and State were to be forever separate.

It was declared that Congress should make no laws for the establishment of any religion. Religion, as Madison declares, was not within the "purview of government," and Washington affirmed in the treaty of Tripoli "that in no sense whatsoever is this Government founded upon the Christian religion."

These are the foundation principles of our Government. The question arises, is it policy to change our form of government and inaugurate a new scheme, make this a religious government and put God and Christ and the Bible in the Constitution and radically reform its spirit and purpose?

In reply to this, Dr. McAllister reiterated the usual National Reform argument. He asked, "Who discovered America?"—"Christians." That settles the whole matter. Being discovered by "Christians," it follows that the country is "Christian." But has it never occurred to Dr. McAllister that this country was also discovered by Roman Catholics? Is he willing to grant that it is therefore or ought of right to be Roman Catholic? Rome thinks so.

There is, however, Christianity and "Christianity." The former is the religion of Christ, and does not seek the aid of the civil power to make men religious, neither does it put a premium upon hypocrisy by making "Christians" the only office-holdiers, as National Reform proposes to do by disfranchising "every logically consistent infidel," or in other words, every honest man who should refuse to wear the regulation National Reform collar. The latter, or "Christianity," is not able to stand alone and so seeks the support of civil "law," police clubs, army rifles, etc.

Among the resolutions adopted was one demanding the adoption of the proposed amendment which we print on page 6; another in favor of Sunday observance; and another requesting the Executive Board of the Association to maintain a representative at Washington "to prosecute a vigorous policy on moral issues in the course of legislation."

A resolution condemning secret societies which take a hand in politics was promptly tabled when it was brought up.

The next annual convention is to be held in Philadelphia.
