# Uncertainties Log - American Sentinel v11n01 (1896-01-02)

## General Notes

This issue was transcribed from OCR text provided in a markdown file. The OCR source appears to be of reasonably good quality, though some uncertainties remain.

## Specific Uncertainties

### Page 2, Article "Statutes Overridden"
- **Text fragment:** "The Chemical Seminary"
- **Context:** This phrase appears mid-paragraph without clear connection to surrounding text about Illinois Sunday law violations
- **Transcribed as:** Included exactly as it appeared in the OCR source
- **Confidence:** LOW - appears to be a misplaced header or OCR error
- **Reason:** The phrase makes no sense in context and may be from a different column or advertisement

### Page 3, Article "Practical Christian Sociology"
- **Word:** "broad" (in "As often as ye eat this broad and drink this cup")
- **Context:** Biblical quotation from 1 Corinthians 11:26
- **Transcribed as:** "broad"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM - should likely be "bread"
- **Reason:** OCR misread common word in biblical quotation, but preserved exactly as it appeared

### Page 5, Article "Sunday Observance" (O'Keefe letter)
- **Word:** "disguisted" (in Queen Victoria proclamation quotation)
- **Context:** "none molested nor disguisted"
- **Transcribed as:** "disguisted"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM - likely should be "disquieted"
- **Reason:** Preserved exact OCR reading; appears to be period spelling variant or OCR error

### Page 7, Article "The Officer Completed the Awful Crime"
- **Word:** "blascous"
- **Context:** "an hour later the blascous arrived at Schwab's farm"
- **Transcribed as:** "blascous"
- **Confidence:** LOW - meaning unclear
- **Reason:** Likely OCR error for "officer" or similar word, but preserved as written

### Page 7, Footnote references
- **Multiple archaic or unclear references** in the Puritan laws section
- **Examples:** "Reason, 1696" (likely "Boston"), "abandon, 1671" (likely a date error)
- **Transcribed as:** Exactly as they appeared
- **Confidence:** LOW to MEDIUM
- **Reason:** Historical document citations may contain period abbreviations or OCR errors

## OCR Quality Assessment

Overall OCR quality: **GOOD**

The source OCR appears to have been professionally done, with most text clear and readable. Main issues are:
- Occasional word substitutions (broad/bread)
- Some proper names may have variants
- Footnote and citation formatting sometimes unclear
- A few completely unclear insertions (e.g., "The Chemical Seminary")

All text was preserved exactly as it appeared in the OCR source file, following the project's principle of faithful reproduction.
