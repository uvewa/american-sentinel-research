## A NEW FEATURE FOR "MISSIONARY" CONVENTIONS.

The "Illinois Missionary Association of the Christian Church," announces a new feature in the program of its coming annual session, to be held in Eureka, Ill., July 28 to August 6. Press reports speak of it as follows:—

A new feature has been introduced in the program this year, which tends to greatly increase the interest in the occasion; that is a series of political speeches, each party to be represented by one of the leading men of the State. Wednesday, July 29, Halo Johnson, of Newton, Prohibition candidate for Vice-President, will be present and speak. Thursday, Governor John P. Altgeld will speak as the representative of Democracy. Friday, Hon. A. J. Hopkins, Congressman from the Eighth Illinois District, will discuss the great questions of the day from the standpoint of a Republican. This speech will close the series.

The remainder of the meeting will be divided between the various conventions of organizations pertaining to the Christian Church.

Verily, the signs are abundant on every hand that religion and politics are rapidly coming together. But one thing is certain,—the mixture will not constitute Christianity. Quite probably this "new feature" on the convention program will "increase the interest in the occasion," but the nature of that increase of interest will be political, not Christian. Christianity and politics are not in the same sphere. To engage in politics the Church must go outside the sphere of her God-appointed work.
