AMERICAN SENTINEL

New York, July 30, 1896.

Any one receiving the American Sentinel, without having ordered it may know that it is sent to him by some friend. Therefore, those who have not ordered the Sentinel need have no fears that they will be asked to pay for it.

---

It is probable that several new indictments have been returned against the Lake County Adventists.

---

A report of the late Christian Endeavor convention in Washington, presenting features and thoughts of much interest in addition to those mentioned in our last issue, is given on page 238.

---

At last accounts the enemies of the Adventists in Lake County, Tenn., were endeavoring to secure indictments against some of the women and larger children for doing the family washing on Sunday.

---

The Lake County Adventists are admitted, even by their enemies, to be above reproach, except in the matter of Sunday work. "In every other respect," it is freely said, "they are good neighbors and good citizens."

---

Civil legislation gets out of its proper sphere when it undertakes to make the way of righteousness broad and smooth, and the way to perdition strait and rough. God means that men shall triumph over worldliness by faith, not by legislation.

---

The Scripture declaration that "we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth," is illustrated in the action of the Tennessee authorities against J. W. Lewis, just released from Tiptonville jail. It appears from his own statement, made in a private letter, that three of his fellow prisoners have been converted and commenced the observance of the Sabbath, as the result of his association with them in bonds. This must seem rather discouraging to the authorities.

---

As briefly stated in these columns last week, the County Court of Lake County, Tenn., has declared the county jail the county work-house, and has procured balls and chains for the purpose of operating a chain-gang for the special benefit of the convicted Adventists. But just why they have been to the expense of getting the balls and chains, does not appear, since there is no danger of the Adventists trying to get away. J. W. Lewis, who has been in Tiptonville jail ever since March, has had opportunity almost daily to get away, but has never availed himself of it. The three men just convicted were sentenced shortly after noon on the 16th inst. They waited around expecting to be taken to jail, but the sheriff paid no attention to them, and finally told them to go home and return the next day, which they did. Their consciences are clear; they are not afraid to look any man in the eye, and why should they run away? The chains provided by the County Court (corresponding to a board of commissioners in some States) will be of no use for the Adventists unless it is designed to heap upon them all possible indignity.

The Supreme Court of Connecticut has recently entered a judgment deciding that church property from which there accrues a financial profit is properly subject to taxation, even though that profit be devoted entirely to religious uses. This is an important decision, and certainly a just one. But the court was not ready to affirm that all church property should be taxed.

Friday, July 18, three Seventh-day Adventists, convicted of nuisance for working on Sunday in the wilds of Lake County, Tenn., were committed to the county jail at Tiptonville; and though it was well known that they would make no effort to escape, they were thrust into the "cage" with black and white cut-throats guilty of various degrees of crime. The sheriff said it was to satisfy public sentiment. When the writer of this note saw these men on the 20th inst., two of them were seriously sick, but they were still in the overcrowded "cage" for no better reason than to gratify the malice of those who hated them and persecuted them for conscience' sake. They have probably ere this been put to work upon the public roads.

The national political conventions which have been in session during the past few weeks, have furnished several illustrations of the kind of religion which may be expected to secure our political or governmental salvation. At the Republican convention in St. Louis, denominational rivalry forbade the selection of either a Catholic or an anti-Catholic clergymen to deliver the opening prayer, and the result was that the "honor" fell to a Jewish rabbi. This was something of a surprise to the country, and no slight shock to many in the various denominations recognized as Christian.

An Episcopal minister is said to have officiated in this capacity for the Democratic convention at Chicago, but the Populist convention just concluded at St. Louis is reported as being less fortunate.

The New York Sun, of the 24th inst., in its report of the preliminary proceedings, said on this point:—

The convention has had a mighty hard time getting anybody to pray for it, and at last accounts it is still marching around without prayers. It has hired a minister each day, but at the opening of each session the announcement has been made: "The Rev. Mr. So-and-So, who was requested to open this session with prayer, has been suddenly called out of town. I hope that we are all in a sufficiently prayerful condition." This announcement each time has been greeted with considerable applause.

What religion would finally descend to in the hands of the politicians, we can of course only conjecture; but in view of the exhibition furnished by the Republican convention, the editor of a religious journal exclaims:—

The great question now for Christian Americans is, How shall the holy function of public prayer to God be rescued from the unscrupulous tricks of the practical politicians?

We can answer the question by propounding another, which is even more pressing in its need of consideration by the American public; namely, How can the Christian religion be brought into the arena of American politics without being shorn of the divinity which demands our reverence and regard, and becoming that which must excite only ridicule and contempt? This is what becomes of the Christian religion when it is made into governmental religion. The question cannot be answered. Let the two be kept separate. Let honesty and justice rule in politics; but keep religion out.

That familiar traditional resolution of a certain religious body which asserts that "the earth was created by the Lord for the use of the saints," finds a frequent parallel in the action of "sabbath observance" reformers at the present day. But it would have been altogether shorn of its potency without the succeeding affirmation,—"Resolved, That we are the saints." So it would be of no consequence for modern religio-civic "reformers" to declare that this Government must be officered by the saints, if they did not always combine with it the cool assumption that they themselves are the ones through whom the divine will in government must be expressed.

---

CONSIDERABLE excitement was occasioned in the city of Niagara Falls on the 14th inst. by the announcement that the mayor had suspended from office Street Superintendent Butler, who is a prominent church member, for refusing to work on Sunday. The latter has of course a right to rest on the day he believes to be the Sabbath; and if he acts upon Christian principles he will not invoke the legal power to save him from inconvenience or temporal loss because of obedience to the dictates of conscience.

---

ELDER GARRETT, a Seventh-day Adventist minister, temporarily at Tiptonville, Tenn., attending the Adventist trials, has probably been indicted for the terrible "crime" of giving to the jurymen copies of the AMERICAN SENTINEL of July 2, containing an article on the meaning of the Declaration of Independence, and other similar matter.
