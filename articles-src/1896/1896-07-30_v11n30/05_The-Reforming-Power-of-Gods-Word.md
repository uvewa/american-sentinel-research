## THE REFORMING POWER OF GOD'S WORD.

The religious world seems at this day to have little or no confidence in God's simple word as a means of moral reform. There is no lack of effort at reform, nor was the need of reform in both Church and State ever greater, probably, than it is now; but the means employed by the various reform parties indicate a general belief that men must be either coerced into reform, or lured into the way of righteousness by some attraction which will appeal to their carnal natures.

The SENTINEL invites the attention of reform workers to the word of God as a reform-producing power.

There is a power in the divine word which men cannot comprehend. The comparative powerlessness of man's word has given rise to the familiar saying that "talk is cheap stuff." Not so of the word of the Lord. And there would be much less need of reform to-day if the distinction had been preserved in the public mind between that word and the "cheap stuff" put forth from the pulpit by those standing in the position of God's spokesmen.

Consider the great reform accomplished in the time of John the Baptist. John was simply a preacher in the wilderness. He himself denied that he was the Messiah, or that he was Elias, or a prophet risen from the dead. There was nothing wonderful about his appearance. He had no circus to exhibit before the people. He performed no miracle. And yet we read that there "went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judea, and all the region round about Jordan, and were baptized of him in Jordan, confessing their sins." Matt. 3:5, 6. If there could be such a reformation as this at the present day, it would surpass all the hopes of those now preaching reform to the unheeding, world-loving masses.

What then is the trouble to-day? Has the word of God lost its power? That cannot be, unless God has lost his power. Does not the trouble lie in the fact that the word of God is not studied to-day, not believed, not preached? Does not imagination, or dogma, or politics, or city government, furnish the theme of discourse in the vast majority of instances, instead of revelation? And in how many instances does a text of Scripture, when used, furnish more than a foundation from which the speaker can take a rhetorical flight into the realms of fancy?

Martin Luther and his associates presented the simple word of God to the people of their time, and the Reformation of the 16th century was the result. The people found in the word as it was presented to them, that which satisfied the longing of their souls; they found the bread and water of life. Will it not be found the same to-day? And will it not be welcomed as of old? Yes; it is as true to-day as it ever was that the mysterious longing of the soul for the happiness and peace which it vainly seeks from the resources of earth, must be satisfied, if at all, by that which is "spirit and life" indeed; and that is the word of God. John 6:63.

God is in his word; and this is the secret of the infinite difference between his word and man's word. This is why his word will come to the heart with a power which man's word knows nothing of. The power of God's word is shown in creation. "By the word of the Lord were the heavens made, and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth." Ps. 33:6. No greater work was ever done than that of creation. No greater power than that which produced creation could possibly be needed for any work at the present time.

God—the Omnipotent—is in his simple word; but not in the great shows and demonstrations which are considered so necessary in religious work at this day. When Elijah the prophet stood on Mount Horeb, after he had fled from the wrath of Jezebel, he was a witness to some very impressive demonstrations. First, we read, "a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks before the Lord; but the Lord was not in the wind." Next there was an earthquake; "but the Lord was not in the earthquake." Then came a fire; "but the Lord was not in the fire. And after the fire, a still small voice;" and that voice revealed the presence of the infinite One. It is so to-day; God is yet in the "still small voice," and any work of reform which does not have that voice in it, whatever else it may have, is disconnected from God.

We point to the divine word as the one essential and all-powerful means of moral reform to-day. Of course, if the reform sought is not sanctioned by the word of God—as, for example, the reform to promote Sunday observance—there is no divine power in it and never can be. There is absolutely no hope for "reform" work of this kind. But there is a Sabbath-reform work going on in our land and in all lands, which is based directly on God's word, proclaiming to the people "the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God;" and such is the power that is in it that multitudes of every race and class are reforming in Sabbath observance and keeping the seventh day, in the face of popular scorn, popular custom, financial loss, and legal pains and penalties.

Let every honest-hearted reform worker ascertain if his work has the sanction of the word of God; and if so, promulgate it by that word. If it has not, it is worse than useless to resort to another means for its propagation.
