## PULPIT POLITICS.

We seem to be rapidly approaching the time when the political "stump" will have become identified with the "Christian" pulpit, and one can learn all he desires to know concerning questions of politics, national finance, law, civil government, etc., by simply going to church and paying attention to the regular Sunday discourse. The clergy will become the political campaigners, and the party managers will simply have to call the conventions, nominate the candidates, and frame the platforms; then the clergy will attend to the rest.

The congregation of the Calvary Baptist Church, New York City, are already thus favored(?) in respect to the political issues of the present campaign. In his discourse of Sunday evening, the 19th inst., the pastor "paid his respects" to the "Chicago platform," condemning especially its reference to the United States Supreme Court. He said:—

This court is the authoritative interpreter of the Constitution. To degrade it would be a national calamity. Do the supporters of this platform want anarchy? Do they not know that Christian patriotism insists that "lex is rex"—that law is king and must rule? That platform propounds and promulgates dangerous doctrines. Its teaching comes perilously near being revolutionary. Americanism is not anarchism.

Whether the standard of truthfulness of the average political campaign speech will be raised or lowered in the hands of the clergy, is a question which remains to be determined. It is evident, however, that in this instance it was not greatly elevated. The statements that the Supreme Court "is the authoritative interpreter of the Constitution," and that "law is right, and must rule," are about as misleading as any that could be uttered. It is true that the Supreme Court of the nation can speak with authority superior to that of any other court upon the questions which come before it; but that court is not superior to the people who created it, and cannot settle for them any question of absolute right or wrong. If it could, it would have settled the question of negro slavery in favor of the slave-holder, when it rendered the historical Dred Scott decision. Not even a decision of this august tribunal can give a bad doctrine a right to rule in the practice of the nation or of individuals. The people have not delegated to any court their reason or moral accountability. Right must rule; and the people must determine for themselves, in the light of their own reason and of revelation, what is right.

The Supreme Court cannot make law. Law, in its true sense, is always synonymous with right. But that is often set forth as "law," which is simply what the court decides to be right; and the court's decision, in many if not most instances, is determined by its constitution at the time. Recently, the Supreme Court considered the question of the constitutionality of the "income tax" statute passed by Congress, and decided it to be law; but almost immediately afterwards reconsidered its decision, and by a change of mind on the part of one member, decided the statute to be unconstitutional and not law. It is evident that the question of "law" in this case might have been settled either way by a slight change in the personnel of the court.

This voice from the pulpit would have us believe that "Christian patriotism" requires an acceptance of the doctrine that "law is king, and must rule," and that what the "law" is which must rule, is a question to be settled by the courts. We are not told what "Christian patriotism" is, but it is a term used evidently to allege that the individual is neither a Christian nor a patriot who will not be ruled in all matters by the "law," as the courts may determine it. There is a strong tendency in this country toward political as well as religious popery, and this tendency will doubtless be strengthened by the utterances of pulpit politicians. Such utterances are invested with a weight and dignity, as coming from the pulpit, which they would not possess, put forth as mere "stump speech" rhetoric. By the pulpit-reverencing class, they are apt to be received as gospel truth.

There is "law" in almost every part of this country in favor of a church dogma—the Sunday-sabbath—and this "law" has the sanction of the nation's Supreme Court. The mere behests of the church, backed by a sufficient show of power, are apt to receive the stamp of "law" from the legislating power, as was seen in the national edict closing the World's Fair on Sunday. The church is looking to the "law" and the courts as her allies in religious work; and it will therefore not be strange if the pulpit politician shall endeavor to impress the public mind with the idea that the "law is king, and must rule," and raise the cry of "anarchy" whenever the rightfulness of the "law," or of a Supreme Court decision, is called in question. 8.
