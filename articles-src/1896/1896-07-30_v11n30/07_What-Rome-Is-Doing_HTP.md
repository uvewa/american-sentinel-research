## WHAT ROME IS DOING.

BY H. T. PHELPS.

Some years ago, when Archbishop Ireland was only a bishop, he was credited with saying: "We can have the United States in ten years; and I want to give you three points for your consideration: The negro, the Indians, and the public schools." It was thus that the bishop avowed himself in sympathy with the purposes and ambitions of Rome to become the subjugator of our free institutions, dominating them to our ruin.

Time passed by with the coming and going of days and years. The bishop became an archbishop of a diocese in the great and growing West. To-day, Mr. Ireland is regarded by the masses as a progressive, liberal-minded, true American; a man that is in perfect accord with the principles guaranteed by the national Constitution. All these years Rome has pursued the object of her ambition with relentless purpose.

In 1893, Mr. Ireland is accredited with saying: "The Roman pontificate to-day before governments and peoples is invested with high prestige and moral power, unknown to it for years. The church is out upon the broad world, felt, esteemed, and listened to as she has not been for centuries. Whole nations are saved."

Does this include our nation? Does he mean that this nation is saved to the Catholic Church, and that it is now a Roman Catholic Christian nation? Certainly that is the thought he intends to convey; for it was on Feb. 29, 1892, that the Supreme Court of the nation rendered a decision that "this is a Christian nation;" referring to Catholic documents, signed by Ferdinand and Isabella, both Catholics and supporters of the Spanish Inquisition, as proof of the position. And almost immediately, Dr. O'Gorman, of the Catholic University at Washington, D. C., seized upon the same argument, (and with reason too, for if it proves the one it also proves the other), and said this was a Catholic Christian nation. And Monsignor Satolli was at once upon the ground to make this a Catholic nation to all intents and purposes, to compel the attention of the Government. And so, of course, Mr. Ireland could truthfully say: "The Roman pontificate to-day before governments and peoples is invested with high prestige and moral power;" including the United States; for he does not say that Rome is before a part of the governments and peoples, for evidently all have made their obeisance to that church.

It was in that same year, 1893, at the jubilee of Cardinal Gibbons, that Archbishop Ireland spoke of the union of the Roman Catholic Church and this Government in no disguised terms, as follows: "I preach the new, the most glorious crusade. Church and age! Unite them in mind and heart, in the name of humanity, in the name of God. Church and age! . . . Mgr. Satolli, the church, and the age. Rome is the church; America is the age."

Of course, in his mind, "Rome is the church," for according to Rome, there is no other church. And as "America is the age," this means to unite them, in order that Rome may "put forth all her native energies, unrestricted and untrammeled." And when the church can do this, is not that union complete? Now notice the following of the present year.

June 19, 1896, Archbishop Ireland addressed the graduates of the Chicago De La Salle Institute, in which he said: "The Catholic Church in America is free, free to act, free to be herself, and to put forth all her native energies, unrestricted and untrammeled." This was an utter impossibility so long as the Government stood as our fathers made it. But in that act of the Supreme Court declaring in favor of general Christianity, was found the pivot upon which the Government was turned back into the lap of Rome, and now "the Catholic Church in America is free . . . to put forth all her native energies," because, forsooth, this is a Catholic Christian nation!

And what are those "native energies"? Let the history of the Dark Ages, the history of St. Bartholomew, and of the Spanish Inquisition, make answer. And let the people beware of this unlawful union, for it bodes only evil to this nation.

But Archbishop Ireland says further: "The Catholic people in America are free, enjoying all the rights and privileges accorded to American citizens, and suffering no loss from the open and consistent profession of their faith. The freedom which is allowed to the Catholic people in America, is simple natural justice . . . for which we may well be grateful to our country."

This is a most wonderful admission in the light of all past history; and in the light of Spain, Mexico, and the South American States of to day. It is either an utter repudiation of the acts of that church in all her history, past and present; or else it is equal to saying that this church did not in the past, and does not now, in all these countries, recognize these "rights and privileges" as being "simple natural justice," and as "a precious boon" to be enjoyed by others where that church dominates in civil affairs. But she boasts, "Rome never changes," and, "What she has done for other countries, she will do for the United States."
