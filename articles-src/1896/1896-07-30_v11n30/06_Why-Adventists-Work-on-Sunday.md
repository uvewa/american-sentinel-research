## WHY ADVENTISTS WORK ON SUNDAY.

The present Sunday cases in Lake County, Tenn., have again revived the question of how Adventists regard the fourth commandment of the Decalogue; not that it is a proper legal question, for it is not, but because in some other States as well as in Tennessee, courts of justice have so far forgotten their proper functions as to assume to declare that freedom of religious faith is not involved in the Sunday work of the Adventists.

It is assumed, as expressed by Judge Hammond, in the King case in 1891, that the Sunday labor of the Adventist is "disconnected with his religion just as much as other people's labor is disconnected with their religion, labor not being an acknowledged principle or tenet of religion by him, nor generally or anywhere."

The fact is, however, that the Adventists do regard it as a sacred duty to habitually devote Sunday to secular purposes; perhaps not necessarily to work every Sunday so that under no circumstances could they rest upon that day, but in the sense that they must treat it as a secular day. And this because they understand that the fourth commandment establishes a difference between the Sabbath and the six other days of the week, and requires men to respect that difference. To ignore this distinction between the Sabbath and the other days of the week, is simply to defeat the object of the divine law, and to set up a counterfeit of the memorial which God has ordained to keep in remembrance the fact that he is the Creator of the heavens and the earth, and the sanctifier of his people.

The view of the Adventists is that physical rest for man is not the primary object of the Sabbath; for it "was made for man" before the fall, as our Lord himself declares, and consequently before man stood in need of rest from wearing toil. Clearly its object was to keep in lively exercise man's loyalty to God as the Creator, just as our peculiarly national holidays—the Fourth of July, Washington's Birthday, Decoration Day, etc.,—are designed to fan the flame of patriotism in the American breast. Viewed from this standpoint, it is plain that the fourth commandment not only enjoins the keeping of the true Sabbath, but it likewise forbids rivals and counterfeits.

Just as the stamp of the government upon a piece of metal or paper separates it from all other metal and paper not thus stamped, and gives it a peculiar character not belonging to other pieces of metal or paper, so the Lord's stamp, placed upon the seventh day, separates it from all other days and gives it a character peculiar to itself. And just as it is a crime under the laws of men to either make or use imitations of metal or paper bearing the government stamp, so is it a sin under the law of God either to make or to use an imitation of the Lord's Sabbath.

## The Sabbath the Badge of God's Authority.

Every law must show in some way the authority by which it was enacted, and this the Decalogue does only in the fourth commandment. In that precept it is declared that the Giver of the law is he who created the heavens and the earth in six days and rested on the seventh. It is this fact that gives the Sabbath its memorial character. The Sabbath commandment is in fact the seal of the divine law, because it is the precept that designates the Giver of the law, and states the ground of his authority to require obedience.

In like manner the Sunday institution is the seal or mark of rival power. It is set forth by the Papacy, the "man of sin" of 2 Thess. 2:3—as the badge of his authority to command men under sin. In a Catholic catechism, called the "Abridgment of Christian Doctrine," the Catholic Church asserts its power to change the divine law, in the following manner:—

**Ques.** How prove you that the church hath power to command funds and holy days?

**Ans.** By the very act of changing the Sabbath into Sunday, which Protestants allow of; and therefore they fondly command it themselves by keeping Sunday strictly, and breaking most other feasts commanded by the same church.

**Q.** How prove you that?

**A.** Because by keeping Sunday they acknowledge the church's power to ordain feasts, and to command them under sin; and by not keeping the rest by her commanded, they again deny, in fact, the same power.

Another Catholic work, called "Dectrinal Catechism," offers the following as proof that Protestants are not guided by the Scriptures:—

**Ques.** Have you any other way of proving that the church has power to institute festivals of precept?

**Ans.** Had she not such power, she could not have done that in which all modern religionists agree with her;—she could not have substituted the observance of Sunday, the first day of the week, for the observance of Saturday, the seventh day, a change for which there is no scriptural authority.

**Q.** When Protestants do profane work upon Saturday, or the seventh day of the week, do they follow the Scripture as their only rule of faith—do they find this permission clearly laid down in the sacred volume?

**A.** On the contrary, they have only the authority of tradition for this practice. In profaning Saturday, they violate one of God's commandments, which he has never clearly abrogated—"Remember that thou keep holy the Sabbath day."

Believing the Papacy to be antichrist, and holding the Sunday-sabbath to be the badge of its power, it is evident that with Adventists the observance of Sunday would be equivalent to rendering homage to antichrist; hence their steady refusal to obey Sunday laws, and their willingness to suffer imprisonment, the chain-gang, or even death itself rather than to do so much as appear to regard Sunday as other than a common working day. It is not as many seem to regard it, simply a matter of choice of the days, but is with the Adventists a vital question directly affecting their salvation.

About four years ago the Advent Review and Sabbath Herald, the denominational organ of the Adventists, had an editorial article upon this subject which we reprinted at the time, but from which we now make the following extracts:—

Every person has a right to work six days in every week, for the language of the commandment is, "Six days shall thou labor, and do all thy work." These words . . . confer upon mankind a God given right. . . . beside which all opposing human authority becomes an absolute nullity.

But the language of the commandment imports something more than a mere permission to labor upon six days of the week. It imports something in the nature of an obligation. . . . Six days of the week are left to be devoted to man and his temporal interests, but the seventh day is the Lord's—the day upon which he rested, and which he blessed and sanctified. This day must therefore be kept distinct and separate from all other days, and of course the means for doing this must not be likewise employed in behalf of other days, or the distinction would be lost. . . . The observance of the commandment by rest upon the seventh day would be nullified by the like rest upon the other day. It is absolutely essential, therefore, that the six working days should be kept distinct in character from that day which God has set apart for himself.

But the impropriety of resting upon both the seventh and first days of the week does not stop here; for the first day is a rival Sabbath. Peculiarly offensive to God, therefore, must any act be which is an acknowledgement of the claims of this false sabbath to the sanctity and reverence due his own day. In what other way could such observance of the first day, by one who knew its claims to be false, be taken, but as an insult to the Creator? In what other way could the Creator himself regard it?

The person who refrains from labor upon the first day of the week, thereby acknowledges either the claims of the day, or the authority of the power which seeks to enforce such rest. He may not "keep" the day as the Sabbath day should be kept, according to the spirit of the Sabbath commandment—his observance of it may be one of form only; but this in the eyes of others at least, is an observance of the day, for only each individual can examine the thoughts and intents of his own heart.

The eyes of the world around us can not, or at least, do not, penetrate beyond the letter of our Sabbath observance—the outward refraining from labor; this is all, therefore, that can be asked of any one in enforcing Sunday observance. This also is all that the authors of the first-day sabbath ever asked as that which should constitute its observance. Sunday, however blessed, sanctified, and made holy; as a rival to the true Sabbath, it is sufficient that the religious world should be induced to rest and attend religious worship upon that day instead of on the seventh day. The edicts which gave rise to Sunday observance never commanded anything more; nor is anything more exacted by the apostate church which has ever been the especial guardian of the day. Every intelligent person knows that the Roman Catholic Church does not demand of its members the observance of Sunday in the spirit of Isa. 58:13.

The Catholic Church does not demand Sunday observance as an act of worship to God, but as an act of homage to itself; and as such it is an act in the highest degree offensive to God. It lowers his Sabbath before the world to a level with the spurious, rival sabbath which is of satanic origin. It nullifies entirely the act of resting upon the preceding seventh day.

To worship God, and an antichristian power also, is to worship the latter power alone. God demands that we should worship and serve him always, and him only. The devil is satisfied to let us serve God part of the time and himself the rest of the time, well knowing that we are thereby serving him all the time, and God not at all. We do not think also that any person can afford to surrender, under such circumstances, his right, before mentioned, to six days of secular employment in every week. He who surrenders a God-given right in obedience to an arbitrary demand by any earthly power, merely as an act of homage to itself, makes himself a slave.

We think therefore that it should be a matter of conscience with all observers of the true Sabbath, not to comply with the demand to rest on the first day of the week.

This is put very mildly, but it is none the less positive; it expresses the view of the denomination upon the subject, and should settle at once and forever the question of how Adventists regard the claims of the fourth commandment. Of course it is not a matter of which the courts can properly take cognizance, for to do so would be to become judges of the consciences of that people; but the fact does show most conclusively that Sunday laws do at least interfere with the religious rights of the Adventists, by requiring of them a service which they cannot conscientiously render. This is in addition to the hardship of being deprived of one-sixth of the time divinely allotted to them for work.
