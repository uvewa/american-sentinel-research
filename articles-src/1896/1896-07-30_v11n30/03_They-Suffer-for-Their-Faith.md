## THEY SUFFER FOR THEIR FAITH.

Down in Lake County, Tennessee, surrounded by the heavy timber for which the lowlands of the Mississippi are noted, is a small community of Seventh-day Adventists.

A year ago, one of their number who owned a small portable saw-mill, secured, in company with another man, a tract of 1,500 acres of wild timber land for the purpose of converting the trees into lumber.

Calling to his assistance several of his brethren of like faith from other neighborhoods, Mr. Callicott, for such is the name of the owner of the mill, proceeded to establish a lumber camp in the hitherto almost trackless forest which he and his partner had purchased.

Soon a number of rough but comfortable homes sprang up where previously there had roamed only wild beasts, or herds of semi-wild cattle and hogs, which have free range of the Mississippi bottoms in Lake County.

The mill hands brought with them their families, and very soon after the mill was in operation steps were taken to build a schoolhouse, which task completed, a teacher was employed and a school successfully conducted for several months.

The school-house served also for a church, and every Sabbath as also on Wednesday evenings, the whole community assembled for divine worship, which, unless a minister was present, which seldom happened, was conducted by one of their own number. The children were organized into classes for a regular Sabbath-school in which both old and young took part, while for the older ones there were Bible readings or "lay" sermons prepared and delivered by some of the men.

A few of the employés of the mill were not Adventists, and it was never operated on Sunday, and so was run only five days each week. Naturally Sunday was "chore day" with the Sabbatarians, and numerous little odd jobs were done on that day.

When it was determined to build the school-house and church the men volunteered to do the work. The owner of the mill gave the timber and the use of his mill, besides himself assisting in the work. On a Sunday morning the volunteers sallied forth to cut the logs at a point about a mile distant from the mill and still deeper in the dense forest.

But evil eyes were spying out the liberty of the Adventists. Sunday loafers from farms adjacent to the forest followed to the scene of operations the fathers intent upon erecting a temple sacred at once to the worship of God and to the education of their children, and this work was the basis of some of the indictments referred to.

Formerly the forest had echoed on Sunday with the baying of hounds and the crack of the rifle in the hands of godless hunters, but nobody was disturbed. Now however when the "sabbath" stillness is broken(?) by the "swish" of a cross-cut saw drawn by sturdy but God-fearing lumbermen, who had on the previous twenty-four hours "rested the Sabbath-day according to the commandment," the neighborhood was "disturbed." Methodists and Presbyterians, and even Baptists, who saw a rival sect gaining a foothold in their neighborhood, were greatly annoyed, not indeed when they heard the saw cutting the logs to be subsequently made into lumber for the Adventist church, for that could not have been heard ten rods, but when they heard that the saw had been running.

The facts of this work together with the odd jobs done about their homes on Sunday, were promptly reported to the grand jury. A never-to-well in the neighborhood, who has more than once crossed his legs under the hospitable boards of his Adventist neighbors and partaken of their salt, appeared in the role of prosecutor, and five of the Adventists were indicted for nuisance, according to the following formula varied only as to names:—

State of Tennessee, } Circuit Court,
Lake County, }
November Term, A. D., 1895.

The grand jurors of the State of Tennessee, elected, impaneled, sworn, and charged to inquire in and for the body of the county of Lake, in the State aforesaid, upon their oath present that W. S. Lowry, late of said county, laborer, heretofore to wit, on the 17th day of November, A. D. 1895, that day being Sunday, and divers other Sundays next before that date, in the county of Lake aforesaid, then and there unlawfully, openly, publicly, notoriously and unnecessarily did, in the presence of divers persons, engage in his secular business, and did perform and follow his common avocations of life on Sunday by working at the sawmill, moving and hauling saw logs, building houses and fences, chopping and sawing lumber, and doing divers other kinds of work on Sundays, said work not being necessary or a matter of charity: and it was and is to the great annoyance and disturbance of the good people of the community, to the evil example of society, prejudicial to public morale, and a public nuisance to the citizens of the county, and against the peace and dignity of the State.

J. W. Lewis,
Attorney General.

As before stated, the mill was never operated on Sunday. The work done, as shown by the evidence, was such as is usually done on Saturday afternoon or on Sunday by men employed on other days in mills or factories, and especially in lumber camps. But for this, one honest man has just completed a term of imprisonment dating from the 14th day of last March, and three more God-fearing men have just been convicted, and must spend several months in prison and in the chain-gang, for they refuse to pay either the small fine or the large costs assessed against them for exercising a God-given and inalienable right.

The indictments referred to were found last November. Last March one of the defendants was tried on two indictments, and in default of payment of fines and costs was committed to jail for nearly eight months.

The other four cases were continued because of a flaw in one of the indictments. On the 16th inst., these cases were tried and three convictions were obtained.

The judge, W. H. Swiggart, of Union City, Tenn., seems to be a fair-minded man, who has lost his relish, if he ever had any, for such cases. Regarding himself as bound by the statute and the decision of the Supreme Court, he discharges what he conceives to be his duty. It is stated on good authority that Judge Swiggart does not want these Sunday cases in his court, and certainly he does not regard Sunday work as done by the Adventists as a very serious offense, since he imposes only the nominal fine of one dollar even on defendants before him for the second or third time on the same charge.

Attorney-General Lewis does not seem so liberal or even fair-minded, and is said to have made some threats by no means creditable to him. It is reported that he induced the prosecutor to assume that role by promising to "nolle" a case against him, and that he has boasted that he drove the Adventists out of Henry County into Union County, and from Union County to Lake County, and that now he will drive them into the river. It is to be hoped that this is a mistake. The Adventists were never driven out of either Henry or Union Counties, and are not likely to be driven out of Lake County; but even should they be driven out of the State or even from the United States it would not prove them wrong nor their persecutors right. Might does not make right, and Attorney-General Lewis may be wrong even though he has at his back all the power of the State of Tennessee.
