"CIVIC RIGHTEOUSNESS."

[Present Truth (London, Eng.), May 28, 1896.]

The expression "civic righteousness" is one which is not infrequently used of late. What is the meaning of the term? In the second chapter of Proverbs the wise man has said:—

My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and hide my commandments with thee; so that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom, and apply thine heart to understanding: . . . Thee shall thou understand the fear of the Lord, and find the knowledge of God. Thee shall thou understand righteousness.

It is then through the fear and knowledge of God that an understanding of righteousness is to be gained. Very possibly the thought of Solomon, in writing these words, was directed to the language of the inspired poet, his father, where, in the one hundred and seventy-second verse of the one hundred and nineteenth psalm, he says: "My tongue shall speak of Thy word: for all thy commandments are righteousness."

So it is the commandments of God, which, being themselves an epitome of righteousness, are the test and measure of all righteousness. But the commandments of God apply to the whole circle of human relations; not only to the social and civil side of life, but to the moral and spiritual existence as well. They regulate not only the exigencies of civic life and a man's association with his neighbor, but also the inner thought of his mind, inclination of his heart, and attitude of feeling toward his neighbor and toward his God,—things which none can know except the man himself and the omniscient God. To fulfill the requirements of this universal law, and satisfy the omniscient Judge, is to possess righteousness.

It is within the power of God, as an omniscient Judge, to measure and test every man by this law and enforce the fulfillment of its requirements. The commandments of God are righteousness. They are divine law. "Civic righteousness," then, would be civil law. Civil law is human law. There is no such thing as "civic righteousness." It is a figure of speech in which poor, feeble, fallible human justice has attempted to array itself in the judicial robes of omnipotent and omniscient divinity.

The law of righteousness God alone can administer. Civic justice, according to human law, man may administer. But when the human agent for the administration of civic justice thinks, or attempts, to administer the divine law of righteousness, he becomes the most pitifully incompetent usurper in all God's infinite universe.
