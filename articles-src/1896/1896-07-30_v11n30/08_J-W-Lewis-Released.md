## J. W. LEWIS RELEASED.

[As appears from the following letter to the SENTINEL from the source of the Sunday prosecutions in Tennessee, the imprisoned Adventist, J. W. Lewis, is now at liberty. It appears that the sheriff and clerk of the court in which Mr. Lewis was sentenced last March, did not know the law which proportions the term of imprisonment to the amount of fine and costs, and this point having been investigated by the editor of the SENTINEL, it transpired that Mr. Lewis has served about one month beyond the legal limit of his sentence. The discovery has occasioned much embarrassment to some of the court officials. 8.]

Tiptonville, Tenn., July 21.

AMERICAN SENTINEL:

J. W. Lewis, who was imprisoned here March 14 for violating the Sunday law, was released to-day at noon. Investigation showed that Brother Lewis served nearly thirty days over his time. As is quite generally known there were two indictments against him. One amounted to $24.65, the other to $15.06. The judgments and costs in both cases were $39.71.

From March 14, the date of his incarceration, to July 20, would be one hundred and twenty-nine days, and as it was discovered, too, that the law allows 40 cents per day in the county jail (although our brethren have heretofore been allowed only 25 cents per day), one hundred and twenty-nine days amount to $51.00, and the fines and costs in both cases were a total of $39.71. Thus it is evident that Brother Lewis was unjustly confined nearly thirty days, or there is due him from the county or sheriff about $12.00.

The sheriff is already perplexed over the matter and proposes to let the surplus days be counted for the three brethren who were imprisoned July 17. The fines and costs of each of the last named, are $17.65, or forty-four days in jail, unless they consent to work on the public road, to which they are daily expecting to be called. C. G. LOWRY.
