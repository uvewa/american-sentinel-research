### ROME AND THE BIBLE.

Do we owe anything to the Roman Catholic Church for the preservation of the Holy Scriptures? We think not; and we will give the reasons for our opinion. We know it is the boast of the church of Rome that the whole world is under many obligations to her for having preserved the sacred Scriptures during the long ages between the time of Christ and the Reformation. But is this really true? Let us see:

For the preservation of the law-Scriptures containing the Old Testament we are indebted to the Jews. And to prevent them from being corrupted by any defection that might have taken place among them, about 250 years R. C., Ptolemy Philadelphia, king of Egypt, who seems to have been a great patron of learning, appointed seventy-two learned men to translate the Hebrew Scriptures into Greek. This translation, known as the Septuagint, is still extant, and was more in the keeping of the Eastern or Greek, than in that of the Western or Latin Church; so we are under no obligation to the Roman Church for the preservation of the Old Testament.

But how is it about the New Testament? The New Testament, with perhaps the single exception of the Gospel of Matthew, was written in Greek. At the close of the first century, or perhaps quite early in the second, the Syrian version was made. This version is called the Paschito, and is still extant. A translation of it was published a few years ago in this country by Dr. Murdock. This version, which is perhaps as correct as any we have, has been the text-book of the Eastern Christians for 1800 years, and it has been carefully preserved by those Christians who have never been under the influence of the Church of Rome. If the Greek Scriptures of the New Testament and the Hebrew of the Old had been entirely lost, we could restore them, word for word, from the Septuagint and Peschito.

It is also true that in the earliest ages of Christianity the Church of Rome was not as hostile to the Bible as she has been since she has adopted so many errors that are not found in the Scriptures. In her purer age she had not, therefore, so much occasion to set the Bible aside. Hence, we have the old Italia, i. e., the Bible translated into Latin, perhaps in the second century. This was almost universally used in the Roman Empire until the Vulgate was published in the fourth century, which has ever since been the standard in the Church of Rome. At an early period—indeed as fast as the nations became converted to Christianity—the Bible was translated for the use of the people; hence, as early as 370, Eliphilas, bishop of the Meso-Goths, translated the Bible into the Gothic. In the eighth century the venerable Sede translated the Scriptures into Anglo-Saxon. Many other translations were made, and thus God's Word was scattered over the world.

There were, moreover, always pious sects, like the Vaudois, Waldenses and Albigenses, who kept the Word of God pure and unspotted, so that we owe nothing to Rome for our Holy Scriptures.

Romanism and the Bible have no fellowship; for if one is true, much of the other must be false. Hence, Romanists do not wish or encourage their people to read the Bible, because they are well aware that Romanism, as it now exists, is not found in the Word of God. A general reading of the Bible among the members of the Roman Catholic Church would be likely to make a great change in it in ten years.—Rev. R. Weiser, D. D.
