**THE POLITICAL VS. THE MORAL SITUATION.**

Is the political situation in this country worse than the moral situation? One would think so, from what is heard in many of the pulpits at the present time. What other conclusion can be drawn when clergymen choose political instead of moral themes for their Sunday discourses?

The Rev. Dr. MacArthur, for example, pastor of Calvary Baptist Church, New York City, gave a discourse Sunday evening, August 2, in which he dealt with a certain political party very much as the ordinary preacher might be expected to deal with sin and Satan. The following extracts from a press report will serve to show the nature of the discourse:—

"Is there danger of anarchy in this country? I am no mere alarmist. I am too much concerned for this nation's honor, and for that reason I shall rebuke the anarchistic spirit whenever I find it. It is easily found. It is to be found in the platform adopted at Chicago. Says that platform: 'We denounce the arbitrary interference of the Federal authorities in local affairs, and we object to government by injunctions.' There was a man near here who objected to injunctions. He is in Sing Sing now. To understand these declarations of the platform let us go back a little further in the history of Chicago," and here Dr. MacArthur referred to the Haymarket murders by anarchists and to the pardoning of the imprisoned anarchists by Governor Aligold.

"In the light of these facts, again read the Chicago platform. . . . Is it not anarchistic in its spirit? And its framers are the people who want to rule us! By the grace of God and the votes of the people no sympathizer with anarchy will ever sit in the presidential chair of the American Republic!

"Are we to revive the Jacobins and Robespierre" Is the Supreme Court to be menaced? Are financial obligations to be repudiated? What could be said of me, twenty six years a pastor in this city, an adopted American citizen sworn to protect the American flag, if I failed to do my part in fighting for the country's honor? Where would be my manliness? What is religion worth if it does not help the government to pay its debts and give the people honest money? Some people say all this doesn't concern the pulpit. I think there ought to be more religion in politics, and I will do my part to bring more religion into politics between now and election day.

"Is this Republic to go down into destruction at the hands of anarchists? They have been sowing dangerous seed, but they must not be allowed to reap the harvest. No monarchy will have a hand to strike so quickly at violation of law as will this free Republic."

. . . If we love our country we must speak and act against its enemies. A crisis in American history is upon us. At a previous crisis Stephen A. Douglas said: "There are but two parties—patriots and traitors. So I say now, there are but two parties—patriots and traitors. Which are we?"

Evidently in the Rev. Mr. MacArthur's view the political situation must be pretty bad, or he would not refer to it in such language as this. But what about the moral—the spiritual situation in this same land? Is there anything worse than that? Is the fact that the country seems to be threatened with anarchy,—that the people are dividing into "patriots" and "traitors"—worse than the fact that many millions of them are in rebellion against God, and that here the people are also fast dividing into two parties, one of which—and by far the larger party—are traitors to the government of heaven? Is the fact that ruin may threaten the political and commercial interests of this country, worse than the fact that eternal ruin threatens the souls of all sinners throughout the land? We do not think so. Bad as the situation is, we do not see in it any occasion for ministers of the gospel of God to turn aside from the work to which they have been divinely commissioned. If the salvation of souls can ever become secondary in importance to any other interest in this world, then religion is a fraud, and revelation a myth.
