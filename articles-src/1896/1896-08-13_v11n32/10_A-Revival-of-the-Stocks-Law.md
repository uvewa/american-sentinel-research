## A REVIVAL OF THE "STOCKS" LAW.

[Bible Echo (Melbourne, Australia), July 6, 1896.]

It may be a surprise to some to learn that the old Sunday law of Charles II., enacted in 1677, is in force in Victoria, but such seems to be the case.

On May 28, 1896, David and Zalic Nettleberg, furriers, of Port Melbourne, were prosecuted "under the provisions of section 1 of Act 29 Charles II.," for "following their usual occupation on Sunday, 17th May," and each fined 5s. So says the Melbourne Jpe, of May 29. The report further states that "Miss Nettleberg, owner of the business, who was also present, expressed her surprise that members of a family 'could not do as they liked on their own premises.'"

Not only Miss Nettleberg, but a great many other Victorians, will no doubt be surprised to learn, when Sunday laws are revived and enforced in this and other colonies, that such laws have no regard for individual rights either at home or abroad. This same section 1 of the Sunday law of Charles II., not only prohibits "worldly labor, business, or work" on Sunday, but requires "that all and every person and persons whatsoever shall, on every Lord's day, apply themselves thereon in the dutyes of piety and true religion publiquely and privately."

"That all the laws enacted and in force concerning the observation of the Lord's day, and repairing to the church therein bee carefully put in execution."

And then it imposes a fine of 5s. for every offense, or in default "to be set publicly in the stocks for two hours." And the provisions for "repairing to the church," "applying themselves to the dutyes of piety and true religion," and the "two hours in the stocks," are as much a part of the law as that forbidding "worldly labor."

And if a person chooses to observe the Bible Sabbath, the seventh day, instead of the Sunday, falsely called the Lord's day, that will make no difference, as was demonstrated two years ago in Sydney. The law says the day "commonly called Sunday" is the day of rest, and individual responsibility, conscientious convictions, and personal rights must all bow in submission to this religious man-made law. All Sunday laws are in direct opposition to the law of God.
