The Sunday question is developing friction between the Methodist camp-meeting and summer campers at Lake Bluff, near Chicago, Ill. The Chicago Times-Herald, of July 31, says:—

There will be quite a rivalry, it is hinted, between the campers and the summer visitors for supremacy, and the contest promises to be an interesting one. The seaside devotees declare they will enjoy their Sunday swim while the revivalists quietly assert their opposition. The officers of the association refuse to make public their opinions on the bathing wrangle, and refer all questions to the association trustees. The latter say the matter will be settled by the village trustees at their meeting next Monday evening. Both sides are gathering their forces for the battle, and the meeting is expected to be a lively one.

On every side we hear of opposing forces being called up in battle array, or engaged in combat, over the question of enforcing Sunday. When the Church thus descends into the arena of civil strife, the standard of Christianity is trailed in the dust.
