## THE SPIRIT OF THE CRUSADES.

A NEW crusade is being preached against the Turk. We have no "Peter the Hermit" in these days, but we have men who come not far behind that old-time leader in zeal and fiery eloquence against Islam. Those men have left nothing undone to move the nations of Christendom to invade the Turk's domain, and either exterminate him or drive him "bag and baggage" away from the confines of civilization.

As with those anti-Islam crusades of which history speaks, the animus of the movement is religious, more than secular. It has its strongest advocates among the leaders in religious enterprise. It is urged upon religious grounds. The Turkish Mohammedans are slaughtering the Armenian Christians. Therefore let Christendom arouse, and, sword in hand, put a sudden and effectual stop to Islam's red-handed propaganda.

We referred not long since to the inflammatory speech of Evangelist B. Fay Mills along this line before a large Christian Endeavor audience at Washington. That meeting and that speech constituted one of the most noteworthy features of the convention, and attracted wide-spread attention. While it evoked some criticism, as an arraignment of the United States Government, it was in harmony with the general tone of newspaper comment, both secular and religious, upon the Armenian situation. The general sentiment evidently is, that the "Christian nations" of the world, our own included, ought to muster their armies and navies upon the shores of the Levant and put down the Turk with a strong hand. The great obstacle that stands in the way of this is the (in the language of Evangelist Mills) "unpatriotic, uncivil, undemocratic, unrepublican, un-American, unchristian, selfish, weak, wicked, barbaric, and criminal" policy by which these "Christian nations" are controlled.

The Turkish massacres in Bulgaria a few years since, which led to the last Russo-Turkish war, drew forth the same sentiment from "Christian" sources. At that time the late Bishop A. Cleveland Coze gave utterance to this sentiment in the following lines:—

Trump of the Lord! I hear it blow!
Forward the Cross; the world shall know
Jehovah's arm's against the foe;
Down shall the cursed Crescent go!
To arms! To arms!
God wills it so!

God help the Russ! God help the Czar!
Shame on the swords that trade can mar!
Shame on the laggards, faint and far,
That rise not to the holy war!
To arms! To arms!
The Cross our star!

How long, O Lord! for thou art just;
Vengvance is thine; in the we trust;
Wake! arm of God! and dash to dust
Those hordes of rapine and of lust.
To arms! To arms!
Wake, swords that rust!

Forward the Cross! Break, clouds of ire!
Break with the thunder and the fire!
To new Crusades let faith inspire;
Down with the Crescent to the mire!
To arms! To arms!
To vengeance dire!

To high Stamboul that Cross restore!
Glitter its glories as of yore.
Down with the Turk! From Europe's shore
Drive back the Paynim, drunk with gore!
To arms! To arms!
To arms once more!

We have nothing to say in mitigation of the crimes of the Turk. But we must raise our voice in protest when such sentiment as this is breathed forth in the name of Christianity. The professed representatives of Jesus Christ would go forth armed with military weapons for a new crusade. It would be well if they would first pause and reflect upon the results of those first "Christian" crusades undertaken centuries ago. It may be true that the Turk is slaughtering people of all ages, sexes and conditions by the thousands. The horrors of the situation, as depicted in the press reports, are probably not exaggerated. The Turk, it appears, is animated with a fiery and unquenchable hatred of the "Christians." But here is a question we would like these would-be Crusaders to consider: .

Where did the Turk first get this fierce and inextinguishable hatred of the "Christians"?

Was it not very largely the result of those first Crusades which, in the eleventh and twelfth centuries, carried fire and sword into the midst of the Turkish domain, spreading death and ruin in their track, and wresting from the Turk, for a time, an important portion of his territory? Certainly, the character and results of those undertakings were well calculated to kindle an undying hatred of their perpetrators in the Moslem breast. Consider the following pen picture of the historian, relative to the Crusaders' storming of Jerusalem:—

The Saracens gave way before them. They retreated through the streets, fighting at intervals until they were driven into the precincts of the mosque of Omar. Blood flowed in the gutters, and horrid heaps of the dead lay piled at every corner. None were spared by the frenzied Christians, who saw in the gore of the infidels the white way of redemption. Ten thousand dead, scattered through the city, gave token of the merciless spirit of the men of the West. Another ten thousand were heaped in the reeking courts of the great mosque on Mount Moriah. "God wills it," said the pilgrims.

The indiscriminate butchery of the Saracens was carried out by the rank and file of the Crusading army. In this bloody work they needed no incentive—no commander. Each sword flamed with hatred until it was cooled in the dripping life of the enemies of Christ.*

"The spirit of the massacre," the historian adds, "is well illustrated in the letter which the Christian princes sent to his holiness the Pope. The devout writers say: 'If you wish to know what we did to the enemies we found in the city, learn that in the portico of Solomon and in the temple our horses walked up to the knees in the impure blood of the Saracens.'"

What spirit was this calculated to inspire in the Saracenic breast other than that which the Turk has ever since manifested toward those whom he deemed to be identified with these invaders in profession and purpose?

When the Turk started out on his career of missionary conquest, in the seventh century, he was animated by no such spirit as that which has moved him to the slaughter of Christians in more modern times. The instructions given by Abu Bekir, the successor of Mohammed, to his military commander, and which, says the historian, "may well be repeated as illustrative of the spirit of young Islam going forth to conquest," ran thus:—

Treat your soldiers with kindness and considera-

tion. Be just in all your dealings with them, and consult your feelings and opinions. Fight valiantly, and never turn your back upon a foe. When victorious, harm not the aged, and protect women and children. Destroy not the palm tree or fruit trees of any kind; waste not the corn field with fire; nor kill any cattle excepting for food. Stand faithfully to every covenant and promise; respect all religious persons who live in hermiteans or convents, and spare their edifices. But should you meet with a class of unbelievers of different kind, who go about with shaven crowns and belong to the synagogue of Satus, be sure you cleave their skulls unless they embrace the true faith or render tribute. [Italics ours.]

The victorious Moslems overran northern Africa, conquered Spain, and pushed on toward the interior of Europe, to meet the resistless "hammer" of Charles Martel at Tours. The advancing wave of Mohammedanism was rolled back across the Pyrenees, and finally out of Spain and back into Africa. But a deep-seated resentment against the Moslems remained throughout "Christian" Europe; and it was a feeling of revenge against the Turk, more than any other motive, which actuated the "Christians" in their crusades for the recovery of the "help sepulcher." The battles of Turk and "Christian," have been the battles of contending rival religions, and it was that fierceness which religious animosity always lends to carnal strife, that gave the contest its vindictive character, and left in the breast of the Turk that hatred of what he deems Christianity, which he has manifested in so sanguine a manner since that time.

We say "what he deems Christianity," for be it remembered that the Turk was furnished with his conception of Christianity by the hosts of red-handed invaders which marched through his territory under the ensign of the cross. If these "Christian" crusaders had been Christians, they would never have thought to fight the battles of Christianity with carnal weapons, and the terrible and fateful animosity which grew out of that struggle would never have been developed.

During all this time, and for centuries afterward, true Christians were suffering a hundred-fold more at the hands of the "Christian" rulers of Europe, led by the Papacy, than at the hands of the Turk. Then was the time when the true Church, the "woman," had "fled into the wilderness," to escape the persecution of the papal dragon (Rev. 12:4-6, 14), there to be nourished by God for the space of twelve hundred and sixty years, until the papal power should be broken. The true Christians were persecuted in Europe, but not in the domains of Islam. There it was that some of them found a refuge from the rage which burned against them in "Christian" lands. But for the wickedly-false conception of Christianity which the crusades gave to Islam, there is no evidence that true Christians would ever have suffered from Turkish wrath. There is no evidence that true Christians would be suffering in Armenia to-day, but for the wicked work of those who were Christians only in name.

What, then, do we want to-day? A new crusade, which will again bear the sword against the Turk in the name of Christ? A new wickedness, to right the consequences of the old? Verily, no. Christianity cannot bear the sword. We make no attempt to define duty for the civil powers. But we would record our most emphatic protest against a repetition, in the name of the Prince of Peace, of that most "unchristian, selfish, . . wicked, barbaric, and criminal" folly which gave the lie to Christianity before all the world, and perpetrated the colossal sin of the ages, in the so-called "Christian" Crusades.
