Speaking of the Sunday-in-nature argument, an exchange forcibly says: "If we found flowers closing their petals, fowls seeking their roosts, and animals their habitations every Sunday, and not emerging until Monday morning, some support for seventh-day idleness could be drawn from nature; but as long as vegetation continues to grow on the Sabbath and animals know no difference between Sunday and Monday, the argument will be without force."
