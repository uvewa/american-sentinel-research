There can be nothing better calculated to aid in the establishment of good government than Christianity. The best form of government is that which imposes the least burden upon the people, and that form will be least burdensome which is simplest and leaves to the people the largest liberty of individual action. "That government is best which governs least," consistently, of course, with the maintenance of order and justice. Christianity, by teaching an individual to live peaceably with all men, to be honest and just in his dealings with all, and to do unto others as he would wish others to do to him, tends directly to the establishment of individual self-government, and thus to the diminishing of the machinery of civil government, which means the lightening of taxation and the removal of many public burdens.

Then, it may be inquired, ought not a government to promote Christianity in order that these benefits may accrue to its people? The answer is, No; for the simple reason that Christianity, operating as it does through faith in the Word of God, is something wholly beyond the control or direction of the civil power. When the civil authority can put faith into a man's heart, it can then promote Christianity, and not before. But faith is altogether voluntary, and hence a forced faith is not faith at all, but only hypocrisy, and hypocrisy is the very opposite of Christianity. However much, therefore, Christianity may promote those ends which good government seeks to secure, the latter must keep "hands off," and leave Christianity to be directed and enforced by the agent divinely appointed thereto,—the Holy Spirit.
