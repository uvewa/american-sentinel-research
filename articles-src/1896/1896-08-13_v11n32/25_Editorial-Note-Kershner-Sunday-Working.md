The substance of an address made by Rev. W. J. Kershner to a Sunday-school convention held at Wernersville, Pa., Aug. 1, 2, is thus reported in part in the Reading Herald (Reading Pa.), of August 3:—

The continual teaching by employers that men can work in defiance of God on Sunday is a cause of strikes. Iron men and railroad companies are punished, destroyed and ruined because of their unwillingness to obey the divine command No. 4. The terrible condition of the iron industry and of the railroads is due to Sunday working. The world is restless and feverish to-day because the Lord's day is desecrated. That home of yours is not secure if you are not obedient to the Lord. Divorcee, murders, suicides, are due to the neglect of God and his work. The man who takes of the Lord's day is a thief.

Remembering that these assertions are made with reference to the first day of the week, let the reader turn and read "Command No. 4" of the divine code (Ex. 20:8-11) and see where the charge of "Sabbath desecration" really belongs.
