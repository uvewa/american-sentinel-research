The Spiritualists are said to entertain strong hopes of converting the noted "freethinker," Ingersoll, to their belief, and it is quite possible that their hopes are well founded. "Freethought," as represented by Ingersoll, is guided by the "evidence" of the senses, the same as is Spiritualism, and when sufficient "evidence" shall have been presented to the apostle of "free thought," in favor of the doctrine that the dead are alive and can communicate with their living friends, he cannot consistently refuse to accept it. And as this same doctrine is also a fundamental dogma of "orthodox" belief, we can see no logical reason why Mr. Ingersoll should not erelong be reckoned as belonging to "the church."
