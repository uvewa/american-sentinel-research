The question of Sunday enforcement is stirring the people of Gloucester, Mass. On the evening of July 23, the mayor's room at the city hall was packed with an audience gathered to hear arguments on the subject, pro and con. The meeting was the result of a trial of Sunday enforcement, and the great majority of those present voted in favor of its discontinuance. Several clergymen were present to argue for civil support of this church ordinance, but their words did not carry much influence, and they were considerably discomfitted when one speaker inquired what it was they preached for on Sunday if not for their salaries. Certainly, if it is right for a preacher to earn money on Sunday by following his accustomed vocation, it is right for other persons to enjoy the like privilege.
