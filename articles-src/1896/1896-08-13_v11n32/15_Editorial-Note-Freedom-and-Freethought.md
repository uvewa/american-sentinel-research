"FREEDOM" is an alluring word, but one which is often ignorantly appropriated where it does not belong. "Freethought" has a pleasant sound to many minds, but there is no freedom in the name. The child wishes to be "free," not realizing to what an extent it is the slave of circumstance. Given its "freedom," it would very soon come to grief through its inability to cope with surrounding difficulties. It could get nothing in comparison with what it would receive through parental care. "Freethinkers" are like children who do not want their parents to tell them anything. They want to enjoy the "freedom" which can be attained by their own wisdom and abilities. They forget that the very air which they breathe is not supplied by any wisdom or ability of their own; that these have not caused one heart-beat within their breasts. They forget that their creed provides no way of escape from that worst of all slaveries—the slavery of passion, which compels a person to do that which he would not, and which he knows to be dragging him to ruin. It is Christianity alone that stands for perfect liberty.
