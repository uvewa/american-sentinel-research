## RELIGION IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS.

[Christian Register, August 6, 1896.]

It seems likely that an effort will shortly be made by the united evangelical bodies to have a certain time set apart for regular religious instruction. The recent attempt made by the party of the Established Church in England to force sectarian instruction into the Board Schools proved a disastrous failure, but only because there all the evangelical forces united with the Unitarian in opposing a measure which was not their own. In this country the conditions will be entirely different; and, should the sects which now unite in Young Men's Christian Associations and Christian Endeavor Societies, both of which exclude Unitarians, join in a great popular clamor for sectarian education in the public schools, they would probably have a numerical majority. Already one of the influential magazines of education, the School Journal, which has heretofore advocated secular and religious training, has come out strongly in favor of special religious instruction.
