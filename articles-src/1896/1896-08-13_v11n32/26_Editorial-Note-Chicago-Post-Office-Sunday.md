From the Chicago Times-Herald we learn that in Chicago, by virtue of a recent decision of the post-office authorities, the delivery of mail never ceases, not even on Sunday. "The general delivery window at the Chicago post-office," says the Herald, "never closes. The key has been thrown in the lake." Until very recently Chicago observed the common custom of one-hour opening of the post-office to the public on Sundays.
