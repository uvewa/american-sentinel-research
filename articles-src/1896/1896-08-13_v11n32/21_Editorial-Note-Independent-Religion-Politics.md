The Independent of August 6 explains "for the benefit of the Catholic Review" and other Catholic journals, that its statement that "we need God in our politics as well as in our business and amusements," "did not mean that the General Conference of the Methodist Church should declare for the gold standard, nor that the Presbyterian General Assembly should give a deliverance on the tariff, nor that the Bishops of the Catholic church should direct all good Catholic voters to support Bryan and Sewall or McKinley and Hobart." Very true. Still, if it is proper to have "religion in politics," why should not the matter be taken up by the representative religious bodies, and managed by them in a way to make religion most effective in the political sphere? Perhaps there would be less contention among clergymen over political issues if they had some authoritative church pronouncements by which to be guided in their political discourses.
