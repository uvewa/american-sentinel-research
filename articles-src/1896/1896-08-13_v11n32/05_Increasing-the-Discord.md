**INCREASING THE DISCORD.**

As was to be expected, the practical application in American affairs of the principle of "religion in politics," by the plunging of the clergy into the vortex of the political issues now before the country, has resulted in a decided straining of the relations existing between the various bodies which profess to compose the body of Christ.

In another column reference is made to the language of the Rev. Dr. MacArthur, of New York City, on a recent occasion, when he denounced from the pulpit those persons whose politics are represented by the Democratic national "platform" adopted at the late Chicago convention. Possibly it did not occur to him at the time that his anathemas might light on the heads of others of like calling with himself; but it appears that they did, and that to no slight extent. The evidence is furnished by a letter from a Baptist clergyman in Utah, addressed to Dr. MacArthur through the *New York Journal*. The Baptist clergyman does not relish being stigmatized as an anarchist and traitor, or the application of such epithets to many others of his own vocation who share his political views. He writes:—

Are you aware that at least two-thirds of the Western and Southern ministry of your own denomination will indorse by their votes that platform? In attaching to them motives that are the essence of dishonor and dishonesty, are you giving a proper answer to that divine interrogation, "Who art thou that judgment another man's servant?"

"The writer goes on," says the Journal, "to suggest how such vituperation of the West and South only irritates and provokes fierce resentment."

Continuing, the Journal adds:—

Another clergyman in Brooklyn writes: "On the silver question, can a man not think, speak, and act, at least conscientiously, in opposition to Dr. MacArthur's private views without being an anarchist and a traitor, as he very strongly implies?"

More moderate in tone, but similar in nature to Mr. MacArthur's language, is the following from the well-known clergyman, Rev. Theo. L. Cuyler, published in the *Independent* of July 30, in reply to some statements made by another religious journal:—

This "watchman on the walls of Zion" actually defends a political policy which would rob every minister in his church of a part of his salary, rob every servant girl of a part of her hard earnings in the savings bank, and rob every soldier of a part of his pension. If this editor should say to me, "My conscience approves this policy," then I should reply, "In the name of common honesty, what business have you got to have such a conscience?"

We had supposed that there was division and discord enough in "the church," broken up as it is into almost countless denominations and factions, without bringing in also the controversies which belong to politics. But it is evident that the question of church unity is of secondary importance compared with the question of supremacy. When the arena of politics offers a favorable place for fighting the latter question out, the former is quickly forgotten. It was always so. The question of supremacy was the cause of all the division and trouble at the first, and it is the one great obstacle now to that unity among the Christian bodies which is so much sought.

So now we have before us the spectacle of one clergyman denouncing other clergymen as anarchists and traitors, and another one discounting the honesty of his fellow-clergyman's conscience, etc. Verily, it is an edifying spectacle which constitutes the first fruits of "religion in politics." And this is but the beginning. What we shall see and hear before the campaign is through no one can say, but certainly the discord in Christendom bids fair to be vastly increased. Is this what the Christian people of America want?
