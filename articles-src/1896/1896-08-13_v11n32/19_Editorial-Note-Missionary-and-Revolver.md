Speaking of the recent experience of Mr. Knapp, an American missionary in Turkey, with some officials of the Turkish government, the Independent of July 5 says: "He was compelled to give up his revolver, and was treated throughout as a criminal." There is usually some degree of connection between a criminal and a revolver; but it is not so evident what hardship there should be to a missionary in being obliged to part with such a weapon. Would it be that he would consider it a fatal blow to his success in missionary work?
