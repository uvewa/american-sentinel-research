## CHURCH AND STATE IN AUSTRIA-HUNGARY.

[New York Tribune.]*

MONSIGNOR AGLIARDI has his revenge. For meddling too much in Hungarian politics he has been compelled to retire from the office of papal nuncio at Vienna. But before doing so he has been made a cardinal, and the king of Hungary has been called upon to place the red cap upon his head. In addition he has hurled a Parthian shaft into the camp of his foes which is certain to cause vast trouble. This latter takes the form of a long "code of instructions," issued in the pope's name to the Roman Catholic clergy and laity of Hungary. It has been issued without the sanction of the king, which the law requires, and without the agency of the Hungarian primate, which custom and courtesy seem to demand. That is to say, it has been issued in the most defiant and irritating manner possible, as though its object were to annoy and to punish the Hungarians for their refusal to accept Monsignor Agliardi's dictation in political affairs.

Nor are the provisions of this document less aggressive than the manner of its issuance. Catholics are commanded to obey the rules of the church rather than the laws of Hungary, in civil as well as religious matters. The clergy are commanded to continue without cessation their opposition to and agitation against the civil marriage, religious equality, and other reform laws enacted by the Hungarian government. To this end brotherhoods and church societies are to be organized everywhere. Clerical newspapers are to be circulated everywhere. A vigorous propaganda is to be maintained among all classes. Especial attention is to be paid to regaining control of the schools and colleges. And, finally, the terrors of excommunication are to be threatened against all who seem inclined to obey the civil rather than the clerical laws.

There can be no mistaking the purport of this. It means war. The "code of instructions" is almost identical with that issued to the Roman Catholics of Germany as a response to the Falk laws, and we all know what that meant and what it accomplished. This differs from it only in the addition of certain vigorous clauses directed against Hungarian nationality and against Hungarian laws. By the national press of Hungary it is regarded as a challenge, which Hungary must accept, and which will surely precipitate a bitter struggle between Church and State. There is also a strong suspicion that the notorious reactionist, Dr. Lueger, has a hand in the matter. He is one of the most bitter foes of religious liberty, and an implacable enemy of Hungary. Whether or not he was concerned in the issuance of the mandate, therefore, he is certainly in sympathy with it, and will receive from it much aid and comfort in his efforts to break up the dual empire and to re-establish religious despotism.
