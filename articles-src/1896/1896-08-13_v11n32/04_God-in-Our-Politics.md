# GOD IN "OUR POLITICS."

THERE is a call for God to come into "our politics." Says the Independent: "We want God in our business as well as in our churches; in our amusements as well as in our devotion; in our politics most of all." [Italics ours.]

Yes, "we" want God in "our politics"; this doubtless speaks the mind of every political party in the land. But the trouble is, no one party wants God in the politics of the other parties; because, of course, "our politics" are the right politics, and ought to prevail, while the politics of the (perhaps) honest but sadly deluded other parties will only bring the country to ruin. Yes; we want God in "our politics"; and so strong is our desire for the salvation of the country that we want him there even more than we want him in our churches or our devotions!

It may be that "our politics" are not what they should be, but we know of no authoritative information that God purposes to save this country through politics. That there is a want of what is Godly in politics, is evident enough. But that is not a sufficient reason for inviting the Deity to come into them.
