## THE POWER OF CONSCIENCE.

"Christianity and Patriotism," by Count Leo Tolstoi.

They [despotic governments] know that power lies not in force, but in thought and in its clear expression, and consequently fear it more than armies. Therefore they institute censorships, bribe the press, monopolize the direction of religions, of schools. Yet the spiritual force which moves the world evades them nevertheless: it is not in the book, nor on the paper, it is always free and out of reach, it is in the conscience of men. That most powerful and free force manifests itself in man when he is alone, when he is pondering over life's phenomena, when he is sharing his thoughts with his wife, with his brother, his friend, from whom he considers it a sin to conceal what he thinks to be the truth. No billions of dollars, no millions of soldiers, no institutions, nor wars, nor revolutions can achieve what can be achieved by the simple expression by a free man of what he considers right.
