IGNORING CONSCIENCE IN OTHERS.

[New York Observer, August 6, 1896.]

INDIVIDUALISM was emphatically a product, if not the sole product, of the Reformation, which was but the unmistakable assertion of the freeness of the human unit to find and to worship God after the dictates of its own conscience. What the Reformation did was to once more set souls face to face with the Bible, and to bid them discover therein their God and their duty. It meant the education of the individual conscience on Bible lines. And it was natural that in view of the intolerable burdens which an unwieldy ecclesiasticism had previously imposed upon human consciences, the reaction from all control of opinion should have been extreme. Rome had stolen men's consciences away from them; and when its former slaves regained their rights of private judgment it was quite to be expected that they would in some cases turn their new-found freedom into license. But spiritual independence, however precious a privilege, must evidently have certain limits. It is not for a pretentious hierarchy like Rome to set those boundaries, nor can these limitations be imposed by any religious body against the will of the communicant. We do not live in an age of Test Acts. And yet it would be absurd to suppose that the conscience is free to form for itself any morality it desires, without let or hindrance from any principles existent objectively in the moral frame of the universe. There must be regulative influences somewhere about.

These outside criteria are found primarily, of course, in the Word of God, "the only infallible rule of faith and practice." But how shall that Word be interpreted? Suppose that my neighbor and I derive a different lesson from the same Word? Shall I then assume with a calm serenity that I am absolutely enlightened in my judgment of Scripture, or shall I use his conscience a bit for purposes of comparison both with mine and with the Word itself? The fanatic, whose creed is built up of the assumption that there is only one side to every question, namely, his side, would answer this last question in the negative, so absolutely convinced is he of his own infallibility. We are always out of patience with the bigot, who never uses any conscience save his own, but we cannot convince him. He is the spiritual protectionist, who completely encircles himself with a high tariff wall in order to exclude from his soul all disturbing ideas of a contrary nature to his own. It was out of a somewhat extended experience with such conceitedly convinced and often erratic believers that the godly and sensible Charles Spurgeon was once moved to remark with a fine though gentle irony: "It is strange that some persons, who think so much of what God's Spirit has revealed to them, should think so little of what he has revealed to other men."
