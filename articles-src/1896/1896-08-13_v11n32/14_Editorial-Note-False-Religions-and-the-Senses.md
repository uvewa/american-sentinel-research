It is predicted in Scripture (Matt. 24:24; 2 Tim. 3:8; Rev. 13:12, 14, etc.) that the time will come when false religions will appeal in a special manner to mankind through the avenue of the senses. False religions have always appealed to men in this way, having indeed no other means by which to gain their converts; but as the conflict between false and true reaches its climax, these appeals and the "evidence" on which they rest will be made as strong as possible, and there will be witnessed manifestations of a wonderful and startling character. These will present "evidence" which to the senses will be absolutely convincing, and will logically compel all who reject any other means of evidence to accept the doctrines for which they vouch. And thus will Spiritualism finally sweep into its ranks the atheists and "freethinkers" and all others of whatever party or creed who reject that other and most essential avenue for receiving religious truth—namely, faith. Here is the essential difference between Christianity and false religions; the one makes faith in the word of God the highest and most essential means of religious knowledge; the others seek always to convince by presenting something which appeals to the senses.
