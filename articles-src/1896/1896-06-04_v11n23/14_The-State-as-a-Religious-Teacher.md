## THE STATE AS A RELIGIOUS TEACHER.

[Present Truth, London, Eng.]

The dullest observer of events in the religious education controversy can now see very plainly why the Roman Catholic Church has always favored compulsory religious teaching in the Board schools, even when they had the gravest objections to what was taught. The great thing with Rome was to have the principle of State-taught religion maintained, trusting in its own power to turn the principle to the direct advantage of the Roman Church.

We remember commenting on this seven or eight years ago in these columns, quoting from the chief organ of the Catholic Church in England to show that, while they held the religion taught to be little better than heathenism, still they regarded those who were insisting that the Board schools should give religious instruction as "doing the work of the Pope as surely as if they were his hired emissaries." They said:—

Every year that passes sees a widening of the circle to which Catholic influences extend in this country. The day will certainly come when the true religion will be placed before the common people of England as it has not been placed before them since the time of Henry VIII.

At that time it was perhaps hardly supposed, even by them, that by 1896 they would be working in the lobbies of the House of Commons, with fair promise of success, in favor of a bill practically establishing their own schools. The bill does not go far enough to suit them, it is true, but the Pope, according to a recent dispatch, says that it is possible to tolerate the bill, and so it is accepted as a further confirmation of the purely papal principle that the State should be the servant of the Church, do as it is told, and pay the bills. So the hierarchy in England has issued an episcopal message favoring the partial endowment of their schools:—

The Education Bill now before Parliament has our goodwill and approval, because it proposes to recognize by statute Voluntary and Christian schools as an integral part of the national system of elementary education. It embodies a Christian principle which, as Catholic bishops, we must ever assert and maintain. That principle is that Christian parents possess an indefeasible natural right to have their children taught catechetically by approved teachers the definite doctrines of Christian faith and morals.

Those who have all along insisted on having a little religion made compulsory in the Board schools now find themselves illy prepared to struggle against this direct establishment of State-paid Catholic teaching. The Catholics, Roman and Anglican, both retort that the Protestant element has always wanted compulsory religious teaching, and they can say that the objectors to the proposed scheme differ only in degree and not in principle. Everything is working out in Rome's favor simply because the papal principle of advancing religion by human authority and political scheming will always work out in favor of the papal religion. The preaching of the Word—not by the State, but by those who believe—is the only thing that succeeds against Rome.
