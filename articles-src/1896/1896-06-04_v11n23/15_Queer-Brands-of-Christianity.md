## QUEER BRANDS OF "CHRISTIANITY."

The San Francisco Monitor (Roman Catholic) of May 9, has this note:—

The account of the "Trilby Auction" in one of the Sunday papers throws a curious light on the methods of the Epworth Leaguers. The auction was held in a Methodist church for the purpose of raising the back salary of the preacher. The village belles, old, middle-aged and young stood behind a curtain and their feet were auctioned off. If this is Christianity, it is a mighty queer brand.

This kind of "Christianity" will do to go with another "queer brand" exhibited of late to a considerable extent by this Methodist organization, in the support it has given to the movement to secure religious legislation. It is a "queer brand" of Christianity indeed which aims to compel men to religious observances by the power of the civil arm. The two brands go well together. Both are indications of the absence of the power and Spirit of Christ.
