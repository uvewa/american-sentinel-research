## GOD IN THE CONSTITUTION.

[The Examiner, Butte, Mont., May 14.]

In the columns of the Examiner we have before referred to God in the Constitution. Our attention is once more called to it by a portion of a recent letter from Supreme President Traynor, in which he refers to the joint resolution introduced by Congressman Morse, to amend the Constitution of the United States by inserting the words: "Acknowledging Almighty God as the source of all power and authority in civil government, our Lord Jesus Christ as the ruler of nations, and his revealed will as the supreme authority in civil affairs."

As Traynor well and aptly says: "If this remarkable and dangerous proposal had emanated from the pen of the Pope of Rome himself, it could not have been more inimical to the true spirit of our national government."

In the canon law of the church of Rome, Art. 9 reads, "That the pontiff was called God by the pious Prince Constantine, and that as God he cannot be judged as man." Art. 10, "That he as God is far above the reach of all human law and judgment."

Let Protestants, and all true Americans, consider this question and ask themselves fairly what the result would be, and what opportunities the introduction of God in the Constitution would present to the Roman hierarchy.

It is not our purpose here and now to speak of those of the Jewish faith, of liberals and agnostics, who by such introduction would be disfranchised. As the Constitution now stands, it guarantees to all perfect civil and religious liberty. With the proposed change the way would be opened to unlimited strife, bickering and contentions which if ever decided in favor of any would result in injustice to the rest.
