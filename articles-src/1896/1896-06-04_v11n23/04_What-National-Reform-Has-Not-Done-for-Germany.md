## WHAT NATIONAL REFORM HAS NOT DONE FOR GERMANY.

ACCORDING to the National Reform theory, Germany ought to be one of the most moral countries in the world, for there the nation has a religion; God is recognized as supreme, and the emperor reigns by "divine right." But what are the facts as to morals in Germany? They are as bad probably as in any civilized country in the world.

May 23, in a meeting of the Baptist Missionary Union, at Asbury Park, the Rev. F. A. Remley delivered an address, in which he attacked social and religious conditions in Germany. The question on which he spoke was, "Are Missions Needed in Germany?"

"Although the question seems to be preposterous," said Mr. Remley, "a more than four years' residence and study of the condition of things in Germany showed me a deplorable condition of affairs.

"My heart bleeds to disclose it, for I love the German people. In Germany every one belongs to some church. In 1890 there were 31,000,000 Protestants, 17,500,000 Roman Catholics, and 500,000 Jews. The people are grouped together in monstrous churches, and no adequate arrangements are made for their religious and spiritual instruction.

"In 1891 I attended services in a Lutheran church, in Hamburg, and there were eighteen persons present. That church has a membership of 41,000. In a suburb of Leipsic, in a church of 10,000 membership, they frequently hold the principal services of the day with from twelve to forty-five persons present. The average attendance at all the services on Sunday in all the churches in the city of Leipsic, according to a Lutheran pastor, ranges from 5,000 to 8,000. For the great masses in Germany religion and morality have no necessary connection, and they see nothing improper in thieves, drunkards, and debauchess remaining members of the church.

"It may be stated on competent German authority that in 1888 there were 200,000 women in Germany who made their living by immorality; that in Berlin there are as many such women as seats in all the churches of the city; that in large cities 90 per cent. of all men are impure, and that most of the unmarried men of all classes are fallen. A Leipsic paper is authority for the statement that in the empire between 1880 and 1890 an annual average of over 166,000 illegitimate children were born. This is not the place to give more of this hideous picture. Only think of it. All this is within the pales of the Jewish Church and the churches of Jesus Christ!

"The Lutheran Church, in its 'homes' for tramps and its hotels for travelers, is engaged in the sale of intoxicating liquors. The drink habit holds the German people in its iron grasp. Of the three drinks—wine, beer, and whiskey—in 1890 there was consumed in Germany an average of over twenty-eight gallons per inhabitant. Nearly a barrel was the share of every little babe! German authorities estimate that annually not less than 10,000 people in the empire fall victims to delirium tremens. Twenty-seven per cent. of the inmates of the insane asylums of the Rhine Provinces became insane through drink. Of the 32,837 prisoners in Germany (1885), 41 per cent. committed their crimes while under the influence of liquor. Of the 300,000 or more persons annually convicted of crimes and offenses in the empire, it is estimated that drink is responsible for 70 per cent., and this, too, is all within the Church.

"At Sunday-school picnics, temperance meetings, and social religious meetings, beer and wine are freely used. A brewery in Leipsic has the following inscription in large gold letters on a marble slab over the front door: 'To the Lord is this brewery intrusted; only there is prosperity and blessing where his hand labors.' Social life centers in the beer glass. Hospitality without beer or wine is impossible. A theological professor, at whose home I was being entertained, said to me: 'It is sad, Mr. Remley; one does not know how to entertain you, for you do not drink or smoke.'

"Gambling is rampant in Germany. The different States and the churches, Protestant and Catholic, conduct lotteries; and gambling in lotteries is considered to be the respectable, proper thing to do.

"Having received their religious and philosophical instruction in the universities, many pastors have their own private philosophy of life and views of the Bible and Christianity which they cannot give to the people, for the dogmas of the Church have been accepted by the State and are made binding upon all pastors. So there is a tendency toward one faith or belief for the pastor and another for the people. The Church is crippled by being united to the States and being made a prop for monarchy. Germany, it seems to me, stands before a religious crisis. The Church is losing its grip upon the people. That large and increasing power—Social Democracy—is opposed to the Church and in the main hostile to Christianity. The spiritual life of the Church is at a very low ebb, and great waves of rationalism, materialism, and infidelity threaten to overwhelm her."
