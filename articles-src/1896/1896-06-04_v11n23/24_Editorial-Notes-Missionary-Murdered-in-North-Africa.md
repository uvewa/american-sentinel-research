SUNDAY evening, May 24, Rev. Dr. Leighton Williams told the congregation of the Amity Baptist Church, in West Fifty-fourth Street, this city, the details of the murder of the missionary Dr. Charles F. Leach, and his wife and young son, which occurred on May 7, at Fsax, near Tunis, in North Africa. Dr. Leach was formerly a physician of New York, and eight years ago the Amity Baptist Church sent him to Algiers to do missionary work. Two years later he was transferred to another field, and while in Fsax he conducted a dispensary for the Arabs in addition to his regular work. Dr. Leach's home was on the outskirts of the town, and, according to the letter received, he was found dead in his room on the morning of May 8. There were ten knife wounds in his body. His wife had been stabbed four times, and the boy, who was six years old, had been murdered in the same manner. No reason is known for the murder except religious hate. Dr. Leach was the first missionary to venture into the territory about Fsax.
