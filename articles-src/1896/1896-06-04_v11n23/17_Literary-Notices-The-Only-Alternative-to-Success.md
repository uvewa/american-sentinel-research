## LITERARY NOTICES.

### "The only Alternative to Success."

We have received from the author, G. H. Lyon, a copy of a little 46 page pamphlet, with the foregoing title. It is inscribed, "For prohibition with a party behind it, and for the Sabbath with God's law behind it; each sustained in the strong defenses of its own realm."

The pamphlet is a review of the attitude of the Prohibition Party toward prohibition, and enforces religious observance, especially as pertaining to the so-called "Christian sabbath."

As shown by the inscription quoted above, Mr. Lyon is not in favor of political religion, nor of enforcing any religious observance by law; and in the brief compass of the pamphlet referred to, he gives the Prohibition Party some excellent advice which it would do well to take, but which, as evidenced by the action of the recent Prohibition Convention at Pittsburg, it has not seen fit to act upon.

We shall take occasion, eroding, to quote at some length from Mr. Lyon's booklet, especially in regard to "prohibition one day in seven."

Everything is not said in this pamphlet as we would say it, yet it is a valuable little work and ought to have a wide circulation. It sells for fifteen cents per single copy, or eight copies for one dollar. It is well printed on good paper, has a neat paper cover, and is substantially stitched with wire. Address the author, G. H. Lyon, Sistersville, Va.
