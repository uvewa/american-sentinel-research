THE Weekly Spokane (Wash.) Review recently had this significant item:

Waitsburg has seldom had such an exciting election as that which just ended. The contest was between the upholders and opponents of Sunday closing, and the Church people won the day.

These contests in which the church people are arrayed on one side, and non-church people on the other, are becoming entirely too frequent; they bode no good to our country. The Church as such has no proper place in political affairs; and the fact that the church people rally so readily in behalf of Sunday enforcement is an evil omen.
