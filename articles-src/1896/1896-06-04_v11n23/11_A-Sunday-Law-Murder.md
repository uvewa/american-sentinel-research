## A SUNDAY-LAW MURDER.

[The following dispatch appeared in the morning papers in this city on the 25th ult. If the facts are as stated, the action of the officers was a dastardly outrage:—]

PROVIDENCE, R. I., May 24.—A double tragedy occurred just over the State line in Massachusetts to-day. It was at the old Robinson Homestead, near Broadway, in Attleboro.

For some time past there have been complaints that the Pawtucket toughs were crossing the line from Rhode Island and desecrating the sabbath. The Selectmen ordered the town constables to see that the laws were enforced, and last Sunday they started to weed out the law-breakers. Early last week the members of the East Side Checker Club, of Pawtucket, obtained permission from George G. Parker, the present occupant of the Homestead, to hold a clam-bake on the farm to-day. The club is composed of Pawtucket liquor dealers, and has never borne a bad reputation.

This morning about seventy people drove out to Attleboro. They carried all the material for the bake, including seven barrels of beer. The company then amused themselves until 2 o'clock, when the bake was served, and at 4 o'clock all, with the exception of a few late comers, left the table.

Just at that moment two men were seen emerging from the woods and were recognized as special officers. Officer John Nearey was in front and Officer Briggs was close behind. As they crossed the fields to the grove Daniel Mountain, a saloon-keeper on Norton Street, Pawtucket, and Michael, or "Muzzle" Conners, of No. 24 Water Street, Pawtucket, advanced to meet them, while seventy others hurried up to witness the result of the interview. The story of the tragedy that followed

is told by George T. Fisher and James R. Tyler, both of whom are given a good name by the Pawtucket police.

## The First Bullet Fatal.

They say that Mountain ordered the officers to leave, as they had the right to use the property, and that Officer Nearey, without other provocation, pulled his revolver and shot twice at Conners, who had not spoken a word. The first ball went directly through his heart, and as he fell Nearey sent the other bullet through the top of his head, while the other officer, not content with what had been done, drew his pocket billy and began to pound the dead man on the head.

In a moment there was an uproar. The crowd surrounded the officers and Tyler seized Nearey's pistol hand by the wrist. He grabbed him also around the neck and succeeded in pulling him to the ground. There the men fought like demons, Tyler, as he says, having no other intention than to prevent further bloodshed. Twice Nearey pressed the muzzle of his pistol against Tyler's abdomen and each time Tyler was quick enough to prevent him from pulling the trigger. At last Tyler managed to get the muzzle of the pistol between the first and second fingers of his hand, and it was in this position when Nearey managed to pull the trigger three times. The first shot struck Dan Mountain in the abdomen and he died almost without a struggle. At this Tyler freed Nearey, and as the latter arose and looked at the two dead bodies, he said: "Gentlemen, I'm sorry, but I lost control of my temper."

## Then the Officer Ran.

He then turned and ran up the hill, the crowd close at his heels, throwing stones after the thoroughly frightened officer. Some of these struck him on the head, and although the blood was trickling down his face, he did not stop until he reached the top of the hill, where he met Deputy Sheriff Brown. He placed Nearey in the charge of Briggs and sent him home while he remained to pacify the excited crowd.

Mr. Parker, who owns the farm, corroborated the story of the men in every particular. He says that the club was perfectly orderly and that the shooting was entirely unprovoked. Nearey is now at home suffering severely from the punishment he received, but a writ will be issued for his arrest in the morning.

Conners was twenty-eight years old and leaves a widow and seven children, the oldest eight years and the youngest a few months old. Mountain was thirty-two and had a wife and three children.
