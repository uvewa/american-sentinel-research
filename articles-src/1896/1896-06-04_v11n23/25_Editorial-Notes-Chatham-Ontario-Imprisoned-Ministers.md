THUS far only one of the three condemned Seventh-day Adventist ministers has been imprisoned at Chatham, Ont. William Simpson, as our readers know, has been in prison for nearly four weeks, and has still about two weeks to serve. P. M. Howe has been in the neighborhood several times, and the authorities have known where to find him, but have not troubled themselves to arrest him. He has made no effort to keep out of their way, neither has he offered to deliver himself up, but has simply gone about his business as an itinerant minister without any reference to the sentence hanging over him. The opinion has been expressed by one in a position to know, that he is not wanted.

William Simpson, the imprisoned minister, was, at last accounts, enjoying good health, and rejoicing even in tribulation. His fare is little but bread and water, as he cannot endure the prison skilligalee.
