# SALVATIONIST ARRESTED.

A SENSATION was caused in Tottenville, Staten Island, last week, by the arrest and imprisonment of a Salvation Army captain for "obstructing the streets."

"The prisoner," says the Journal of the 26th inst., "is Captain James Fairbrother, who commands the English Salvation Army Corps, located at Perth Amboy. Sunday afternoon Captain Fairbrother, with twenty-five members of his corps, came here to hold services. The Salvationists took a position on Main Street, and with drums and tambourines, songs and exhortations, soon attracted a crowd numbering several hundred. They were within earshot of the principal hotels in the village.

"Private Stumbles was engaged in fervent prayer when a policeman forced his way through the crowd and the ranks of the Army and tapped the soldier on the shoulder. Private Stumbles stopped and turned in surprise to the policeman, who quietly asked him to suspend the meeting on the public street. The only answer of the soldier was the continuance of the prayer. He was brought to a stop, however, when the bluecoat informed him curtly that he was under arrest. The prisoner was taken to the station, but the meeting continued with even greater fervor than before. After a consultation the police decided that they would not hold a mere private, and released the prisoner. Private Stumbles hastened back to the meeting, followed leisurely by the policeman, who found Captain Fairbrother making an address.

"The policeman made his way again into the circle and requested the captain to desist. This the Salvationist leader refused to do, and he was arrested and the meeting was broken up. When Captain Fairbrother was arraigned in court he declined to make any defense except to declare that he was serving God. Justice Smith found him guilty and imposed a fine of $10. In default of the payment of this fine he was sentenced to ten days' imprisonment in the County Jail. He will serve out his sentence, as he says the Army's policy is not to pay fines of those imprisoned for such offenses."
