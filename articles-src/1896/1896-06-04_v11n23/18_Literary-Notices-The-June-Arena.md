## The June "Arena."

The June Arena opens its 16th volume, appearing in a new dress, and being printed by Skinner, Bartlett & Co. It is an unusually strong number, opening with a brilliant paper by Rev. Samuel Barrows, D. D., the distinguished editor of the Christian Register, of Boston, on "The First Pagan Critic of Christian Faith and His Anticipation of Modern Thought."

Justice Walter Clark, LL. D., of the Supreme Bench of North Carolina, contributes an instructive and delightful paper on Mexico, the interest of which is enhanced by several excellent illustrations, including a recent portrait of the President of the Mexican Republic. The President of the Mercantile National Bank of New York contributes "A Proposed Platform for American Independents for 1896," which illustrates how strongly the silver movement is taking hold of Eastern financiers, no less than the mass of voters in the South and West. Recently Jay Cook, the veteran banker, who floated the government bonds in 1861, at the time of our worst need, came out boldly for free silver. Mr. St. John, who has made finance a study for more than twenty years, and who is president of a bank having a capital of $1,000,000, is no less pronounced on this subject.

Another paper of special merit, on "Bimetallism," appears in this number by A. J. Utley. It is able and from a silver point of view very convincing.

Professor Parsons, of Boston University Law School, continues his masterly papers on the "Government Control of Telegraph," a series of careful papers hitherto unapproached in authoritative character.

Mr. B. O. Flower, the editor of the Arena, writes in most captivating manner of Whittier, considering him in the aspect of a "Poet of Freedom," and giving many of Whittier's most stirring lines. A fine portrait of the Quaker Poet forms a frontispiece to this number. The editor also discusses somewhat at length in his editorials, the message of Whittier to men and women of to-day, and the proposed platform of Mr. St. John. Another interesting feature of this issue is Mr. Eltweed Pomeroy's illustrated paper on the "Direct Legislation Movement and Its Leaders."

Students of the higher metaphysical thought of our time will be deeply interested in Horatio W. Dresser's paper, entitled, "The Mental Cure in its Relation to Modern Thought." Will Allen Dromgoole continues her powerful serial of "Tennessee Life," and Mrs. Calvin Kryder Reifsnider's "Psychical Romance," which opened a few months since, is prefaced by a digest of the preceding chapters. It is also profusely illustrated with exceptionally fine drawings.

These are by no means the full quota of the strong attractions of this brilliant number of America's great progressive, reformative and liberal review.
