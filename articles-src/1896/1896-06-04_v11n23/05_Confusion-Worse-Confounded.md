## "CONFUSION WORSE CONFOUNDED."

The California Standard, an A. P. A. paper, published in San Francisco, has in its issue of May 2, an editorial paragraph, which runs as follows:—

An earnest friend requests us to define the bad results of uniting State and Church. We are glad that he has changed the common expression of "Church and State," thus half answering the question by placing State first. The Church could not exist without the State well organized to support it. To understand this proposition thoroughly it is necessary to go back to first principles and accept the declaration of the head of the Church, and the person upon whom it is founded in a spiritual sense. Christ declared in most emphatic terms, "My kingdom is not of this world," and through all ages since the era from which all dates in the civilized world are taken, the civil and political powers have been recognized as ourselves of the Church. Wherever the Church has wielded power over the civil and political concerns of a nation, and assumed temporal power, that country has been overthrown and its people held in gross ignorance. There is but one nation of any importance at this time where the Church and State are united, and that is Spain. Its decadence marks the effects of papal rule. Its history is a sad one. Once the grandest in the world; now the weakest and most despised. Italy is only emerging from dense ignorance since the civil power dissolved the unity of Church and State. One is liberty and progress, the other is ignorance and slavery.

The thought underlying this paragraph is

as mischievous as is the papal idea of the State subservient to the Church; in fact, it is in effect the same thing. The Catholic position is that the State exists for the sake of, and to serve the Church. The California Standard asserts, and evidently approves the idea, that "civil and political powers have been recognized as nurseries of the Church."

Civil governments have been recognized as nurseries of the Church only where they have been perverted from their true purpose. Civil government is properly recognized only as the conservator of civil rights. The State can properly be the nursery of the Church only in the same sense that it is the nursery of any other institution with which it has no connection whatever any more than to guard its rights. The State should sustain no different relation to the Church than it sustains to Oddfellowship or Freemasonry. The State guarantees to every organization and to every peaceable assemblage protection from disturbance. The State guarantees property rights to every properly organized association or society regardless of the object for which it is incorporated; it does this alike for the Church and for the Liberal club. The moment the State makes any difference between the Church or between churches and other organizations not-destructive of civil society, it is upon dangerous ground.

Our contemporary says that the Church could not exist without the State; that is true only in a limited sense. The Church could exist as well or better without the State than could any other association of individuals. But of course the State is necessary for the preservation of civil order, and churches share, and are entitled to share, the benefits equally with individuals and with other associations.

We think, however, that the Standard has been unfortunate in expression rather than in thought, and that the editor believes and desires better than he has stated.
