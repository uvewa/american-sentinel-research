# HOW THE POPE REGARDED IT.

Speaking of the recent move made by the Catholic cardinals of England, Ireland, and America, toward the establishment of a court of international arbitration, a writer in the Western Watchman, of May 14, says:—

At the Vatican the scheme proposed has been highly applauded. It is the practical deduction from the Pope's teaching and the continuance and outcome of his aims toward universal peace. Indeed, reference is made to this in the appeal itself. "Such a court [of international arbitration] existed for centuries when the nations of Christendom were united in one faith. And have we not seen nations appeal to that same court for its judgment in our own day?"

The incident referred to here was the selection of Leo XIII. by the Emperor of Germany to arbitrate between Germany and Spain regarding the right of proprietorship in the Caroline Islands. Leo XIII. did not consider it fitting, in the circumstances, that he should arbitrate between the two Powers. He consented to be a mediator between them. His mediation was accepted and his conclusions received as binding.

When the matter was settled Leo XIII. sent to Prince Bismarck the insignia of the very distinguished Order of Christ, accompanied by a kindly letter. And so important did the Pope deem this selection of himself as mediator that it formed the subject of the medal cast in the following year on the feast of St. Peter. The figure of the Pontiff bearing an olive branch stands between the figures of Germany and Spain; around the border of the medal are the words: "Controversia de insulis Karolinis ex sequitatis dirempta," and beneath the feet of the figures are the words: "Pacis arbitra et conciliatrix," with the date "MDCCCLXXXV."

The Pope was quite right in regarding the selection commemorated by this medal as an important one; and he now aims to give a practical character to this importance by extending the idea to the formation of an international papal court of arbitration.
