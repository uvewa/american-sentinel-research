THE London Times, of the 26th ult., published a dispatch from Athens saying that since Sunday anarchy has reigned in Canea, where the Turkish soldiery has poured through the streets, shooting, massacring, and pillaging Christians.

The immediate cause of the disturbance in Canea is unknown and inexplicable. In that city there has not been the slightest provocation offered by the Christians to the Turks throughout the anomalous régime of the past six years.
