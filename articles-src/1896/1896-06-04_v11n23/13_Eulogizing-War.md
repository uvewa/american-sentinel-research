## EULOGIZING WAR.

In a speech delivered in St. Louis, Mo., May 9, Archbishop Ireland alluded to the agitation in behalf of international arbitration, in these words:—

War is the great instigator of patriotism. If we come to a stage where everything in dispute is to be peacefully settled, we will gradually lose the interest in the affairs of our country in its relation with other governments that now animates us.

The policy of the Papacy is consistent with war as well as with international arbitration. It knows how to turn each to its advantage. But we can well afford to dispense with that bloodthirsty brand of "patriotism" which cannot be kept alive without being fed upon the ghastly horrors of war.
