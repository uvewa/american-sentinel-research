J. W. Lewis, imprisoned in Tiptonville, Tenn., for a similar offense, is likewise enjoying good health, and is happy in the consciousness of having done right. He is still permitted all the liberty consistent with imprisonment; has plenty of good food and finds no fault whatever with his treatment, though he is deprived of liberty.
