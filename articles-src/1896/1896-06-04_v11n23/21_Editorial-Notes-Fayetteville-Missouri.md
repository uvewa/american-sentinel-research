C. B. HALL, a Seventh-day Adventist of Fayetteville, Mo., sends word that he has been threatened with arrest by some citizens of that place for working at his trade on Sunday. His business is sharpening tools, which he does in a small movable booth in the streets of the city. Other people and Adventists, who do business in the streets on Sunday, such as milk and ice peddlers, pop-corn sellers, liverymen and railroad men, are not disturbed. The Sunday statute of Missouri contains a sweeping exemption for all seventh-day observers, but this does not seem in the least to deter religious bigotry from attempting to make Mr. Hall its victim.
