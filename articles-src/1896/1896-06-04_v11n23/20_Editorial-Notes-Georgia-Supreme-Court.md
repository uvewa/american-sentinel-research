THE Eagle of Gainesville, Ga., commenting on the decision of the Georgia Supreme Court in the cases of Messrs. McCutchen and Keck, the Seventh-day Adventists fined fifty dollars each for "disturbing the peace" by working on Sunday, says: "It looks like any one ought to know that doing carpenter work in the ordinary way is not a disturbance of the peace. We are glad to know that our upper court has stepped in and placed the conscientious members of a Christian church on the same footing before the law as the keeper of a livery stable."
