As noted in these columns a week ago, the Presbyterian General Assembly, in session at Saratoga, May 22, tabled a resolution introduced by Elder L. P. Main, of Kearney, Neb., expressing "lack of sympathy with the criminal prosecution of those persons who honestly and conscientiously observe the seventh day of the week instead of the first." "Mr. Main was given to understand," says the Chicago Tribune, of the 23rd ult., "that the assembly had no control over criminal law." Nevertheless that assembly proceeded at once to pass this resolution:

Resolved, That those sabbath associations of our land, having a Christian basis, and being in sympathy with Sunday laws passed with a view to protect the day of rest and worship, should have a claim upon the cooperation and practical support of the Christian public, and that we especially indorse with our cordial approval the American Sabbath Union, and the Woman's National Sabbath Alliance (auxiliary to the American Sabbath Union), and recommend these organizations especially to Christian men and women in all our communities.

It seems that consistency is about as rare in the Presbyterian General Assembly as anywhere else; it is, therefore, still a jewel.
