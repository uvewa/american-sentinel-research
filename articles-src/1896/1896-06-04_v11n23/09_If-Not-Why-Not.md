# IF NOT, WHY NOT?

[South African Sentinel, Cape Town, May, 1896.]

The Commission appointed by the Raad in the Orange Free State to draft a law for a better sabbath observance, recommend the prohibition of the following, as recently published in a Free State paper: "Slaughtering, baking, catching fish, planting, sowing, and work of all kinds at public diggings, riding loaded vehicles (except passenger vehicles), races, giving or attending dancing parties, concerts, processions, cricket, tennis (except in closed grounds at distance from churches), Penalty for contravention not exceeding £20 or two months."

Such proposed legislation leads naturally to the inquiry, does not the State go beyond its rightful jurisdiction in enforcing religious observances? The Sabbath is not an institution of the Free State; it was ordained by Jehovah before the fall of man. The observance of the Sabbath, therefore is a religious duty that man owes to his Creator. God has never delegated to the Raad the right to incorporate into its statutes the laws of his Government, and to enforce them by fines and penalties. If they may enforce the Sabbath, why may they not also enforce baptism, the Lord's supper, or any other religious duty? Sabbath-keeping is a religious duty, and as such it is rendered, not to man but to

God. Man is responsible to God alone for the observance of a Sabbath, just as well as for every other act of worship. If he chooses to use that day in recreation or work, instead of in rest or worship, who has the right to say that he may not do so? If he chooses to bake, to plant, to play cricket, or to have a game of tennis on the Sabbath, who is injured? Are not these things lawful on any other day of the week? Every one must see that these things are not wrong in themselves, but they are wrong because they are considered irreligious. No man's civil or religious rights are infringed by these acts; for one man's work does not interfere with another man's rest, nor does one man's irreligion deprive another man of his religious rights.

When civil governments enact laws touching religious duties, or dictate to man in reference to his duty to his Creator, they overstep the bounds of their lawful jurisdiction; they assume the prerogative of Deity, a right to judge even the consciences of men. Every such act is a step backward, and if carried to its logical end, will result in the erection of another inquisition, and a repetition of the scenes of the "Dark Ages." If not, why not?
