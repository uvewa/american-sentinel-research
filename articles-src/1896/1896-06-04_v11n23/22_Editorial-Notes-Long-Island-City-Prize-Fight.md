Some clergymen of Long Island City have put their heads together and succeeded in suppressing a prize-fight, or "glove contest," advertised to be held in that place. They did this through a shrewd manipulation of the legal forces which they were able to summon to their aid.

We have, of course, nothing to say in favor of exhibitions of brutality; but it seems that glove contests are not the kind of fighting which the clerico-civic reformers of this day are prepared to sanction. What they want in that line is something more genuine, such as is foreshadowed by the church and school "boys' brigades," with their military uniforms and drill, and their real muskets and bayonets. When these "brigades" come to put their military knowledge into practical use, or in other words, when people are shot, stabbed, and clubbed in regular military warfare, it will be justifiable by the rules of our "Christian" civilization, in harmony with which these "boys' brigades" were formed. Fighting in itself is all right, but it must be conducted in the manner approved by civilized "Christian" nations! The prizering style of fighting does not kill or maim individuals in the proper way.

But what must be the effect of this action of the clergymen upon the class of people interested in exhibitions of the kind prevented on this occasion? Must it not tend to embitter them against the clergymen and that for which they stand, and thus drive them further away from that gospel which they so much need? If it were not clerical action and recognized as such, we would have nothing to say against it. But when the gospel of Christ is so misrepresented as in this and other similar proceedings, by appeals to the civil authorities, the resulting evil is much greater than that which is sought to be suppressed.
