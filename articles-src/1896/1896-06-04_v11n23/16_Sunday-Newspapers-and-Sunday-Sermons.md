## SUNDAY NEWSPAPERS AND SUNDAY SERMONS.

[Detroit Free Press, May 4, 1896.]

A KALEIDOSCOPIC view of yesterday's sermons is strikingly suggestive of the modern Sunday newspapers. The various pulpit discourses contained a little of politics, a little of stage gossip, a little of religion, a little of advertising, a little of literature, and a little of various other elements that go to make up the Sunday newspapers. In addition there was a great deal of editorial comment, and opiniated matter that could hardly be classified. One preacher denounced the theater as a cesspool of immorality and vice. Another warmly commended the theater

ter as a power in the upbuilding of humanity. One scored the newspapers and another took the view that even the Sunday paper is a great moral agent. It is evident that the ministers of Detroit have never held a caucus, and determined just what their composite belief is. It may be taken for granted that the authors of the multi-moral sermons yesterday are all sincere Christians, and all conscientious in their efforts to uplift humanity. The disagreement is merely on the means to the end, and should be comforting to everybody. With such a multiplicity of beliefs, nobody should experience any difficulty in finding the kind of doctrine that suits him, and here is where the resemblance of the various sermons to a Sunday newspaper is again in evidence.
