THE following appeared in the New York World, of April 12:—

LITTLE ROCK, April 11.—Chester Gordon and his wife, two intelligent and respectable citizens of Eagle Township, in this county, were convicted this week in the court presided over by Albert Desha, a justice of the peace, of sabbath breaking, and were fined $5 each.

It was proved (and no attempt was made to deny the charge) that they are Adventists, and in accordance with the tenets of their faith, are accustomed to rest on Saturday, which they consider their Sabbath, and to labor on Sunday.

They refused to pay the fines, although able to do so, and by order of the court were remanded to the county jail, where they now are. Husband and wife were handcuffed together when brought into town by a deputy constable.

The Sunday law of Arkansas provides as follows concerning persons in the State who observe another day of the week as the Sabbath:—

SECTION 1886. Persons who are members of any religious society who observe as Sabbath any other day of the week than the Christian sabbath, or Sunday, shall not be subject to the penalties of this act, so that they observe one day in seven, agreeable to the faith and practice of their church or society.

We have received no information as yet from other sources concerning this case.
