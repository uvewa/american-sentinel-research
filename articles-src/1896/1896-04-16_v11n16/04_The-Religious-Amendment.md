# THE RELIGIOUS AMENDMENT.

For the present the proposed religious amendment is dead, but the National Reformers will not let the matter rest. Another Congress will see it revived and urged with a persistency worthy of a better cause, hence it is still a live question for discussion. Concerning it the Protestant American says:—

"But what harm can come of such an amendment? says some reader. In the first place there are thousands of "the people of the United States" who do not make such acknowledgment, and the adoption of such amendment would only pave the way to compel them by civil amendment to at least act as though they did, which would only be to make hypocrites of such as would in all other respects be considered good citizens.

"This amendment would not make the nation any more Christian, because Christianity is a thing of the heart and life of the individual, and the adoption must be an individual act, and anything short of this is not Christianity at all, but an empty mockery. Therefore, every Christian should protest against the adoption of such an amendment.

"More than this, the adoption of this proposed amendment would be to make so-called Christianity the national religion, and the "revealed will of Jesus Christ"—the Bible—the creed of the nation. And this would not be the word of God, that "revealed will," to each individual to be studied, interpreted and accepted by the individual guided by the Holy Spirit, but as interpreted by the Government, by a tribunal appointed by the nation. Thus again, as in days gone by, would the word of God be put into the hands of crafty, designing men, a priesthood of corruption, intolerance and bigotry, and its interpretation be found in the decrees of national councils with all the power of the nation back of these decrees to enforce them, which would be persecution for conscience' sake. And so again, no Christian should be found upon the side of such an amendment; and we are sure that when the matter is seen in its true light they will oppose it.

"It is further evident from the foregoing that the proposed amendment would be a union of Church and State. This being so, every truly loyal, patriotic person will be henceforth, now and ever, opposed to any such amendment, as being un-American, un-Christian and therefore utterly inconsistent and out of harmony with the principles upon which this government was founded."
