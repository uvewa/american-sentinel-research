# STRANGE "CHRISTIAN" ENTERPRISE IN INDIA.

The working of any movement to promote Christianity among men by the power of political or social combinations, human precepts and traditions, or any means other than the divine means which God himself provides and controls, is being illustrated in a movement to secure a better observance of Sunday as the "Christian sabbath," in India. The following account of the undertaking is furnished by the St. Louis Christian Advocate:—

There has recently been formed in India a "Lord's Day Union," the purpose of which is to secure a better observance of the Christian sabbath. As originally constituted, the union was composed, not only of Europeans resident in India, but also of Christian natives, who, seeing about them a constant violation of the Christian sabbath, by Hindoces and Mohammedans, determined to do what they could in order to secure more respect for the sabbath as an institution. With this end in view they went to work disseminating Christian literature, showing the propriety of rest on one day in seven, and also designed to impress upon the minds of the public the sanctity of the day and the good results that would follow from its observance after a Christian fashion.

The result was, in one respect, quite unexpected. The Lord's Day Union succeeded well among the Christians, for it is said a marked improvement in the observance of Sunday has been noted in those parts of India where it has been laboring. Stores and workshops have been closed, the peasant farmers have been induced to cease from their ordinary vocations, and among many classes the beneficial results of the labors of the union have been quite marked.

A sabbath in England is the perfection of a Christian day of rest, and the English in India, while diverging in no small degree from the religion of their island home, have nevertheless retained a considerable measure of respect for the sabbath, and have been shamed into a still closer observance by the example of the Christian natives. The consequence is that in the Christian quarters of many Indian cities the Sunday is said to resemble that of an English country town.

But the union is now contending with a very strange problem. It seems that Hindoces and Mohammedans, noticing the benefits to be gained from a careful observance of the Christian sabbath, have joined the Lord's Day Union in such numbers as to threaten to become a preponderant element. This was what the union never contemplated. When it was formed it was not expected that its influence would extend much beyond the Christian element of the population, nor that its membership would comprise those of another faith; but the Hindoces and Mohammedans perceived the advantage gained by the Christians from a day of rest in every week, and strangely enough, desire admission for the purpose of still further forwarding the work of sabbath observance.

The situation is probably unique in the history of mission and Christian work. The Hindoces and Mohammedans having once been admitted, are increasing in numbers, so that the society is in danger of being outnumbered by a non-Christian, if not anti-Christian element. It is certainly a very strange situation and one that demands the closest consideration from all concerned.

That the means employed in this undertaking are merely human, is evident from the fact that God has never provided any means for securing the observance of Sunday, since his Sabbath is not the first day but the seventh day, and at the time of making the Sabbath, he constituted Sunday one of the six working days. It is also evident from the fact that God does not work through "Lord's day unions" or other organizations aiming to secure religious observances by human legislation. He works by the power of his divine word, applied to the hearts of individuals by his Spirit.

This influx of pagans into the ranks of the promoters of this enterprise is not an unheard-of proceeding. There have been many like it on similar occasions in the past. Early in the "Christian era" pagans flocked in large numbers into the church, retaining the essence of their paganism; which paganism, blending with the outward forms of Christianity, and adding to these many of its own ceremonies, became the religion of the Papacy. The pagans did not join the Church because they had become converted, but because they saw in church connection a prospect of worldly advantage. And it is precisely so with the pagans of this time. In these movements for the exaltation of religious institutions by human "law," there is nothing that tends to convert a person from sin to Christ, since the power of God is not in them. Therefore they will become popular just as soon as they can present strong enough inducements to the unconverted masses to persuade them that an espousal of the cause on their part will be good policy.

When the politicians see that our cause is going to succeed, said a leading representative of the National Reform party, they will tumble over each other in their haste to secure front rank among its adherents. To which we reply, Very likely; but any cause which fights its battles with the carnal weapons of worldly organizations, which attains what the world recognizes as success, and thereby attracts to itself the multitudes who place policy above principle, is not a Christian cause, and has no value from a Christian standpoint. Christianity was never popular in this world, and never will be. Let the spirit of pure Christianity actnate a movement, and there will be no danger to it from an inrush of unsanctified men.
