"ARRANGEMENTS for the most remarkable religious conference ever held in the United States, have been practically made," says the Pittsburg Commercial Gazette, of the 6th inst. "Fifteen clergy and laymen of the Roman Catholic Church and the same number of Protestant ministers and laymen will shortly meet in Pittsburg for a friendly conference in regard to the obstacles which lie in the way of Christian union, and will formulate plans, if possible, for their removal."

Prominent among the "Protestant" ministers interested in this movement is Rev. David McAllister, D. D., editor of the Christian Statesman, and the very soul as it were, of the National Reform Association. We shall have more to say on the subject next week.
