# CHURCHES MAKE WAR ON GAMBLING.

An appeal to the English nation against the growing habit of betting and gambling has been issued by representatives of various churches in that country. The manifesto says: "We believe that the public morals are being seriously affected in every class of society, while the national sports, especially horseracing, are degraded by the development of betting and book-making, which are steadily increasing. The increase to a great extent is to be traced to the trade of the professional betting man. . . To the enforcement of the law must be added strenuous efforts in every direction to influence public opinion by that moral suasion which alone can be used in dealing with individuals and their action."

The appeal is signed by the bishops of London and Durham, the Rev. J. Morlais Jones, Chairman of the Congregational Union; the Rev. Richard Leitch, Moderator of the Presbyterian Church of England; the chairmen of the Baptist and Methodist churches; Mr. Thomas Hughes, J. P., and other men equally prominent. "One of the most encouraging things about this appeal," says the Outlook, "is that it indicates a realization of responsibility on the part of those prominent in the Church, not only for the welfare of the Church as an institution, but also for the morals of the community. It is only another sign that the Church is every day coming to realize more keenly its power as a social and political force."

And the comment is about as significant as the manifesto. Gambling is robbery and ought to be prohibited, but "the Church" is a dangerous "political force."
