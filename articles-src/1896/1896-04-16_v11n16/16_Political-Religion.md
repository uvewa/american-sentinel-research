# POLITICAL RELIGION.

[The Christian Leader, Cincinnati, Feb. 25.]

There are men who will serve a "cause" as long as the cause serves them, and these men pretend much conscientiousness in serving the "cause," if there be promise of advancement and emoluments; but if thwarted in their ambition to climb above their fellowmen, and if the scaffolding upon which they stand gives way, these men will at once desert the cause, and, with an evaporated conscience, seek a new cause. These men who hold themselves ready to sell soul and conscience to the highest bidder are the bane of both Church and State.
