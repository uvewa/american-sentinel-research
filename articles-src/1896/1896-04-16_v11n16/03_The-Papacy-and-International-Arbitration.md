# THE PAPACY AND INTERNATIONAL ARBITRATION.

Three leading representatives of the Papacy in three separate countries of Christendom—Cardinals Gibbons, Vaughan, and Logue, have put forth to the world a plea for the establishment of an international court of arbitration, which shall be a permanent body for the decision of international controversies. This plea comes as the result of a conference on the subject between the said cardinals, and is worded thus:—

We the undersigned cardinals, representatives of the Prince of Peace and of the Catholic Church in our respective countries, invite all who hear our voice to coöperate in the formation of a public opinion which shall demand the establishment of a permanent tribunal of arbitration, as a rational substitute among the English speaking races for a resort to the bloody arbitrament of war.

We are well aware that such a project is beset with practical difficulties. We believe that they will not prove to be insuperable if the desire to overcome them be genuine and general. Such a court existed for centuries, when the nations of Christendom were united in one faith. And have we not seen nations appeal to that same court for its judgment in our own day?

The establishment of a permanent tribunal, composed, may be, of trusted representatives of each sovereign nation, with power to nominate judges and umpires according to the common acceptance of general principles defining and limiting the jurisdiction and subject matter of such a tribunal, would create new guarantees for peace that could not fall to influence the whole of Christendom.

We do not hesitate on our part to lift up our united voice and proclaim to all who are accustomed to hearken to our counsels that it is a sign of a divine influence at work in their midst when "nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they be exercised any more in war" (Iaa. 2:4), for it was written of a future time, "Come ye and behold the work of the Lord, what wonders he hath done upon the earth, making wars to cease even unto the end of the earth." Ps. 65:9, 9.

Others may base their appeal upon motives which touch your worldly interests, your prosperity, your world-wide influence and authority in the affairs of men. The Catholic Church recognizes the legitimate force of such motives in the natural order, and blesses whatever tends to the real progress and elevation of the race. But our main ground of appeal rests upon the well-known character and will of the Prince of Peace, the living Founder, the divine Head of Christendom. It was he who declared that love for the brotherhood was a second commandment like unto the first. It was he who announced to the people the praise and reward of those who seek after peace and pursue it. "Blessed," said he, "are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of God." Matt. 5:9.

We therefore earnestly invite all to unite with us in pressing their convictions and desires upon their respective governments by means of petitions and such other measures as are constitutional.

It is not at all strange that the Papacy should thus make its voice heard in the matter of international arbitration. It would be difficult to find a matter widely affecting or concerned with public interests in which the Papacy is not "in evidence." As the appeal states, such a court of arbitration once existed, in days of which the Papacy has fond remembrance. That court was a conclave of papal prelates, with the Pope at its head. And so far as existence is concerned, it is sitting yet; but since the Reformation it has found its occupation gone. The three cardinals, Gibbons, Vaughan, and Logue, would doubtless be willing to see this long-lost function of the Papacy revived.

But when we look at the history of the centuries during which the Papacy was international arbitrator, we are by no means assured of its utility as a preserver of the peace. We find that international wars and factional quarrels abounded on every hand, which drenched Europe in blood; and this notwithstanding the fact cited in this appeal that "the nations of Christendom were united in one faith." Their "faith" was not of a kind which made them peaceable. And indeed, there is strong reason to believe that so far from acting as a peacemaker among the nations, the Papacy, through her instruments the Jesuits, stirred up international strife whenever it was deemed that her interests would be promoted thereby.

Doubtless this papal court is as willing as ever to act as international arbitrator. Nothing would do more to elevate the Papacy to her lost position of worldly predominance. And there is much that favors the scheme. As stated in the appeal, the establishment of a permanent court of international arbitration is a project "beset with practical difficulties," and these difficulties might be found so great that it would be deemed better to accept the services of this court already established, which has officiated in the proposed capacity in times past, and whose offices in this line are sought by some of the nations to-day.

There can, of course, be nothing more desirable than that wars should cease unto the ends of the earth; but unfortunately, there is very little real indication that the "Christian" nations of the world will be willing from principle to submit their differences to any court of arbitration. The spectacle of the strong nations tyrannizing over and absorbing the weak, the "Christian" powers failing to take measures to stop Turkish butcheries in Armenia because of their jealousy and distrust of each other, and all striving to the utmost to equip themselves with armies and materials for war, does not indicate that they are willing to accept simple justice in any case where aggrandizement seems to be within their power.

The apostle James tells us that wars and fightings come from the evil lusts of men which rule in their hearts. James 4:1. And so long as these lusts reign in the human heart, so long will the fountain of war and strife continue to flow. The only power that can put an end to war is the power of the Prince of Peace, which power is exercised in the individual heart through faith. The one in whose heart dwells the Prince of Peace will "follow peace with all men;" but this peace will be found only so far as faith is found. Elsewhere there will be "wars and fightings," and the usual manifestations of the "fruits of the flesh."

But the time is near to which the words of the prophet apply: "Come, behold the works of the Lord, what desolations he hath made in the earth. He maketh wars to cease unto the ends of the earth; he breaketh the bow and cutteth the spear in sunder; he burneth the chariot in the fire." Ps. 46:8, 5. Of this it need only be said that it is not the work of man, but of God. Then indeed will wars cease unto the ends of the earth; not because of a millennium, nor because men will have abjured war, but because God's judgments will have visited the earth, leaving "desolations" in their track. Then will God be exalted in the earth, and all men will know that he is God, because the fact will have been visibly demonstrated before their eyes. But the only saving knowledge of God is that which is to be obtained now, through faith.
