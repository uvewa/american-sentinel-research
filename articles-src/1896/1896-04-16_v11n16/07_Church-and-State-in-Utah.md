# CHURCH AND STATE IN UTAH.

Action taken at the semi-annual conference of the Mormon Church, in Salt Lake City, Utah, April 6, outlines that church's position in the matter of Mormon affiliation with the State government. It is in the form of a manifesto, which declares that all political office-holding on the part of officers of the church must be subject to the church's direction and approval. Considering that seventy per cent. of the Mormon people hold office in the church, it is apparent that this action will very widely affect, if it does not shape entirely, the character of the State.

The position of the Mormon Church, says the Ban of April 8, "as defined, is that a man having accepted the honors and obligations of ecclesiastical office in the church, cannot of his own volition make these honors subordinate or even coordinate with new ones of an entirely different character, and that he is bound to obtain the consent of the priesthood before assuming any other such responsibilities." In harmony with this decision, "apostle" Moses Thatcher, who accepted the nomination for United States senator without consulting the "First Presidency," was deposed from his church office during the conference.

There can be no doubt, in the light of this manifesto, that the State government of Utah will be a Mormon government as long as the Mormon Church is able to make it so. From her view of the nature of church office-holding as compared with State office-holding, it could not be otherwise. If that view were the proper one, the church would not have deemed it necessary to issue this manifesto. There is in the exercise of the functions of civil office nothing necessarily antagonistic to religion. The obligations of the one demand the exercise of honesty and integrity, virtues which are certainly not out of harmony with the spirit of the other. The person who conducts himself with honesty and uprightness before his fellowmen, should not be debarred from the privilege of church connection simply because he occupies a position of public trust.

Considered in connection with the facts of the situation in Utah—the predominance of the Mormon element in numbers, and their known readiness to hold political office—this manifesto can mean nothing else than that the Mormon Church aims to control political action within the State. The power that selects the office-holders in a State, is master of the whole situation. That the Mormon Church should aim to be master of the situation in Utah is in harmony with her history, and with the principles upon which she is established.
