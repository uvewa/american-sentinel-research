# REFORM BUREAUS IN WASHINGTON.

"The good people of the whole country, and particularly the Christian people," says the *Christian Work* of April 9, "are deeply indebted to the National Bureau of Reforms for many excellent bills which have been introduced in Congress at this session, some of which have already become laws. . . . The idea of having a responsible Bureau at Washington to look after and to initiate reform legislation is eminently wise and practical, and it ought to receive the support of all interested in reform work."

From this view we emphatically dissent. The theory that reforms should have their fountain head in the national legislature is inconsistent with the idea that this is "a government of the people, by the people, and for the people," and consistent with the doctrine of paternalism. If the national legislators are fathers to the nation,—if they and not the people are the governors,—then it is proper that they should, as parents, lay down rules and regulations for their children, the people. But if they are merely representatives of the people, through whom the people themselves exercise the functions of government, then governmental reforms must have their origin with the people.

In other words, the people must determine upon the reforms and elect such persons to Congress as will properly represent them in legislative action, instead of having their representatives originate schemes of reforms, or take up with the schemes of some "reform bureau" representing not the people but some private parties, enact them into "law," and swing the people around to their standpoint. The body should wag the tail, and not the tail the body.

We have enough governmental machinery already for every possible need, without the establishment of a "bureau of reforms" to tell Congress what is most needful in the line of legislation. To say the least, such a thing is not very complimentary to Congress or to the people.

Let the people govern themselves; and let "reform" bureaus and "Christian" lobbyists meet with no favor within the halls of the Capitol.
