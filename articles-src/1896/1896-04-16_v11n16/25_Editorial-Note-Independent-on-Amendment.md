As appears from the article, "Jesus Christ in the Constitution," on page 125, the Independent, of this city, is opposed to the proposed religious amendment to the national Constitution.

Our contemporary does not, however, sufficiently differentiate between the State and the people when it says: "The State is not Christian because the organic law of the State acknowledges Christ; but the State is Christian if the citizens are such."

In only a very limited sense is this true. A State is simply a gigantic business concern, organized for certain specific purposes. It can properly have no religious character whatever. We do not speak of a bank as a Christian bank because many of its stockholders are Christians; no more should we speak of a nation as Christian.
