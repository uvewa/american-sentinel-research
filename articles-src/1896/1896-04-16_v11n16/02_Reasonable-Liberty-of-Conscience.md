# "REASONABLE LIBERTY OF CONSCIENCE."

The confusing and misleading use commonly made of the phrase "liberty of conscience" in the forum of public address, is illustrated by the following from the New York World of April 9:—

The simple fact is that the Sunday laws of this State are infringements upon the just and reasonable liberty of the citizen, and as such they ought to be repealed. In recognition of this proper demand the Republicans at the last election promised German and other voters in this city that they would so modify these laws as to permit a reasonable liberty of conscience. Instead of doing so they have enacted an excise law which further and most intolerably restricts liberty of personal conduct.

Liberty of conscience is something which does not enter into the turbid strife of saloon politics. It has nothing in common with the "liberty" which some men desire, to drink freely of intoxicating liquors. No person ever conscientiously desired full freedom to indulge his appetite for intoxicants. His conscience, if not too benumbed by dissipation, told him to refrain from such indulgence. To invoke the name of conscience in behalf of perverted appetite, is the merest sham. The sacred rights of conscience do not keep company with Bacchus and his troop.

It is commonly considered that the use of intoxicating liquors as a beverage ought to be guarded by "reasonable" restrictions; but this has nothing to with liberty of conscience. "Reasonable" liberty of this kind is nothing short of perfect liberty, such as God himself has given to all men. No man or organization of men has any business to restrict human freedom in this respect. We protest against any use of the phrase which tends to associate and connect liberty of conscience in men's minds with that which is properly subject to the restrictions of human legislation.
