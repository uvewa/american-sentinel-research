# "BETTER AS WE ARE."

[The Christian Work, April 2.]

Those respected religious contemporaries who are so very desirous of putting the word "God" in the Constitution of the United States, and deplore the fact that "we are a Christless nation," are reminded that putting the word God in the Constitution will not mend matters at all. If we are to be a distinctively Christian nation, it can only be accomplished by establishing the Christian religion as the national religion. But this could only be as in England by establishing a sectarian religion, and if we went by numbers the Methodist denomination would be on top: then all other denominations would be "tolerated," whereas now all have equal rights and privileges. The world's exhibit of nationalized religions is not favorable either to the cause of religion or to the State. We are better as we are.
