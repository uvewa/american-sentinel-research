THE POPE has indorsed the petition put forth by his cardinals in America, England, and Ireland (noticed elsewhere in this issue), in behalf of the creation of a permanent tribunal of international arbitration. In considering the significance of this action it need only be remembered that in whatever is done by the Pope and his cardinals, the first and foremost consideration is always the interests of the Catholic Church. These interests stand paramount in their minds to everything else.
