# POPULAR CHURCH ATTENDANCE IN A "CHRISTIAN" NATION.

[Atlanta Journal, Atlanta, Ga.]

A TABLE has been prepared which shows the percentage of church communicants to the total population of a number of States and Territories. It is as follows:—

|  New Mexico | 68.85  |
| --- | --- |
|  Utah | 61.62  |
|  Arizona | 45.24  |
|  South Carolina | 44.17  |
|  Rhode Island | 42.84  |
|  North Carolina | 42.35  |
|  Massachusetts | 42.11  |
|  Connecticut | 41.45  |
|  Minnesota | 40.91  |
|  District of Columbia | 40.89  |
|  Alabama | 36.96  |
|  Georgia | 37.96  |
|  Maryland | 36.40  |
|  Florida | 36.21  |
|  New York | 36.21  |
|  Louisiana | 35.76  |
|  New Jersey | 35.18  |
|  Virginia | 34.37  |
|  Mississippi | 33.39  |
|  Ohio | 33.10  |
|  Wisconsin | 32.98  |

Most people will be surprised to find that the highest percentage of churchgoers in this list is found in a Territory, and the next in the newest State. The New England press is given to boasting of the superior morality of that section; but if churchgoing is an indication of moral virtue no New England State approaches Utah or Arizona. South Carolina is the second State in the list of churchgoers, while Georgia comes ninth. In as old a State as ours, and one which has been the scene of so much religious enterprise, it is rather surprising that less than thirty-seven people in every one hundred "belong to the church."

Still Georgia makes a better showing than several others of the original thirteen States.
