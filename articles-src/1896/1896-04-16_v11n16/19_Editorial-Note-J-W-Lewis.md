DON'T forget these beautiful spring days, that J. W. Lewis, an honest Christian man, is imprisoned at Tiptonville, Tenn., for no other offense than refusing to observe the statute-introached sabbath of his neighbors. And this in "free America," under a national constitution supposed to guarantee religious liberty, and under a State constitution which provides "that no human authority can, in any case whatever, control or interfere with the rights of conscience; and that no preference shall ever be given by law to any religious establishment or mode of worship."
