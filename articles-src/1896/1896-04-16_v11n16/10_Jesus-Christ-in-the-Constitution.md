# JESUS CHRIST IN THE CONSTITUTION.

[The Independent, March 26.]

ONCE more the little band of agitators, led by those who will not vote for God's righteousness, because the supreme authority of God is not mentioned in the Constitution of the United States, have brought before Congress their periodical bill for an amendment of the Preamble to the Constitution so as to recognize God as the source of all civil power, and Christ as the ruler of nations, and his supreme will as of supreme authority. The proposition has actually passed to a second reading in the Senate and is also before the House, and it is among the remoter possibilities that it may pass and be sent to the State legislatures for ratification. Possibly the character of the very devout men who have advocated the measure before the committees of Congress, and of the pronounced unbelievers who have been moved to oppose it, may have affected the attitude of our legislators. We take the liberty to represent the views of the great body of Christian men in this country, and to explain why it is that they take no interest in trying to secure such a recognition of the Almighty in our organic law.

In the first place they do not believe that a State is affected one way or another by a formal, and necessarily to a great extent perfunctory acknowledgment of Jesus Christ. Religion is something that affects individuals, and affects States as it first affects individuals. The citizens are not Christians because the organic law of the State acknowledges Christ; but the State is Christian if the citizens are such. If all the lawgivers and judges and executive officers are trying to do their duty in the fear of God, the State is not made a particle more religious by putting the name of God into its Constitution. If lawgivers and judges and executive officers do not fear God, then his name in the Constitution makes that State worse rather than better. It is putting the cart before the horse to attempt to sanctify the people by first sanctifying the State. The citizens give character to the State, not the State to the citizens. Putting the recognition of Christ in the Constitution would not make one citizen better, nor insure the better observance of one law; but making one citizen better will insure a better observance of law, and a greater power to Jesus Christ.

Next to the utter uselessness of such a printer's ink assertion that this nation recognizes Jesus Christ as its ruler is to be considered the propriety of it as affecting the rights of those who do not accept the Christian faith, but who yet are and should be citizens possessing equal rights with us. This point is emphasized to us by a letter from a distinguished Hebrew rabbi in Philadelphia, Dr. S. Morais, in *The Hebrew*, a weekly journal printed entirely in the Hebrew language. A number of Hebrew immigrants who have escaped the persecutions of Christian Russia have written to ask him if there is any danger that the movement to put Christianity into the Constitution will prevail, as they fear it would be the precursor of discriminating laws against non-Christians. Dr. Morais reassures them in very florid and biblical Hebrew, stating that efforts at Christianizing the Constitution have been made before and failed. "The Ruler of the Universe," he says, "watches over the American people," and will not allow them to be "afflicted by the ills which Christian priests" have brought on other countries; but that here "every one that cometh to trust under the wings of this standard of liberty shall be a singer in his soul, and shall believe according to the desire of his own heart." He is right. This land belongs equally to all its citizens. It puts no one religion into its Constitution. The framers of the Constitution decided this intelligently and wisely. They wished our flag to give equal rights to believer and unbeliever, to Jew and Christian.

As Christians we will do our best to make other people believe our truth; but as citizens we want to put no pressure and no stigma of non-conformity on atheist, infidel, or Jew. We believe enough in Christianity not to desire to ask the State to help us propagate it or proclaim it. As to the endorsement of the State, we will have none of it. The Christian Church does not need the endorsement of the State, as it would resent its help. As we want no interference from the State, we ask for no favors, nothing but equal rights, and we are not afraid that Christianity will not hold its own in a fair field.
