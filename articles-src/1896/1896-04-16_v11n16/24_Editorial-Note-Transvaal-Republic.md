SPEAKING of the Transvaal and its people, the late Rev. Josiah Tyler, D. D., a veteran South African missionary, recently said:—

Theoretically, the Transvaal is a republic; but practically, an oligarchy. Officers of the Volkeraad, or Senate and House of Representatives combined, must all belong to some Protestant church; but any one of sufficient ambition and no religion can easily adjust that matter.

Of course; and this illustrates what the SENTINEL has been saying all along, in pointing out the uselessness and the danger of political obsequiousness to the Church. As things are now going in our own country, it will not be long before the Church's stamp of approval will be a sine qua non of election to public office; but "any one of sufficient ambition and no religion can easily adjust that matter." Then Congress will become an assembly of unprincipled hypocrites; and then we shall have a glorious "Christian" nation!
