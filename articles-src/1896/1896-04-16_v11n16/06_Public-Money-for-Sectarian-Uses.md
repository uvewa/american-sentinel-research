# PUBLIC MONEY FOR SECTARIAN USES.

The New York Methodist ministers' conference in session in New York City, April 6, passed the following resolutions touching the appropriation of money by the United States Government for sectarian schools. Incidentally, says the New York Sen, the members of the conference displayed some feeling against the Catholic Church, the only church that has asked for an appropriation this year:—

WHEREAS, We learn that the House of Representatives has, by a large majority, refused to grant further appropriations to certain sectarian schools, which for years have been supported at an annual expense to the Treasury of the United States of $200,000, and

WHEREAS, The bill as it passed the House of Representatives is soon to be acted upon by the Senate; therefore, be it

Resolved, That the New York Conference of 300 ministers of the gospel representing 150,000 members and adherents, and as fellow-boirs of Methodist doctrine and history representing 10,000,000 of communi-cants and adherents in this Republic, most heartily ap- prove the action of the House of Representatives, and we earnestly request the Senate to promptly pass the bill and the President to sign it, so that this great wrong committed against the taxpayers of this country and against the very spirit of the national Constitution may cease forever.

There is more reason for this display of feeling against the Catholic Church than might appear on the surface. A few years ago the Methodist Church was "in the swim" with the Catholic and other churches, seeking to get all the money they could from the Government in aid of their denominational schools and charitable institutions. But the Catholic Church distanced them all in the race, and was leaving them behind so rapidly as to make it evident that the only means of checking her career would be by repudiating the principle of governmental appropriations for sectarian institutions, thus influencing the Government to withhold all such appropriations, from the Catholic Church as well as from others.

We trust that the Methodist Church recognizes the evil principle of Church-and-State union in such appropriations, and that the Government will likewise recognize it, and on that basis bring them to an end.
