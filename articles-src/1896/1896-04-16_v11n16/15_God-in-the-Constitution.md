# GOD IN THE CONSTITUTION.

[Commercial Appeal, Memphis, March 18.]

Ever and anon some doubtless well-meaning people rediscover the fact that there is no recognition of God in the Constitution of the United States, and are reshocked by their discovery. They are surprised that the wrath of Heaven has not long since descended in the form of fire and brimstone to consume a nation that forgets God so utterly as to omit his name from its law. They therefore make haste to agitate for an amendment of the Constitution in order that the Almighty may be acknowledged in plain black and white.

This effort to legislate the Almighty into supremacy over the hearts and minds of the people is a survival of a system that has long since perished. As a means of promoting piety it has been long since abandoned. There are many God-fearing, Christian people who oppose the project, but no matter what may be the motive of the objectors, no good could possible come from forcing an acknowledgment of God and of Jesus Christ upon them. The particular amendment proposed by Mr. Morse would practically make a religious test for members of Congress and for all civil or military officers who are required to take an oath to support the Constitution. The test would bar not only atheists and agnostics, but Jews and Unitarians, all who do not subscribe to the divine authority of both the Old and the New Testament, and all who do not recognize the divinity of Christ—that is, unless they should take the oath to support the Constitution, as the abolitionists used to do, "with a mental reservation."

As a matter of fact, such a recognition as that proposed by Mr. Morse would not change the religious character of Congress in the least, nor make the slightest change in the spirit of its laws. It would simply be an empty mockery, a hollow form of words, and not in the least calculated to glorify the Almighty or to establish his dominion over the hearts of men. This is a nation of God-believers, a Christian nation. But it is so as a matter of fact and not as a matter of law. It is so because such is the faith of the people and because our civilization, our ideas of justice, our standards of right and wrong, are all tempered by the pervasive influence of Christianity on the minds and lives of men.

The acknowledgment of God and of Christ is a matter that belongs to the conscience of the individual, and in no other way can it be made. The State cannot vicariously perform this duty for all the people. If Mr. Morse should succeed in engrafting upon the Constitution a declaration that "we, the people of the United States," acknowledge Almighty God and the Lord Jesus Christ, etc., for whom would this declaration speak? Can a State perform a Christian duty and receive a Christian's reward, independently of the action of its individual citizens? Would God punish a State for neglecting a supposed Christian duty if the people of the State were devout believers and faithful followers of his word?

God has imposed his law upon the individual mind and conscience. It is the individual and not the State that must acknowledge Him; it is the individual that must believe, repent and be baptized. It is an absurd and a pernicious idea that a body politic can in its corporate capacity make its peace with God for all the people of all the country.
