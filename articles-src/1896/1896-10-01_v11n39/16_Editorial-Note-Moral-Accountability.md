The civil government is not without moral accountability for the reason that individuals lose moral accountability when acting collectively in a governmental capacity, for an individual can ever be in a position where he is freed from moral accountability; but for the reason that in moral matters, one individual cannot represent another, but each individual must represent himself and no other; and hence the civil government cannot properly take account of moral questions. The government official cannot act morally for those whom he represents in his official capacity. The government represents the whole people living under it, and when it presumes to deal with moral questions it assumes the right to be the moral representative of the people; but the only proper moral representative which any person can have is Jesus Christ. His life and death will answer in the Judgment day for the life record of every one who shall have made him their representative, by the provisions of his gospel. But such as trust in the fiction of the moral accountability of the civil government, will find in that day that the moral accountability rests all upon the individuals, and that each one must answer for himself before God for the deeds which he has done, whether as a participant in the government, or in any other capacity.
