# THE CLERGY IN POLITICS.

"The Sunday-schools and pulpit are in politics. Time was when politicians sneered at them, but they might as well understand that they are now in politics to stay, to affirm great moral principles and keep on affirming them till election." So said the Rev. R. S. MacArthur, before his audience in Calvary Baptist Church, Sunday evening, the 20th inst., and no one who has taken note of the church's present activity in political affairs will feel inclined to dispute his assertion.

But why have the clergy suddenly become interested to such a degree in politics? Is it because politics present this year a great moral issue for the decision of the people? So we are told. One leading New York journal announces in bold headlines that "ministers agree that this is a contest for supremacy of the eighth commandment." But is this the only contest in progress in which the supremacy of one of the ten commandments is involved? Have politics been conducted in such a manner hitherto as to avoid all disagreement with the dictates of honesty and justice? Is the question of the financial policy to be adopted by this Government the greatest moral issue before the people? Are not the clergy aware of any present, vital, and momentous controversy which centers upon some other commandment than the eighth?

It is not a little strange that the latter can so clearly discern a moral issue which is enveloped in the mists of political controversy, while seemingly quite oblivious to moral issues which are plainly exposed to view. It is a fact which no one can dispute, that the question whether "this is a contest for supremacy of the eighth commandment" or not, is one which involves the political question which the various parties are trying to settle. In other words, it involves the question of which one of the political creeds is entitled to the confidence of the people. No one of the parties proposes to be dishonest. No party platform announces an intention of violating the eighth commandment. Each one intends to do justice; and it is first necessary to settle the question of the fallacy or soundness of the political creed set forth before any moral issue comes into view. Whether there is any contest for the supremacy of the eighth commandment or not, depends upon whether the creed of one leading political party is as fallacious as it is pictured in the assertions of its opponents. It is a fact which also no one can dispute that vast numbers of intelligent, honest men see no intention of violating the eighth commandment where it is so loudly announced to exist by the pulpit politician.

We say it is not a little strange that these clergymen can see the moral issue so clearly through the mists of party creed, and are so stirred over the same, while they are oblivious to other great moral issues not involved in political obscurity, or at least unconcerned about them. For instance, the Rev. William Lloyd, of the Central Congregational Church, New York, said in his political discourse of Sunday evening, September 20: "The ten commandments are at the root of all national greatness. . . . They are the pillars of the State, the foundation of all good government; and the man who would break one of them and teach other men to do so, is a traitor, and places the whole social structure in imminent peril." This was said with particular reference to the eighth commandment, which it is said the adherents of one political party purpose to violate. The Rev. Mr. Myers, speaking in "The Temple," New York, the same evening, on the theme, "Sixteen to One," said: "If any man says, 'Thou shalt steal,' I am commissioned by the Almighty God to declare, 'Thou shalt not steal.'"

But it is certain that the eighth commandment is no more important than the fourth, which says: "Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work: but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work." Mr. Myers, Mr. Lloyd, and the others of like calling, who are preaching political sermons on the eighth commandment, very well know that the vast majority of those who profess Christianity, themselves included, do not observe the seventh day, as the fourth commandment directs, but the first day. Now these clergymen can see very clearly that the proposed "free coinage of silver" will be a violation of the eighth commandment; but they are wholly unable to see that the observance of the first day of the week instead of the seventh is a violation of the fourth commandment; or if they do see it, they feel no burden to say anything about it. There is a mystery here which calls for explanation.

"What right have men to put the eighth commandment to a popular vote?" inquired Mr. Myers, further on in his discourse. "It is blasphemy. I can now hear the thunderings of Sinai." But we would ask, What right have men to put the fourth commandment to a vote? That is what was done by the Congress of the United States, when in the summer of 1892, they decided by vote that "the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday" is the Sabbath, and that the World's Fair should be closed on that day. But neither Mr. Myers nor the other clergymen who are now so much interested in politics, either "heard the thunders of Sinai," on that occasion, or were in any way disturbed by the event. It is altogether probable that they rejoiced that such a vote had been taken.

Again, it will not be denied by these same clergymen that the sale of intoxicating liquors is a violation of the second of the two "great" commandments—"Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself." Yet the liquor traffic continues its awful course in our midst, not only creating dishonesty and other criminal impulses on every hand, but blighting numberless homes and sending its victims annually by hundreds of thousands into dishonored graves, without a fourth part of the furore from the clergy that is being raised by them over the issue of "sound money."

It is the proper business of the clergy to deal with moral issues, as these issues concern individuals. They are commissioned to be ambassadors for God, to beseech men to become reconciled to God. There is never a time when great moral issues are not claiming the attention of individuals everywhere. The controversy between sin and righteousness is raging to-day as fiercely as ever, the issues of which are fraught with consequences as momentous to the soul as imagination can depict.

The minister of the gospel is commissioned to present to the people the law of God. He is commissioned to say in the name of God, "Thou shalt not steal." He is commissioned also to say by the same authority, "The seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work;" and "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself." In presenting the gospel, he will present not merely the law by which mankind is bound, but the divine means provided of God to enable man to meet its requirements. And in all this he will address himself not to governments, or political parties, but to individuals; for it is to individuals alone that the provisions of the gospel can apply.

The pulpit politician, however, of which there are now so many representatives, has left the battle-ground where sin and righteousness struggle for the mastery of the soul, and stepped down into the arena of politics, not to beseech sinners to become reconciled to God, but to command them to become reconciled to a political party. Ignoring great moral issues which vitally concern the eternal welfare of souls, he devotes his energies to issues which concern the temporal interests of State and party. He would have moral questions decided and moral laws enforced by political methods, rather than by those divine agencies which alone are competent to instruct and guide the soul in moral conduct.

We are told that the church is now in politics to stay; and we see no reason to doubt the truth of the statement. But the church that is in politics to stay is also out of Christianity to stay. The political activity of the clergy, under cover of the "great moral issue" which is declared to be involved in the present campaign, affords a startling evidence of the advanced stage of development reached in the movement for a union of Church and State.
