## MUST ACT CONSCIENTIOUSLY.

APROPOS to an article in these columns, September 3, on "The Christian Citizen," is the following paragraph from the Signs of the Times of September 17:

"Freedom under the Stars and Stripes permits the male citizen of this country over twenty-one years of age to exercise his franchise at the polls under the same conditions as all other citizens. This is one of his rights, which he may exercise or not as he elects; but it would not be right for his fellow-citizens to seek to compel him to vote. Such an attempt would deprive him of his liberty. The exercise, or non-exercise, of such rights belongs to him. In fact, he might not conscientiously be able to exercise such a right; it might not be right for him to do this; he would violate his conscience if he did. For instance, he might believe in a high tariff 'for protection' and 'free silver.' He is conscientiously opposed to a 'gold standard,' a waiting bimetalism, and a low tariff, or a tariff for revenue. It would not be right for him to vote otherwise than he believes. Where would he vote? We have two Democratic parties, the Republican party, the National, the Prohibition, the Socialist parties. But not one of these holds to what seems to our conscientious citizen the two cardinal principles of the country's needs. To him, therefore, it would not be right to exercise the right of franchise, and it would not be right to compel him so to do."
