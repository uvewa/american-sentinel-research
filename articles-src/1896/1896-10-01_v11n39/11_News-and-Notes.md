## NEWS AND NOTES.

It is announced that a "council of the churches" has undertaken to put down gambling in Sydney, Australia.

In Raleigh, N. C., a suit has been begun by one transportation company against another to compel the transportation of express matter on Sunday, as well as other days of the week. A previous decision at Asheville affirms that it is contrary to the State law to transport any matter on Sunday except that which is liable to perish through delay. The outcome of the present suit will probably settle the legal status of Sunday in that State for some time to come.

The Toronto Mail and Empire reports that the Canadian Government has passed an order in council providing for the opening of canals on Sunday, to facilitate traffic.

The question of the advisability of opening the Texas Coast Fair on Sunday, which for some time past has been agitating the public mind in sections of that State, has been decided in the negative through the active opposition of the Christian Endeavor societies and other religious agencies.

The Christian Citizenship Union, of New Jersey, composed of Christian Endeavor societies, Epworth leagues, Baptist Young People's unions, Law and Order leagues, etc., have issued an address to the voters enrolled in the Union, directing the course to be pursued by them at the polls in the coming election.

The Canadian law against blasphemy was recently invoked in Montreal against an individual who was indulging in the same on the exhibition grounds in that city. The delinquent was fined ten dollars. Whether the blasphemy consisted in what is ordinarily known as profanity, or in speaking against some dogma of the accepted religion, is not stated; but presumably it was the former.

In a recent speech at Liverpool, Mr. Gladstone comes boldly forward as the advocate of armed force for the suppression of the Turk in Europe, urging England to proceed upon this course independently of the other powers of Europe. It transpires, however, that Russia, Austria and Germany stand ready to cry, "Hands off," should England take the step to which she is urged. Thus the international jealousy and rivalry of the "Christian nations" of Europe are again conspicuous before the eyes of the world.

Speaking of "ecclesiastical prisons," the editor of the Wesleyan Methodist says in a recent issue: "Some time ago we mentioned the case of a young priest in Ohio, who had recently escaped from a convent, and expressed our conviction that all such establishments should be opened even by force if the case required such a method. We are again reminded of the evils of these ecclesiastical prisons by the report of a case where an angry father sends his daughter, age nineteen years, to one of these prisons on the Hudson River. It is described as having barred windows and a brick fence around the building fourteen feet high. Again we make the demand that public sentiment, and if necessary force of arms, be employed to open these prisons."

Mr. Flower is one of the most candid and fair-minded of literary men, and his presentation of any subject must at least command respect from all, and cannot fail to carry conviction to many minds.
