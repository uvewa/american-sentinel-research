## MORALS AND RELIGION.

The fundamental idea of religion, beyond all doubt, is obligation. And the fundamental idea of morals is precisely the same obligation. So far as they can be distinguished, their distinction lies in this: that the obligation of morals is to a principle, while that of religion is to a person, even to God. But this does not and cannot discriminate either the subjects of moral obligation, that is, all moral beings, or the objects thereof, that is, all duties.

Religion takes up, under her imperial and benignant sway, all creatures to whom right and wrong are or can be known, and lays her heavenly sanctions on all they ought to do. She vastly enlarges the scope and dignifies the office of duty. She raises dead ethics to life. She substitutes allegiance to man's true King, for the cold and ineffective impositions of abstract truth. There need be no larger reference to Scripture, in confirmation of this statement, than to adduce our Saviour's two great commandments, on which "hang all the law and the prophets:" "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength, and thy neighbor as thyself." "Shalt" is the very keynote of morals. "The Lord thy God" is the sublime Person from whom the law must come, and to whom, in infinite degree, moral service is due.—Charles F. Deems, D.D., LL.D., in Frank Leslie's Sunday Magazine, December, 1879, page 713.
