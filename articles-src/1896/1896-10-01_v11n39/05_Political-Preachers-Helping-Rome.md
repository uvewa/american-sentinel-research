**POLITICAL PREACHERS HELPING ROME.**

If the clerical politicians, who are venting their political ideas from their pulpits upon long-suffering congregations, were injuring only the political prospects of the cause which they espouse, the evil done by them would be small. As we have elsewhere pointed out, however, they are directly working to break down the dividing wall between politics and religion, and thus to establish a union of Church and State. And this is not all; for they are putting a weapon into the hands of Rome which she will know how to use against the liberties of Americans. The evidence of this appears in an editorial paragraph in the *Catholic Review* (New York), of September 19, which alludes to the "pernicious activity" of Protestant preachers in politics as an example of "their devotion to the so-called American principle of the separation of Church and State."

Rome does not believe—has never believed—in the separation of Church and State, and she can now point to the example of these American Protestant clergy and claim that there is no such American principle as that which demands the separation of the civil and religious powers, but only a "so-called" principle, which does not exist in reality. With this principle out of her way, the progress of Romanism in this country will be much more rapid.
