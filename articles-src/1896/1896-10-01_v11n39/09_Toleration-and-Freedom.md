## TOLERATION AND FREEDOM.

[Evening Herald, Syracuse, N. Y., Sept.11.]

THE Illinois Appellate Court has just handed down a decision which will be welcomed by every person who understands at all the genius of our political institutions. This decision is that plowing of corn on Sunday, or other similar labor, quietly performed, does not in itself constitute a breach of the peace and call for the exercise of police power. The defendant in the case upon which appeal was taken to the Appellate Court is named Foll and is a Seventh-day Adventist. The members of the sect to which he belongs observe Saturday as the Sabbath, and on Sunday they feel free to engage in any work that does not in itself constitute a breach of the peace. The charge against Foll was that he plowed his land on Sunday. Any other decision than that rendered would be an outrage upon the rights of the individual.

A republican government can have no more license to force a citizen to observe any given day in a certain way than it can have to force every citizen to subscribe to a given religious creed, and persecution of the kind attempted by the petty bigots who caused the arrest of Seventh-day Adventist Foll for plowing his field on Sunday is utterly abhorrent to the genius of American institutions. A majority in the State has the right to say that the peace shall not be broken on a certain day, but it has not the right to say that the ordinary vocations of life are necessarily breaches of the peace in themselves if pursued on a certain day. Such intolerance would be a blunder as well as a crime against liberty.

Liberty for all to worship as they please and the separation of State and Church are only to be had where the State does not attempt to force conformity in such matters as creed and the observance of the Sabbath. When a Christian missionary goes to China or other country where Christianity is looked upon as a queer, absurd doctrine by the average native, he is fortunate indeed if his preaching and practices are not also regarded by the natives as breaches of the peace, dangers to society and corruptors of religion. When toleration has been secured, after tribulation and sacrifice, the missionaries regard the victory as a great one. It is an evidence that the country is becoming civilized.

Such a prosecution as that of Seventh-day Adventist Foll is a survival of the intolerance which has made history a bloody record. It shows that despite the theory of our institutions, and the bitter experience of many American denominations with their fellow-Christians, the old spirit of sectarian hatred, most merciless and revengeful, is yet alive here and there, even in a country whose very foundation was a protest against intolerance, and whose continuance as a republic and as a union depends upon toleration in the broadest possible sense of the word.
