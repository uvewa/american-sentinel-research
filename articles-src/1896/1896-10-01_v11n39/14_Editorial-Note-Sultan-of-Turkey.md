It has been said in defense of the red-handed Sultan of Turkey that he is subject to fits of emotional insanity. But what sort of a defense can be made in behalf of Turkey's apologists and defenders in this country?

In reply to a recent letter addressed to the Sultan of Turkey by the Evangelical Alliance of the United States, protesting against the massacres in Armenia and threatening to do all in their power to incite the "Christian" governments of the world to employ force against the Sultan in case the massacres are not stopped, the latter sends a letter, politely assuring the Evangelical Alliance that they are misinformed on the subject, and that Christians in Armenia are treated very well, and have really no cause to complain. "The imperial government," he says, "has protected their property, their lives, and their honor, and has assured them full and entire liberty of conscience;" in proof of which he cites an "imperial firman, which the Sultan Orkhan delivered to his brother when he had appointed him commander-in-chief of the imperial army," and which had since been "confirmed in a more precise manner by his illustrious successors." This is very much like the "proof" offered to Adventists imprisoned for Sunday work, that there can be no religious persecution in this country, since it is contrary to the Constitution, and to the American principle of the separation of Church and State.
