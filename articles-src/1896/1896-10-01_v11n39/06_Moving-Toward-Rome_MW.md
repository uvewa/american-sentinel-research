**MOVING TOWARD ROME.**

**BY MINARD WOOD.**

For several months past the Protestant churches of West Haven, Conn., have been holding union temperance meetings alternating with the several societies. Things ran well for awhile, and considerable enthusiasm was manifested by these local societies. But for causes unknown to the writer, there was a lack of attendance, and a failure on the part of our Protestant friends to keep pace with their Roman Catholic brethren. This fact rather grated on the nerves of the pastor of the Methodist Episcopal Church. He saw his frail bark was stranded upon a lee shore, and the only way left to save the survivors of the wreck, was to accept the overture of Rome, and grasp the treacherous cords by which millions have been led to death, or worse. So he publicly announced from his pulpit that hereafter the Methodist Episcopal branch of the temperance work in this section would unite with their Catholic brethren. This suggestion was highly favored, and carried into effect a few days later at a temperance demonstration, led by a Roman Catholic priest, of course. The wayward daughter was gladly received and affectionately embraced by the "Mother of Harlots." The priest in charge held up both hands and said, "I hope the time is not far distant when there will be a general return to 'the church,' and all unite under one head;" that head the head of Leo, to be sure. Can't you see it?
