**THE EASTERN EMBROGLIO.**

Massacres and outrage continue in Turkey, but the jealousy of the Powers prevents any effective action.

At a meeting held in London on the 21st ult., to protest against the massacre of Christians by Turks, "a most important announcement was made," says a London dispatch published here on the 22nd ult., "which it is believed, puts an end to all conjecture regarding the action that will be taken by the British Government in the direction of putting an end to the massacres by force or deposing the Sultan.

"The statement was made by John Lowles, member of the House of Commons for the Haggerston division of Shoreditch. He said that if England had a free hand in the matter very few days would elapse before there would be a change in Turkey.

"He then added that he was authorized by the Foreign Office to say that Great Britain was confronted by an agreement between the three powers that if she attacked Turkey on any excuse or pretext she would have to face that combination. If she fired a single shot or took action alone it would mean that at that moment there would be a European war."

The same day this appeared in the American papers the London Times published a dispatch from Sebastopol saying that "the Russian Black Sea fleet has been put on a war footing, and that three battalions of infantry have been embarked.

"Part of the fleet is cruising off Otchakoff, at the mouth of the Dnieper River, forty miles from Odessa, under orders that if its commander receives a telegram from M. Nelidoff, the Russian Ambassador to Turkey, it must join the remainder of the fleet leaving Sebastopol and go direct to the Bosporus. All the troops in South Russia are ready for active service."

These dispatches show that the situation is extremely critical. Even a very slight thing apparently might precipitate a conflict.
