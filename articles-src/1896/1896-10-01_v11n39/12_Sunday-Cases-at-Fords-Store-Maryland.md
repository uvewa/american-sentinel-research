## SUNDAY CASES AT FORD'S STORE, MD.

Our readers will remember that last week we stated that three arrests for Sunday labor had been made at Ford's Store, Md.

The work complained of in these cases was fishing for crabs; and the offenders against the majesty of the Maryland Sunday "law" were a Seventh-day Adventist and two other men, whose wives are Adventists.

It transpired at the trial of two of these cases, though it was not part of the evidence, that probably a dozen men were fishing at the same time and at the same place, but only the three men mentioned were molested by the officers of the law.

The accused were summoned to appear before a justice of the peace, three miles distant, at Queenstown, Saturday night, September 19. Owing to a severe storm, which swept over that part of Maryland in the evening of that day, only Mr. Mansfield, the Seventh-day Adventist, and a few of his friends, among whom was Elder J. E. Jayne, President of the Seventh-day Adventist Conference, appeared before the magistrate. Neither the constable nor the witnesses for the State were on hand. The case against Mansfield, of course, went by default owing to the failure of his prosecutors to appear.

The cases of the defendants not present were set for Monday evening, at which time the trial was again postponed to Thursday evening. Elder Jayne had in the meantime left the neighborhood, but returned again at the request of the International Religious Liberty Association, and was present to advise the defendants when they appeared for trial Thursday evening.

On this occasion the witnesses for the State appeared, and the constable told his story; that he had seen the men fishing; had watched them until they came up to the dock, and had seen the crabs and the crab lines in their boats.

It came out upon cross-examination, however, that the fishing ground was at such a distance from the constable's point of observation that he could not have distinguished between a man and a barrel. He could not see the lines, could not see the crabs, and could not tell whether they were indeed fishing, nor could he swear positively that the crabs he had seen in the boat had been taken that day.

The other witnesses for the State manifested great reluctance in testifying, so much so that the constable reproached them for "going back on him," and was in turn accused by them of making the arrests simply for the fees he hoped to get out of the cases.

The defendants and their friends were interested listeners during the discussion thus aroused, in which the facts were fully brought out that before there were any Adventists in the neighborhood people did about as they pleased on Sunday, and were not molested for so doing; that even now only the Adventists and their friends were arrested; that, as before stated, a number of others, not Adventists, and not in sympathy with the Adventists, were fishing at the same time as the defendants, but were not arrested; but that the Adventists were persistently and systematically spied upon and prosecuted.

Elder Jayne, the representative of the Religious Liberty Association, spoke, giving a brief history of the origin and purpose of Sunday laws, stating some facts in regard to their practical operation, and giving some good advice as to how neighbors should conduct themselves toward each other. In rendering his decision the magistrate, evidently an intelligent, fair-minded man, did not say that the men tried were not guilty, but, "Under the circumstances, I will excuse you this time."

Of course, all present were morally certain that the men were technically guilty, and yet the evidence was probably not sufficiently positive to have justified the magistrate in imposing a fine, even had the law been a just one. The friends of religious liberty in that neighborhood are to be congratulated upon the outcome of these cases, because we believe an era of better feeling and of more just appreciation of human rights has been inaugurated there.
