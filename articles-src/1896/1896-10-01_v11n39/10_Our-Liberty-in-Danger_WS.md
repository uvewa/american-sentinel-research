## OUR LIBERTY IN DANGER.

BY WILLIAM SIMPSON.*

DEAR to the hearts of all mankind is the precious gift of God, "liberty." The pages of history testify to this fact as we read of the desperate attempts of man to attain this priceless boon. For days, men have willingly deprived themselves of food and suffered from rain and cold to gain this hope that was set before them. Many a father has left the comforts of home and even yielded up his life, and many a mother has sacrificed her son for the blessings of freedom that we now enjoy; but, like health, how little we appreciate it. It is only when we feel it slipping from us that we become alarmed and make an effort to retain it.

What Canadian is there, whether saint or sinner, who would be willing to give up, without remonstrance, his civil or religious liberty; and who would not raise his voice in warning should he see it in danger? "Give me liberty or give me death," are the sentiments of every true human heart. Not liberty to trample upon the rights of our fellowmen, not liberty to compel others to conform to our ideas and customs. No, this would be despotism, and we plead for freedom from such. We plead for equal rights, not only in civil but also in religious matters, and especially the latter, as this is in danger and so in need of the most diligent attention of all, just now, whether infidel or Christian.

You may take no interest whatever in religion and console yourself with the thought that it is of no importance to you; but stop and consider a few plain questions.

Would you like to be forced by law to believe in God? Would you not object if compelled to pray, to attend church and partake of the Lord's supper? Would you not remonstrate if urged by law to be baptized, or to observe any religious form in which you have no faith? I am sure you would claim the right to believe or not believe as you might see fit. But on the other hand, suppose that you are a Christian, would you not recoil with horror at the thought of being compelled to pay homage to the Papacy? Would you not be reluctant to give up your faith in the doctrines of the Bible or to break one command of the law of God? I am sure you would. In view of this fact, what position can civil government take in religious matters? Whom shall it favor, the infidel or the Christian, or shall it favor either?

This is indeed an important question, but the searchlight of truth as illustrated in history tells us that in matters of religion the civil government can of right have no power.

A royal proclamation issued by the Queen recognizes that the civil government cannot rule the consciences of men, and declares as follows:

We declare it to be our royal will and pleasure that none be in any wise favored, none molested nor disquieted, by reason of their religious faith or observances, but that all shall alike enjoy the equal and impartial protection of the law; and we do strictly charge and enjoin all those who may be in authority under us that they abstain from all interference with the religious belief or worship of any of our subjects on pain of our highest displeasure.

Noble words these, but are they being obeyed? Look about you, reader, to-day, and answer the questions. Are any favored in their religious convictions? Are any molested or disquieted by reason of their religious faith or observance? Do all alike enjoy the equal and impartial protection of the law? Are all who are in authority under Her Majesty the Queen abstaining from all interference with the religious belief and worship of all of her objects?

We need not look far for an answer to these plain questions. The yielding of Parliament to the demands of the different religious bodies for law to enforce religious dogmas, tell us that some are favored. The angry threats of enforcing law and the bitter religious hatred of professed Christians toward some who do not agree with them in their forms of worship, tell us that there are some who are molested and disquieted by reason of their religious faith and observances. Could the silent cells of Chatham jail but talk, they would inform us that all do not alike enjoy the equal and impartial protection of the law, and likewise some magistrates' offices would testify to the fact that all who are under authority to the Queen do not abstain from all interference with the religious belief and worship of all of her subjects.

Not long since, the writer, with other of his brethren, was arrested and dragged before the civil courts by fellow-Christians (?) and for what crime? Let the summons tell:

Whereas you have this day been charged before the undersigned, Geo. A. Watson, a justice of the peace in and for the said county of Kent; for that you on the third day of November, a. m. 1895, at the township of Chatham, in the county of Kent, did exercise worldly labor, being the Lord's day (the sabbath day).

We are not accused of interfering with the civil rights of our fellowmen, but for exercising worldly labor on the Lord's day (the first day of the week).

We are arraigned before rulers and magistrates, not for crime with which civil law only has to do, but for supposed disobedience to God, which is punishable by God alone and over which the civil law has no jurisdiction.

We do not deny having performed quiet labor on the first day of the week, but we do deny the charge of breaking the Sabbath day. We believe that the Bible only contains a perfect revelation of God. We believe that in the Bible alone can be found an infallible rule of what man is to believe, and consequently when God says "the seventh day is the Sabbath," that he has blessed and sanctified and made it holy, we believe that it is so and we dare not follow the world in trampling it under foot. After conscientiously keeping the Sabbath according to the commandment, we have, according to the same command, a God-given right to labor six days, providing such labor does not interfere with others; but instead of being allowed to worship God according to the dictates of our consciences which in harmony with the Bible says, "The seventh day is the Sabbath," we are urged on pain of imprisonment to worship according to the dictates of the conscience of others, who, being more favored, have succeeded in persuading the government that the first day is the Sabbath in plain contradiction to the Bible.

The magistrate instead of abstaining from interference in this question of religion as the Queen strictly charged, found convictions against us, ranging from forty to sixty days in Chatham jail.

We have served our time. The civil law has been satisfied for the awful crime(?) of doing quiet, civil work on the first day of the week after we had conscientiously kept the Sabbath according to the commandment. We have no complaint to offer nor do we seek sympathy, but we cannot refrain from raising our voices in warning against such interference by the State with religious matters. Oh, that all could see the evil results of religious legislation!

God forbid that we should forget in this nineteenth century, the sickening scenes of the Inquisition and what led to it. Let us profit by the terrible mistakes of the Dark Ages. Shall the rack and the thumbscrew be revived to wring from men outward obedience to religious dogmas in which they have no faith?

We have no faith in the first day of the week as a holy day, and why should government by the oppressive arm of the civil law compel us to observe it as long as we conduct ourselves as civil citizens and pay our honest debts? No, we have no faith in any other day as the Sabbath but the one which God has blessed and instituted, which is, according to our teacher, the Bible, the seventh day of the week, and not the first. Stern law may substitute for the company of our dearest friends that of the vilest criminals, it may take away our citizens' clothes and give us the heavy prison garb; it may feed us for long weary days with scanty prison food and compel us to sleep on hard prison beds, but such treatment will not inspire in us faith in a religious institution that has no authority in the Bible. "Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God." One text from God's Word would be far more effective than all such treatment. In fact, the gospel of Jesus Christ and the word of God are the only lawful weapons for Christians to use in leading others to obey God. Here love only is power, and faith that worketh by love is the only obedience that God accepts; hence civil power is useless when used to enforce obedience to God.

Because we cannot bend our consciences to conform to laws and forms of religion that God has never made nor authorized, we become an object of reproach, but where, let me ask, has God ever changed his Sabbath from the seventh day and commanded us to honor the first day in its stead? Surely not in the Bible, which we as Protestants take as our only infallible guide. It is evident to all that a change has taken place, and the question comes home to every honest heart, Who has dared to tamper with God's law? The Bible answers the question in the seventh chapter of Daniel and the twenty-fifth verse. Speaking of the Papacy, as all commentators admit, it says: "He shall speak great words against the Most High, and wear out the saints of the Most High, and think to change times and laws."

The Papacy has fulfilled these specifications to the very letter. We hear them trumpeting to the world the claim to infallibility and equality with God. Is not this speaking great words against the Most High? The instruments of torture used in the Inquisition by this power to punish those who did not yield to her religious demands testify to the fact that they have literally worn out the saints of the Most High. The Papacy has also thought to change the law of God. Yes, friends, this is the power that has brought about this change, and we hear them making their boast of it to the world without one word of remonstrance from the majority of professed Protestants.

In a Catholic work which may be obtained of Catholic publishers in Toronto, we read the following:

The church, in virtue of the power which she has received from Christ, abolished the Jewish Sabbath and substituted the Sunday in its stead.*

In another work entitled, "A Manual of the Catholic Religion," on page 186, we read as follows:

But that the church has instituted the Sunday as the Lord's day instead of the Sabbath, and determined it as the day to be especially employed in adoring and worshiping God, shows forth the great power which she solemnly received from Christ.

Presumption! Where did the Catholic Church receive such power from Christ to abolish the Sabbath that he blessed, and substitute another day in its stead? Where, I ask? The Bible is silent. Christ himself says: "Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill. For verily I say unto you, till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one little shall in nowise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled. Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven."

In spite of these plain utterances of Christ, the man who would do and teach God's commandments just as they read, is thought to be strange and peculiar. He is in the minority, and despised by man. He does not have the name of being called great in the earth, but he has the promise from the lips of Christ that he will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
