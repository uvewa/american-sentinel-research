**RESPECT FOR LAW.**

"One of the hopeful signs of the times," says the Catholic Review, of September 13, "as it is also an eminent characteristic of the American people, is the profound respect for law which we everywhere behold. This respect for law lies at the root of public conscience; it trains and informs it. Were men to lose it, then the crimes of the great and powerful would go unwhipped of justice, and the popular conscience would soon become seared and perverted."

It is possible that there is less cause for satisfaction upon this point than is believed to exist by those who view the situation in this light; there is a probability, in fact, and this probability constitutes one of the gravest dangers threatening this Republic. Certainly no question can more vitally concern the welfare of a nation than that of the respect of its people for the law. But "respect for law" is a phrase whose full meaning very many fail to comprehend. To them it is only a half statement of the truth, and as such becomes the inculcator of a most dangerous error.

The all-important truth which underlies this subject is that law is not something manufactured by the flat of man, in legislative assembly or otherwise, but law is justice, and respect for law must mean respect for justice, if it would be of any benefit to the State. If the people lose sight of this distinction, then indeed will the public conscience become seared and perverted, and that in very brief time.

What is justice? is the question to be determined by the people themselves, and their right to determine it for themselves, in any case whatsoever, cannot be questioned. Legislatures and courts are not established to instruct the people, or to rule over them, but to transact the people's business in civic affairs. As such they are the servants of the people, to execute the people's will, and not to dictate to them. If the people are incompetent to determine what is right and just, then they are unfit for a republican form of government. But the right of self-government is the right of all intelligent people. They may not always determine correctly upon these points, but this fact does not affect their right in the matter. No man is invested with infallibility.

The danger is that the people will come to regard as law anything which legislators and judges may enact or affirm to be such, without considering it essential—or even proper—to pass judgment upon it themselves; in other words, that they will regard the flat of legislator or judge as constituting the law, and forget that justice must constitute it. It might be well enough if legislators and judges were always sure to state the law of justice in each case, or to exercise their unbiased judgment in the endeavor to do so. But legislators and judges are but men, having human weaknesses and subject to the temptations common to all. Experience has proved that they are not entirely incorruptible. It has demonstrated that their action is not always above the suspicion of proceeding from selfish motives. The servants of the people, like all other servants, will bear watching.

When the people come to look with awe upon the flat of man, as constituting the law which they are bound to obey, without reference to its justice or injustice, their sense of justice will inevitably become blunted; and without a lively sense of and regard for justice in the minds of the common people, the very foundations of popular government must crumble into dust. The people must remember that they themselves are the rulers in this Government, and that upon them rests the responsibility of the Government. The legislatures, Congress, the courts, even the national Supreme Court, are the creatures of the people; and the creature must not dictate to the creator. The former is answerable to the latter; he must acknowledge the latter's right of criticism. Such criticism is not anarchy. Bodies so powerful as legislatures and supreme courts should be scrutinized by the public eye with a care proportionate to the harm they are capable of doing by a wrong move. It is upon these fundamental principles of popular government that the people need to be educated, far more than upon the issues involved in a political campaign.
