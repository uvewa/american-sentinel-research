It seems that the authorities of Ontario are in no hurry to imprison the three Adventist ministers, Burrill, Howe, and Simpson, to whose cases we devoted so much space last week. The judgment against them by the lower court was affirmed but without costs. This leaves all the expenses of the cases to be paid by the prosecutors, including the prisoner's board bill while in jail. This latter fact doubtless accounts for the delay in carrying out the sentence of the court. Bigotry has in this instance been "Hoist with his own petard."
