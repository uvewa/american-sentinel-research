## EVENTS IN WASHINGTON.

DR. CRAFTS, the body, soul, and spirit of the National Bureau of Reforms, Washington, D. C., is still urging upon Congress the "necessity" of enacting a Sunday "law" for the District of Columbia.

Sunday, March 29, the doctor did a little detective work in the interest of "reform." He tells the story himself in the Washington Post of the following morning, thus:—

EDITOR POST: In reply to those who say that Washington does not need to have the law restored by which Sunday traffic was forbidden for the twenty-two years ending in 1886, permit me to report that yesterday in a walk from the National Capitol, whose business was suspended (why should it not give clerks equal rest?) I noted street number and business of forty-eight open stores in as many minutes on the north side of Pennsylvania avenue to Seventh street, with Seventh street northwest, as far as E, including not only fruiteners and tobacconists in abundance, but also numerous grocery and gents' furnishing stores. This count did not include druggists or any traffic at hotel stands.

Even if this opening of shops would not increase, as it has everywhere else when not forcibly prevented, as it has been increasing here for years slowly but surely, even if there were not such preventive reasons for the law, the clerks and tradesmen now doing seven days' work for six days' pay ought to be protected against masters and competitors in that right to rest which is written not only in the Bible, but in the body.

The foreign element in our National Capital of all places ought not to be allowed to destroy this best of American institutions, the American Sabbath, and put a foreign Sunday of toll and dissipation in its place.

WILBUR F. CRAFTS,
Superintendent National Bureau of Reforms,
710 Delaware Avenue, Northeast.

This account must have been written and put in type before twelve o'clock Sunday night, for the Post is printed long before daylight Monday morning. But then we believe that the doctor does not hold that it is wrong for him to work on Sunday, and of course it could not be wrong for a printer to set matter on Sunday in the interests of Sunday sacredness!

As stated in the SENTINEL two weeks ago the Commissioners of the District of Columbia returned the Morse Sunday bill to the House and Senate with an adverse report; but immediately the Reformers secured the introduction, through Mr. Wellington, of Maryland, of a substitute for the Morse bill. The substitute was also introduced in the Senate by McMillan, of Michigan. This bill is so framed as to disarm if possible those who keep the seventh day. After the enacting clause and the prohibitions, the second section of the bill reads: "It shall be a sufficient defense to a prosecution for servile labor on the first day of the week that the defendant uniformly keeps another day of the week as a day of rest, and that the labor complained of was done in such a manner as not to interrupt or disturb other persons in observing the first day of the week as a day of rest."

It never seems to occur to these Reformers that persons can have any other motive in opposing the passage of Sunday "laws" except those that are purely selfish. The truth is that while Sunday "laws" exempting observers of the seventh day are less oppressive than others, they are the same in principle; they are religious legislation, and to assent to them is to abandon the whole field so far as principle is concerned.

But even from a purely selfish standpoint the Sabbatarian still has abundant reason for opposing this bill, because under such a "law" he could be dragged before courts and compelled to prove that he uniformly keeps another day of rest, and that his labor has disturbed no one. After all this is done, the courts will be the judges as to whether the defendant has established the fact. It is easy for the people who are demanding Sunday "laws" to be "disturbed," and difficult sometimes to make a defense that will satisfy a court.

It is impossible to tell what disposition will be made of this Sunday bill.
