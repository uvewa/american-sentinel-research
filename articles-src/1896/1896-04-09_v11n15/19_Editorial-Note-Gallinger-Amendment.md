March 25, Senator Gallinger, of New Hampshire, introduced a joint resolution proposing the following, to be known as Article XVI. of the Constitution:—

Neither Congress nor any State shall pass any law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, or use the property or credit of the United States, or of any State, or any money raised by taxation, or authorize either to be used, for the purpose of founding, maintaining, or aiding, by appropriation, payment for services, expenses, or otherwise, any church, religious denomination, or religious society, or any institution, society, or undertaking, which is wholly or in part under sectarian or ecclesiastical control.

The SENTINEL will probably have more to say in regard to this proposed amendment in the future. Suffice it to say now that if adopted and administered as it reads it would leave the National Reformers and the National Bureau of Reforms without a mission.
