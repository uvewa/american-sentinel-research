ACCORDING to Article VI. of the Constitution of the United States, "All treaties made, or which shall be made, under the authority of the United States, shall be the supreme law of the land; and the judges in every State shall be bound thereby, anything in the Constitution or laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding. It follows that this is not and cannot be a Christian nation in any legal sense, for the Treaty of the United States with Tripoli in 1797 provides as follows:—

As the Government of the United States of America is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion, as it has in itself no character of enmity against the laws, religion, or tranquility of Musselmans; and, as the said States never entered into any war, or act of hostility against any Mahometan nation, it is declared by the parties that no pretext, arising from religious opinions, shall ever produce an interruption of the harmony existing between the two countries.

But this which the Constitution declares is the supreme law of the land, the author of "Christian Sociology" argues "is outlawed as a precedent by the contrary decision of the National Supreme Court in 1892"!

With all National Reformers, any deviation from "law" in the interests of liberty is anarchy; but if it stand in the way of their pseudo-reform, no law is too sacred to be by them ruthlessly brushed aside whether it be the constitution of the natural law of justice, the Constitution of the United States, or sacred treaty obligations entered into under that Constitution. National Reform is therefore the very embodiment of anarchy.
