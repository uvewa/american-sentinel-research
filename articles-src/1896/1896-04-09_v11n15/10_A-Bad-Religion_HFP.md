## A BAD RELIGION.

BY H. F. PHELPS.

It is reported of Benjamin Franklin that he once said: "When a religion is good I conceive that it will support itself; and when it does not support itself and God does not care to support it, so its professors are obliged to call for help from civil power, it is a sign, I apprehend, of its being a bad one." Another writer has expressed the principle in substance, that a religion that cannot stand without aid from the civil power, is not worth the possession. How does the cause of Sunday sacredness and Sunday observance appear when examined in the light of this principle?

There was a time when the friends of the Sunday cause appealed to Scripture for its support. But, driven to the wall in their search for divine authority, almost universally they have acknowledged that the search is fruitless, because there is no such authority. But instead of relegating the Sunday to the shades of papacy and paganism, where it rightfully belongs, they have turned to the civil power for its support. But this act condemns the institution. Says the Supreme Court of Ohio: "A form of religion that cannot live under equal and impartial laws ought to die, and sooner or later must die." Such is sure to be the fate of every false system eventually.

Once more I quote from the same source: "True Christianity asks no aid from the sword of civil authority. It began without the sword, and whenever it has taken the sword, it has perished by the sword. To depend on civil authority for its enforcement, is to acknowledge its own weakness, which it can never afford to do. It is able to fight its own battles. Its weapons are moral and spiritual, and not carnal. Armed with these and these alone, it is not afraid nor 'ashamed' to be compared with other religions, and to withstand them single-handed. And the very reason why it is not so afraid or 'ashamed' is that it is not the 'power of man,' but 'the power of God,' on which it depends. True Christianity never shields itself behind majorities. Nero, and the other persecuting emperors, were amply supported by majorities, and yet the pure and peaceable religion of Christ in the end triumphed over them all; and it was only when it attempted, itself, to enforce religion by the arm of authority, that it began to wane."

It is well here to remember that the religion of Jesus Christ is not a changeable thing, and therefore Christianity pure and simple, never did, and never will attempt to enforce itself. It is false Christianity that has done this. It was false Christianity that became legalized by civil enactments, and then enforced itself by such enactments. And it is a false Christianity that, in this time, has become legalized. And being legalized, it has, as a logical consequence, no support in the Scriptures of truth, and does therefore, seek to "hide itself behind majorities," and enforce itself by the carnal weapons.

The same decision says again: "Legal Christianity is a solecism, a contradiction of terms. When Christianity asks the aid of government beyond mere impartial protection, it denies itself. [And denying itself it proves that it is not true, but a false Christianity.] Its laws are divine and not human. Its essential interests lie beyond the reach and range of human governments. United with government, religion never rises above the merest superstition; united with religion, government never rises above the merest despotism; and all history shows us that the more widely and completely they are separated, the better it is for both." Let all modern would-be reformers ponder these words, for they are incontrovertibly true.
