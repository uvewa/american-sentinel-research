## ADVENTIST FARMERS PETITION THE ON-TARIO GOVERNMENT.

"The following petition," says the Toronto Globe, of the 1st inst., was presented yesterday to the Provincial Government by Eugene Leland, pastor of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, and Mr. G. W. Morse, manager of the Adventists' publishing house, on behalf of fifty-five farmers of Essex and Kent":—

To the honorable the Attorney-General:—

We, the undersigned farmers, citizens of the Province of Ontario, beg leave to present the following petition to your Lordship through Mr. G. W. Morse and Mr. Eugene Leland of Toronto.

Referring to Mr. Ferguson's bill, No. 127, entitled, "An Act to amend the Act to Prevent the Profanation of the Lord's Day," we ask that this bill may not pass, and for the following reasons:—

1. Believing that the fourth commandment of the Decalogue should be obeyed literally, we observe the seventh day, or Saturday, as the Sabbath, and carry on our work on Sunday the same as on other working days of the week; but if this bill becomes a law, it will deprive us of one-seventh of our time and consequently of one-seventh of our income. [They would be deprived really of one-sixth of working time, and income.—Ed. SENTINEL.] The government will get no pecuniary benefit from this tax upon us, and we will get no quivalent whatever. It is a great grievance to farmers, especially at certain seasons of the year, to be deprived of one day's work every week, and as no possible good can come from it, either to us or to those who require it of us, we most earnestly protest that this bill shall not pass.

2. It is religious legislation, a union of Church and State, and, as such, we protest against it.

(a) That it is religious legislation is shown in the title of the amended act. It is called an act to prevent the profanation of the Lord's day. The observance of the Lord's day is a duty which pertains wholly to the Lord, and, as such, it should be rendered to him, and not to Caesar, or the State. It is "the Sabbath of the Lord thy God," not the Sabbath of the Province of Ontario. Like the Lord's supper, the Lord's prayer, the attendance at the house of the Lord, baptism, or any other religious ceremony, the observance of the Lord's day is simply and solely an act of religious worship. We believe that its observance should not be enforced any more than should the observance of any other of the forms of religious worship that we have named.

(b) That it is religious legislation is shown still further in that the Lord's day act is not intended to restrain or prevent crime, but it is intended solely to restrain or prevent what is considered to be irreligion. This is true, for when a crime is committed on Sunday, and a conviction is secured against the criminal, it is never secured under the Lord's day act, but always under some other statute. And again, whenever a conviction is under the Lord's day act, it is invariably for an act which in itself is perfectly civil, and which would be so regarded on any other day of the week. The only reason, therefore, why the act is considered an indictable offense when committed on Sunday, is because it is thought to be irreligious, and not at all because it is thought to be uncivil.

(c) That this is religious legislation is shown in that the observance of Sunday is not on a civil basis. If Sunday is to be regarded as a civil day merely, why should it not be put on a civil basis just the same as any other recognized civil holiday? Quiet civil employment on the Queen's birthday, New Year's, the first of July, a civic holiday, or Thanksgiving, is not an indictable offense; nor on any day regarded as a civil day. Why should quiet, civil employment on Sunday be considered uncivil and made an indictable offense any more than on these other days? Is Sunday any more civil than these other days? Not at all, but it is more religious. And that is the reason why its observance is enforced.

(d) This is shown to be religious legislation from the character of the disturbance complained of, and from the nature of the injury sustained. The disturbance, if such it must be called, is not complained of for the reason that someone else is injured by it, in person or in property, but because the individual has injured himself. But this injury which he himself sustained by working on Sunday, or which others may sustain by it, is of a spiritual character entirely, not a real or personal injury; but the Government of Ontario is a civil, not a spiritual Government, and therefore it has no jurisdiction over spiritual offences, such as sabbath-breaking is.

From all these considerations it is clear that this bill proposes religious legislation, and against it all we wish to enter our most earnest protest.

(3) This legislation is not needed.

(a) As a rule the farmers are more strict, if possible, in their observance of Sunday than any other class of people, the only exception being in the case of the few who observe the seventh day as the Sabbath. But in their case, if the civil labor which they perform on Sunday constitutes so great an offence as to demand special legislation, surely they have a thousand-fold more reason to ask for special legislation to protect them in the observance of the seventh day, for there are a thousand-fold more people to create a disturbance on that day. But a petition from these people asking for such legislation would be laughed at, or treated with contempt. But have not the minority an equal right with the majority in demanding the protection of the law in their religious worship? Most assuredly they have! But it is not protection the promoters of this bill are seeking to secure. It is conformity to a form of religious worship. And there is no protection in such legislation, either to the promoters of the bill or to those upon whom it is intended to operate.

(b) Labor on Sunday by the farmers, even though in a field ajoining a house of worship, does not disturb the worship, unless it is intentionally boisterous, and in that case the provisions of the Lord's day act would not be invoked to restrain the disturbance, but the statute would be appealed to which forbids the disturbing of a religious meeting.

The sittings of the Legislature or of the courts of justice, the running of the public schools and other institutions of learning are not disturbed by civil employment during the six working days of the week. Nor is the religious worship of the Jews, and others who observe the Sabbath, disturbed by the noise of business which is carried on on that day, and which is greater if possible than on other days of the week. No one ever heard of a complaint being made by these people on account of the disturbance to their religious worship on the Sabbath. We repeat that this disturbance is simply of a mental character, and is occasioned solely by nonconformity to an act of religious worship.

(c) Restraining people from civil employment on Sunday does no good either to the one restrained or the one who restrains him. The one restrained is not made civil by the restraint, because that from which he is restrained is not uncivil. And he certainly is not made religious by the restraint, for people are not made religious in that way. "If righteousness come by the law, then Christ is dead in vain," Gal. 2:21. So far, then, as the one whom is this intended to restrain is concerned, this legislation is not needed, for he is made neither civil nor religious by it, and so far as the one who restrains him is concerned, he can derive no possible benefit from the legislation unless it be from the moiety of the fine which is allowed him for entering the complaint. Aside from this consideration, he is no better pecuniarily, and if that is the object of his entering the complaint he is certainly no better for having entered it.

(4) We protest against this bill because it is legislation against the law of God. The divine command is always and everywhere, "The seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God." Now if the Legislature has the right to decide in regard to the manner in which the Lord's Day shall be observed, the provisions of the act ought certainly to conform to the requirements of the divine statute. But they do not, for the day which is required to be observed by the Lord's day act of Ontario is not the seventh day. And therefore, if this bill becomes a law, it will be directly opposed to the law of God, and it will require the farmer either to commit sin or to pay a fine for not doing it.
