## "WHOSE OX," ETC.

### BY H. B. MAURER.

There are a few preachers and religious thinkers in our country who have not the natural ability, or training, to define the difference between tweedle-dee and tweedle-dum. Our pulpit and platform ability can evolve a discourse from an adverb, a conjunction, or preposition; can divide into longitudinal sections the finest specimen of capillary matter that was ever found in a second growth on any theological pate, however shiny; it can elsegate into scriptural texts ideas God and the angels would fail to find therein; can beat out moral questions into a thinness in comparison to which tissue paper is like China's wall; while of moral principles, however subtle in themselves, it can make such fine-spun applications as to necessitate, for the ordinary intelligence, a Lick mental telescope to discover, and many other feats of intellectual jugglery it is able to perform; but when it comes to a consideration of a certain phase of religious matters, the support religion receives, directly or indirectly, from the State—a support that is inconsistent, unjust, unfair, and therefore un-Christian and un-American—the theologian's sensibilities seem suddenly soared as with a hot iron.

There is a failure to detect the dishonesty and unfairness in the exemption of church property from taxation, which exemption besides is so palpably inconsistent with our theory of the union of Church and State, that it surprises one that there should ever be any claims made that we have here no such union.

Sabbath legislation, under the disguise of civil, sanitary, and other pretensions, is an insult to the ordinary intelligence, and "it gives one a pain" to think that the "Sabbath" reformers cannot see it in that light, and since they do not, what hope is there that they will ever see that such legislation is alike subversive of Christian as well as American principles?

Strong is the spell that error weaves,
In midnight madness for mankind;
And deep the trace that error leaves
Impressed upon the human mind.
Bright must the rays of God's light break,
And strong the power of truth must be,
Ere men from error's trance awake
And think, and act, and dare be free.
