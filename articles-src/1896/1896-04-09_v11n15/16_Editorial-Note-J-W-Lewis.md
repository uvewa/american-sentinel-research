J. W. LEWIS, the Seventh-day Adventist, confined in the Lake County Jail at Tiptonville, Tenn., writes us:—

Please ask through the SENTINEL all friends of freedom of conscience to remember me in their prayers, and say that I very much appreciate the many good letters that I receive, some coming almost every day. But I am forced to say that though I am ever so willing to reply promptly, writing materials and stamps are quite an item to one deprived of his liberty.

We trust that those readers of the SENTINEL who have written to this prisoner for the truth's sake, will accept this notice as sufficient reply, and continue to remember those who are in bonds as bound with them.
