A DAILY paper has recently made inquiry concerning the religious affiliations of the forty-four State governors of the American Union. The result showed that thirty-nine are avowed believers in religion and twenty-nine are professed Christians, and most of them are regular attendants at some place of worship. In response to the inquiries sent out, forty-three State governors and three Territorial governors returned answer. The governor of Texas declined to state his position, while the governor of South Carolina did not respond. Ten of the number are Presbyterians, five Congregationalists, five Unitarians, one Baptist, one Christian, and sixteen are unconnected with church organizations. Several who made answer are regarded as possible candidates for the presidency in the ensuing election. Commenting upon this fact the Outlook very pertinently says that "little can be determined by a simple profession of religion."
