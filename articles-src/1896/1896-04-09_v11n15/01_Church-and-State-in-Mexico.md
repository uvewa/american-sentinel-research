# CHURCH AND STATE IN MEXICO.

The history of Mexico under the republic is largely a record of conflicts between the civil and ecclesiastical powers, arising from the union of Church and State inherited from Spain and the Papacy. It is a history from which valuable lessons may be drawn respecting the evils of Church and State union.

As bequeathed to Mexico by the Papacy, this union was complete. The Church was the dominant power, and the State executed her bidding; and as the will of the Church had been made the civil "law" as well, the Church could proceed against dissenters by "due process of law" in the civil courts.

As was natural under such conditions, the Church held title to vast possessions. To the power of superstition and absolute belief in the spiritual claims put forth by her priests and prelates, was added the power of immense wealth. With such resources at her disposal, and unchecked by considerations of justice and the rights of mankind, the Church haughtily and fatuously proceeded to illustrate the proverb that "pride goeth before a fall." To the arbitrary and unscrupulous use of her great power, the soil of North America was

not suited. Bordered by a great republic "conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal," the spirit of liberty could not be debarred from her people. This desire for freedom first took visible shape in Mexico in an effort for political independence, which was realized in 1821. This achievement was shortly followed by the establishment of the republic.

The first constitution, adopted in 1821, was called the "constitution of the three guarantees." These guarantees were "religion, independence, and union." The religion guaranteed was Roman Catholic, and no other

kind was tolerated. The rebellion against ecclesiastical tyranny was successful in 1857. In that year the government, under the leadership of the Liberal party, passed what were afterwards called the "laws of reform." As respects the attitude of the State toward the Church, these laws provided as follows:

# SECTION ONE.

ART. I. The State and the Church are independent of each other. No laws shall be made establishing or prohibiting any religion; but the State shall exercise authority over them all relative to the preservation of public order and the observance of its institutions.

ART. II. The Federal Government guarantees the free exercise of all religious services throughout the republic. It will reprove and punish those acts and practices only, which, although authorized by some tenet of faith, occasion a violation of the penal laws.

ART. III. No public officer, or corporation, or organized body of troops shall assist, in any official way in any religious service; neither shall demonstrations of any kind be made by civil officials with the object of religious solemnities. They shall therefore reject all holidays that do not have for their exclusive object the remembrance and celebration of acts purely civil. Sunday shall continue to be designated as a day of rest by the public offices and establishments.

ART. IV. Religious instruction, and the official practices of whatever form of worship, are prohibited in all the institutions of the Federal, State, and city governments. Moral instruction may be given in those which by their nature permit it, although without reference to any form of worship. The violation of this article shall be punished by a government fine of from $25 to $200, and by dismissal of the guilty parties in case of repetition.

Persons who reside in public institutions of whatever class, may, if they solicit it, go to places of worship, and in cases of extreme necessity may receive the spiritual aide of the religion which they profess in the institutions themselves. The

rules of each institution may fix the manner of obtaining this privilege without doing violence to the objects of the institution, and without violating the provisions of Art. III.

ART. V. No religious act shall be performed publicly in any other place than the interior of the churches, under penalty of the rite being suspended and the authors punished by a fine of not less than $10 nor more than $200, or imprisonment for not less than two nor more than fifteen days. When, however, the act may assume a grave character by the number of persons that may engage in it or from whatever other cause, the author of it, as well as such other persons as may not obey the intimation of the authorities that the act should be suspended, shall be

placed under arrest and consigned to the judicial authorities, incurring a penalty of not less than two nor more than six months in prison.

Neither the ministers of any religious faith nor individuals of either sex who profess such faith, shall wear, outside of their places of worship, a dress or uniform peculiar to such faith to distinguish them, on penalty of a government fine of not less than $10 nor more than $200.

ART. VI. The use of bells shall be strictly limited to calling the people to religious worship. The legitimate use of church bells may be prescribed by police regulation in such a manner that the public may not be disturbed thereby.

ART. VII. (Solutes to reporting churches and having them entered upon the public register as houses devoted to public worship and nothing more.)

ART. VIII. All wills and legacies made in favor of ministers of religion or of their relatives to the fourth civil grade, or of persons who dwell with such ministers, shall be null and void where such minister may have lent any kind of spiritual aid to the testator during the sickness of which he died, or may have been his confessor.

ART. IX. Wills and legacies are equally null and void, which, although made in favor of competent persons, may be fraudulent before the law, or an infringement of Art. XV., part III.

(ART. XV., part III. The right to receive alms or gifts shall never be interpreted to include real estate, mortgages on real estate, nor promises or obligations to be fulfilled in the future, be it in form of legacy, donation, gift, or whatsoever other class of obligations of that nature; all shall be null and ineffective.)

ART. X. Ministers of religion shall not, by reason of their office, enjoy any special privileges before the law over other citizens, nor shall they be subject to other prohibitions than those imposed on other citizens, nor shall they be subject to other prohibitions than those which this law and the constitution designate.

ART. XI. Discourses delivered by any minister of religion counseling disobedience to, or provoking any crime or violation of the laws, shall constitute such meeting illegal, and it shall cease to enjoy the guarantees given in Art. IX. of the constitution, and it may be dissolved by the civil authorities. The author of such discourse shall remain subject, in such case, to the provisions of Art. VI. of chapter VIII. of the third book of the Penal Code which is declared in force, in such cases, throughout the republic. Any minister of religion who may suggest or instigate crimes under this article shall be held as the principal author of such crimes.

ART. XII. All meetings in the churches shall be public and subject to the surveillance of the police, and the civil authorities may interfere when the circumstances demand it.

ART. XIII. Religious institutions shall be free to form ecclesiastical organizations as they may choose; but such organizations shall have no other legal authority than that of designating the officers of such organizations in the locality where they reside that they may receive the benefits of Art. XV. No minister of religion can, by reason of his office, address himself in his official character to the civil authorities. He shall do so in the form and according to the regulations imposed on any citizen who exercises the right of petition.

As may be supposed, the Papacy did not tamely submit to this curtailment of her power and authority. When the Liberal Constitution and "laws of reform" were put in operation by the government, the clerical party rebelled and set up an opposition government, whose object was the attainment of the following points:—

1. The inviolability of all church property and church revenues and the re-establishment of former executions.

2. The reestablishment of the fuerus, or special rights of the church and of the army. (Under these fuerus the military and clergy were responsible only to their own tribunals, and not to the law of the land.)

3. The restoration of the Roman Catholic religion as the sole and exclusive religion of Mexico.

4. The censorship of the press.

5. The exclusive system with regard to foreign immigration, confining it solely to immigrants from Catholic countries.

6. The overthrow of the constitution of 1857 and the establishment of an irresponsible central dictatorship, subservient solely to the Church.

7. If possible the restoration of a monarchy in Mexico, or the establishment of a European protectorate.

This was called the Plan of Tacubaya and was proclaimed by Zuloaga. When the legitimate government under President Juarez got the ascendancy over this body of revolutionists and they saw they could not succeed, the Clerical party entered into a conspiracy with Napoleon III. of France, and Maximilian of Austria was invited to come to Mexico as emperor. Maximilian accepted, he first went to Rome and received the Pope's blessing and the assurance that heaven would smile on his undertaking, and then came to Mexico and was proclaimed emperor. Assisted by the French soldiers he at first made some headway; but when in 1867, the French forces had to withdraw at the demand of the United States Government, Maximilian's cause soon became demoralized and he and his two leading generals were taken prisoners, tried by a court martial and executed in Quereterro.

The constitution and "laws of reform" were then carried into effect. All property held by the Church, except the houses actually used for worship, was confiscated and sold, or turned into public uses for post offices, school houses, barracks, museums, public libraries, etc.

As noticed recently in these columns, the property thus confiscated amounted in cash to the vast sum of $300,000,000, and the income derived from it was more than the entire revenue of the Mexican Government. And this vast property was, of course, untaxed.

## Evils of Untaxed Church Property.

Under these circumstances, such a step on the part of the Mexican Government appears as a plain necessity of the situation. But it should be equally plain that the evil is, in principle, the same under any system which exempts church property from taxation. Such property is bound to accumulate, and with this exemption in force, it is only a question of time when the government will be forced to take some measures to free itself from an insupportable incubus, or to guard against the dangerous use of the vast power thus placed in the Church's hands. The example of Mexico, as also that of France and other countries, shows that the danger is not imaginary. Under a liberal government, the Mexican Republic found in the Church its most formidable antagonist; and while expressing no dissent from her spiritual claims, the government saw in the curtailment of her temporal power a measure demanded by the instinct of self-preservation.

All history warns against the acquisition by the Church of temporal power. All Scripture forbids its use. The Church's legitimate power is spiritual; it is the power of God, and of Him who said to his followers on the day of His ascension, "Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world." Matt. 28: 20. It is, of course, only the Church which covets temporal power that can become dangerous to the interests of good government; and any church which does seek for such power, whether Protestant or Catholic in name, shows thereby that she has lost her divine power, has separated from her living Head, and is no longer the true Church which is the body of Christ. And from a church thus separated from Christ, nothing but evil can be expected.

## Untaxed Church Property in the United States.

The untaxed church property in the United States to-day amounts in value to nearly $700,000,000,—more than twice that in Mexico when confiscation became a necessary proceeding. There are no grounds in reason or justice upon which this property should be exempt from taxation. The principle that the State should look with favor upon an institution which tends to promote the integrity of its subjects, will not hold as regards the Church; for, as we have seen, and as all history attests, the Church apostatized from Christ, as the church of wealth and numbers is prone to be, is the most formidable enemy of the State's prosperity; and the State cannot, of course, undertake to distinguish between the different religious bodies claiming to be the Church of Christ. Nor has the State any right in justice to exempt church property; for the burden of taxation thus shifted from the Church, must be laid upon the shoulders of the people, in addition to that which they would be justly obliged to bear, and thus they are taxed, indirectly but no less really, for the support of the churches. But compulsory support of the Church is not a principle of good government, nor is it in harmony with the will of God. It is a principle pertaining to a union of Church and State.

## The Liberal Constitution.

The Liberal Constitution of Mexico, adopted in 1857, has been freely amended since that date, the change made being in pursuance of the liberal policy of government upon which the republic has happily set out. As touching the attitude of the State to the Church, the amendments made are as follows:—

ART. I. The State and the Church are independent of each other. Congress shall not make any laws establishing or prohibiting any religion.

ART. III. No religious institution shall acquire real estate or mortgages on the same except as provided in Art. 27 of the constitution.

(ART. 27 of constitution: No corporation, civil or ecclesiastical, whatsoever may be its character, name, or object, shall have legal power to acquire right in property or to control real estate with the exception of the buildings designed immediately and directly for the uses or purposes of the institution.)

ART. IV. The simple promise to tell the truth and to fulfill the obligations imposed shall take the place of the religious oath with all its gains and penalties.

ART. V. No one shall be obliged to labor without just remuneration and his full consent. The State will not permit any contract, covenant, or agreement to be carried into effect which has for its object the diminution, loss, or irrevocable sacrifice of personal liberty, whether it be on account of labor, education, or religious vow. The law, therefore, does not recognize monastic orders, neither can it permit their establishment whatever may be the name or object with which they pretend to be erected. Neither can it admit a contract in which a man may agree to proscription or banishment.

Thus far has Mexico proceeded toward the realization of that ideal system of government under which liberty and equality are secured within the limits of human power, to every citizen. It may well be true that not only the country of which Lincoln spoke in his Gettysburg address, but this entire western hemisphere, has been in the divine purpose dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal; that here the despotisms which had enslaved the world for ages were to be broken, here should be a refuge for the oppressed of other lands, here the banner of liberty be uprared for the encouragement and enlightenment of mankind. But the foremost and greatest of the powers of this hemisphere is proving recreant to her sacred trust, so that her territory has become in many places the scene of religious persecution. Her pernicious example cannot but react most disastrously upon the progress of liberty throughout the world. But the Author of liberty is about to appear the second time, coming in all the glory of his Father, and with all his angels, as King of kings and Lord of lords, to sweep the world of its wickedness, and establish eternal righteousness and peace. In this lies the hope of the lavers of liberty and justice for mankind.
