THE bill to amend the "Lord's Day Act" of Ontario, noticed in our last issue, has passed the Ontario legislature, and only the governor's signature is needed to make it "law." This means that as certainly as the governor signs it, persecution will be begun under it upon the farmers in the province who are observers of the seventh day, they being the class at which the bill is aimed.
