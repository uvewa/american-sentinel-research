**OPPOSED TO THE AMENDMENT.**

*[Sabbath Outlook, April 2.]*

The Watchman, (March 19) speaking of the Constitutional amendment which proposes to unite Church and State under its specious pleadings, takes the same ground that we have already announced. Those who love Christianity and seek its highest good must oppose such mistaken notions, even though some may also oppose them because they are enemies of Christianity. The Watchman says:—

The circumstance that in opposing this amendment, Baptists will be ranged with the irreligious forces of the community against those churches which have not accepted the principle of the separation of Church and State is perhaps to be deplored, but it should not weaken our courageous advocacy of our own convictions. Some will antagonize this amendment simply on the ground of their opposition to Christianity, and those who antagonize it on other grounds will be regarded by some thoughtless and superficial persons as adopting a course hostile to the interests of true religion. But we oppose the amendment not because we hate Christianity, but because we love it, and believe that Christ made a distinction between civil and religious affairs, between the service that is due an earthly sovereign and that which is due to the Supreme Rule; between the interests intrusted to the State and those intrusted to the Church.

We wish the Watchman and its Baptist composers would take the same definite stand concerning Sunday laws; as they would, no doubt, if their own unscriptural practice was not involved.
