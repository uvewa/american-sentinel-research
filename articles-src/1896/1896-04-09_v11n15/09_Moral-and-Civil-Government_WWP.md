**MORAL AND CIVIL GOVERNMENT.**

*BY W. W. PRESCOTT.*

**Sin and Crime.**

God in Christ Jesus deals with sin; the State deals with crime. The scripture says, "The thought of foolishness is sin;" but it is not crime. Therefore as Jesus Christ dwells in the mind, ruling the thoughts, anything contrary to his thought is sin, and he deals with sin. Sin is defined in the Scripture to be the "transgression of the law," and Jesus Christ in his kingdom deals with sin. The State has nothing to do with sin; it is crime that it deals with. Sin is the transgression of God's law in the thought of the heart. Sin is a lapse from holiness, and holiness dwells in the inmost heart. Anything different to that is sin; but the State cannot inquire about that. It waits till the thought becomes an overt act contrary to its law; because while God has a law to rule the heart, the State has a law to rule the action. When one transgresses the law of the State, he may or may not have sinned against God, but it is crime. There should be a careful distinction drawn between sin and crime. Crime is transgression of human law; sin is transgression of God's law as interpreted by Jesus Christ. Sin may or may not be crime. A man may be a murderer of the blackest type before God, and not be guilty of a crime. I may be an idolater, breaking God's law every day, and not have committed a single crime. I may be dark and deep-stained with sin, and not commit any crime.

**Morality and Civility.**

God's Government is moral; the government of the State is civil. Christ deals with morality. But we must understand what morality is. There is an accommodated sense of the word, in which we say, "He is not a Christian, but he is a moral man." When we come to the strict sense of the word, it means "One that is in harmony with God's law." The word "civil has to do with the relations between man and man; the word "moral" has to do with the relations between man and God. The truly moral man will be civil, you may be sure of that, and the only purpose of civil government is to make those men civil who would not be otherwise, who are not governed by the higher law of morality, the law of God in the heart.

The object, and the only object, of Caesar's government is,—not to give men rights, God does that,—but to protect men in their God-given rights. No company of men can confer rights upon any other company of men, but they can protect them in the proper use of those rights which they already have. Those rights belong to them, they are given them of God. Men will not be moral; then the State comes in with its power, and compels, and properly too, those men who will not be moral, to be civil. Outward conduct is civility; inward conduct is morality. God lives in the heart, making men moral by conferring upon them his own moral character. But the State cannot do this; it cannot get into the mind and see when men are committing sin. All the State can do is to look at the body, see whether men are committing crime or not, and make them civil if they will not be moral.

**Forgiveness vs. Penalty.**

Further, God in Christ exercises forgiveness in his government; Caesar knows no forgiveness, he knows nothing but the penalty. A man commits a sin against God, he has been a sinner all his life, but he sees Christ lifted up, and hears the promise, "If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness," and he accepts that promise; and right there his sins are forgiven; his load of crime is entirely removed; and he stands before God as though he had never committed a sin in his life. But if a man commits a crime, he may be ever so sorry, and he may confess to Caesar, but Caesar says, "Settle that with your Maker; I know nothing but the penalty."

If we should introduce into civil government the principles God uses in his kingdom, we should have perfect confusion. Look at those principles: "Then came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times? Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times, but, Until seventy times seven." "Take heed to yourselves: If thy brother trespass against thee, rebuke him; and if he repent, forgive him. And if he trespass against thee seven times in a day, and seven times in a day turn again to thee, saying, I repent; thou shalt forgive him." Matt. 18:21, 22; Luke 17:3, 4.

Suppose we should apply this principle to civil government. Here is a man arrested for horse stealing. He is brought up before the judge, and says, "I am very sorry, and the Bible says you must forgive." The judge says, "You are forgiven." He goes out and steals another horse, is brought back, and again forgiven. He does that seven times over. How do you think the judge would feel? I think that by the time he had reached the seventh experience he would think that there was some mistake about the law. These principles, which are the very glory of God's moral government, the very glory of his character, we cannot apply to

Cesar's government. God does forgive, even to seventy times seven, and he does it for us, thank God, but these principles do not belong here; they are for a different realm, and God, by the gift of his Son, has so provided that he can exercise forgiveness and still maintain the character of his law. By the sacrifice of Jesus Christ God has upheld the character of his government, keeps his law where it belongs, and yet holds out forgiveness to all that believe on his Son. Because of his wonderful provision for the stability of his government, God's law is not brought into disrepute when the man who has broken it again and again turns about and says, "I repent." By forgiving, civil government would break down the whole system of government; but God keeps his law where it belongs, and yet forgives everyone who repents.
