APRIL 1st, the Assembly of this State adopted an amendment to the Sunday barber bills, allowing shops all over the State to keep open until 11 A. M. Sunday, by a vote of 76 to 45. Cities of the first class, New York, Brooklyn and Buffalo, are permitted to keep open until 1 o'clock, as provided in the bill passed last year. The "law" enacted a year ago prohibited barbering at any hour on Sunday except in New York and Saratoga, and in these places also after 1 o'clock, P. M.
