Pope LEO's commission to Martinelli, the successor of Satolli, concludes thus: "We command all whom it concerns to recognize in you as Apostolic Delegate the supreme power of the delegating pontiff. We command that they give you aid, concurrence and obedience in all things, that they receive with reverence your salutary admonitions and orders. Whatsoever sentence or penalty you shall declare or inflict against those who oppose your authority we will ratify, and with the authority vested in us by the Lord will cause the same to be observed inviolably until condign satisfaction be made, notwithstanding constitutions and apostolic ordinances or any other thing to the contrary."
