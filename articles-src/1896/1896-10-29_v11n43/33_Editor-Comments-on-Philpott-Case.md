The letter on page 342, from D. W. Reavis concerning the Philpott indictment, is interesting matter. The facts as stated in the letter show clearly that the Grand Jury in indicting Mr. Philpott as they did, for violation of the "law," were themselves guilty of violating law.

As stated by us some weeks ago, the law of Tennessee gives grand juries inquisitorial powers only in certain cases. In all other cases some citizen must take the initiative, furnish the evidence, and sign the indictment as prosecutor. It is evident that in this case the grand jurors themselves took the initiative, summoned witnesses, and then without any authority endorsed upon the indictment the name of one of these witnesses as prosecutor. We believe that there have been other similar cases in Tennessee. We know that at the July session of court in Lake County, the grand jury summoned witnesses, and took every step in the finding of indictments up to the point of endorsing some name upon them as prosecutor. No one was willing to appear in that role, and so the indictments were not returned into court. The proceeding, however, was not the less illegal, simply because it was not fully carried out. Grand juries in Tennessee have no business to institute such proceedings in "nuisance" cases.

The suggestion of the judge to appoint the attorney general prosecutor ex-officio was likewise contrary to law. The court has power to appoint the attorney general prosecutor ex-officio when he is satisfied that a crime has been committed, and no one appears to prosecute; but the appointment must be made before the indictment has been found and for the purpose of securing it, and not afterwards. It is too late to make such appointment when the case comes up for trial. However, we do not wish to censure the judge. It does not appear from the record that he was at all disposed to persist in this matter, and indeed we have private information that he made the suggestion only to give the attorneys an opportunity to argue the question, as he wished to hear what they had to say upon it. He is said to be a fair-minded, honorable man.
