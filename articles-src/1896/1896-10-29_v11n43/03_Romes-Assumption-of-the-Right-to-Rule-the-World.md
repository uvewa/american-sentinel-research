# ROME'S ASSUMPTION OF THE RIGHT TO RULE THE WORLD.

We print on another page under the heading, "The Supreme Court of the World," a short report of a discourse by a Catholic priest in San Francisco, on the claims of the Roman Catholic Church to the right to be the supreme arbiter of the world.

This is a favorite theme with Rome. She once occupied that position and aspires to occupy it again.

It will be observed that this claim, to be the supreme court of the world, does not refer alone to religious matters, but to civil affairs as well; and authority in both religious and civil matters is sought to be found in the gospel commission, "Go ye, therefore, unto all nations."

It is assumed both by Roman Catholics and by so-called National Reformers, from the original National Reform Association to the Young People's Society of Christian Endeavor, that the gospel commission extends not only to individuals, but to nations; not in the sense that the gospel shall be preached to the individuals composing all nations, but that the gospel minister is commissioned to the nations in their organized capacity, that is, as to moral beings, and that the nations should hear and believe and be saved by the gospel, as nations.

Some have even carried this so far as to attempt to show that the words "State" and "world" are synonymous, because all the world is organized into some form or other of government; that therefore the texts which tell what Christ's attitude toward the world is, tell what his purpose and attitude are toward the State, and what the Christian's relation should be to the State. This conclusion would of course be correct if the premises upon which it is based were correct. Indeed, it is only a logical conclusion if the gospel commission means what Mr. Yorke, the San Francisco priest, and the Roman Catholic Church generally interpret it to mean; that is, if instead of being a commission authorizing the apostles and their successors, and indeed, all Christians, to go unto all the world and preach the gospel to every creature, or, as elsewhere expressed, to go to all nations, means that they were to bear a message to nations as such rather than to the individuals.

The Catholic Church is entirely consistent in its claim to infallibility. The assumption of the right to dictate in matters of faith and morals is in itself an assumption of the prerogative of infallibility.

In the memorial, written by Madison and presented to the Virginia Assembly in 1776, by the Presteretians, Baptists, and Quakers, it is said: "It is at least impossible for the magistrate to adjudge the right of preference among the various sects which profess the Christian faith, without erecting a claim to infallibility, which would lead us back to the church of Rome."

This is just as true to day as it was in 1776, and it is just as true of Protestants as of Catholics; whoever assumes to decide questions of faith and morals for others, thereby assumes the prerogative of infallibility, whether like the pope, he boldly avows it or not.

National reform in its various phases claims infallibility, not openly, it is true, as does the papacy, but by assuming to dictate to individuals in matters of faith and morals. This is true of the National Reform organization formed in 1863, and it is just as true of the Young People's Society of Christian Endeavor and the "Good Citizenship" leagues of more recent origin, now so earnestly engaged in using the civil power to advance, as they suppose, the interests of the church.

We do not see how those who assent to the claims of national reform, by whatever name it may be called, could take issue with Mr. Yorke, or the Catholic Church, whose views he voices, if the church bears a message not only to individuals, but to nations. For if the authority given to the apostles empowered them to decide civil disputes and controversies, or to exercise any civil authority, then, indeed, must the church be the supreme court of the world, not only in religious, but also in civil matters; and this, not the church in a divided state, not as represented by the various sects of Protestantism, but it is manifest that it must be the church, so organized, constituted and recognized, that its authority will be universally respected. National reform to be consistent must either abandon its own claims, or find refuge in the bosom of Rome.
