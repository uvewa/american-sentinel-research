A PRESS dispatch from Winnipeg, Manitoba, dated the 19th inst., gives the following news relative to the Manitoba school controversy—

"A bitch has occurred in the conference at Ottawa for the settlement of the parochial school question. Premier Laurier and the Manitoba delegates had agreed to the setting apart of half an hour a day in each school for religious teaching by Catholics, the belief being that this concession would be acceptable to both sides. But when the Protestant leaders here heard of it they made vigorous objection, declaring such a concession a violation of the national school principle. So the Manitoba Premier, Mr. Greenway, had to withdraw from this agreement; and now, as far as can be learned, no other scheme can be devised, and the settlement is as far off as ever."
