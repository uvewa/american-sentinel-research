# THE OBJECT AND STRENGTH OF THE CHRISTIAN CITIZENSHIP MOVEMENT.

BY CHAS. E. BUELL.

The ministers who are organizing the so-called "Christian Citizenship" movement, which is a gigantic religious combination for giving direction to the votes of honest-hearted and unsuspecting members of Christian Endeavor societies and kindred organizations, led by ambitious and designing persons, would seem to have mistaken the voting strength of the churches.

The thought that is born of the wish to force upon the people of this now free country a condition of class legislation, in which the elective franchise, the right of the individual to vote, is to be conditioned upon a religious test (and, as stated by an official, good citizenship will not be sufficient; but the voter must acquire standing under the test of "Christian Citizenship") is the first idea to be carried into complete form, to be made the basis of operations that are to follow.

To get all the strength which is desired, a religious "Tammany Hall" is to be created, whereby the religious are to become the balance of power, and, by throwing their strength to the highest bidder, to get in return the much-coveted legislation. This was the openly-avowed plan proposed by a speaker at the convention recently held at Plainfield, N. J.

This coincides with what has been announced by leaders of the movement in public addresses, or in official publications.

The words of the president of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, in National Convention, in 1887, disclose how this organization would combine Church and State:

The Woman's Christian Temperance Union, h.cal, national and world-wide, has one organic thought, one all absorbing purpose, one undying enthusiasm, and that is, that Christ shall be this world's king; yea, verily, this world's king in its realm of cause and effect—king of its courts, its camps, its commerce, king of its colleges and its obstetera, king of its customs and constitutions. The kingdom of Christ must enter the realm of law [force] through the gateway of politics.

The "National Christian Citizenship League," in its organ, The Christian Citizen, published in Chicago, in March, 1896, stated that the objects of the organization are threefold: 1, To reveal Christ as the Saviour of the nation as well as of the individual; 2, To make Christian principles operative in public affairs; and 3, To unite the followers of Christ in aggressive action, etc. In further stating the objects of the organization it defines the purpose of its "aggressive action" as being: "To purify and elevate the elective franchise." This means to require that the individual shall be approved by some leading and acceptable Christian denomination in order to be a voter.

From all that can be gathered from the statements of persons and publications officially representing the so-called Christian Citizenship movement, under the name of Christian Endeavor societies, the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, the National Christian Citizenship League, and kindred organizations, designing persons hope to place religion in politics with the ultimate object of uniting Church and State.

These are constantly speaking of this people as a "Christian nation," which might mean that, in contradistinction to its population being followers of Mahomet, they incline to the belief emanating from the Scripture teachings regarding the Messiah, and a general acceptance of the principle embodied in the "Golden Rule" enunciated by him. The statement might also mean that they consider that the majority of the voters of this country are enrolled members of religious organizations which actually hold to the very belief which is entertained by members of the societies which have been named, and will, without question, advance the project which the leaders have in hand.

There would be grave doubts of the possibility of making a success of an attempt to reach the ends aimed at by friends of the "Christian Citizenship" movement, when viewed from a political standpoint; for, numerically considered, the church people are not in the ascendancy. When the United States Census was taken in 1890, the entire membership of all religious bodies, Jews, Catholics, Protestants, Mormons, Communists, Theosophists, all, of whatsoever name or creed, was scarcely one-third of the population of the country.

One-third of this membership would amply represent the proportion of adult males that are voters. Not less than one million were foreign born, and had not been naturalized in 1890; more than a hundred thousand Indians were counted as church members, but were not counted among the population: ten million of the population were negroes, while there were numerous organizations, orders, and societies that withhold from voting; these must be taken into full account before a correct estimate can be made of the voting strength of the churches. More than all, the very members upon which the leaders rely will be divided when the hour comes for placing a free people at the feet of zealots.

The friends of "Christian Citizenship" who urge this as a "Christian nation" publish as facts that the 240,000 saloons which this country supports, graduate 600,000 drunkards annually, and that the money annually devoted to intemperance exceeds the value of church property; and, while urging upon the attention the great growth of denominations, they portray the immensity of the work that is to be done in converting the world outside of the so-called church.

Although Scripture teaching is against force, against the use of civil law to promote religion, there is a constant effort to procure unjust and unnecessary legislation for religious purposes, as can be shown in the numer-

ons bills always before Congress and State legislatures; and it is to such legislation that the peculiar organizations direct their strength.

Plainfield, N. J., Oct. 15, 1896.
