A REPORT of the recent Pennsylvania State Christian Endeavor convention, held at Scranton, makes this announcement: "Christian Endeavor citizenship is now beginning a practical program with work for the preservation of the sabbath. The suggestions of Dr. Crafts that petitions be prepared for the closing of all post-offices on the sabbath, met with enthusiastic response, and the State Secretary was instructed to prepare such petitions in blank as soon as possible. Pennsylvania will be found in the lead in this important endeavor. Already Williamsport is moving in the matter with great energy."
