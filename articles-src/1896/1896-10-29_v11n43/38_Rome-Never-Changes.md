The following from the Western Watchman (Roman Catholic), is significant:—

Tell the truth. Rome removed Bishop Keane. Cardinal Satolli advised the measure. The Germans had nothing to do with it. Rome did not want the young priests of America to be taught Pelagianism. The advocates of the doctrine that any form of Protestantism is better than no religion at all, claim Cardinals Manning and Newman for their contention. Neither of the English cardinals was regarded as a theologian in Rome, and at the time of their death neither enjoyed the slightest influence in Rome. Pelagianism must be stamped out. Man is in the supernatural order, and whether pagan or Christian, is obliged to tend to his supernatural end. Grace is an aid to that end. The church is a guide to that end. Protestantism in all its forms leads the pilgrim astray. Protestantism is a siren. It sings to the seafarer and allures him to the breakers. Protestantism is the enemy of God; of God's truth; of God's Church. It is not better than nothing, because good for nothing.

It is to be hoped that such utterances by the Roman Catholic press will have the effect of opening the eyes of Protestants generally to the fact that "Rome never changes."
