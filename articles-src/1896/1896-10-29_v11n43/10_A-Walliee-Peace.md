# A WALLIEE PEACE.

[Christian Advocate, October 15, 1896.]

Every term is relative. The newspapers are speaking of the Victorian age as one of peace. A woman consulted a lawyer to begin proceedings for a divorce on the ground of intolerable cruelty. But a few weeks later he found it impossible to get from her the facts necessary to enable him to draw up the papers, and on demanding whether she had changed her mind, she replied, "Not exactly

but all is peace with us now. Would you believe it? John has not struck me for four weeks."

An English paper makes a list of the wars of England since Queen Victoria ascended the throne. Here it is:—

Afghan war, 1838-40; first China war, 1841; Sikh war, 1845-46; Kaffir war, 1846; second war with China; second Afghan war, 1849; second Sikh war, 1849-49; Burmese war, 1850; second Kaffir war, 1851-52; second Burmese war, 1852-53; Crimea, 1854; third war with China, 1856-58; Indian Mutiny, 1857; Maori war, 1860-61; more wars with China, 1860 and 1862; second Maori war, 1863-66; Ashantee war, 1864; war in Bhootan, 1864; Abyssinian war, 1867-68; war with the Bazotees, 1868; third Maori war, 1868-69; war with Looshais, 1871; second Ashantee war, 1873-74; third Kaffir war, 1877; Zulu war, 1878-79; third Afghan war, 1878-80; war in Basutoland, 1879-81; Transvaal war, 1879-81; Egyptian war, 1882; Soudan, 1884-85-89; third Burmah war, 1885-92; Zanzibar, 1890; India, 1890; Metabele wars, 1894 and 1896; Chitral campaign, 1895; third Ashantee campaign, 1896; second Soudan campaign, 1896.

Yet that is peace compared with any corresponding period in England's history. War, however, horrible as it is in human history thus far, has considerable to its credit as a peacemaker, and preparation for it is the main defense that any nation has "against sedition, privy conspiracy, and rebellion," and against the rapacity, envy, treachery, recklessness, and the revenge of other nations.
