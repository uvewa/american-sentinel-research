The Sabbath question is fundamental. It underlies everything." So we are told, and upon this is built the argument that we must have Sunday laws. The statement is wrong. Not that Sabbath, but faith, underlies everything that is Christian. There may be Sabbath observance—outward and formal, such as can be secured by human laws—without faith; but "whatsoever is not of faith is sin." And faith cannot be produced by legislation.
