# IS THE SABBATH IMPORTANT?

To this question the voice of orthodoxy in this country answers, Yes. And it speaks in a very positive and emphatic tone. For example, an address on Sabbath observance, by the Rev. Alexander Allison, D. D., published in the Christian Endeavorer, for August 1896, makes this statement:

The home mission problem in all the denominations will be largely solved so soon as Sabbath laws are enforced. The Sabbath question is fundamental. It underlies everything. If the Sabbath goes, so does the church, the Bible, and the family. Who will dare to go to church or read the Bible if the Sabbath becomes a dead letter?

This is spoken from the standpoint of the Sabbath as a day to be enforced by human law. From this standpoint many like utterances have been made by religious teachers. There is practical unanimity in the sentiment that Sabbath observance is a matter vastly too important to be left unregulated by legislation. We are told that our "sabbath laws"

are good, that we ought to have more of them, and that what we have ought to be more strictly enforced.

And what do these "Sabbath laws" state? They state most explicitly that pursuits of business and pleasure must be laid aside on "the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday." This language contradicts that of the fourth commandment, which declares, "the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God; in it thou shalt not do any work."

But the advocates of these "Sabbath laws" can explain this discrepancy. The Lord, they say, was not particular about the day, and so left it to man to select any one day in seven, as might suit his inclination! "The seventh day" specified in God's Sabbath commandment does not mean the seventh day of the week, but simply a seventh day, that is, any seventh day after six days of work! Hence "the seventh day" may be "the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday," or any other day of the week as well, and the divine obligation of the Sabbath commandment may pertain to the first day of the week, or to any other day of the week!

Hence it may pertain to every day of the week, and the whole week may be a sabbath, without any distinction of sacred and secular days at all!

In other words, the Creator made the Sabbath, but as he did not specify the day of the week to be observed, bequeathed the Sabbath to man in such shape that it would destroy itself as soon as men should try to observe it!

And yet "the Sabbath question is fundamental; it underlies everything." Did the Creator know that the Sabbath was so important when he made it?

As a day to be enforced by human law, the Sabbath is of the greatest importance; but as a day commanded by God's law, it is not important enough to be specified in that law, or to demand observance upon any particular day of the week!

If the Sabbath is of such importance, why is it not important to observe the day specified as the Sabbath in the fourth commandment—namely, "the seventh day"?

That the Sabbath is of the utmost importance as an institution for the promotion of human welfare, is as certain as that the Word of God is true. Would that the people of this and every land might be so impressed with its importance in their relationship individually to their Creator, that they would not dare to deviate from his own explicit commandment concerning its observance, whatever might be the view set forth by tradition and the commandments of men.
