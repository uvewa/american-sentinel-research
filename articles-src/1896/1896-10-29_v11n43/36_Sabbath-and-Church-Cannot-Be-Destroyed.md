"DESTROY the Sabbath and you abolish the church," says the advocate of Sunday laws. But no man or organization of men can either destroy the Sabbath or the church. For fifty years the seventh-day Sabbath has been making steady headway against all opposition, and is to-day gaining ground more rapidly than ever, though contrary to the popular practice, and without the aid of a single human law, and even against that law in many places. What the Lord is back of, man cannot destroy; and if he is not back of a religious institution, the sooner it is destroyed the better.
