Arropos to our first-page article is this thought: It is contended by some that "the Christian being an ambassador for Christ can have no more part in the affairs of an earthly government than the English ambassador could have in the affairs of the United States." But to us it does not seem that the cases are at all parallel. The ambassador of Christ is not accredited to nations, but to individuals. His mission is not to induce men to turn from the governments of this world to God, but from Satan to God. Neither is it the business of an ambassador of an earthly government to induce men to transfer their allegiance from one government to another; but his business is to adjust differences between his government and that to which he is accredited, and to see that the rights of the citizens of his own government temporarily living under the government to which he is sent are protected. But surely the duty of the Christian is not to adjust differences between the governments of earth and the government of God. To so assert would be to deny the former proposition that the Christian could have nothing to do with the affairs of earthly governments. Neither can we believe that it is the duty of the Christian to concern himself chiefly with the rights of Christians as such. His mission is, preeminently, to beseech men to be reconciled to God.
