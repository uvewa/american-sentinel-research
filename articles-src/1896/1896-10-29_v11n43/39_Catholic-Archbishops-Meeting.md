The recent annual meeting of the Roman Catholic archbishops of the United States at Washington, D. C., was precluded by a statement issued by Cardinal Gibbons on the morning of 22nd inst., to the effect that the utmost harmony exists among their members, inclusive of the Catholic University directors, and there are absolutely no factional or sectional differences; adding: "The election of the candidates for the rectorship was practically unanimous. To speak of the triumph of this or that party, of conservatism or liberalism, Americanism or nationalism, is to entirely misrepresent the whole situation."

The cardinal added that "all the members are equally American in spirit;" which is not saying much, however, since Romanism is utterly opposed to the principles of free government.
