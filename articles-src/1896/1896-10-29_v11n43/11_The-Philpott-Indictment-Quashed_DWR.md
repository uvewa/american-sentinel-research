# THE PHILPOTT INDICTMENT QUASHED.

Murfreesboro, Tenn., Oct., 21, 1896.

**EDITOR SENTINEL:** The Philpott indictment was quashed this morning in short order. Whitaker & Sheaff, attorneys for the defendant, made the following plea:—

The defendant for plea says that the indictment pending against him in this county returned by the Grand Jury at the June term, 1896, of this court, charging that he, the said Philpott, "on the 15th day of March, 1896, and divers other days before the finding of this indictment in said county and State of Tennessee, did engage in farm work, viz., plowing, hauling manure, rendering it exceedingly unpleasant to reside in the community of the said Philpott, to the manifest corruption of public morals, and so as to become a public nuisance to a large body of citizens living in the community, against the peace and dignity of the State," is not a valid indictment for the reason that the name of Byron Freeman appearing thereon as prosecutor was not signed by said Byron Freeman, nor was the signature thereof with his name as such prosecutor authorized by him. Wherefore, said defendant avows that there is no prosecutor upon said indictment, and this he is ready to affirm, and he therefore prays that said alleged indictment be quashed.

SHEAFF & WHITAKER,
ALEXANDER PHILPOTT.

Alexander Philpott makes oath that the matter and things alleged in his plea are true in substance and facts, to the best of his information and belief.

The State for plea joins issue on the above plea.

Mr. Freeman was then put on the stand and testified that he did not sign the indictment, nor did he authorize anyone to sign it for him; that the Grand Jury summoned him to appear before them, and he testified that he had seen Mr. Philpott at work on Sundays, and had signed his name to his testimony only, and that he was not prosecutor in the case. The judge at first suggested that he would make the attorney-general prosecutor ex-officio and proceed with the case, but Attorney Sheaff argued against this procedure, and the judge held the indictment void and ordered the case thrown out of court. The court said that through "mistake" Freeman's name had been used as prosecutor instead of the proper prosecutor; but it is very evident that the Grand Jury proposed to make Freeman prosecutor in the absence of any other, whether he so desired or not. They exercised inquisitorial power in the sphere prohibited by the law of Tennessee in securing evidence, and were compelled to find a prosecutor to cover up their illegal procedure. No doubt this is not the first case of this kind in the history of persecution of Sabbatarians in this State.

The people at large in this community are opposed to the proceedings against Seventh-day Adventists and it is hoped that this will end further trouble for the present, at least.
