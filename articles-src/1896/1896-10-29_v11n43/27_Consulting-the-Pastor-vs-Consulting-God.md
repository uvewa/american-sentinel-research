"EVERY Christian Endeavor plan begins by consulting the pastor," is a suggestion made by the Philadelphia Union to local societies. It is well enough to consult the pastor, but we would suggest that every genuinely Christian plan of work begins by consulting God. There is a world of significance in the fact that Christian people to-day are so much more ready to take counsel of the pastor than of God's Word.
