# THE "CHRISTIAN STATE" AND HERESY.

The "Christian State" which it is the aim of the "Christian Endeavor" and kindred movements to set up in these United States, will, if it is realized, be supported upon the same principle as is the Roman Catholic "Christian" State in South America; and this being so, it is wholly inconsistent for the advocates of "Christian" civil government in this country to take exception to that which is done in South American republics, and which the maintenance of that form of government logically demands. The following note from the Catholic Review, of October 17, is to the point in this connection:—

"No ecclesiastic in this country," says the Independent, "believes that the State has a right to confiscate religious books and burn them; yet that is just what was done, not many months ago, by the Peruvian authorities, on the express request of the Roman Catholic priests, with some Bibles and hymn books."

The fallacy in that statement lies in the adjective "religious." Substitute for it "heretical," which exactly characterizes the books from the Peruvian point of view, and some ecclesiastic in this country will believe that the State there is justified in destroying them. The condition of separation between religion and the public life of the nation, desirable as it is in some respects under the circumstances of a thousand and one creeds in our beloved Republic, is not the highest and best. The Christian State is the ideal government.

The Independent, in its Christian moments, recognizes this truth, for it lands the members of the Christian Endeavor societies for promoting Christian citizenship, so it insists on the duty of following the obligations of morality in finance, etc. The kingdom of Christ should come to nations as well as to individuals. Granted, then, a Christian State, as Peru ought to be but is not, and it has more right to protect its inhabitants from heretical doctrines than it has to defend them from an importation of cholera or smallpox.

Roman Catholics as well as misguided Protestants believe in the "Christian State" as being the "ideal government." And they have the same rights which Protestants have. If Protestants in this country have the right to set up a "Christian State," Roman Catholics have the same right in Ecuador and Peru. The principle is the same in each case, namely, that the majority, who rule in the government, have the right to make that government a "Christian" one. That their own conceptions of Christianity will govern them in the matter is of course perfectly patent. And whether these conceptions are right or not, is not a question which touches the principle upon which the idea of the "Christian State" depends for justification. The question of rights has nothing to do with the question whether people are mistaken or not in their religious belief. An individual has as much right to be a Roman Catholic as he has to be a Protestant. He may be honest and sincere in becoming either. If he fails in any duty covered by his relation to God, that is a matter to which God himself will attend.

The Peruvian authorities, therefore, if the "Christian State" theory be a just one, had a right to seize and burn what they deemed to be heretical books; and in condemning them for this action, the advocates of "Christian citizenship" condemn the bridge on which they stand themselves. Would that they might at once abandon it after having thus pronounced it unsound.
