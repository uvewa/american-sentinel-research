"PORRY is the religion of human nature." It is human nature to ask, rather than to search; to get things in an easy way, rather than in a way which requires persistent effort; to ask the pastor or the priest what is right and what is true, than to drive the mines of spiritual truth contained in the Scripture. It is human nature to be impressed by outward show more than by unseen principles of truth. It is human nature to reverence some visible man more than the unseen God.
