A DETROIT (Mich.) journal of recent date reports that considerable stir is being made among tax payers in that city by the introduction into the public schools of the new book of selected Bible readings, compiled by a committee in Chicago, consisting of a Jew, a Protestant, and a Roman Catholic. The readings are in use in the schools of Chicago and are designed for general use throughout the land. They recognize the Deity, and to a limited extent, Jesus Christ. The book has received the endorsement of many prominent men in religious and educational circles.
