ROMAN CATHOLICS claim the apostle Peter as the first pope, and the "Christian Endeavor" organizations can with greater truth lay claim to him as the first one who sought to give practical effect to the doctrine for which they stand. Peter and John and other disciples were with the Lord at the sea of Galilee, after his resurrection, and as Peter was following the Lord, after the latter had given him instruction to "feed my sheep," he turned and saw "the disciple whom Jesus loved following." "Peter seeing him saith to

Jesus, Lord, and what shall this man do? Jesus saith unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? follow thou me." This cured Peter of the notion that it might be any part of his business to direct other people in religious matters. It taught him that Christian endeavor was simply following in the footsteps of his Lord. Would that all the professed followers of Christ to-day who are so anxious to make laws to regulate the religious conduct of others, might endeavor more earnestly to conform their own walk to the example and precepts of Christ, instead of endeavoring to make others conform to their ideas. Christian endeavor which is truly such cannot mean coercion.
