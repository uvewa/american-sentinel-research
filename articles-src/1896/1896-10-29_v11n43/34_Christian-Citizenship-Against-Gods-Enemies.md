The gospel is the wisdom of God embodied in a plan to win back the human enemies of Christ to a state of loyalty to him. Therefore a summons sent forth "in the name of the Lord of hosts," "to the followers of Christ, to unite against his enemies," is not a summons to gospel work, but to the opposite of that work. God and Christ are not "against" their enemies, as the representatives of the "Christian citizenship" idea would teach by their "summons" to Christ's followers. "For God so loved the world [his enemies] that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life." John 3:16. And "God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." Romans 5:8. Those who unite in a confederacy now against the enemies of Christ, or those whom they may deem such, may rest assured that they are working at cross purposes with the world's Redeemer.
