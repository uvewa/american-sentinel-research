What our country needs is not the enthronement of Christ in political parties or in the civil government, but his enthronement in the hearts of individual citizens. "The kingdom of God is within you." The body is the temple of God, and the heart is his throne. The kingdom is now the "kingdom of grace." It will not be the kingdom of glory on this earth until Christ comes in glory to set it up, and the new Jerusalem, its capital, descends in glory from God out of heaven, as set forth in Rev. 21:2, 10, 11.
