A "LORD's day bicycle pledge" is being circulated among religious users of the wheel, and is obtaining numerous signatures. It binds the signer not to "use the bicycle on the Lord's day to attend meets, runs, or races; nor for mere pleasure riding, nor in such a way as to interfere with public quiet, personal rest, and divine worship."
