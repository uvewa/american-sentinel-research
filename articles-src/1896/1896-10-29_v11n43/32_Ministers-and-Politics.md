The New York Observer, of October 15, asserts that "ministers can so live and so preach that their utterances, even on the eve of a presidential campaign, may influence votes, and yet not be partisan." This is evidently what a large number of clergymen in some sections of this country have been trying to do for a number of weeks past, without, however, being able in any case to demonstrate its possibility. They have, however, one and all, demonstrated the unfitness of political issues as a theme for what purports to be Christian discourse. The clergyman cannot preach politics without becoming partisan; and in so doing he favors a party which Christianity does not recognize, and recognizes a distinction of which Christianity knows nothing. The only parties in the world which Christianity recognizes are, the sinners, and the righteous; and as a preacher of the gospel, no man can rightfully recognize any others.
