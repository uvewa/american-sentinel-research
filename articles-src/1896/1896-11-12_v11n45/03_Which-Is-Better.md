WHICH IS BETTER?

A LEADING organ of the movement for enforced Sunday observance, the Christian Statesman, states in its issue for October 24, that it would regard a first-day sabbath as better than none at all, even from the standpoint of those who are firmly convinced that the fourth commandment requires the observance of the seventh day and not the first.

It believes that seventh-day observers should therefore work for the establishment of the first-day institution, in harmony with those who believe it to have divine sanction, as a more desirable alternative than that which seems to be the only other, namely, no Sabbath at all.

It says further, by way of illustration, "If we were dwelling in a Jewish country, in which, as in the days of Nehemiah, the seventh-day Sabbath was being enforced, we would feel under obligation to give our public influence in favor of such governmental action, as against Sabbath desecration, even if we were as thoroughly convinced in that case as we are now that the first day is the Sabbath of our risen Lord. We would maintain our personal right to keep the Christian Sabbath holy, but we would recognize the right of that Jewish people to interpret the divine law of the Sabbath according to their conviction, and to enforce the observance of the day by their governmental action. And for us to oppose this Jewish nation in so doing, and attempt to break the force of their Sabbath law, would be to put ourselves on the side of lawlessness and anarchy in that country."

The fallacy of this position is shown by the fact that the Sabbath must, by its very nature, be limited to one definite day of the week.

There could not be two weekly Sabbaths in the same week, each of divine appointment. To establish such an arrangement would be to destroy the Sabbath altogether, since in that case the Sabbath day would not be set apart from the other days of the week, as God has set it apart. "Six days shall thou labor and do all thy work, but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God," is language which draws a distinction between the Sabbath day and all other days of the week. And this distinction the Creator established by his own example, in working six days and resting on the seventh. The divine arrangement is, six working days in every week, and one day, the seventh, set apart from them as the rest day. Hence, we repeat, there cannot possibly be two Sabbaths of divine appointment in the same week.

To recognize two Sabbaths in the same week, therefore, is to recognize no Sabbath at all. To attempt to establish two weekly Sabbaths is to attempt to break down the one Sabbath. To support one of two weekly Sabbaths is to work against the other.

Were seventh-day observers to support the first-day Sabbath, they would work directly against the day which they believe to have been set apart by divine sanction. And were first-day observers to lend their support to the seventh day institution, they would soon discover that they were making no progress toward the realization of their scheme of universal Sunday observance.

The adherents of Sunday are strenuous for Sunday, and that day only; so much so that they demand laws to compel every individual to rest on that particular day, whether he believes in and observes another day or not. They are constantly advising seventh-day observers, however, not to be so particular about the day.

Those who understand the evil of a union of Church and State, however, whether observers of the seventh day or of the first, would not be willing that the observance of any day shall be enforced by human law, even were there no dispute concerning which day is divinely sanctioned. In Nehemiah's time Sabbath observance was not enforced by human law, but by God's law, for God governed in civil affairs by his prophets, and the people were not makers of their laws at all. The laws which governed in that time were given by the Lord to Moses, and not one of them was the product of human legislation. There was never a time in the world's history when human legislation in religious matters had the sanction of God.

While there are in every heart, to a greater or less extent, the principles of right and justice implanted by the Creator, which are good independently of any religion one may profess, we believe it to be also true that a false religion is worse than no religion at all; since it is not only valueless, apart from the good principles of the individual, which have really no connection with it, but it deceives its possessor and lures him on to ruin. A false religious observance, made in the name of Christianity, is a worse insult to God than no observance at all. And every religious observance not made in faith is a false observance; for "whatever is not of faith is sin." Rom. 14:23. And faith cannot be supplied by legislation. A forced observance of the Sabbath is only sin. The movement to enforce Sabbath observance is in its true character a movement to multiply sin. 8.
