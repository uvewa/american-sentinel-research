"CHRISTIANS DISFRANCHISED."

UNDER this heading a Western journal makes mention of a recent sermon by Rev. F. M. Foster, of the Third Reformed Presbyterian Church, New York City, in which the proper attitude of Christians toward the elective franchise under our present Government was defined from the Reformed Presbyterian standpoint. We quote:—

"It is the duty of the Christians to refuse to swear allegiance to the constitution of a government which does not recognize the authority of Almighty God," said he.

Mr. Foster said that the laws of God are broken every Sunday by the Government, and as an example he cited that "the Government will admit into the service of the post-office department only those who will swear that they will violate the fourth commandment and keep the office open on the holy day.

"The candidate for office must, according to the Constitution, swear that he will uphold the laws which contradict the laws of God. The Christian loyal to Christ cannot take such oath, or if he does, he becomes a sharer in all the wickedness which is fostered and protected by this Government. As all candidates must take this oath the Christian citizen is debarred from voting on the principle that he cannot ask another what he might not do himself.

"The Christian citizen cannot vote, because the Constitution does not require God's qualifications for official trust. Moral qualifications are required in the office bearer."

As is well known, however, the especial aim of the Reformed Presbyterian Church is to so remodel this Government that it will "recognize the authority" of God in its Constitution, and enforce the law of God in its legislation. But this cannot be done even in theory except through the expressed will of the people; and that will must be expressed by the ballot. Refusing to act the part of citizens themselves, they yet seek nothing short of the complete revolution of the Government from a Republic to a man-made theocracy; and they are forced to occupy the rather anomalous position of asking others to do what they say it is not right to do, in order that this change may be made. However, this party have never been backward about petitioning Congress and other legislative bodies to vote for the measures which embody their hopes. They are more than willing to make full use of the office and office-holder which exist under our present "godless" Government. And should their scheme of government come to be submitted to the choice of the people, it would surprise us if they were not found as willing and anxious to vote as any others.

It should be noted, also, that a Republican form of government is the only one under which the act of voting can be necessary or even proper; for under a theocracy, civil as well as religious affairs are administered by the Lord, through his ministers, and not by the people at all. There has never been a government in existence whose civil affairs were sought to be administered according to the law of God, where the people exercised the function of voting. God's will is expressed in his Word; his laws are there stated, and cannot be changed. And it would only remain for the people, under a civil government founded upon those laws, to be governed by those laws according as clerical authority might construe them, instead of choosing their own officials and legislating for themselves.
