# NEWS AND NOTES.

An Italian named Guari was stabbed to death a few days since in New York City by a fellow Italian for having insulted a picture of the Madonna.

An effort is being made to inaugurate Sunday afternoon concerts in Carnegie Hall, Pittsburgh. The authorities having the matter in hand are waiting for a fuller expression of public sentiment.

The law passed by the last Florida legislature, making it a crime in that State to teach whites and negroes together, has been declared unconstitutional by Judge Call, on the technical ground that the title of the bill is not broad enough to cover its contents.

The Christian Statesman, of October 31, is authority for the following: "The support given by Archbishop Ireland in so marked a manner to the Republican party is the reward for the striking out from the platform of the St. Louis convention of the clause opposing the use of public money for sectarian purposes and the union of Church and State. It will be remembered that this clause was stricken out because of a telegram signed, John Ireland."
