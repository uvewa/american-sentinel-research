## THE PRESIDENT'S CALL TO WORSHIP.

The President of the United States has issued to the people of the nation the customary annual Thanksgiving proclamation, which we print in another column. The day designated is Thursday, November 26.

"On that day," speaks the proclamation, "may all our people forego their usual work and occupation, and, assembled in their accustomed places of worship, let them with one accord render thanks to the Ruler of the Universe for our preservation as a nation and our deliverance from every threatened danger; for the peace that has dwelt within our boundaries, for our defense against disease and pestilence during the year that has passed, for the plenteous rewards that have followed the labors of our husbandmen, and for all other blessings that have been vouchsafed to us."

It may not be out of place to call attention to a lack of definiteness in the proclamation which would, were all whom it addresses to observe it, lead to uncontemplated results.

The proclamation does not specify the being who is to be recognized as the "Ruler of the Universe," and, as is well known, the various nationalities and classes which compose the nation are by no means in agreement on this point. Nor is any particular religious class or order of people specified, but the proclamation is to all citizens alike.

Therefore, by order of this proclamation, let the Chinese citizen on the specified day repair to his "accustomed place of worship," and there burn incense to Joss, offer the customary libations and present the tributes of rice, etc., by which he believes the blessings of this life to be secured. Let those who know no god but nature, repair to the groves or the hills or whatever place they may deem suitable, and there worship the mysterious life principle by which all things have, in their view, been evolved from the primordial condition into their present state. Let the Jews assemble in the synagogue and worship as the ruler of the universe a being who has no son Jesus Christ. Let the Spiritualists assemble in grand seance and hold communion with the "spirits of the departed." Let Roman Catholics give thanks to the various "saints" whom they recognize as the dispensers of temporal blessings, and rejoice in the inroads of the papacy upon Protestantism. And let the various Protestant sects, and others not here named, whose membership is composed of American citizens, worship the Ruler of the Universe in accordance with the conceptions of their respective creeds.

Of course, the President could not have confined his proclamation to one class of worshipers, or have discriminated in it between the various sects. He was bound to be impartial; and a summons to most incongruous proceedings was the result.

We have no objection to thanksgiving on the part of any in recognition of divine mercies and blessings; we believe nothing can be more profitable on any day than to "bless the Lord," and "forget not all his benefits." But from the considerations above presented, we think it must be evident that to assume the role of "priest of the white house"—as R. Fay Mills puts it—or pontifex maximus of the American nation, can be no proper part of the functions of the chief executive's office.
