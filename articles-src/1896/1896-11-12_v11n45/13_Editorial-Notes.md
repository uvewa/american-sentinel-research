"It is said," remarks the Western Watchman (Roman Catholic), "that Princess Victoria, of Wales, is determined to become a nun."

Now that the election is over look out for an assault "all along the line" by the so-called "Christian Citizenship" forces upon Congress and State legislatures, in the interests of religious legislation.

Read the advertisement on the preceding page of the new tract, "Fighting Against God," by A. F. Ballenger. This is one of the very best and most attractive of our Religious Liberty tracts. It ought to have an extensive circulation.

Do not fail to read the article, "A case of Religious Persecution," on page 358. The writer, H. L. Wayland, D. D., of Philadelphia, is a prominent Baptist, and one of the editorial staff of *The Examiner and National Baptist*. His love for religious liberty is inherited from his noble father, whose name is honored by Baptists everywhere.

It seems that the papal authorities in this country are seriously contemplating the contingency of a withdrawal of government aid from their Indian schools. At a recent meeting of Catholic archbishops in Washington, D. C., says the Catholic Review of November 7, this matter was considered; but what plans were laid to prevent it have not been made public. "It is possible," says the Review, "that the withdrawal of government aid will make necessary the abandonment of a number of our institutions for the aborigines."

We wish to direct special attention to the article on page 356, "The Church and Civil Power." The writer clearly shows that the theocracy of Israel was simply the Jewish church clothed with civil power, and that that power was taken away from the church never more to be restored, until "He come whose right it is."

A point hinted at, but worthy of more space than the writer has devoted to it, is the influence of the rulers of Israel to lead the people into sin. A true theocracy is a government in which God rules through chosen representatives. Even in Israel it was too often true that the rule was not God's but man's, for in reality the rule was administered by men only professing to represent God, but really representing their own selfish interests or personal ambition. But because they were nominally God's representatives and ruled in the name of God, the people looked to them to know the will of God; and because they were regarded as God's representatives their power to lead people into sin was much greater than it would otherwise have been.

The same is true to-day. Men who assume divine authority to keep men from sin certainly have more power when they go wrong to lead people into sin than those who make no such profession; and were the State to assume the prerogative of keeping men from sin, its power to lead men into sin would be thereby increased to the full extent of the confidence of the people in its pretended commission as a moral guardian.

## Prays They May Be Converted.

Rome is pursuing toward Rev. James O'Connor, of this city, the tactics which she usually pursues toward those priests who renounce Romanism and become Protestants. The Western Watchman, of October 29, published the following:

O'Connor, who has maintained a refuge for apostate priests in New York for years, has been adjudged insane, and is now in an asylum in Ohio. We said fifteen years ago that the poor man was out of his head. Most of his unhappy wards are doing penance in monasteries in different parts of the country. Will Protestants ever learn that an educated Catholic is inconvertible?

Having seen and talked with Mr. O'Connor only a few weeks previous to seeing the above paragraph, we were morally certain that he was not an inmate of an asylum; but to make assurance doubly sure, we sent him the clipping, together with a note of inquiry concerning the matter, and received from him the following letter written with his own hand:

Christ's Mission, 142 West 21st Street,
New York, Nov. 6, 1896.

Mr. C. P. Bollman—Dear Brother: Please accept my thanks for the clipping from the St. Louis Watchman, which in an editorial note says I am in an insane asylum in Ohio.

The editor of that Roman Catholic paper, Rev. D. S. Phelan, is a sad rogue. He avers that he said fifteen years ago that "the poor man [O'Connor] was out of his head." Of course, Father Phelan's story is an unmitigated falsehood. Thank God, I am not in an asylum, and never was, but am busy at work in our Christ's Mission for the conversion of Catholics at the above address, which you have often visited with pleasure to us all.

By a remarkable coincidence, I had published in my *Converted Catholic*, for October, an article of four pages, entitled, "Roman Catholic Partners of the Father of Lies," wherein the slanders and calumnies of priests and Roman Catholic editors like Phelan regarding converted Catholics were exposed.

It has been my privilege to welcome fifty priests out of the church of Rome and to lead thousands of Roman Catholics to a knowledge of the truth as it is in Jesus during the last eighteen years that I have been an evangelical pastor and editor in this city. Hence the wrath of the pope's agents.

The bishops, priests and editors began their malignant attacks against me sixteen years ago, and, I suppose, they will keep them up until they are converted. They have said that I had retired from this work and gone into a monastery to do penance for my sin in saying that the pope was the antichrist, and now, after many years, they say I am in an insane asylum. Last year they said that Father Lambert, the distinguished Redemptorist priest, who was converted at our Christ's Mission in March, 1894, was also an inmate of an asylum. The very day that falsehood was published he was in my home preparing to go to Kingston, Jamaica, W. I., where he is now pastor of Coke Wesleyan Church.

They have made similar mendacious statements regarding Father Chiniquy, Miss Cusack, "The Nun of Kenmare," and every other prominent converted Catholic in this country and Europe. Men who would deliberately lie about the living would not scruple to misinterpret and misquote the Scriptures and falsify and forge documents to sustain their claims to the primacy and supremacy of their church.

The secular reader might ask, Why does not Mr. O'Connor sue these infamous falsifiers for libel? From a legal point of view an action could be sustained, but I am so busy trying to convert those priests and their poor deluded victims, that I really have not time to bring them into the courts of this world. My prayer is that they may be converted to Christ, when their pens and lips, as well as their hearts, will be clean.

Sincerely yours,
James A. O'Connor.

We cannot speak too highly of the work which Mr. O'Connor is doing in this city, and are glad that he does not resort to the courts for vindication from the attacks of Rome. Let him that suffers as a Christian not be ashamed; but let him remember that "God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in time of trouble." Christ never sued his enemies for slander, and they not only charged that he was "beside himself," but they said "He hath a devil." "It is enough that the servant be as his Master."

"The missionaries have got into trouble again down in Peru," says a Catholic paper, and adds: "It seems they persist in preaching to people who do not want to hear them. Why do they not shake the dust of Peru off their feet and come home?"

The real difficulty in Peru is that Romanism is the established religion, and Protestantism receives scant toleration. It is not that all the people do not want to hear, but that the priests of Rome don't want any of the people to hear, and use their power and influence to prevent it.
