## THE CHURCH AND CIVIL POWER.

### BY A. F. BALLINGER.

In the days of the kings of Israel and Judah the Lord permitted his church to rule in civil things. Twelve of the twenty rulers of Judah and all of the nineteen rulers of Israel used that civil power to compel the people to violate the commandments of God. Jeroboam, first king of Israel, made two golden calves, "and he set one in Bethel and the other set he in Dan." 1 Kings 12:28. He then ordered the people to sacrifice to these idols, saying to them, "It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem: behold thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt."

Speaking of this, the inspired record says: "Jeroboam drove Israel from following the Lord, and made them sin a great sin." Over and over again it is said of Jeroboam's successors, that they "walked in the way of Jeroboam . . and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin." At length the Lord took away the civil power from Israel and made them subjects of the heathen kingdom of Assyria.

The Lord bore longer with the kings of Judah. But a majority of them were like Manassah, of whom it is recorded that he "made Judah also to sin with his idols." 2 Kings 20:11. The civil power continued to be used to make the people sin until the reign of Zedekiah, when the Lord decreed through the prophet Ezekiel, that the civil supremacy that he had permitted his church to exercise should be wrested from it, and his people made subject to heathen nations. The words addressed by the Lord to Zedekiah are, "And thou, profane wicked prince of Israel, whose day is come, when iniquity shall have an end, thus saith the Lord God: Remove the diadem, and take off the crown: this shall not be the same: exalt him that is low, and abase him that is high. I will overturn, overturn, overturn it: and it shall be no more, until he come whose right it is; and I will give it him." Eze. 21:25-27.

The long history of misrule and misuse of civil power is briefly told in 2 Chron. 36:14-16, as follows: "Moreover all the chief of the priests, and the people, transgressed very much after all the abominations of the heathen; and polluted the house of the Lord which he had hallowed at Jerusalem. And the Lord God of their fathers sent to them by his messengers, rising up berimes, and sending; because he had compassion on his people, and on his dwellingplace: but they mocked the messengers of God, and despised his words, and misused his prophets, until the wrath of the Lord arose against his people, and there was no remedy."

Thus it is seen that the Lord took the civil supremacy away from the church and made his people subject to heathen nations. He decreed that his church should never more be trusted with civil power; thus in effect declaring that heathen nations were better qualified to justly administer civil authority than was the fickle, backsliding church.

The wisdom of God in taking the civil supremacy from his church, was shown in the fact that his prophets and his people suffered less at the hands of heathen nations than at the hands of their own rulers. Had Israel been possessed of civil supremacy at the time of Christ, both Christ and his apostles would have been destroyed before they were. Pilate, the Roman governor, was more humane than the church leaders, and the whole history of Christianity proves that when the professed Christian church has sought and secured civil supremacy it has used that supremacy to oppress mankind.

Doubtless some in Israel were amazed that God would take the civil supremacy from his church and give it into the hands of those who were not of his church. Doubtless the church doubted the power of God to rule in the kingdom of men. Notwithstanding its long period of misrule it still believed itself better qualified than God to rule the nations. This is certainly true to-day. The larger portion of the professed Christian church to-day is clamoring for civil supremacy, notwithstanding the fact that the history of the civil rule of the professed Christian church is one long story of cruelty.

The objection will be offered that the misrule arose from the fact that the "professed" Christian church ruled instead of the true church. If the true church should rule it would be otherwise. The reply to this is, first, that since the Lord has taken the civil supremacy from his church, and decreed that it shall exercise it no more,—that it shall not be exercised again until Christ comes to exercise it himself, it follows that any church that seeks this forbidden power, by that very act ceases to be the true church. Again, it is impossible for the true church to attain civil supremacy because the true church will always be too few to obtain it.

Christ said, "Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat: because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it." Matt. 7:13, 14. "Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom." Luke 12:32.

Not only was the true church to be numerically few, but it was to be unpopular. "If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you. If ye were of the world, the world would love his own; but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hate you." John 15:18, 19.

Not only was the true church to be few in number and unpopular, but it was to be per-cuted. "Remember the word that I said unto you, The servant is not greater than his Lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also." John 15:20. "Yea. and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution." 2 Tim. 3:12. "And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ." Rev. 12:17.

How would it be possible for an unpopular, persecuted, minority to gain control of the civil governments of earth? Manifestly not until it ceased to be unpopular, ceased to be persecuted and ceased to be in the minority. But when the church is unpopular no more, when it is persecuted no more, when it is no more in the minority, it is no more the true church.

What the church needs to learn to-day is that "the Most High ruleth in the kingdom of men" (Dan. 4:25), that God has not committed to the church the control of earthly kingdoms. He will control these if he has to send angels to destroy their armies (2 Kings 19:35), and withstand their princes (Dan. 10:13), and divide their kingdoms (Dan. 5:28), as he has done and is doing to-day. Let the church have faith enough in the power of God to believe that he can control the governments of earth. Let it devote its energies to fulfilling its mission which is to preach the gospel, which is "the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth." "The Most High ruleth in the kingdom of men."
