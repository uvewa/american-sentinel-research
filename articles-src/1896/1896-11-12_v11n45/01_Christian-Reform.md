## CHRISTIAN REFORM.

CHRISTIAN reform is distinguished from all other methods of reform in its possession of and operation through the divine agency of faith in Jesus Christ.

This distinction is a vital one. It means that Christian reform not only operates through an agency infinitely above the human, but that its results differ as widely in character from those which the human agency can effect. It means the product of the wisdom and power of God in human life, as distinguished from that of the wisdom and power of man.

Yet this broad distinction is one which very many fail to perceive, even among those who profess to know the power of the life of faith. This failure has marked the reform efforts of nominally Christian men through many centuries. Spiritual reforms have been undertaken by carnal means, and "reforms," which are altogether visionary and without foundation in the purposes of God, are sought to be put into effect. This is what we see in the events now transpiring around us.

Christianity reforms the individual. It does this by eradicating the evil from his heart, putting upright desires and purposes in the place of all those which are carnal. And it deals with individuals only. Its mission is to every individual on the earth, and having gone to all those, it can go no further. It can do no more for a nation than it can do by transforming the lives of the individuals who compose the nation, as many of them as are willing to receive it.

Of late the idea has come to be advocated in religious reform circles that the mission of Christianity is to the nation as well as to the individual. At the recent international convention of Christian Endeavor this idea found free expression, and was heard with no appearance of dissent. The following extract from an address by Rev. J. T. McCrory, on that occasion, will serve as an illustration:—

There was a time, not so long ago either, when the Cross was viewed almost exclusively in reference to the salvation of the individual. We looked at Calvary amid the shadows of the awful day and heard the sweet assurance given by the suffering Saviour to the dying thief, "This day shalt thou be with me in paradise," and were disposed to conclude that the whole meaning of that mysterious and merciful sacrifice was summed up in the rescue of the individual sinner. We have taken that picture which brings tears to every eye that looks upon it, where the shipwrecked woman clings to the cross standing there upon the rock where heat the billows of an angry sea, while the broken vessel is dashed madly upon the shore, as the full representation of the saving purposes of the Son of man. But our conception of his work and mission has been mightily enlarged.

The conception now is, as the speaker proceeded to explain, that the mission of Christ is not only to save individuals, but to become enthroned "in our national life." The meaning of this phrase he made clear by referring to the action of the Pilgrim Fathers, who, "in the cabin of the Mayflower, entered into that solemn compact setting forth that they had undertaken that perilous voyage for the purpose of planting a colony for the glory of God and the advancement of the Christian faith, and pledging themselves to frame civil institutions with that end in view."

It was thus, he asserted, that "Christ got practically into our national life" in the time of those first settlers; and it is in a similar way that he is to be "enthroned in our national life" to-day.

But Christ cannot be truly enthroned in our national life while at the same time he is not enthroned in the hearts of the people composing the nation; and there is no power in civil enactments to enthrone Christ in the heart. Only the power of God through faith can accomplish that.

Reform by a change in the government, or through civil legislation, is of a different nature entirely from that individual heart reform which is necessary to an alliance with Christ.

Reform in the government, or in legislation, is accomplished by purely political means. Heart reform is accomplished only through individual acceptance of the sacrifice and merits of Jesus Christ.

The soul clinging to the cross in earnest faith amidst the raging floods of evil, makes an appropriate and beautiful picture; but a civil government clinging to the cross, would be a caricature having neither beauty nor meaning.

Civil governments do not cling; they do not trust. They are invested with power to act for themselves, and they exercise that power for the accomplishment of every purpose they are designed to serve.

Political reforms cannot go deep enough for the purposes of the gospel. Those purposes demand the reforming power of divine grace. The gospel invitation is to all individuals on the earth. The Spirit of God strives with every one, bidding each one walk in the light, be it greater or less, which God has given him; and whosoever will do this, will experience that reform which touches the fountain head of every thought and act. Nothing short of this will fit the heart to be the throne of Christ.

Hence what the grace of God through the gospel cannot do toward the enthronement of Christ, cannot possibly be accomplished by any means whatever; for no other means of reform deals so thoroughly with a nation as to touch and affect the heart of every individual in it. The reforming power of civil legislation can certainly not succeed where grace fails. It cannot touch the heart at all. It is utterly useless and can have no mission at all in respect to those reforms contemplated by the gospel.

More than this, these two reforming powers cannot be directed toward the accomplishment of the same purpose without antagonizing each other. The effort to enthrone Christ in our national life by civil legislation not only can do nothing to further the work of divine grace upon the heart, but must come into conflict with it.

This becomes evident when we consider the nature of civil government. In that government all are represented who are citizens under it. In its decisions each one must acquiesce, whatever may be his own political convictions. The deciding element is simply the will of the majority.

But in religious conduct the only proper authority is the Word of God. And this Word, in order to control the conduct, must be received in faith, and this means the full consent of the individual will to God's will. Hence when civil government undertakes to regulate religious conduct, the will of the majority is substituted for the will of God as revealed in his Word, the individual will is ignored, and a conflict between the two forces working for the reform of the individual is inevitable.

If he admits the right of the civil power to legislate in religious matters, he must let the will of the majority rule, and the grace of God, which is seeking the consent of his own will in order that he may be led by faith, must be ignored. If he yields to the grace of God, he does so by the exercise of his own will, and not by the will of the majority.

Such is true Christian reform, as distinguished from reform by civil enactments. It is true Christian reform—individual heart reform wrought by the power of divine grace—that our country needs. The disease whose symptoms are manifest in the moral corruption seen on every hand, is one which no human power can remedy. It is the old, old trouble that has afflicted the human race since the fall—carnality. Civil legislation can at best touch but the symptoms, and these only in a superficial way. It is dangerous to rely upon a treatment which deals only with the symptoms, and especially so when the treatment is such as will aggravate the disease itself.

Let Christ be enthroned in the hearts of the people by the reforming power of faith. Only where faith is, can the throne of Christ be set up. Faith, and not legislation, inaugurates His reign.
