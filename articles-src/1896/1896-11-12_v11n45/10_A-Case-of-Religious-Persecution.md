## A CASE OF RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION.

*[H. L. Wayland, D. D., in N. Y. Independent, Nov. 5.]*

The only safety for religious liberty lies in the absolute and entire severance of Church from State. The disposition to persecute seems inherent in human nature. Archbishop Whately once quoted the nursery rhyme,—

"Upstairs, downstairs, in a lady's chamber,
Find an old man there who won't say his prayers,
Take him by the left leg and throw him downstairs."

and added the comment: "See in these lines, dating back from time immemorial, the antiquity of religious persecution and the inveterate disposition of mankind toward it." The comment (like the same author's "Historic Doubts as to the Existence of Napoleon Bonaparte") was both witty and forcible.

Men love to persecute; they will persecute if they get the chance. The only way to avoid the extreme of persecution is to guard against its beginnings.

Recently three Christian ministers of the Seventh-day Adventist denomination held meetings in Kent County, Ontario. Their success aroused the jealousy of members of other denominations, and a society was formed to watch them, which reported that they had been seen laboring on Sunday, putting up a meeting house for their denomination. It was not pretended that anyone was disturbed by their labors; but a complaint was entered. The Queen's Counsel held that the law in the case was not clear. Justice Forham refused to issue a summons, saying that, sooner than do so, he would resign his office. At last a compliant magistrate was found. The law forbade men to "exercise their ordinary calling." It was urged in defense that slacking lime and mixing mortar were not the "ordinary calling" of these ministers; but this ground was overruled. The defense urged the proclamation of Queen Victoria, 1858, as follows:—

Firmly relying ourselves on the truth of Christianity, and acknowledging with gratitude the solace of religion, we disclaim alike the right and the desire to impose our convictions on any of our subjects. We declare it to be our royal will and pleasure that none be in any wise favored, none molested or disquieted, by reason of their religious faith or observance, but that they shall alike enjoy the equal and impartial protection of the law; and we do strictly charge and enjoin all those who may be in authority under us that they abstain from all interference with the religious belief or worship of any of our subjects, on pain of our highest displeasure.

But this royal proclamation the magistrate promptly waived aside as not applying. The defense urged this very strong ground, which we have never seen taken before: God commanded men to sanctify the seventh day. In the belief of the defendants this command has never been modified. In giving to the first day the same honor with that given to the seventh day, they believe that they would be robbing the divinely appointed Sabbath of its preeminence. But all was vain. The magistrate convicted them and sentenced them to fines of $10 and $15 respectively, with costs, and, in default of payment, to serve out their sentence in jail at 25 cents a day.

An appeal was taken to the higher court, and the case was argued before Chief Justice Meredith and two associate justices. The judgment of the lower court was affirmed, but without costs, which leaves the costs to be paid by the prosecutors. This action of the Supreme Court was equivalent to saying that the Court considered that the case was one of petty persecution, and, while the prosecutors had a legal right to carry on the case, they must do it at their own expense.

The Chief Justice added: "We think there is evidence by which we might have come to another conclusion had the case been before us at the first." But the sentence remained in force. Two of the ministers served their time in the Chatham jail; the third, for some reason, has not yet been imprisoned.

Will not all friends of religious liberty in the Province of Ontario and the Dominion of Canada proclaim the great principle which forbids persecution for religion's sake and which refrains the State from enforcing religious observances?

There is a lesson here worthy of being heeded, at a time when excellent but misguided men are advocating an amendment to our National Constitution by which God shall be recognized as Ruler of the universe, and the Lord Jesus Christ as King among the nations. It will hardly be claimed that its advocates mean it as anything more than a form of words. They do not intend to disfranchise the Jew, the Unitarian, the Agnostic, the non-Christian; but, if the amendment is not to mean what it says, why say it? If, however, the amendment is to mean anything, then it may be made the cover of just such persecution as has been above described. The amendment is either futile or oppressive.
