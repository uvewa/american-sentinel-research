A CORRECTION BY A CHICAGO ATTORNEY.

University of Chicago,
Nov. 1, 1896.

EDITOR AMERICAN SENTINEL:

The statement is inadvertently made in your issue of the 29th ult. that "the new book of selected Bible readings compiled by a committee in Chicago, consisting of a Jew, of a Protestant, and of a Roman Catholic, . . are in use in the schools of Chicago, and are designed for general use throughout the land." It is true that they were prepared for general use and were intended for use in the public schools of Chicago as well as elsewhere, but it is not true that they are now in use in this city. An attempt was made to introduce them here which met with such a determined opposition on the part of the friends of religious liberty, that the matter was temporarily dropped. Chicago has gained two victories during the past year for religious freedom: one was in killing this measure and the other was in getting the Illinois Sunday law declared unconstitutional.

**ADDISON BLAKELY.**
