## HOW RELIGION MIXES WITH POLITICS.

"RELIGION in politics" has been quite conspicuous throughout the country during the last two or three months. A general view of the manifestations in this line and the attending results is sufficient to fill with dismay the clearer and more consecutive intellects even among those who do not favor the divorce of religion from the civil power, and to call forth from them strong expressions of disapproval. Upon this point the following words from the New York Christian Advocate, of October 29, are worthy of note:—

The campaign differs in several respects from others in the debasing of the more sacred parts of the Holy Scriptures to the purposes of invective, satire, and caricature. At its first appearance the Christian Advocate, of July 16, thus referred to it:—

"In every political campaign the Scriptures come into use for purposes of illustration, and nothing seems to strike the popular mind and, if properly turned, fire the popular heart more promptly than a Scripture figure. Balaam and the ass, Samson and the Philistines, David and Goliath, Daniel, Jonah in the whale's belly, the save of Aduliam and the discontented that have gone down there, and Judas himself frequently appear. Ananias, of course, at times takes high rank.

"We do not object to the use of these Scripture characters for purposes of illustration in secular spheres, but when our Lord is made to serve such purposes reverence and good taste alike are shocked.

Some speakers have reached the verge of blasphemy by following our Lord into the Garden of Gethsemane and quoting his words upon the cross.

"Ministers who take the stump are more likely than others to fall into this habit."

This, we regret to say, has been more than fulfilled. There lies upon our table a paper of a certain political party with a cut representing the United States under the figure of "Uncle Sam" as being crucified between two thieves, and the scriptural account of the crucifixion of the Saviour of mankind is followed out in all its particulars.

Not only have the parables of our Lord been travested and every possible reference made, and a shocking paraphrase of the Lord's Prayer printed, but members of another political party who have denounced such proceedings have themselves plunged as deep into the pestilential mire as the others who sought to serve their ends by such blasphemies as have been here mentioned.

Within the last ten days a leading paper published a contribution in which a man is represented as confessing that he committed "the sin against the Holy Ghost" by voting for James Buchanan, and did not intend to repeat it now by voting for one of the candidates in the present struggle.

## THE PULPIT AS A STUMP.

Few ebullitions of extravagance upon the stump surpass those that have been uttered in some pulpits. While a profane picture shocks the mind more than words, it is certain that whatever is uttered with the voice would be neither better nor worse if it were illustrated by the artist's pencil.

Ministers have spoken of "wedding banquets in hell," of "the devils holding convention" to concoct a political platform; and some have resorted to language which we should not be considered excusable in repeating. One at least has culminated in what The Central Christian Advocate calls "Hysterical Politics in the Pulpits" by the following utterance, solemnly delivered at a prayer-meeting: "I will not introduce political lines to night. The honor of the nation is on trial as perhaps it never was in 1960. It were better that the nation perished in the civil war than to have endured to this hour only to lose its honor in the sight of all the other nations on the face of the earth."

A more extravagant, reckless statement than this cannot be found in the productions of the stump orators of the campaign.

Meanwhile, in several parts of the country, on both sides, ministers have been expelled from their pulpits for delivering partisan harangues. In one, a Congregational church, it was done by the action of a large majority who were of the same way of thinking as the preacher; so outraged were they by the uncourageous advantage taken by the preacher that they passed resolutions forbidding him to deliver any more discourses, and also stating that his engagement must terminate at the end of the year. Similar difficulties have occurred in Methodism; although, because of the nature of our government, they have operated in a different way.

Such are the "first-fruits" of religion in politics. Do we want the harvest? Is it not evident by this time that a religion which will mix with politics is something else than Christianity?
