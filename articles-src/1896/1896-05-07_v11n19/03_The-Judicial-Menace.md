## THE JUDICIAL MENACE.

The Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court has affirmed the constitutionality of the Raines liquor law. This fact is not itself of great significance, but the language of the court in stating its conclusions has a significance which is highly ominous.

Justice Patterson wrote the opinion of the court, which was concurred in by four other members. In it he said:—

The subject presented for our consideration is the constitutionality of the law. The law has been severely arraigned in argument as offending against justice and reason. It may be as unjust, unwise, oppressive and odious as the relator claims, but all that does not help in the solution of the question before us, and we have no opinion to express on that subject. The Court of Appeals has said:—

"No law can be pronounced invalid for the reason simply that it violates our notions of justice, is oppressive and unfair in its operation, or because, in the opinion of some or all of the citizens of the State it is not justified by public necessity or designed to promote the public welfare. If it violates no constitutional provision, it is valid and must be obeyed. The remedy for unjust or unwise legislation not obnoxious to constitutional objections is to be found in a change by the people of their representatives according to the methods provided by the Constitution."

Such language is calculated to raise in the reader's mind the query what courts and constitutions are for in the machinery of government. If, as the Declaration of Independence asserts, and as common sense affirms, governments are instituted among men to preserve the inalienable rights given man by the Creator, how can it possibly be that a part of the machinery of government can legitimately operate to invade those rights? For what purpose was the judicial department of government established if not to act at all times in the interests of justice and the rights of the people?

The same may be said with reference to the constitution. The constitution of the State of New York has this preamble: "We, the people of the State of New York, grateful to Almighty God for our freedom, in order to secure its blessings, do establish this Constitution." And yet the Appellate Division of the highest court in the State has gravely declared that a "law" may be oppressive and unjust, and still be constitutional! If the constitution is established by the people of the State in order to secure to themselves the blessings of freedom, how can that which is oppressive be constitutional?

If the assumptions of this court are to be held by courts generally, we have arrived at a most dangerous position, and the people may well call a halt and take their bearings. If our "courts of justice" have become instruments of oppression, it may be proper to inquire what further use we have for them. Certainly no person in this country wants to be oppressed; no one wants to become a victim of injustice. When appeal is honestly made to the court, it is that injustice may be averted, and the rights and liberties of the plaintiff secured to him; and it is to this end that all our courts were ordained to act.

We seem to have reached that place as a nation which the Jewish nation reached in the time of Christ, when the Scribes and Pharisees gave tithes of mint, anise, and cummin, and omitted the weightier matters of the law—justice, mercy, and faith. Matt. 23:23. More and more it becomes apparent that judicial decisions are taking less account of first principles, and exalting technicalities. The constitution is made superior to the people—the thing created, to its creator. Injustice is declared to be law, and the eternal law of justice is ignored.

Let the worst injustice and oppression now be put by legislative enactment into the constitution ordained by the people for the preservation of their liberties, and there will be no help for them in the courts of law, according to this decision of the Appellate Court of New York. The only remedy will lie in the slow, uncertain, and difficult process of changing the legislature and thereby securing the repeal of oppressive laws, and the enactment of that which is just. Commenting on the situation, the New York World, of April 26, heads an editorial with the words, "Contempt for Law." Such decisions on the part of our courts of law can tend only in this direction. The clogging of the channels of justice can tend only to a popular outburst in the direction of anarchy and revolution.
