### NAMES OF THE DAYS OF THE WEEK.

A SUBSCRIBER asks us to give the origin of the days of the week.

"The week," says the "Encyclopedia Britannica," "is a period of seven days, having no reference whatever to the celestial motions,—a circumstance to which it owes its unalterable uniformity. . . . It has been employed from time immemorial in almost all eastern countries; and as it forms neither an aliquot part of the year nor of the lunar month, those who reject the Mossic recital will be at a loss, as Delambre remarks, to assign to it an origin having much semblance of probability. . . .

"The English names of the days are derived from the Saxon. The ancient Saxons had borrowed the week from some Eastern nation, and substituted the names of their own divinities for those of the gods of Greece. In legislative and justiciary acts the Latin names are still retained.
