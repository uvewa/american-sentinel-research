A GOOD DEFENSE.

The Wilkesbarre Record of April 24 contains the following defense made by the three Koenig brothers, Seventh-day Adventist farmers living in the vicinity of Wilkesbarre, Pa., who, as noticed in our last issue, are now threatened with prosecution for pursuing their customary occupations on Sunday:

Editor Record: Your issue of Wednesday contained an item relating to our religious belief and practice regarding the Sabbath; will you kindly permit us to make a brief statement of our attitude toward the Sabbath question and our attitude toward our neighbors whose belief and practice differ from our own. It is true that we have lately changed our views regarding Sunday observance. Until recently we were conscientious observers of Sunday, the first day of the week, supposing that we were thereby obeying the will of God as revealed in his word; but recently we have come to believe that to obey the fourth commandment we must observe the seventh day, or Saturday, as therein commanded. We are as conscientious in this belief as we were in our former belief, but still willing to be convinced of our error (if such it be) with scriptural testimony.

As stated in your columns, we labor on the first day of the week, considering it one of the "six days" upon which labor may be performed, as set forth in the commandment. Our work is not of a noisy character and is not performed where it will disturb either the public or private devotions of our neighbors. We are endeavoring to follow the Golden Rule in all our relations with our neighbors, and would not knowingly do unto them that which we would not be willing to have done to us.

We are sorry to see some of our neighbors laboring on the day we now regard as holy, but we think it unchristian for us to attempt to harass them by legal action, as we understand a few of our neighbors propose to do with us. If we are wrong the Lord of Sunday will reckon with us in the judgment, and so long as our work on Sunday does not injure our neighbors in any way, but is wholly a matter which belongs

to the realm of conscience and religion, ought we not to be left in the hands of a just and merciful God?

Railroads and street-care thunder past us at all hours on Sunday, much nearer our neighbors than is our work, and pleasure-seeking wheelmen speed along unmolested; why then are we, who having kept the Sabbath day according to the commandment, go quietly about our honest toll on Sunday, singled out and threatened with prosecution? There are hundreds of Seventh-day Adventists in Pennsylvania who believe and practice as we do, but none of them have ever been arrested for their labor on Sunday.

We desire to impress upon all our neighbors that in pursuing the course we do, we are not attempting to needlessly offend them, and we sincerely hope that they will manifest the same kindly spirit toward us that we hear toward them, and not attempt to exact from us a tax of one-sixth of our income for the privilege of worshiping according to the dictates of our consciences in the land of the free.

Would it not be well for the State of Pennsylvania, or for any State, if all its citizens were as conscientious and as careful of human rights as are these men? And yet it is proposed by certain zealous religionists of their neighborhood to petition the borough council for authority to prosecute them in case they do not in the future observe Sunday. It is always the best citizens who are made the victims of religious prosecutions.
