## WHAT THEY MEAN BY RIGHTS.

The National Reformers insist that their proposed amendment instead of infringing the religious liberty of any would be the safeguard of religious liberty for all. That however depends altogether upon what is meant by religious liberty. This was clearly revealed in the Hearing before the Committee of the Judiciary, of the House of Representatives, March 11, 1896. We quote from the official report:—

DR. LEWIS—There are to-day in the United States by the last census, and I give my statement on the authority of Mr. Charles Buell, who was a prominent member of the census corps, one million of people observing the Sabbath according to the Bible, Seventh-day Baptists, Adventists, and Hebrews. Now, I put the question to you, Doctor: Is it not the purpose of this movement—it has certainly been so announced—to compel us who, on conscientious biblical grounds, hold to the seventh day, according to the Bible and not according to a tradition, is it not the purpose to compel us to submit?

DR. McALLISTER—No, sir.

DR. LEWIS—It has been so announced.

DR. McALLISTER—I am not responsible for any such announcement.

MR. BURTON—Conceding that it is not the purpose, would it not be the result?

DR. McALLISTER—No, sir; not at all. It could not be. Now, let me give my answer as to this matter in regard to the Bible. In the first place, my good friend, Dr. Lewis, says explicitly that the seventh-day Sabbath is the Bible ground. That is his interpretation. He has a right to interpret it in that way. I say that the first day of the week is the Bible ground. And that is the way it ever will be. Now, here comes the Congress of the United States; and it must decide; the nation must decide.

MR. BURTON—Let me ask you why should anyone decide except the individual?

DR. McALLISTER—The Congress must decide.

MR. BURTON—But why?

DR. McALLISTER—You meet here to do certain work, and, like every man, you have to decide whether you shall work seven days or six. You must decide whether you will work seven days or not. You have to give a decision. The next point is that when you decide not to work more than six days you must decide which day you will rest. And you have decided to rest on Sunday, the first day. Why? Because it is a Christian country. It is the Christian sabbath.

MR. JONES—In several States for several years, for more than one hundred years, those who have kept the Sabbath—Jews, Seventh-day Baptists, and Seventh-day Adventists—have been and are imprisoned or fined under the present State laws, and some are in jail now, I understand. I would ask the brethren if you have made any effort to secure the repeal, or in any earnest way showed sympathy for the people who have thus suffered?

DR. McALLISTER—I have used my efforts as editor of the Christian Statesman, which endeavors to advocate the principles of Christian citizenship, in favor of the rights of every man to his own fullest, freest conviction. I have done this from the time I was first able to think on these subjects. It has been over forty years of actual work. I have plead for every man's enjoyment of his religious convictions to the fullest extent, whether he is Jew, Seventh-day Baptist, Adventist, Chinaman, or any other. At the same time I say that this nation, according to the propositions I have laid down, must decide as to which day shall be a day of rest. It is decided, as a matter of fact, in favor of the first day. Now, the Christian people have the right on that first day of the week to quiet; they have the right to meet in their places of worship without disturbance. It is a civil right. It is not a matter of ecclesiastical doctrine at all. It is their right as citizens of the United States. If there be anything which infringes on that right the Government should interpose. It is right it should do it. It has the authority to interpose where there is a violation of law. But here a man is brought into court, charged with working on the first day of the week, contrary to the laws of Pennsylvania. He says, "I believe the seventh day of the week is the day on which the Lord intended us to rest." He has his right to observe it, but he must not publicly infringe on the rights of others.

A MEMBER—Has he a right to work?

DR. McALLISTER—He can work in his house, so it will not disturb others.

MR. CHOPPIY—Can he plow corn?

DR. McALLISTER—Not if it is to the disturbance of those who pass to church.

Note that the "disturbance" of which Dr. McAllister speaks is not such properly so-called, but the mental annoyance due to intolerance. It is the "disturbance" of bigotry in the bosom of him who is disturbed. Such "disturbance" is not due to noise or other conditions which might reasonably be held to interfere with the quiet of a day of rest, but to the unwillingness of a part of the people that the other part should enjoy equal rights with themselves. It is only a little over a century ago that Baptists were arrested and fined and imprisoned in Virginia for disturbing the peace by holding religious meetings and baptizing. The meetings were as quiet and orderly as those who were opposed to them would permit, but those who held them were adjudged guilty of disturbance, simply because the fact that such meetings were held was a mental annoyance to the adherents of the established church.
