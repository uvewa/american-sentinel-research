### THE MATABELS INSURRECTION.

[Mail and Express, April 24.]

It is not likely that we will hear the Matabels side of the outbreak in South Africa. Savages do not write books or correspond with the newspapers—toberwise a good deal of what is accepted as history might have to be rewritten. According to trustworthy accounts, however, the English in their treatment of natives in the newly acquired regions of South and Central Africa, follow the same rule as did the Spaniards in Central and South America, after the nominal abolition of native slavery by Charles V. in 1543. The natives were made free in name, but they were made in effect serfs of the crown instead of the slaves of individuals. A capitation tax was imposed amounting to about $1 a head and exacted in the form of personal service. We are told of this system that it really increased the miseries of the natives and kept them in a condition of bondage, although undoubtedly intended for their benefit.

Dr. James Johnston, a British subject and one of the most impartial men who have traveled in and written about the newly occupied regions in Africa, says that "a tax of six shillings per annum is levied by the British upon every male native over fourteen years of age, while the Portuguese demand only one rupee (about two shillings, or 48 cents, resulting in some of the natives going over to the latter, while others are threatening resistance to the unreasonable and unjust demands made upon them, from which they derive no return or benefit whatever."

If there is a race in Africa that the British claim especially to have benefited, it is the Mashonas, whom the white invaders profess to have rescued from the tyranny of the Matabeles. Dr. Johnston gives the other side of the Mashonas story as follows:—

The large native kraal (at Six Mile Spruit) turned out to be completely deserted, the natives having fled in terror from the outrages committed upon them by white policemen. The cooking pots, calabashes, and baskets of the Mashonas scattered around the huts were suggestive of hasty flight. . . . The

whole scene was sad and sickening in the extreme. Further information from reliable sources only augmented our horror at the depravity of the brutes, who had thus added another blot on England's fair escutcheon. And yet we have heard the hope expressed by philanthropic and Christian people at home that with the opening up of Central Africa by British protectorates and chartered companies an entrance would be secured to the heart of this hitherto unevangelized region for the gospel of Christ. But it is much to be feared that not in this generation will the deep-seated dread and bitter hate of the Mashonas toward the white man be eradicated, whether he represents the church, government or commerce.

It is easy to imagine from the foregoing that the Matabeles, who are not of the same submissive stamp as the Mashonas, may have had provocation to justify their insurrection against British authority. The Matabeles would not be likely to accept without resistance the yoke of servitude imposed as an equivalent for a personal tax, which the Mashonas have borne patiently if unwillingly.
