### General Note
The OCR source file contained clear page markers (PAGE 1, PAGE 2, etc.) and image placeholders (img-0.jpeg, img-1.jpeg, etc.) which helped identify structure. Images were noted but not described in detail as they were not part of the article text content.

## Summary
Overall OCR quality was very good. Most uncertainties were minor typographical errors (street-care vs street-cars, DISEATCH vs DISPATCH, etc.) that were preserved exactly as found per transcription instructions. No significant content uncertainties required second-pass review.
