## RELIGIOUS TEACHING IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS.

A SESSION of the American Society of Religious Education was held in Washington, D. C., April 20–22, for the purpose of discussing religious education in its relation to the welfare of society and of the Church.

The discussion turned largely to the subject of the religious training of children. This it was assumed would be conducted by those to whom the general education of children was most largely entrusted; in other words, to those holding positions in public institutions of instruction.

Some of the assertions by which the discussion was characterized, were, that the teaching of our relations to the future was of greater importance than the teaching of our relation to God; that to know the reasons for belief was more important than belief itself; and that knowledge would be an effectual bar against all the isms which were leading the minds of many in the Christian world astray, and which could not be combatted by anything but an intelligent comprehension of the doctrines of the Christian religion. These and other statements made gave evidence that in the minds of prominent members of the association, the religious education required was not a mere knowledge of fundamental principles of Christian ethics, but a complete knowledge of the doctrines of Christianity.

There is manifestly an increasing sentiment in this country in favor of combining religious instruction with secular teaching in our public educational institutions, and of making this religious instruction comprehensive of the doctrines of Christianity. In so far as this results in the introduction of religious teaching in schools supported by the State, it must tend to a union of Church and State. The various religious denominations will inevitably be drawn into competition for the selection, through their influence, of instructors in the public schools, and also for the determination of the doctrines which shall be taught as pertaining to the Christian religion. A wide field would inevitably be opened up for denominational controversy; and the most powerful, or prevailing, church would receive the support of the State in the public dissemination of its doctrines, and the training of

the youth to become applicants for admission into her fold.

While some time was given in this session of the association to a discussion of the family as an educational institution, it is undoubtedly true that the importance of parental religious training for children and youth is becoming more and more lost to public view. The family, the church, and the denominational school are the only proper institutions for imparting religious instruction; and of these the family is not the least. The parental and family influence is incomparably greater over the youth than is that of the church or the school. Religious training should begin with the child as soon as it is old enough to understand religious ideas and principles, and for the purposes of such training the Bible, in the hands of parents, stands preeminent. It is the home influence that begins or mars the character. The person who in early youth contends with an adverse influence at home, struggles against great odds. The parents stand to the young child in the place of God, and their place cannot be taken by any others. This is fixed by the natural relation between the parties. To parents is entrusted by God the training of their children for usefulness in life, and no part of this training is of such importance as that which affects their moral nature, and sets forth their relation to God. If parents evade this responsibility or shift it to other hands, they neglect a sacred trust.

Where parents are not competent to train their children in religious knowledge, this work should be done by the church and the denominational school. In many instances this will be the case; but no parent is released from obligation in this respect. What the country needs is an agitation which will set before parents their duty to diligently instruct their children in religious knowledge as revealed in the Word of God, and not an agitation which tends to lessen their perceptions of personal responsibility in this respect.
