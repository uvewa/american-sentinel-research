### CONTEMPT FOR THE LAW.

[New York World, April 26.]

The tentative and technical support given to the Raines law by the Appellate Court will, so far as it has any moral effect, prove a distinct injury to public morals. People will say, "If this is law, so much the worse for law." They will say that if a statute may be, as the court declares, "unjust, unwise, oppressive and odious," and yet perfectly constitutional, "A fig for your Constitution."

The object of a constitution is to "establish justice," "promote the general welfare" and "secure the blessings of liberty" to all the people. How, then, the plain people will ask, can a law which is "unjust, unwise, oppressive and odious" be in accordance with the constitution?

The object of statute law is to maintain peace and order, to protect life and property and to guarantee the rights and privileges of the citizens. The equal rights of equal citizens under equal and just laws ought to be the distinguishing mark of good government in a republic.

When the constitution and laws subserve these purposes they are universally respected. Under such conditions that "respect for the constable" which has been cited as an evidence of high civilization becomes natural and proper.

But when laws discriminate between classes and communities, . . . when they unduly restrict personal liberty, interfere with the public's comfort and necessities, impose an obligation to observe "holy time" upon thousands to whom all time is equally good, and in general nag, oppress, restrain and afflict peaceable and orderly citizens, they fall into contempt.

The consequences of this stimulated lawlessness may prove more serious than those responsible for it have imagined.
