## BAPTIST MISSIONARY PERSECUTED BY ROMANISTS IN CUBA.

A DISEATCH from Havana, Cuba, under date of April 22, says: "The Rev. Alberto Diaz and his brother, Vincento, who were released by the authorities to-day, have been ordered to leave the island in six days. They undoubtedly will do so. For several years the Rev. Mr. Diaz, a Cuban born, but a naturalized citizen of the United States, has been a thorn in the side of the bishop of Havana. He has held Baptist meetings at such times and places as suited him, and has not taken the trouble in conform to the laws and regulations which are framed to favor the Roman Catholics and to fence out interlopers. When the bishop wrote a letter of remonstrance to the preacher, Mr. Diaz replied that he would worship in his own fashion.

"Diaz has been arrested several times for holding meetings without first obtaining a permit from the authorities. He has been charged repeatedly with disturbing the public peace, but he has continued his work undismayed.

"When Diaz first went to the island the members of his congregation were refused burial in the consecrated cemeteries, then the only burial grounds in Cuba. Diaz overcame this by starting rival cemeteries. The three cemeteries of the Baptists in Cuba now contain over 7,000 bodies.

"On one occasion he and two of his assistants, Godinez and Herrera, went to Guanabacoa to hold an open-air meeting, when the three were arrested and taken before the mayor, on the charge that they had not given a notice of the meeting. They were followed by a throng of sympathizers. Infuriated and ready to mob the officers in charge, the crowd surrounded the prison, and Diaz was obliged to appear on the jail balcony and deliver an address dissuading his adherents from an attempt at rescue. A day after the required notice of the meeting was found in the mayor's office, where it had been mislaid.

"One day while Diaz was preaching, so he states, a shot from behind and above was fired. The ball, passing close to the intended victim, struck a boy in front of him. The screams of the wounded boy aroused cries of "Kill the Protestants!" "Shoot the horetic!" Diaz and his brother were mobbed, their clothing was torn off, and, bruised and bleeding, they were carried before the mayor. He ordered his police to see them safely on the cars for Havana. Later a priest was con-

victed of firing the shot into the meeting and sent to Spain for punishment.

"Mr. Diaz is an M. D. as well as a reverend, and he once conducted a hospital here.

"For many years he has received financial aid in support of his institutions from Baptists in the United States.

"He has organized in Cuba thirty churches and stations and twenty-six Sunday-schools. He has twenty-five assisting clergymen. Seven churches have a membership of 7,000. He has over 3,000 teachers and pupils, and annually he baptizes 500 or 400 persons.

"The Southern Baptist Church bought for Diaz a theatre in Havana at a cost of $60,000. It seats 3,000 persons. In this building his mother was converted, and he says that so overcome was he with joy that he forgot the usual ceremony, and could only say: 'Lord Jesus, this is my mother,' when he immersed her.

"Mr. Diaz has not taken any active part in the revolution, but he has given utterance repeatedly to sentiments favorable to the success of the Cuban cause."
