## DISSENTERS IN RUSSIA.

[Richard L. Conrad, Seventh-day Adventist Minister, Hamburg, Germany, in Present Truth, London, Eng.]

A NUMBER of interesting communications have reached us of late, showing the steady progress of the work in this great mission field. The difficulties are by no means growing less; on the contrary, they are rather on the increase, and our only hope is that our Lord is at the helm, and that he is mightier than all the earthly powers. Our brethren who are laboring among the German colonists have entered several new fields with apparent success.

What some of our brethren have to suffer is best seen from the following letter from the elder of one of our German churches in the South:—

Last June I wrote you about the difficulties we had for meeting each Sabbath. They have since only increased. Each Sabbath we have been fined two shillings for each person who attended the meeting. Thus far we have not paid, and in consequence they have taken our sheep, horses, etc., and sold them. We have now taken a piece of new land about one hundred and twenty miles from here, and hope that thereby our situation may be eased. Each week we had to be in prison from twenty-four to forty-eight hours. Remember us in your prayers.

The work among the native Russians has been growing quite rapidly. The following letter was received from one of our exiled brethren:—

Psalm cxxl. as greeting! The fifth year of our banishment in this wilderness has begun, and we have had many obstacles and temptations to meet, but the Lord has preserved us through his strength, a miracle of his mercy.

Last November we were greatly surprised that the leaders from the different villages visited us, to ask of us the reason of our faith and hope. One of the five elders afterward stood up and remarked: "Dear brethren, these people have the truth; I shall be no hindrance to them." Another stood up and said: "If the first day of the week is not to be kept, then there is no other." But the rest all acknowledged the truth. The visits increase; many have been awakened by publications and letters received from your mission, and there is a great stir here now. Many who before took no pains to study the Bible have, on account of the Bible readings which have been sent to them, been awakened and have bought Bibles. Three preachers have already proclaimed the truth among their own churches, and they spread it from place to place. Ere they did this, they had a day of prayer and fasting in their respective churches. Several have already asked us to be received into church fellowship. Thus we can see how the Lord is wonderfully fulfilling his promises, and while we are bound, he is bringing the hungry souls to us. Therefore we will all be of good courage in the Lord, even in bonds.

From another place we received the following:—

Psalm xcv. as greeting! The prince at whose house I stop, has of late been summoned to St. Petersburg. The reason is as follows: Some six months ago he sent a petition to the emperor that all our brethren and sisters might be freed from exile, and also asking for religious liberty. When he returned, we were all anxious to learn of the results, but he was silent. We learned afterward that he had to sign a document in which he had to pledge himself never again to ask any favor for such who had been exiled nor to secure them any passports. The Lord only knows what the future will bring; may his will be done at all times.

The latest news from the East has been that one of our native laborers has been imprisoned lately, and that his case has been given into the hands of the higher courts. The Lord has greatly blessed his labors during the past year. Truly the times are becoming more and more perilous. May all awake in view of them, and may we all remember those in bonds for Christ's sake.
