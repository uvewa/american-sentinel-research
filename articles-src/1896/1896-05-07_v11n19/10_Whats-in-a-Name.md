### "WHAT'S IN A NAME?"

THE Christian Statesman of the 18th ult., has the following under the heading "Sabbath Reform":—

Rev. N. R. Johnston of Oakland, Cal., State Secretary, has sent out the following: "The California State Sabbath Association will hold its first annual convention in San Francisco on the 14th of May next. The arrangements had all been made before the date of the Prohibition convention was known. The committee appointed to invite speakers and make out the program invited the honored old standard bearer, John Bidwell of Chicago, to be the presiding officer and make the opening address. In his letter of reply he writes the following sentences. To the Prohibitionists they are golden. He says: 'I am still firm in the faith that the ballot which destroyed the Christian sabbath can alone restore it. Until Christians use this invincible power will God give them any other? One old political party repealed our sabbath law. The other will not restore it. Both are afraid of the liquor power whose servants they are.'"

It appears from this that the great object of the Prohibition party is to honor Sunday.
