## ARE THEY CONSISTENT?

REV. JOHN WHITTAKER, pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran Church, Rochester, N. Y., is the author of a little book, published by the Young Lutheran Company, of Utica. It is entitled "Baptism," and of course defends sprinkling and the baptism of infants. On page 18 occurs the following:—

To this claim [that children should be baptized], the denomination known as Baptists directly oppose themselves. They say that there is no express command in the word of God for infant baptism. They propose, at the constant, to be very scriptural. "To the law and to the testimony," they say. Their demand is, "Show us a positive command in the Bible to baptize infants and we will yield at once. And then they pause for a reply. We shall endeavor, in our humble way, to give them one.

But in so doing, we may be pardoned if we imitate the example of our blessed Master—answer one question by asking another. We challenge any and all who demand direct scriptural authority for infant baptism to show us in the word of God a positive command to observe the first day of the week as a day of rest, in the place of the seventh! "Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy." Where is the express command to set aside this day and keep the one which the Christian Church so universally observe? There is none. Now, if Baptists wish to be consistent, they must either allow us to infer that infant baptism is an implied teaching of the New Testament, or they must unite with the Seventh-day Baptists, in keeping the Jewish Sabbath. Until they hold "to the law and to the testimony," they must not try to force others to do so.

This is a weak point with Baptists, and some of them candidly confess it.
