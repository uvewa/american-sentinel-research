### THE CARDINAL'S PROPHECY; OR, A VATICAN VISION.

1.

The Cardinal sat (in his brand new hat), and he dreamed a lugubrious dream:

He heard Europe's battle-drums beating for war; he beheld all her bayonets gleam;

And he says, says he, one may easily see a catastrophe cannot be far;

Seven millions of men, and all armed to the eyes, must portend a most terrible war!

2.

Heigho! it is sad; yet the world is so bad that it calls for this bloody self scourging;

For which unaware, all the nations prepare, as directed by Heaven's own urging

The ill wind of war, which I snuff from afar, shall blow good to the See of St. Peter;

And, stablish, I hope, the sole sway of the Pope.

Could a Nemesis well be complete?

3.

The rascal apostles of Red Revolution have pulled down the temporal power;

Heaven's justice must seat Humpty-Dumpty again; while his enemies grovel and cover.

But chastisement dire and a scourge as of fire are a sine god non for redressing

That hideous wrong; and so, armaments strong claim a Cardinal's—sorrowful blessing!

4.

Threat is not my intent; 'tis a pious lament. I'm exceedingly grieved to foresee it.

But the great Dies Irae of "Reds" is at hand, 'tis too late, they'll discover, to flee it.

I plainly perceive that the councils of Heaven, have settled the term of their tether.

Seas of blood must atone, and the POPE have his own—then we all may be happy together.

5.

Not in Döllinger's fashion,—the mooning schismatic! how dares he to praise about unity?

Those blundering babblers at Bonn must be shown that they can't shout the POPE with impunity.

The Sirens of Schiem sing vainly of peace though they warble as sweetly as Patti can.

The only true pan-pipe to marshal the flock of the Church is that played at the Vatican.

6.

On woes men must sup; Messrs. Armstrong and Krupp are preparing the meal most unwittingly:

Big gun and torpedo shall stablish our Credo; so Providence fashions it fittingly.

Saltpetre shall fume for St. Peter—an incense unpleasant, but yet an oblation

Supplied unawares by those foes of the Church who are destined to self-immolation.

7.

Steel, powder and shot, they will soon make it hot for thy spoilers, Infallible Vicar!

On that deluge of blood the Sole Ark of the Faithful shall float to its haven the quicker.

It is sad—that of course! but if murderous force prove the backer of Church School, and Nunnery.

No doubt it is true, that from this point of view, there's a sort of a Gospel in Gunnery.

8.

Laus Deo! yet stop! No, the mask must not drop. I'm a peace-loving man and a pastor.

No firebrand am I, though I see in Fate's sky all the omens of woe and disaster.

The vile of Cassandra I grieve to assume, and lest any should find it alarming,

I'll put up a pious and fervent petition for—Unity, Peace, and Disarming.

—London Punch.
