ANY ONE receiving the AMERICAN SENTINEL without having ordered it may know that it is sent to him by some friend. Therefore, those who have not ordered the SENTINEL need have no fears that they will be asked to pay for it.

A FORCED religious observance is a sacrifice which God abhors.

ANY power which undertakes to deal by law with an act on the basis of its immorality, assumes the wisdom to measure and the power to adequately punish *sin*; and thus doing, it assumes to stand in the place of God. Earthly powers can by their laws deal with acts only on the basis of their character as violative or not violative of human rights.

WHATEVER is accomplished by the people is done through popular sovereignty; and yet we are gravely told by the "National Reform" party that the people ought to put God in the Constitution and elect pious men to political office on the ground that popular sovereignty does not afford the right kind of government!

OUR illustration in this number is deserving of more than passing notice: it speaks volumes. The manacled men, the heartbroken women, and the wondering children, all tell far more eloquently than mere words could possibly do, of "man's inhumanity to man" that "makes countless thousands mourn." And it is all the more sadly inexplicable when done in the name of the religion of the Lord Jesus Christ.

J. W. LEWIS, the Seventh-day Adventist imprisoned at Tiptonville, Lake County, Tenn., for consistently dissenting from the religion of his neighbors, is no longer locked in the cage like a dangerous character, but is given the freedom of the jail and is permitted to occupy a room which, as he puts it, "seems like a palace," in contrast to the iron cage. Right-minded people everywhere will rejoice that this persecuted man is finding favor with his keepers; but however easy his imprisonment may be made, the fact remains that he is deprived of his God-given liberty.

APRIL 20, Chester A. Gordon, and Rebecca Gordon, his wife, the Seventh-day Adventists sent to jail recently in Arkansas by an ignorant and bigoted justice of the peace, were "pardoned" by Governor Clarke.

The imprisonment of these people was without even color of law, as the statutes of Arkansas provide that "persons who are members of any religious society who observe as Sabbath any other day of the week than the Christian sabbath, or Sunday, shall not be subject to the penalties of this act, so that they observe one day in seven, agreeable to the faith and practice of their church or society."

Though all the parties to this affair are colored, Governor Clarke was visibly affected when he heard the story of the injustice done to the Gordons, and he acted very promptly in the matter.

The most painful feature in this case is that the brutal contractors compelled both Gordon and his wife to work on the Sabbath. This is another illustration of how Sunday "laws" do not(?) interfere with the rights of conscience.

When asked why he ignored the statute in the case and ordered the Adventists to jail, the justice, who has only a trace of negro blood in his veins, said that "Gordon and his wife claimed to be seven day something," but he never heard of it before, and he thought there were churches enough now for people to belong to and they were good enough for anybody. He further stated that he received his support from the church people, and they had complained to him, and he was obliged to have Gordon and his wife arrested.

SECTARIAN appropriations of public money should be stopped not because some one sect is getting more than its share, thereby making the other sects jealous; but because it is not just to tax people to support that in which they do not believe, and in which they are prevented by conscience from having any representation.

THE doctrine that Christianity is in this country a part of the common law, is certainly very flattering to the common law, but not so flattering to Christianity. Great indeed must be the common law if Christianity is only a part of it. Christianity—the manifestation of supreme love to God and to our fellowmen—covers the whole individual life. It includes not only justice in dealing, but mercy as well; while the civil law can at most only aim at justice. Christianity is infinitely broader and higher than human law, and is administered by an infinitely higher power and authority. The doctrine that Christianity is a "part of the common law," is one of the devil's schemes to degrade Christianity.

THE Mail and Express, of April 22, prints this item of news in reference to the God-in-the-Constitution party:—

The National Reform party—whatever that may be—will nominate a Presidential ticket at Pittsburg next month, if it can corral sufficient delegates to make up the various committees without robbing the convention of its officers. The outlook at present is most encouraging, as the party's New York State Convention, in Syracuse, was called to order yesterday with eight gentlemen present.

The Mail and Express seemed to be well acquainted with "National Reform" in the days of Elliott F. Shepard. The significance of this party's activity is not to be estimated by the number present at their conventions, but by the wide-spread prevalence of doctrines of which "National Reform" is but the logical outgrowth; namely, such doctrines as that the State has a right to legislate on sabbath observance and other matters pertaining to public morality.

It is not quite clear how the National Reformers are going to conduct a political campaign while holding to their belief that it is wrong to vote or take any part in politics under this "godless" government.

THE following, which appeared in the Wilkes-Barre Record, of April 22, indicates that we may look for Sunday persecutions in Pennsylvania in the near future:—

The doctrine that the Seventh-day Adventists have been propounding in Forty Fort for the past few months promises to cause some annoyance. Among their converts are John, William, and Henry Connock, who operate farms between the river and Wyoming Ave. These men, now being Adventists, insist on keeping Saturday as Sunday, and not caring to lose two days in the week, work on Sunday. Last Sunday they had four teams plowing. One of them, driven by a boy fifteen years old, ran away, and on the way to the barn the plow caught on a post, and the shock was so great to the horses that they were unable to work the remainder of the day. It is said the people living in the neighborhood propose petitioning the borough council to take proper action in the matter to prevent them from doing further work on Sunday.

We shall expect to hear erelong that some zealous believers in Sunday sacredness have taken special pains to be "disturbed" by the Sunday work of these Adventists, in order to have them prosecuted, and if possible, compelled to change their practice of setting apart the seventh day from other days by making it the weekly rest-day, as enjoined by the fourth commandment.

WE are told by the advocates of Sunday laws that Sunday rest, being merely the observance of a "civil sabbath," can be enforced without any interference with the rights of conscience. But those who have most to say on this line are always those who are most zealous for Sunday as a religious institution. Have these persons a clearer insight than others into the nature of things purely civil? or does their religious zeal eclipse their discernment of truth and justice? Why does disregard of the "civil sabbath" "disturb" only those who are zealous for the religious sabbath? Why does honest labor, not objectionable to any upon six days of the week, become a "nuisance" to certain ones upon one particular day of each week, if not upon religious grounds?
