# PERVADING LAWLESSNESS.

The *Christian Leader* (Cincinnati) of March 10, makes this comment and query:

The spirit of lawlessness and insubordination pervades the entire country. Who can give the causes, proximate and remote, of these terrible crimes? In general terms it is called "the spirit of the age." But what produced this spirit? In general terms we might exclaim that there is no fear of God before the eyes of the people. Atheism and agnosticism are rampant. What forces have produced this condition of things?

The mystery of the situation may be solved by discovering the cause which has removed from the people's eyes the fear of God. Whatever has done this, has also removed from the minds of men the restraints of wholesome law, and clear conceptions of right and wrong. Without discussing the question at length, we will state three facts which have a fundamental bearing upon it.

1. It has long been taught by men, recognized as ministers of the gospel, that the law of God—the Decalogue—is abolished.

2. What amounts essentially to the same thing, the great majority of professed Christians have for centuries disregarded the fourth precept of the Decalogue—the very one which points out the true God—by observing another day than the one which it commands to be observed. And as the attention of the Christian world has within a few decades been called to this fact, those who still persist in their adherence to the false sabbath do so for the most part at the expense of their own convictions of duty as enjoined by God's word. And the unconverted world at large have learned that professed Christians themselves place their own custom and tradition above the commandment of Jehovah.

3. These same "Christians" have for several years been clamoring and lobbying for legislation to exalt Sunday, and make crim-

inal acts performed on Sunday, which on all other days are held to be right and honorable. Nothing could contribute more powerfully to break down moral distinctions of right and wrong in the public mind than the course pursued by the Christian world regarding the Sabbath.

With these facts in mind, the present alarming moral condition of society is quite fully intelligible.
