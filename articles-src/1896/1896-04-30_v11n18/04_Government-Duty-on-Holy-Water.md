# GOVERNMENT DUTY ON "HOLY WATER."

The collector of customs at Hartford, Conn., was recently, says the New York *World*, of April 15, called upon to decide a perplexing question, which was that of whether "holy water" imported from abroad was chargeable with government "duty." "Several months ago," says the *World*, "His Holiness Pope Leo XIII. blessed a quantity of water at the petition of a pious congregation in Hartford, Conn. One week ago a keg labeled 'Holy Water' arrived at the custom-house in this city and was sent to the collector of customs at Hartford, in bond.

"The keg arrived at Hartford. The official gauger of that port certified that it contained five gallons of a fluid that had the appearance and consistency of pure water. Then it fell upon the collector to determine whether the importation was or was not dutiable. The collector searched the records of the department in vain for a precedent. There was none.

"He found a number of department decisions admitting free of duty Appolinaris, Villacabras, and a dozen other waters for medicinal uses, when accompanied by an affidavit to the effect that they corresponded to the required medical formulae, and he found also that water from the Grotto at Lourdes had been admitted free because of the pious belief among Catholics that miracles had been performed by its use. Nowhere, however, could the collector at Hartford find anything bearing on holy water."

Finally after long consultation with his assistant, the collector decided that "holy water" came under the head of "Unenumerated Articles" in the Wilson Bill, and as such was subject to a duty of 10 per cent. Special Deputy Naval Officer Gourley, an expert on customs enigmas, upon being visited by a *World* reporter, said that "holy water" should come under the same category as natural-spring water, which is considered a crude mineral and free from duty.

The situation might well have caused perplexity. Was the representative of the United States Government to affix a value to the papal blessing and on that basis charge a certain per cent. of duty? or was this "holy water" blessed by Leo himself to be regarded as "crude mineral" and admitted free? In either case there was a chance that the Roman pontiff might feel himself grievously insulted.

The incident may well serve as an occasion for pointing out the absurdity of the idea that holiness can be made a mere abstract quality of matter. Holiness cannot be separated from God. And therefore no man can impart holiness to anything, any more than he can impart God himself. It is the presence of God that makes holy; for God, and he alone, is holy in and of himself. And his holiness is imparted not at the volition of man, but only according to the divine will.

The papal blessing affected the water neither for better nor worse; and as ordinary water, it was of course not subject to duty upon entry into this country.

There is no danger that real holiness will ever have to be considered by the United States Government as a quality affecting the nature and value of any of its articles of import.
