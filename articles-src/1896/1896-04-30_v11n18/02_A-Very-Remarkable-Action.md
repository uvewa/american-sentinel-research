# A VERY REMARKABLE ACTION.

We take the following from the *Denver American*, of the 18th inst., which is credited by our contemporary to the *Catholic Citizen*:

A question of great importance in church circles has come up in Illinois. The issue is, whether a priest of the church should be held amenable to the laws of the United States for writing and sending through the mails a letter to one of his parishioners uttering a warning against a contemplated act that would be a violation of the laws and canons of the Catholic Church.

The issue is raised by the fact that Father Lawrence Erhardt, of the parish of Somonank, in Illinois, has been held by the United States Commissioner in $5,000 bail to the grand jury, for sending to a woman communicant of his parish a letter based on the announced fact of her engagement to a divorced man, and in which he pointed out that the church could not recognize a marriage with a divorced person.

Action was taken against Father Erhardt, on the dictum of a post-office inspector, on the ground that the letter in question was an unmailable one within the meaning of the statute relating to such offenses. The case is the first of its kind that has arisen in the country, and the extraordinary nature of the proceeding has evoked some comment from leading clergymen. As the legal proceedings are in a Federal court, the outcome will establish a precedent applying to every part of the country.

We know nothing about the facts in this case further than what is here stated, but it seems incredible to us that anybody would hold that a priest, or anybody else, for that matter, was guilty of a crime for writing a letter of the character indicated, to one of his parishioners.
