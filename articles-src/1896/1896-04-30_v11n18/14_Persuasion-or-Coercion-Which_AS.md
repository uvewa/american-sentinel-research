**PERSUASION, OR COERCION; WHICH?**

*BY A. SMITH.*

"In the town of M———, New York, there lived an infidel who owned a saw-mill, situated by the side of the highway, over which many members of a Christian congregation passed, every Sunday, in going to and returning from their place of worship. The infidel was accustomed to manage his mill himself; and, having no regard for Sunday, he was as busy, and his mill as noisy, on that day as on any other. It was observed, however, that, at a certain time before service, the mill stopped, and remained silent, and appeared to be destitute of the presence of a human being for a few minutes, then resumed its noise and clatter till about the close of service when it again ceased for a little time. It was next noticed that Deacon B———passed the mill toward the place of worship, during the silent interval. It appeared that the deacon being (as all other good Deacons are) regular in his time, the infidel knew just when to stop his mill, so that it should be silent while Deacon B———was passing, although he paid no regard to the passing of others. On being asked why he paid this marked respect to Deacon B———, the infidel replied, 'The deacon professes just what the rest of you do, but he lives also such a life that it makes me feel bad here [putting him hand upon his heart] to run my mill while he is passing.'"

Had all other members of the church, like Deacon B———, lived up to their profession as he lived, would not the infidel have shown them like respect? and he might have shut down his mill altogether on Sunday out of regard to the religious element of the community, and, perhaps, himself have become a Christian.

An immense amount of responsibility for infidelity rests upon professed Christians themselves on account of their glaringly inconsistent conduct as representatives of Christ.

Suppose Deacon B———had adopted National Reform ideas, and, instead of, Christlike, winning by moral suasion as he did, had gone before a magistrate and sworn out a complaint against the infidel for running his mill "on the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday, or the Christian sabbath," etc, what would have become of the infidel's respect for him, or the Christianity he represented? It is not difficult to see what the result would have been.

National Reform religion is a religion of force, of coercion and its tendency is to engender hatred of Christ and his religion.

Says Paul "Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men." 1 Cor. 5: 11.

Says the National Reformer, "Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord we coerce men."

Which is the Christlike method? Which will best win its way to the hearts and consciences of men?
