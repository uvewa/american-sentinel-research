## THE OVERWEEKNING AMBITION OF THE PAPACY.

To again hold in her hands the destiny of nations, to depose kings and to set up kings, is the overweening ambition of the Papacy. The following, published in this city in the afternoon papers on the 17th inst., is significant:—

### Pope to Mediate.

LONDON, April 17.—A despatch from Rome to the Pall Mall Gazette says that the Papal Nuncio, at Madrid, has been instructed to propose the mediation of the Pope in order to bring about a settlement of the troubles in Cuba, or to urge upon Spain the acceptance of President Cleveland's reported offer of mediation.

The Globe, discussing the affect of the election policy of the Spanish Premier, Senor Canovas del Castillo, says that either Cuba must be allowed to follow the example of the South American republics or the motherland must grant a generous measure of autonomy.

It is to be hoped that neither President nor Pope will interpose himself or his mediation between the Cubans and that political liberty and independence for which they are so gallantly doing battle.
