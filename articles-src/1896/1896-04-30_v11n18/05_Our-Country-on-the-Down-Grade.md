# OUR COUNTRY ON THE DOWN GRADE.

"A score of years ago," says the *Catholic Universe*, of Feb. 26, 1890, "the sight of a Catholic priest sitting on a platform with the ministers of other denominations to discuss measures for civic, State, or national improvements, would have caused a wild frothing at the mouth. Now it is too common and too welcome to excite comment." The statement points out the rapidity with which even the greatest changes in popular sentiment are taking place at the present time. We live in a fast age, fast especially in the downward rush of the tide of affairs in social and national life. A gathering of preachers "to discuss measures for civic, State, or national improvements," can have no other meaning but that the churches represented by them will use their united power to shape and control affairs in city, State and national government. And that means a union of Church and State.
