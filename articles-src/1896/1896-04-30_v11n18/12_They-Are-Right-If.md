**THEY ARE RIGHT—IF.**

*[Evangel and Sabbath Outlook.]*

The earnestness and persistency with which the "Christian Amendment" to the National Constitution is supported by its friends is shown in the following from the *Christian Statesman*, the special organ of that movement:—

The hand of Providence is with us. The Christian amendment has been laid over until next year. This is not defeat. It means that the Christian people of this great land have many precious months in which to agitate, educate and petition. Shall we not now sink all differences of creed and denomination and with one mighty voice declare that God shall be the acknowledged Lord of America? Let us roll up petitions long enough to reach from the Penobscot to the Golden Gate and back again to Washington, and with each petition to Congress send one up to God's throne asking him to speed this course and give victory to the right.

The connection between Sunday laws and the proposed "National Reform" is set forth by the following from the "Field Notes" of Secretary J. H. Leiper, in the *Christian Statesman* for March 28. It shows that we do not mistake in thinking that the "Civil Sabbath" argument cannot stop, logically, short of the full "God-in-the-Constitution" theocratic position. Leiper says:—

We meet with no opposition in our special work of sabbath defense, but the most convincing and always accepted argument in defense of the civil sabbath, as we present it, is precisely the central idea of National Reform—the moral personality of the State. No one ever takes any exception to it as applied to the duty of the State bearing on sabbath observance; all of which proves that opposition to the Christian amendment with every one except the infidel is prejudice or ignorance.

In one thing these amenders of the Constitution are right. If the doctrine of a "Civil Sabbath," as it is usually applied to Sunday, is correct, there is no reason why their scheme for bringing the nation to the millennium by civil law should not be forwarded. We commend this to the consideration of the great mass of Christians who favor laws protecting and establishing the "Civil Sabbath," but who do not favor the Constitutional Amendment. If the Sunday laws—outside the liquor laws—can be sustained logically or theologically, much more the whole God-in-the-Constitution scheme; sooner or later these issues will stand or fall together. They are part and parcel of the same general conception. That conception found full expression in the Sunday law of Constantine, 321 A. B., and despite such modifications as times and circumstances have wrought, the fundamental principle is unchanged. If we may make a "Civil Sabbath" by law, compelling men to idleness because of something which exists, or is supposed to exist, in Sunday, we can compel a "Civil Baptism" a "Civil Good Friday," and, in the end, a "Civil Church membership" in every detail. Certainly, Ben. *Statesman*, you are right—if the first fundamental error of the "Civil Sabbath" idea is accepted.
