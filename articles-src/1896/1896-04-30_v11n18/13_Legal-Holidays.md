**LEGAL HOLIDAYS.**

*[New York Mail and Express.]*

There is a good deal of misconception regarding the question of legal holidays in this country. As a matter of fact, there is no such thing as a legal national holiday, not even the Fourth of July, Congress never having passed a law creating it such, but it is observed in all the States, as are Christmas and Thanksgiving days, those being the only three which have universal recognition, and in the States of Arkansas and Mississippi they are not upon the statute books.

In the case of New Year's day, there are five States which ignore its claims to being a legal holiday, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Rhode Island joining with Arkansas and Mississippi in refusing it such recognition. Five States, Alabama, Louisiana, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Tennessee, have made Good Friday a legal holiday, and Decoration day is down as such on the statute books of thirty-six States and Territories. Labor day is a holiday the date of which varies. This year, for instance, Pennsylvania will celebrate it on September 5, thirty-three other States on September 7, and three others on September 12, October 5 and November 25, the latter being the date fixed upon by Louisiana. In Connecticut, Lincoln's memory is honored by a State holiday on October 15, the date of the Emancipation Proclamation.
