# POPULAR SOVEREIGNTY AND DIVINE SOVEREIGNTY.

At a recent "National Reform" convention held at Coulterville, Ill., the following resolution (among others) was passed:

Resolved, That we condemn the assumption of absolute and popular sovereignty, and declare that the power of the people is limited by the law of God, and that the people are bound to set over them only such rulers as are willing to qualify by professed subjection to the law of Christ.

It is almost incredible that an assembly of intelligent people should declare itself in words so puerile and short-sighted. In pursuance of this thought let us notice a few facts.

1. The theory of popular government upon which our nation is established, makes no claim of sovereignty for the people in that sphere which is covered by the law of God. It claims no sovereignty for the people in the sphere of man's relation to his Maker. Hence that popular sovereignty which pertains to republican government is not touched by the law of God at all.

The statement that the power of the people is limited by the law of God in the sphere covered by that law, would be equally beside the truth; for the people have no power at all in the direction of that which the law of God commands. This is a fundamental gospel truth. The power of God, and that alone, can perform that which the law commands.

2. "Professed subjection to the law of Christ" does not in itself amount to anything. Profession is not possession; and the former without the latter only makes an individual worse in the sight both of God and man. And it is as clear as noonday that if the people should undertake to put in political office only such persons as are willing to qualify in the manner described, the first announcement of such an intention would be the signal for unscrupulous self-seekers of every class to rush into the church. Then indeed would the prophetic utterance be fulfilled, "Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird." Rev. 18:2.

Any moral ruler over the individual other than God, is popery. God has no vicars or lieutenants on this earth; he has only ambassadors. And the adult individual who cannot rule himself, conformably to the principles of popular sovereignty, in that which pertains simply to his secular affairs, is fit only to be an inmate of some institution of charity.
