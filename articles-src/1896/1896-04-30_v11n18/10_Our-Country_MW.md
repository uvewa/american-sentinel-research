OUR COUNTRY.

BY MAY WAKEHAM.

WHEN speaking of the injustice of Sunday laws, seventh day observers are often met with the response, "If you don't like our country and our laws you can go somewhere else"—just as if this country was created, and its Constitution and laws enacted for the sole benefit of first-day observers!

To such the writer would respectfully suggest that this is our country as well as theirs. We owe allegiance to the same God and Creator, whose will it is that all his creatures should enjoy the blessings of life, and who "maketh the sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust."

Our ancestors, as well as theirs, laid down their lives to free this country from the hand of oppression, that their children might enjoy "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness," and the privilege of "worshipping God according to the dictates of their own consciences." When rebellion reared its head in our midst, our fathers stood shoulder to shoulder to uphold the Government.

This is our native land, and we love it.

We love the "Star Spangled Banner," and have sung with fervent hearts

Long may it wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave.

We love its broad plains, its sunlit mountains, and its mighty rivers, and with feelings of pride see it exalted to a leading position among the nations.

But it is with deep regret and sadness that we see the spirit of religious bigotry and persecution abroad in the land, and the liberties purchased by the life blood of some of earth's noblest sons fast being taken from us. Our fair country is on the down grade, and it is with dark forebodings of evil we look into her future.

Yes, we love our country and yield glad obedience to her just laws. But we love our God more, and when laws are enacted which come in conflict with his law, instead of fleeing for our lives like shame-faced criminals, we can but stand firmly for what our consciences and our Bibles tell us is the truth and suffer the penalty, trusting in him who has said: "Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake. Rejoice, and be exceedingly glad: for great is your reward in heaven; for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you." Matt. 5:11, 12.

Fremont, Nebr.
