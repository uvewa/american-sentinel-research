## SPIRITUALISM.

What is It? Its Origin, Character, and the End of It.

BY G. MORSE GREEN.

"AND the Lord God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die." Gen. 2:16, 17.

"And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die: for God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil." Gen. 3:4, 5.

Here was the first and greatest deception ever brought to bear upon the human race by the arch-enemy of God. If we study well the character of this first fatal delusion, it will give us the key to every other deception of Satan. It was a direct contradiction of the word of God and an emphatic assertion that man would not "surely die;" and that, therefore, he was himself a god. "And ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil." After Adam and Eve had yielded to Satan's deceptive assurance and had partaken of the forbidden fruit, God told them plainly that the death sentence meant: Thou shalt "return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken; for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return." Gen. 3:19.

Although God's word was fulfilled in the case of Adam and Eve, and their posterity from that day to this, Satan has continued to zealously promulgate the same falsehood ever since.

"There shall not be found among you any one that maketh his son or his daughter to pass through the fire, or that ureth divination, or an observer of times, or an enchanter, or a witch, or a charmer, or a consulter with familiar spirits, or a wizavi, or a necromancer. For all that do these things are an abomination unto the Lord." Deut. 18:10-12.

The last-day workings of this deception are

seen in what is termed, "Spiritualism," and are manifested through its mediums by means of "rapping," "slate-writing," "mind-reading," "materializing," "calling on the dead," etc. Spiritualists everywhere claim that their communications are from those who have died, and whom they claim are not dead, but have really entered another state of existence. Hence, the conclusion of the whole deception is that man possesses inherent immortality, and therefore needs not even to know of God in order to possess eternal life.

That the spirits consulted by mediums are the spirits of devils impersonating people who have died, and are not the spirits of the persons themselves, is very clearly taught in the Bible. It explicitly states that "the dead know not anything," and that their "thoughts perish," in which condition it would be impossible to hold any communication with them whatever. "His sons come to honor, and he knowsth it not; and they are brought low, but he perceiveth it not of them." Job 14:21. "His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts perish." Ps. 146:4. "For the living know that they shall die; but the dead know not anything, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten. Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy is now perished; neither have they any more a portion forever in anything that is done under the sun." Eccl. 9:5, 6.

"Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God; because many false prophets are gone out into the world." 1 John 4:1. "To the law and to the testimony; if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them." Isa. 8:20. "For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, together them to the battle of the great day of God Almighty." Rev. 16:14. "There is a way that seemeth right unto a man; but the end thereof are the ways of death." Prov. 14:12.

"The blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords; who only hath immortality" (1 Tim. 6:15, 16), is "the resurrection, and the life."
