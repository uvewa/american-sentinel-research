**HOPE THOU IN CONGRESS.**

*[Evangel and Sabbath Outlook.]*

The address of Rev. G. W. M. Rigor at a Sabbath Reform Convention held Dec. 23, 1895, in Lebanon, Pa., contains the following suggestive paragraph:—

While there are many noble exceptions to this rule, yet the fact remains that the great bulk of Sabbath-desecration in our land is perpetrated by those of foreign birth, a large proportion of whom are almost totally ignorant of the genius of our American institutions, and further, are loyal to a foreign ecclesiastical power that seeks to transform the American Christian sabbath into the Sunday of Continental Europe. Our hope is in the United States Congress, and unless it speedily brings relief by enacting laws which will restrict emigration to those only who are worthy and who are willing to become bona fide citizens of our great Republic and act in harmony with our institutions, the most serious consequences may result.

Slight analysis of the past is necessary to show that this influx of foreign Sabbathlessness is only transferring to America the fruits of the popular, yet false, theory that the Sabbath is abrogated and that Sunday is in its place as a day of the church and custom. What Mr. Rigor complains of is the result of the same popular errors which pervade America at the present time.

But the point we desire to fix in the mind of the reader is that this representative of "National Reform" along religious lines, this advocate of putting God's name and Christ's into the National Constitution in order to make this a "Christian Nation," reveals the unutterable weakness of that movement when he says: "Our hope is in the United States Congress," etc. His conclusion is logical,

but none the less self-condemnatory. When the leaders of a movement like the National Reform and kindred Sunday-supporting movements build their greatest hope on Congress, failure is not far away. But they cannot do otherwise consistently. Having cast the Sabbath of Jehovah and the example of Christ away, having staked all upon the "Civil Sabbath" issue, there is no other logical conclusion, even though it be the most broken of reeds to lean upon.
