RELIGION AND POLITICS.

BY J. R. LOW.

It will not be disputed by anyone who is acquainted with the Christian religion, who is acquainted with its fruits, who knows, by experience, what it is to have the law of love to God and man inwrought into the soul—it will not be disputed by any such that the more real true Christians there are in the nation,—in politics and in office—the better it will be for the nation and the safer will be the rights and liberties of the people.

But there are two radically different views as to how religion will affect politics and the government.

One view is expressed in the following words from the Christian Statesman, of January 23:—

The duty of serving the Lord is binding equally everywhere. Can it be that God has bound men by moral law every place but one? Can it be that he left the great organization of the government, with its tremendous possibilities, both of good and evil, unaccountable, without moral and organic power for its control? This is true if the folly of modern State philosophy be true that religion has nothing to do with politics.

By a careful study we may resolve the above into the two following syllogisms:—

1. (1) Men are bound by moral law in all places.

(2) Governments are composed of men.

(3) Therefore governments are accountable to moral law.

2. (1) Governments are accountable to moral law.

(2) The "modern State philosophy" that religion has nothing to do with politics is contrary to government accountability to moral law.

(3) "Modern State philosophy" that religion has nothing to do with politics, is not true.

The fallacy of this may be seen by noticing that in the major premise of the first syllogism the term "men" is used indicating individual men; while in the minor premise and also in the conclusion the term "government" is used, indicating a collection or association of men; and this conclusion being made the major premise in the second syllogism, its conclusion must also be false.

This view of the personal accountability of government to moral law arraigns as false "modern State philosophy" which, as stated by Washington and Jefferson and Madison, was, that "the Government of the United States is not in any sense founded on the Christian religion," and "religion is wholly exempt" from the cognizance of civil government. If it is indeed true that these principles, laid down by the founders of this Government are false, it is time the people were finding it out.

There are several difficulties in the way of the government's setting up a standard of religion in politics.

It is forever impossible for the government to devise any means of reaching the thoughts and intents of the heart, and therefore in any standard that the State might see fit to set up it would have to be content with outward forms and creeds which the most corrupt and hypocritical office-seeker on earth would have no difficulty in subscribing to, while the man of honest conviction who should happen to disagree with the government standard and who had the strength of character to live up to his convictions, regardless of all worldly gain, would be shut out of office; thus the government would be turned into a manufactory of hypocrites, while at the same time closing the door of office to all dissenters however honest.

Again, if the government should set up a standard of religion in politics, it would not in so doing put into a single selfish office-seeking heart, that law of love to God and man which is able to transform the motives and desires of every one who yields to its claims; the ambitious office-seeker is as ambitious as ever, and those corrupt means that he would resort to before without any pretense of piety, he can now resort to under the garb of piety and the protection of the church.

These considerations are enough to show that any standard of religion in politics which the State should endeavor to set up would be a standard in name only and not in fact.

Does, then, "modern State philosophy" say that religion has nothing to do with politics? We answer, No; it is not the fact, but the how, that is in dispute.

The other view of this question is that religion has no other way of affecting politics than to transform the lives of individuals, by putting the law of love to God and man in their hearts.

What will be the effect of having this law written in the heart of the voter? He would not sell his vote for a glass of whiskey, for a few dollars, nor for the hope of preferment after election. But, holding the welfare of all his fellow-citizens equally as dear as his own, he would cast his ballot in accordance with what, after careful thought and study, he considered the best interests of his country, regardless of selfish interest. This law of love in the heart of the voter will lead him to protest against the infringement of the rights of a very small minority or of even a single individual, even though his own personal interests be in no way concerned, as quickly and as strenuously as if his own interests were directly concerned.

What will be the effect of having this law of love to God and man inwrought into the heart of the office-seekers? He will not lie to

the public for the sake of gaining votes, but will be honest and open-hearted. He will not sell himself to the whiskey ring nor any other ring for the sake of patronage. He will not sell his Christianity for office.

Lastly, what will be the effect upon the office-holder of having this law of love in his heart? It will make him honest; he will not receive bribes; he will hold the rights of others as sacred as he holds his own; he will hold the interests of his country too dear to betray them for selfish motives. That is, a man cannot be a Christian in private life and at the same time a corrupt office-holder. If he has the true spirit of Christianity, is a Christian, it will be manifest in every act of his life.

Since it is impossible for the State to set up a standard of religion that would put this law of love to God and man in the heart of a single individual, without which all profession is vain; and since it is impossible for the State to judge as to who has this law written in his heart, it must be apparent to all that the only way that religion can favorably affect politics is through the heart of the individual.
