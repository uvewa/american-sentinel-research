GRANT AND GARFIELD ON THE UNION OF CHURCH AND STATE.

BY WM. PENNIMAN.

In his message to Congress in 1875, General Grant said: "I would call your attention to the importance of correcting an evil that, if permitted to continue, will probably lead to great trouble in our land before the close of the nineteenth century. It is the acquisition of vast amounts of untaxed church property. In 1850, I believe, the church property of the United States, which paid no tax, municipal or State, amounted to $87,000,000. In 1860, the amount had doubled. In 1870, it was $354,483,587. By 1900, without a check, it is safe to say this property will reach a sum exceeding $3,000,000,000. So vast a sum, receiving all the protection and benefits of government without bearing its proportion of the burdens and expenses of the same, will not be looked upon acquiescently by those who have to pay the taxes. In a growing country, where real estate enhances so rapidly with time as in the United States, there is scarcely a limit to the wealth that may be acquired by corporations, religious or otherwise, if allowed to retain real estate without taxation. The contemplation of so vast a property as here alluded to, without taxation, may lead to sequestration without constitutional authority, and through blood. I would suggest the taxation of all property equally."

James A. Garfield said in Congress: "The divorce between the Church and State ought to be absolute. It ought to be so absolute that no church property anywhere, in any State or in the nation, should be exempt from equal taxation; for if you exempt the property of any church organization, to that extent you impose a tax upon the whole community."

In the preceding we have the thoughts of men who attained the highest honors the nation could bestow upon them, men of eminent ability and sagacity, men who were highly respected by both the religious and the political world. One of them has said, "Keep the Church and State forever separate." The other uses equally as strong language in saying that "the divorce between Church and State ought to be absolute." Yet, strange to tell, many would-be National Reformers, who formerly admired the teachings of those men, now in their blind zeal not only ignore what they said, but what the founders of our Constitution have said, and greatest of all what Christ has said; and would not only exempt church property from taxation, but would so amend our Constitution as to enforce a "civil" Sunday upon the people and thus compel not only the worship of the Papacy but also of his image.
