Having shown in another column that "National Reform" principles have been espoused by the great Christian Endeavor Society, some reader who has not studied the "Reform" movement may inquire what is the ultimate object of the movement.

The following quotations from the official report of the "Hearing before the Committee on the Judiciary, House of Representatives, March 11, 1896, on H. Res. 28," will show what the movement really means. The dialogue quoted is between the chairman of the committee having the resolution in charge, (Congressman Ray of New York), and Dr. David McAllister, editor of the *Christian Statesman*, the official organ of the National Reform Association:—

**THE CHAIRMAN**—I want to get at exactly what you mean here. I read from your proposed amendment—

We, the people of the United States (acknowledging Alonishly God as the source of all power and authority in civil government, the Lord Jesus Christ as the ruler of nations, and his revealed will as supreme authority in civil affairs)—

In civil affairs. That is the point. What do you refer to by his revealed will?

**DR. McALLISTER**—The Bible.

**THE CHAIRMAN**—Then you wish the Constitution to recognize the Bible as supreme authority in civil affairs, do you not?

**DR. McALLISTER**—Yes, sir.

**THE CHAIRMAN**—Then the supreme authority—that is, law—in civil affairs must be construed and enforced by the courts, must it not?

**DR. McALLISTER**—Certainly.

**THE CHAIRMAN**—Then the next step would be that the construction of the Bible would be thrown into the courts, and you would have conflicting decisions, and instead of leaving men to determine the meaning of the Bible in these affairs according to the dictates of their own intelligence and conscience, you would have judicial decisions, would you not?

**DR. McALLISTER**—I will answer your question as soon as you get through.

**THE CHAIRMAN**—You deny that?

**DR. McALLISTER**—I deny it as you put it, and I will explain.

**THE CHAIRMAN**—Well, do you think if this amendment were adopted that the construction of the Bible and its meaning would be open to the courts at all?

**DR. McALLISTER**—No, sir.

**THE CHAIRMAN**—You don't intend that?

**DR. McALLISTER**—Not in the way you put it.

The Chairman.—Do you intend it at all?

Dr. McAllister.—I will tell you if you will give me the opportunity. I will give you a full answer.

The Chairman.—I want to know whether you intend at all to subject the true meaning of the Bible itself to the construction of the courts?

Dr. McAllister.—No, sir; it cannot come in that way.

The Chairman.—It is not a question of whether it would or would not. I ask you what you intend.

Dr. McAllister.—This is what is intended: Let me give you an illustration. You had the question in Congress as to whether the gates of the World's Fair should be kept open on Sabbath or not. That was a practical question, and that was a question on which the lawmaking power had to decide. Now, Congress must take into consideration, as it did then, what the word of God says. The Senator from Pennsylvania sent up to the Clerk's desk a copy of the Bible with the page marked on which was "Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy."

A Voice.—That is the seventh day.

Dr. McAllister.—It is not the seventh day. "Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy." That is what it says. There was a case of Congress having to decide whether the gates would be open on a particular day or not and the appeal was made to the authority of the Divine Word. The Congress, having the lawmaking power, having thus decided, the courts should be bound by the lawmaking power, for it is not the business of the courts to make laws.

Mr. Burton.—Now, suppose we adopt this amendment, and a party should be arrested for breaking the Sabbath, the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday; that he should be convicted, and he should appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States, and say, "You have adopted the Bible as the standard in civil affairs," claiming that the Sabbath day is Saturday, and that the Supreme Court of the United States should decide that it was Saturday?

Dr. McAllister.—The Supreme Court of the United States would have to go by the law.

Mr. Burton.—Very well; but when they did go by it that is the end of it.

Dr. McAllister.—Certainly.

Mr. Burton.—Now, do you want to put into the Constitution of the United States a clause which will permit the Supreme Court of the United States to say that you must keep Saturday or else you violate the law of the land?

Dr. McAllister.—No, sir.

Mr. Burton.—That is just what you are trying to do.

Dr. McAllister.—Not at all.

Mr. Burton.—Every lawyer here will tell you that.

Mr. Burton—Is not this the theory: Each man regards the day he believes to be the Sabbath and the Government protects him in his worship from disturbance or interference?

Dr. McAllister.—Not only must this be the case in regard to every man, but the State and the nation must decide for themselves whether they will keep one day or not.

Mr. Connolly—Suppose the Bible has already settled that question, how could any act of Congress interfere with it if that is to be in the Constitution.

Dr. McAllister—Because we must interpret the Bible. [Laughter.]

The committee thus drew out, and Dr. McAllister was forced to confess, exactly what the National Reform Association lately reinforced by the Christian Endeavor Society and the National Christian Citizenship League, really means.

Reader, are you in favor of this movement? If not, have you the courage of your convictions to oppose it in the interests of pure Christianity and just civil government?
