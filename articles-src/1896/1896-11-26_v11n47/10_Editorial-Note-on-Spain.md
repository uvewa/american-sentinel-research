THE Western Watchman (Catholic), of November 12, makes the statement that "Spain is the only civilized country in the world to-day where there is a perfect union of Church and State." We do not question the statement in the least, but we call to mind the fact that no civilized country in the world is so little envied to-day as Spain. The Watchman adds that "If there is any benefit in that union we should not begrudge it to glorious old Catholic Spain." It is very safe to say that no nation begrudges Spain any "benefit" on this score. The magnificent ruin of national greatness which this union has bequeathed to Spain, and which all the world beholds to-day, ought to constitute an object lesson upon the results of church and State union which would cause every civilized country on earth to shrink from the slightest step which might tend in that direction.
