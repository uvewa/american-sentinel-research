AMONG the utterances which have been called forth from various quarters by the peculiar nature of the President's Thanksgiving proclamation, the following from the New York Christian Advocate, the leading Methodist organ in this country, is very significant. Having remarked upon the "extreme evangelical orthodoxy" of the proclamation, it says:—

This is significant. No doubt atheists, anarchists, and the coarser class of infidels will make it the text for such ebullitions of blasphemy as are as natural to them and as necessary to their happiness—if such a word as happiness can be applied to persons "without God and without hope in the world"—as its peculiar laughter is to a hyena.

Thus does the leading organ of the great Methodist denomination give its sanction to this un-American proceeding of the chief executive, and manifest its regard for those classes of our citizens whom the President, in his official capacity as their representative, has ignored. It is significant, but it is not strange. For it has ever been the case that when a religious body was in a condition to view with joy the prospect of distinctive recognition from the State, it was ready to treat as hyenas not only the irreligious classes, but other church bodies as well.

What would the Christian Advocate have said if the President had gone a step further and put into his proclamation not only an allusion to Jesus Christ, but to the Virgin Mary and a few of the Catholic "saints"? Does not the Advocate know that there are other steps yet to be taken in the process of making such documents definitely "Christian"? And when it has been decided who are "Christians" in the eye of the Government, the Advocate may find itself in a position to receive sympathy from those whom it now derides.

From the words of the Advocate, it is evident that the consequences which Jefferson foresaw must follow such proclamations are now upon the country: "It must be meant that this recommendation is to carry some authority, and to be sanctioned by some penalty on those who disregard it: not, indeed, of fine and imprisonment, but of some degree of proscription, perhaps in public opinion." That penalty of proscription is to-day inflicted, and that in no small degree.
