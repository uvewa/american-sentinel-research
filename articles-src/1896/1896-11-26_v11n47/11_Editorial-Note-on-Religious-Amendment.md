THE National Reformers have already begun their movement upon Congress at its coming session. Two weeks ago they sent throughout the country, all at one mailing, 60,000 memorials and blank petitions to be filled up and sent to the secretary of the National Reform Association, at Allegheny, Pa., to be taken by the National Reformers to Washington and presented to Congress, calling for the establishment of their religion as the national religion. The directions accompanying the blanks are to "Put them in the hands of some active young men or women in your congregation or vicinity, the W. C. T. U., the Christian Endeavor or other young people's society committees, or any party who will energetically circulate them." Further, that "twenty or more men or women in your vicinity shall without fail write a brief letter to Hon. Geo. F. Hoar, chairman of the Judiciary Committee of the Senate, and Hon. David B. Henderson, chairman of the Judiciary Committee of the House of Representatives, urging this amendment, and when the matter comes up before the Committee or in Congress, will you not make sure to have a half dozen telegrams sent to the same persons urging the submission of the amendment." The managers of this move say that it "is expected to attract much attention." We shall do all we can to keep the country informed on the question. Therefore every reader of this should subscribe for the AMERICAN SENTINEL, and get his neighbors to subscribe. This is of great importance to you.
