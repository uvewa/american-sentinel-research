"The church was as though incrusted in an order of things which wounded the public conscience; the altar was the strongest support of the ancient social edifice. Every aspiration towards reform, every tendency to progress, meeting it from its first start, as an obstacle and a barrier, beat against it with rage. The result was that generosity of mind speedily became irreligious. All that was young in heart, and burning to vindicate right and liberty, was thereby even predisposed to repel Christianity at the outset.

"The eighteenth century has seized a great idea, which is a daughter of the gospel: it is the idea of humanity; the idea of human right, claimed in the face of privileges which are its negation. And it is found that the church has taken part beforehand against this human right which she ought to have been the first to proclaim, since she had in her hands the Book which, in a society profoundly divided, had caused those immortal words, the charter of equality and of true liberty, to resound: 'Before Christ there are neither slaves nor freemen.' Gal. 3:28. Thus by the fault of her representatives, the religion which, with the divine idea, brought into the world the grand idea of humanity and of its rights, is considered by generous minds as the enemy which it is necessary to strike down, and that in order to realize their own programme.

"The seventeenth century . . . had even formulated the theory of its practice in a book due to its greatest orator [Bossuet] who had graven for posterity, in an immortal style, the maxims of the double despotism, destined to raise so much indignation some years later—'La Politique tirée de l'Ecriture Saiste' (Politics drawn from the Holy Scriptures) that learned catechism in which royalty without control, and a clergy without restraint, are taught how, by uniting, they may entirely enslave a nation, may be considered as the testament of the seventeenth century."

"The book of Bossuet is the apotheosis of the ancient régime, and of its worst abuses. The king appears in it as a god, whose countenance rejoices his people like the sun, and whose indisputable caprices ought to be received on their knees. . . . There is no right in the face of the royal right—I am mistaken—there is the right of the priest, for whom alone Bossuet causes to be heard a haughty claim. All the property of the nation belongs to the king, except that of the Levites with which he ought to concern himself only to increase it.

"A king who well understands his duties, does not rest contented with opening his treasures to the church in order to enrich her; remembering that she has a horror of blood, but that she, nevertheless, has need of it, he lends to her his sword, or, rather, he turns it against her enemies, pursues them, and sacrifices them to the greater glory of God, as at the revocation of the Edict of Nantes. Heresy is not tolerated in the happy country that he governs. 'Those who do not wish to suffer the prince to use severity in the matter of religion, because religion ought to be free, are in impious error.' Bossuet recalls the oath taken by the very Christian king on the day of his coronation, and the solemn engagement that he takes to exterminate heresy.

"All these beautiful theories are supported by passages of Holy Scripture, the true sense of which is completely disfigured, despite the beauty of the translation, because the learned bishop applied to modern societies that which was suitable only to the theocracy of Israel, essentially transitory like the whole of Judaism. He arrives thus at this double result, of causing hatred altogether both towards monarchy and Christianity, and of surely preparing the most dangerous revolution."—*De Pressensè* "The Church, and the French Revolution," pp. 5-8.
