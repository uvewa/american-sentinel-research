The American Sentinel was established in 1886 to expose the danger of there being fastened upon the country the papal principle of the union of Church and State. Previous to its establishment there had been organized within the Reformed Presbyterian Church a society, called the National Reform Association. This association declared that the national Constitution was an "infidel document." In order to convert this "infidel document," it was advocated "that in the written Constitution of the United States there should be unequivocal acknowledgment of Almighty God as the ultimate source of civil power and authority, the avowal of allegiance to his Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, as the ruler of nations, and the acceptance of the recorded will of God [the Bible] as the supreme rule of national action."

When the American Sentinel first appeared, the religious and secular press of the country was opposed to the National Reform movement. It was thought to be merely a Covenanter idea that would never get beyond the Reformed Presbyterian Church, which the Independent, in speaking of the matter, called "the smallest of the split P's."

The American Sentinel drawing its views from the Sure Word, declared that these principles of Church and State union would eventually pervade all the popular denominations, and through that would seize the national power. It predicted that they would unite to force from legislators, laws enforcing certain religious dogmas, especially Sunday observance, upon all the people.

It is the purpose of this article to show that this destructive principle has gained a controlling influence in the councils of that gigantic federation of church forces, known as the United Societies of Christian Endeavor; and "Christian Endeavor," it is well known, is leading the church elements of the nation. Quotations from the "Official Report" of the Fifteenth International Christian Endeavor convention held at Washington, D. C., July 8-13, 1896, are here submitted, which certainly make this so plain, as to be undeniable by any one. First, is the official Christian Endeavor description of the National Reform scene at the National Capitol on "Banner Day" of their convention:

### Fifty Thousand Strong.

"What a spectacle! The wide space enclosed by the East and West wings of the National Capitol was one sea of human beings, a flowing sea, with currents and tides, with streams of humanity pouring into it from all avenues, with great bays stretching out along East Capitol Street and Delaware and Maryland Avenues, and with three mighty waves breaking upon and covering the flights of Capitol steps."

"The Capitol windows were crowded, and the crowd overflowed onto the Library grounds, and surged up on the pedestals of statues and bases of fountains; and pushed hard on the full areas allotted to carriages.

And the white figure of George Washington rose serene from the midst of it all. Was the spirit of the great patriot there, rejoicing over this, the mightiest gathering of young patriots ever seen in the country he loved, or in this wide world? Never before has our Government permitted the area around the Capitol, the very heart of the nation, to be used for other than governmental purposes. And, indeed, a governmental purpose was that since the fifty thousand represent nearly three million of young people whose force of character will make them the country's governors before many a moon has passed. That grand exhibition of young manhood and womanhood is the clearest omen yet seen of the coming time when Christ, whose right it is to reign, shall be supreme on Capitol Hill."

The foregoing is taken from pages 286 and 289 of the Society's "Official Report." The reader may ask, Why call it a "National Reformers" scene? The answer will be made plain. Let the description of the scene continue.

"The trustees of the United Societies filled one stone outpost. Justice Harlan's strong face and giant form was conspicuous in the fair setting of the topmost row of the chorus. The speaker's stand was filled with Dr. Clark, Secretary Baer, Chairman Smith, Director Foster, Dr. McCrory, of Pennsylvania [Dr. McCrory is one of the Directors of the National Reform Association, a contributing editor of the Christian Statesman, and President of the Pennsylvania Christian Endeavor Society], and Dr. J. Z. Tyler, of Ohio.

"'Holy, holy, holy!' fit opening chorus that! And how the over four thousand young voices bore that glorious hymn to heaven. Dr. McCrory offered prayer, and then Dr. Clark made a brief address."

## Presenting the Banner.

Dr. Clark is the founder and President of the Christian Endeavor Society, and the occasion is the presentation of the "Christian Citizenship Banner," which is presented annually to the local society that has been the most active in the modern church movement known as "Christian Citizenship." One of the principal objects of this movement is the enforcement of Sunday laws. In presenting this banner Dr. Clark said in part:—

Just a word before I present the banner to the Local Union that has reported the best work in promoting Christian Citizenship. What a glorious spectacle is this—these tens of thousands! I think this scene will be photographed upon our minds as long as we live. We shall never forget the sight at the Capitol of the nation. It means that Christian Endeavor stands for Christian Citizenship. That is the significance of this meeting. . . Many cities have done excellently, but Cleveland excelled them all. . . In the name of the United Societies I present this banner to the representative of Cleveland, Rev. J. Z. Tyler, D. D., who will accept it in the name of the fair city by the lake.

Dr. Tyler, in his speech accepting the banner, said:—

No clearer demonstration of the divine touch upon the heart of him who has led us in this movement, can be found anywhere than in the suggestion that Christian Endeavor shall give special attention to Christian Citizenship.

Following Dr. Tyler's speech, the "Official Report" gives this description of the scene in its next phase:—

After these stirring exercises came the praise service. Of course the Marine Band made matchless music. Of course the regiments of Endeavurers faithfully applauded every patriotic piece, gayly swinging flaps and hats and umbrellas to the more sprightly tones, such as "Yankee Doodle." And of course Mr. Foster's tremendous chorus took hold on the very heavens. The international hymn, "America," "There is a Royal Banner," Dr. S. F. Smith's "The Cross and Victory," and Mr. Foster's own "Loyal Soldiers,"—those were the songs they sung.

Finally came the march down historic Pennsylvania Avenue. The Marine Band led the way with inspiring strains. There followed the trustees of the United Societies. Dr. Tyler (one of the trustees) bore his Christian Citizenship banner. In the center were the officers of the United Society. Very appropriately there followed the noble Committee of '96, and then came the mighty army of Endeavorers, pouring down Capitol Hill in an endless stream.

"What a spectacle!" What momentous meaning in these marching thousands with the millions they represent. Marching behind a banner which embodies the blighting principles of National Reform, of Statechurchism, of Roman Catholicism, of the "image of the beast."

What a scene for the vision of the student of prophecy is this mighty arm of twenty-five federated churches, fifty thousand strong, the representatives of many millions more, with crusader enthusiasm, marching in confident expectation that through "Christian Citizenship," through human law, they are to bring Christ to reign as king on Capitol Hill!

## "Christian Citizenship."

Thursday evening preceding the scenes here described was devoted to the subject of "Christian Citizenship." Fifty-three pages of the "Official Report" are devoted to a report of the addresses on this theme, with the following introduction:—

Under two mammoth tents, in half a dozen churches, and within one great hall of the city, thousands of Christian Endeavurers gathered to raise songs of praise to God, and to listen to addresses by distinguished speakers on the duties of Christian Citizenship.

A few quotations from the speeches will convince the reader that this movement embodies the principles of National Reform which the SENTINEL has been exposing from its first number:—

If we are praying for the preservation of our Sabbath, we must demand the nomination and election of men who will uphold its sanctity.—Official Report, p. 105.

The trouble at the garden of Eden was that Adam and Eve went out and Satan stayed in. Here we must stay in and put Satan out, and we will have Paradise regained. What are some of those evils which threaten to spoil the Almighty's design in America? What are some of the devils which Christian Citizenship should cast out? . . . The second great evil which on account of its direful effect may be called a Devil is Sabbath desecration.

Upon our national sky are clouds as black and threatening as ever three their shadows or rolled their thunders over a people. Flacy your ear to the ground and you will hear voices that bode no good to our country. . . . Let it ["Christian Citizenship"] stand for the Sabbath. Let it apply the gospel, and all of it, to the faith of the nation.—Pp. 107, 108.

Taking an interest in politics does not mean that the minister of the gospel should bring politics into the pulpit, but it does mean that he should take his pulpit into politics. It does not mean that he should bring politics into church, but it does mean, most emphatically, that the church should be translated into political power.—P. 109.

Any Endeavorer may be as much a missionary of God in American politics as in the forests of Africa.—P. 117.

To the Christian Endeavorer, politics means an instrument of righteousness, and party but the scaffolding around the rising kingdom of God.—P. 111.

To whom should our country look to give us these ["a new conception of patriotism, a comprehension of civic duty"] but to us, her Christian young people? . . . With our sisters we will strike hands that this country shall cast out her devils, and, sitting at the feet of Jesus, be clothed and in her right mind. We will no longer be silence-keepers to hell, but we will live for God; we will fight for God. And when we can no longer fight we will pray for the mildew of God's wrath on "whosoever worketh abomination," or would delay the coming of the kingdom of God. . . . We will force respect for the Sabbath.—P. 123.

## A Great Change Has Come.

The next recorded speech is that delivered by Dr. J. T. McCrory, one of the directors of the National Reform Association, a contributing editor of the Christian Statesman, its official organ, and president of the Pennsylvania Christian Endeavor Association. This speaker saw everything to encourage the heart of a National Reformer. A great change had come over the Christian Endeavor movement. This change was noted by Chairman Page, who presided at the Christian Citizenship meeting held in Central Hall. He said that—

A few years ago it might have been necessary to apologize for introducing the subject, "Christian Citizenship," into a Christian Endeavor meeting, but it was now a timely topic.—P. 129.

Dr. McCrory, referring to this same change in sentiment, said:—

Let me call your attention to the fact that the aspect of the cross is undergoing a great change in this regard. There was a time, not so long ago either, when the cross was viewed almost exclusively in reference to the salvation of the individual. . . . Now, if I understand it aright, it is one purpose of this great Endeavor movement to enthrone Christ in our national life. . . . Over yonder in Scotland they have just been engaged in doing honor to the memory of the martyrs of former centuries. Who are these men? They are the men who sought in their day to get Christ into national life, and they lost their heads for it. They stood, in their day, for what they called "the crown rights of King Jesus." The same thing precisely that the Christian Citizenship movement of Christian Endeavor stands for in this country to day.—P. 127.

From the same official report, we find others speaking as follows:—

It will only be when Christian men, whose thought has been quickened by the divine life and energized by the Holy Spirit, are elevated to the places of trust and honor and landed as heroes by the patriotic sentiment of the Republic that Christian Citizenship will have reached the acme of its claims, and the government will become in fact as well as in name a Christian government.—P. 139.

Stand by every business man who closes store or factory on Sunday. Patronize him as far as possible. Bring all possible pressure to bear upon any who refuse to close.—P. 305.

We have a right to make and enforce human statutes that call for the observance of the laws of God. As a matter of fact, we have in every State in the Union but one, what might be called fairly good Sabbath laws. . . . Let us see to it that laws now in existence are enforced. . . . The home mission problem in all the denominations will be largely solved as soon as Sabbath laws are enforced.—Pp. 304, 305.

The foregoing quotations are sufficient to sustain the assertion that the "Christian Endeavor Society" has been transformed into a great "National Reform" Endeavor Society, engaged in disseminating with startling rapidity among the rank and file of the twenty-five confederate churches which it represents, the cruel, persecuting principles of State-enforced religion.

No one who has not attended these "Christian Citizenship" meetings can begin to realize the zeal and enthusiasm manifested. These gatherings are composed largely of young people between the ages of twenty and forty who are thoroughly persuaded that their organization is destined to usher in the kingdom of God, a millennium of righteousness, when He whose right it is will come and reign. This strong incentive, together with the fact that they have coupled with this movement some worthy objects such as temperance reform, etc., make of them a zealous host hardly second in misdirected enthusiasm to the Crusaders of the Middle Ages. The National Reform movement, in this new form, is as much more dangerous than the original National Reform Association, as the influence of this powerful federation exceeds that of the old National Reform organization.

The words of the Author of Liberty should arouse every friend of true Christianity and of human freedom. "Can ye not discern the signs of the times?"
