No person who reads this number of the AMERICAN SENTINEL can fail to see that there is a mighty contest on hand—a contest that means everything to this nation. You must take one side or the other in this conflict. If you decide to take sides with the Constitution as the fathers of the Republic framed it, and with the forces led by the AMERICAN SENTINEL in defense of it, then you must have the paper to learn how the contest progresses, and the best means of defending your position. On the other hand, if you are in favor of the movement of the confederated church forces to force religious institutions upon the people by human law, then you should read the AMERICAN SENTINEL, the acknowledged leader of the forces opposing your movement, that you may know the arguments of the "other side." Perchance you may find yourself in error. In any event, be you friend or foe, you cannot afford to be without the AMERICAN SENTINEL. Don't miss a single issue. Subscribe now. Terms below.
