The allusion to a divine Mediator in the Thanksgiving proclamation of President Cleveland, has produced no small stir in religious circles, especially among the Jews, many of whom see in it a direct insult to their religion. From this it may be imagined what the effect would be of an attempt to establish a national religion, as is demanded by the party who want God in the Constitution.

The Greek Church seems to be as little reconciled to Roman Catholic heresy as to the doctrines of the Stundists, notwithstanding the efforts of Pope Leo for reconciliation. Recently a Russian priest named Tolstoi was sentenced to seven years' banishment from St. Petersburg and Moscow and to twenty years' deprivation of the right to hold any office, because of a refusal to clear himself of the charge of having become a Catholic.

Among various reasons that are urged nowadays in support of Sunday laws, we see it stated that employés of bake-shops and confectionery stores ask for the enactment of such a law to "regulate their sanitary conditions." The idea seems to be that without a Sunday law, unsanitary conditions in such places are unavoidable. We have always supposed that unsanitary conditions in a place of business were a disgrace and never justifiable under any circumstances. That is the principle upon which modern sanitary science proceeds, and we believe it is sound doctrine. If people do not maintain sanitary conditions about them it is because they do not have a proper regard for cleanliness.

Among press dispatches of the 16th inst., we note the following:

CHICAGO, Nov. 16.—Playing football on Thanksgiving day was denounced by the Methodist ministers of Chicago at their regular weekly meeting to day. It was contended that if the game of that day were persisted in, the original spirit of the day would become lost. Resolutions were adopted by precating the custom, requesting those in authority to "fix such hours for the games on the coming Thanksgiving day, if they must be played, as shall not conflict with the hours of divine services in the churches," and requesting that no arrangements for games on that day be made hereafter.

Coupling this with the fact of the sectarian character of the current national Thanksgiving proclamation, it becomes evident that this institution is playing quite a part in the movement to establish a national religion.

The following item from the New York Morning Advertiser, of November 16, shows how the agitation for Sunday observance is having its effect upon the ranks of organized labor:

There was a well attended meeting of the Central Labor Union in Clarendon Hall yesterday. Delegate William J. O'Brien, of the Granite Cutters' Union, presided, with Delegate Lawrence as vice chairman.

There was great excitement when Delegate Henry, of the Wood Carvers' Union, reported a startling violation of the Sunday law. "Several members of our union," he said, "were passing through Elizabeth Street this morning when they noticed a wood carving factory in full blast. The machinery was all humming, and every workman was at his bench. It was simply scandalous.

"Our members promptly went on to the Elizabeth Street police station, and informed the sergeant behind the desk. That official called out the reserves, who got into the factory, turned out the workmen, and closed it up for the day. Right across the street a tin pail factory was also going, but as it was not in our line of business we didn't interfere with it."

Up to the present time the labor unions have not been actively identified with the movement for Sunday enforcement. In some instances they have resented the attempts of Sunday-law agitators to make use of their organizations to further the Sunday cause. It seems now, however, that they are beginning to fall into line with the various church and religious societies, to swell the mighty procession that is moving to erect the standard of religion upon the citadel of national government.

The idea that Sunday laws possess value from a sanitary standpoint is closely related to the doctrine so much in evidence that such laws are necessary to prevent people from doing too much work. This doctrine is persistently urged, notwithstanding that the great cry of workingmen for years has been for legislation that will enable them to do work enough. The greatest trouble with the workingmen to-day, and the greatest menace, probably, to prosperity and peace in our land, lies in the fact that so many thousands in all parts find themselves without anything to do at all. It certainly will not help this situation to reduce the amount of work and the number of workers by means of Sunday laws.

The park commissioners of Boston, Mass., have been petitioned by the "New England Sabbath Protective League" to grant open parks on Sundays "for sacred songs and preaching the gospel," and the organ of the League says that if they do not grant the petition, "the legislature of Massachusetts should be requested to limit their powers in the interests of the best citizenship. The religious element of the community," it adds, "have rights which cannot be denied them." But nobody is disposed to deny their rights. The whole trouble is that a zealous but misguided part of the religious element want the civil power to grant them favors which are denied to other classes of the community, or which would be denied if the religious element had their way.

The Mormon church in Utah is attempting to exercise a controlling influence in the Utah legislature, and justifies her action upon the very orthodox ground that she constitutes the most numerous religious body in the State. The occasion of this Mormon manifestation is the contumacious action of "apostle" Moses Thatcher, in refusing recently to sign a manifesto issued by the church authorities, requiring all church officers to obtain the consent of the first presidency before becoming candidates for political office. Mr. Thatcher is now a candidate for the office of United States senator, and the church is opposing his election. The Mormon official organ, the Deseret News, says in its issue of the 17th inst.:

It is yet to be shown that the members of the legislature desire to cast their votes in a manner calculated to wound a vital principle of the discipline of the most numerous religious body in this State. Does the political party which will so absolutely control the next legislature desire to array itself in pronounced and distinctly defined opposition to that religious body? Is it to be expected that a church thus assailed and antagonized will not try to protect itself, and strive to maintain its organic principles?

In reply, the Salt Lake Tribune, ("Gentile") says:

If Moses Thatcher has broken his priestly covenants, and with him there is a question of church discipline to be settled, with that we have nothing to do. It is a matter which does not concern the people at large in the least. But when the Mormon or any other church directly threatens that it will interpose all its church power to influence a legislature to defeat for office a citizen because he has dared to assert his independence, even in the face of the church, then we beg to say that this people will not stand that sort of tyranny, and if it is attempted, then the old fight will be opened all at once.

It seems quite easy for people to distinguish the boundary lines which separate between the proper spheres of church and State, in the case of the Mormon church. But we would call attention to the fact that the Mormon church takes the same attitude with respect to legislation that is taken by orthodoxy in general, in defense of the demand for Sunday legislation. For it is a "vital principle" in the creed of the "most numerous religious body" in the land, that Sunday should be observed as the Sabbath, and it "wounds" this principle deeply when legislation is so shaped as not to prohibit the profanation of the day. The church is so grieved over this matter that she is getting ready to retire from office such of our legislators as will not defer to her demands.

The "most numerous religious body" in the land assumes the right to make demands upon legislatures which, in the case of the smaller bodies, would be promptly denounced as involving a union of church and State.

CONFIDENCE in the virtue of that much-trusted religious guide, "the public conscience," has recently in this vicinity received a rude shock. About a year ago a number of States and Territories were vieing with each other in an exhibition of morality, by measures taken to keep out of their borders two well-known pugilists who were seeking some place for a prize fight. There was not a State or Territory in the Union that would permit such a thing; not even though it might be necessary to call a special session of the legislature to prevent it. Now, behold, one of those same pugilists, with a companion of almost equal fistic renown, engages in such a fight in the very heart of New York City, under the approving eye of the city's most prominent police commissioner, and with approving comment from a number of prominent clergymen! The "public conscience" is a thing of queer freaks.
