THE Christian Endeavorer, November, 1896, page 5, says:—

The only preparation for the lofty privileges of the heavenly is conspicuous and persevering fidelity in the fulfillment of the duties pertaining to our earthly citizenship.

Jesus Christ said, "Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God." "Except ye be converted and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven." And yet this professed Christian Endeavorer says "The only preparation for the lofty privileges of the heavenly [citizenship] is conspicuous and persevering fidelity in the fulfillment of the duties pertaining to our earthly citizenship"!

Nor is this a mere slip of enthusiasm. It is intentional doctrine; and is emphasized as follows, in the same connection:—

The Christian who will not vote as he prays is a backslider. Along the shining streets of the celestial city walk the Christian citizens saved and jubilant, who did not shirk their duties as Christian citizens while here.

The further that the National Reform theory is carried the more unchristian and blasphemous it becomes. There is no doubt of that. And we told them so, years ago.
