The American Sentinel recently called attention to the fact that the principle of the "National Christian Citizenship League," which has grown so marvelously, are identical with those of National Reform. At that time we did not know of any cooperation between the two bodies, but we did know that they were "birds of a feather" and would soon "flock together."

The following editorial from the *Christian Statesman* of November 14, shows that they have already begun to "flock:"—

Dr. H. H. George [General Field Secretary of the National Reform Association] reports from Chicago that the way seems open for a fine convention in that city. He has already met with a most cordial reception in many quarters, and particularly from members and officers of the National Christian Citizenship League. The first great purpose for which this league exists is as the official document states it "to reveal Jesus Christ as the Saviour of the State and nation as well as the individual." This league will cooperate most heartily and vigorously in the work of the coming convention.

Reader, what will be your attitude toward the tremendous federation of forces combined to overthrow the fundamental American principle of separation of Church and State, as exposed in this issue of the AMERICAN SENTINEL? If you are not stirred by these signs of the times we wonder what would stir you. May the Author of liberty arouse the people before it is too late!
