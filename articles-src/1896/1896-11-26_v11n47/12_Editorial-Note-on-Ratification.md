The proposition of the National Reformers, for the ratification of the religious amendment which they propose, is that it shall be by "conventions in the States," not by a vote of the people. They know that they stand a chance to manipulate the choosing of members of conventions, and the organization of such conventions, much more than they possibly could the vote of the people. Therefore they purpose to make it sure that the people shall have no chance to vote on the question. There is nothing these managers dread more than to have this thing freely and fairly presented to the people. But is it not time that the people awake?
