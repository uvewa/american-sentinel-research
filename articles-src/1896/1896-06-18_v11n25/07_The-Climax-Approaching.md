# THE CLIMAX APPROACHING.

[Journal (New York), June 9.]

The awful tragedy that has been swiftly approaching its climax in Armenia during the past two years is likely to be finished, in one way or another, before the end of this year, or of the next at the latest. Either torture, outrage, degradation and massacre will have wiped out everything that makes the Armenian people worth persecuting, or some means of rescue will have been found.

The hope of European armed intervention is practically extinct. Russia will not consent to a joint interference, and England is not sufficiently unselfish to invite her to interfere alone. Whatever is done for the salvation of the Armenians must be done by peaceful means.
