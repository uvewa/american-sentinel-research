**THE MAIDEN MARTYR.**

In the early summer of 1685, two girls of the name of Wilson, the older of whom was eighteen, and the younger thirteen years of age, were sentenced to be drowned for refusing the Abjuration oath.

The younger sister was saved, upon the payment of a hundred pounds by her father. The elder, and a poor widow named McLaughlin, were tied to stakes within flood-mark in the river Blendnock. The girl saw her aged companion in tribulation painfully perish, as she had been fastened furthest out in the tide. Still her faith failed not; and though importuned by her friends to save her life by praying for the king and taking the oath, she steadfastly refused. Calmly she awaited death, singing psalms till her voice was choked by the rising water; and, a little after, the slight ripple, and the air-bell rising to the surface, told she had breathed her last. And as though in sympathy, the fast westering sun, too, sank from sight and nature threw over the scene her sable mantle of the night.

A troop of soldiers waited at the door,
A crowd of people gathered in the street,
A loof a little from the sabres bared
And flashed into their faces. Then the door
Was opened, and two women meekly step
Into the sunshine of the sweet May moon,
Out of the prison. One was meek and old—
A woman full of years and full of woes—
The other was a maiden in her morn,
And they were one in name and one in faith,
Mother and daughter in the bonds of Christ,
That bound them closer than the ties of blood.

The troop moved on; and down the sunny street
The people followed, ever falling back
As in their faces flashed the naked blades.
But in the midst the women simply went
As if they two were walking, side by side,
Up to God's house on some still Sabbath morn,
Only they were not clad for Sabbath day;
But as they went about their daily tasks,
They went to prison, and they went to death
Upon their Master's service.

On the shore
The troopers halted; all the shining sands
Lay bare and glistening; for the tide had drawn
Back to its furthest margin's weedy mark,
And each succeeding wave, with flash and curve
That seemed to mock the sabres on the shore,
Drew nearer by a sand breadth. "It will be
A long day's work," murmured those murderous men,
As they slacked rein—the leaders of the troop
Dismounting, and the people pressing near
To hear the pardon proffered, with the oath
Renouncing and abjuring part with all
The persecuted, covenanted folk.
And both refused the oath, "because," they said,
"Unless with Christ's dear servants we have part,
We have no part with Him."

On this they took
The elder Margaret, and led her out
Over the sliding sands, the weedy sludge,
The pebbly shoals, far out, and fastened her
Unto the furthest stake, already reached
By every rising wave; and left her there,
As the waves crept about her feet, in prayer
That He would firm uphold her in their midst,
Who holds them in the hollow of His hand.
The tide flowed in. And up and down the shore
They passed, the Provost, and the Laird of Lag—
Grim Grierson—with Windram and with Graham;
And the rude soldiers jested, with rude oaths,
As in the midst the maiden meekly stood
Waiting her doom delayed—said "she would turn
Before the tide—seek refuge in their arms

From the chill waves." And ever to her lips
There came the wondrous words of life and peace:
"If God be for us, who can be against!"
"Who shall divide us from the love of Christ?"
"Nor height, nor depth,——."

A voice cried from the crowd—
A woman's voice, a very bitter cry—
"Oh, Margaret! my bounie Margaret!
Gle in, gle in, and dinna break my heart;
Gle in, and take the oath."

The tide flowed in:
And so wore on the sunny afternoon;
And every fire went out upon the hearth;
And not a meal was tasted in the town
That day.

And still the tide was flowing in:
Her mother's voice yet sounding in her ears,
They turned young Margaret's face toward the sea,
Where something white was floating—something white
As the sea-mew that sits upon the wave:
But as she looked it sank; then showed again;
Then disappeared. And round the shoreward stake
The tide stood ankle deep.

Then Grierson,
With cursing, vowed that he would wait no more;
And to the stake the soldiers led her down,
And tied her hands; and round her slender waist
Too roughly cast the rope, for Windram came
And eased it, while he whispered in her ear
"Come, take the test." And one cried, "Margaret,
Say but 'God save the king.'" "God save the king
Of His great grace," she answered; but the oath
She would not take.

And still the tide flowed in,
And drove the people back and silenced them.
The tide flowed in, and rising to her knee,
She sang the psalm, "To thee I lift my soul."
The tide flowed in, and rising to her waist,
"To thee, my God, I lift my soul," she sung.
And the tide flowed, and, rising to her throat,
She sang no more, but lifted up her face—
And there was glory over all the sky;
And there was glory over all the sea—
A flood of glory—and the lifted face
Swam in it, till it bowed beneath the flood,
And Scotland's Maiden Martyr slept in God.
