# PERSECUTION FOR CONSCIENCE' SAKE.

It will be remembered that in April C. A. Gordon and wife, two Seventh-day Adventists, of Eagle Township, Ark., were arrested for "sabbath-breaking," and were sent to jail by a justice of the peace, notwithstanding the fact that the statutes of that State provide that observers of the seventh day shall have the right to work on Sunday.

These Seventh-day Adventists were hired out with other convicts, and were required to work on the Sabbath. When the facts were brought to the attention of the governor he promptly "pardoned" them. The following letter, which appears in the Arkansas Reporter, of May 28, a local Seventh-day Adventist paper, tells the sequel:—

May 11, 1896.

It has been some time since you heard from me. I have had a little trouble in securing a place to work. On being released from prison I returned home only to find my portion of land re-rented and my household goods removed and the house possessed by another family. I had to accept this condition of things or enter a law suit, with all chances against me. I concluded to move. We are now within four miles of the city. I will try to get employment among some Seventh-day Adventist for myself and wife, for persecution still holds up its prejudiced head. My wife was in her house doing some hand-sewing, a woman passed and told her it was against the law to do anything on Sunday, and that she would be arrested if she did not stop.

To reserve the right to not work on Saturday makes it difficult to secure work. For this cause I must work for Sabbath-keepers.

CHESTER GORDON.

It will be seen that while the legal right of Sabbatarian Christians to work on Sunday is recognized in Arkansas, Seventh-day Adventists in that State are by no means free from persecution. If such a thing as this were to happen to some Sunday-keeper because he worked on the seventh day, what a cry of persecution would go up from the friends of Sunday everywhere!

In order that Sunday-keepers may be "protected," they must even have "laws" forbidding anybody else to work; but the Seventh-day Adventist must suffer not only legal but petty persecution for keeping the Sabbath, and is denied even his legal rights.
