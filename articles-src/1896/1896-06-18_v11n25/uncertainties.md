## Specific Uncertainties

### Page 1, Masthead
- **Issue:** Volume number discrepancy - masthead shows "Vol. 11, No. 28" but this should be No. 25 based on date (June 18, 1896)
- **Resolution:** Used "25" in YAML frontmatter as per instruction, but preserved "28" as it appears in the masthead transcription
- **Confidence:** HIGH - this is a printing error in the original

### Page 3, "The Maiden Martyr" poem
- **Line:** "A loof a little from the sabres bared"
- **Transcribed as:** "A loof"
- **Uncertainty:** Possibly should be "Aloof" but appears as "A loof" in scan
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM

### Page 4, Line 372
- **Asterisk reference:** "* From Frank Leslie's 'Sunday Magazine,' with slight additions and changes."
- **Placement:** This footnote appears at bottom of page 4, refers to "The Maiden Martyr" poem on page 4
- **Resolution:** Included in reprint attribution notes
- **Confidence:** HIGH

### Page 5, Article "Persecution for Sunday Labor"
- **Author initials:** "J. E. JAYNE"
