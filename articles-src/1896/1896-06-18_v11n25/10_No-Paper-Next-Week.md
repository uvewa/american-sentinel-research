# No Paper Next Week.

As this number of the SENTINEL completes the first half of the volume for 1896, we shall issue no paper next week. Number 26 will bear date of July 2. It will be a specially interesting and attractive number, containing at least three illustrations, instead of only one as is usually the case.

Better order a few extra copies of the SENTINEL of July 2; you will want them for your friends. They will cost you only 1 cent apiece if sent to you, or you can send us five cents for each four copies and we will wrap and mail them to the addresses which you furnish.
