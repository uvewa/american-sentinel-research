# "A SIGNIFICANT DECISION."

By all means read the article, "A Significant Decision," on page 197. This is the most far-reaching Sunday-law decision ever rendered by an American court. It is just such a decision as might have been expected to follow Judge Brewer's "casual obiter dictum" of February 29, 1892, and is closely related to it in logic and effect. We shall have more to say about it in our next issue.
