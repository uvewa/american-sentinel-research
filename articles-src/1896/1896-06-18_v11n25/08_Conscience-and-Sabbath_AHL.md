# CONSCIENCE AND SABBATH.

BY A. H. LEWIS, D. D.

The average American citizen has no conscience in the matter of Sabbath-observance. The question has been so long treated as a subordinate one, and the human and utilitarian element has been made so prominent, that even religious men have little conscience in the matter. Customs and prevalent modes of teaching have combined to put Sabbath-observance outside the realm of religious duty, in a very large degree. The mere "rest-day" theory is a popular one, i. e., if body or brain need rest, it is well to rest. Upon this theory it is easy to invent methods of resting (?) which will gratify worldly tastes and desires, and be-numb conscience. Upon the same low plane is the average notion concerning church going and religious culture. Popular opinion says, if there be a service conveniently near, where music and oratory will entertain one, it is a pleasant way of spending a part of a leisure day; but if the music be second class and the preaching common-place, there is little or no conscience to compel men even to attend service on their "rest-day." The "rest-day" theory does not necessarily, nor usually, involve the idea of sacred time, or of a divine obligation in the matter of Sabbath-keeping.

The church and the pulpit are in no small degree responsible for this state of things.

One would think from much of the current discussion on the question that even Christian men are loth to discuss the Sabbath from a religious point of view, so much do men plead with railroads and pleasure seekers about the "utility of a rest-day." We do not object to these lower elements in the discussion, but they are merely secondary; and if men make these the prominent, or foundation idea, all conscience as of duty toward God is at an end. The same is true when the "civil sabbath" is made the prominent thing. Religious conscience is neither awakened nor cultivated by an appeal to civil law. If the church does not take high religious ground, the world will certainly drift far away from it. The work of awakening the latent conscience of the people, if it exists, or of cultivating, creating it, must be done by the church, if it is done at all. Evils do not cure themselves. A revival of Sabbath-ism will never be obtained on the "rest-day" theory of utilitarianism, nor the testimony of medical experts, and managers of street car service. Conscience toward God alone will form the permanent foundation for such a revival. Even the resolutions of schools and conferences, and the wisdom of creed-makers will prove useless, unless the masses are trained to a higher religious conception of the Sabbath as a divine and especially religious institution. It would not be far from the entire truth to say that one of the first steps toward reform is the creating of a conscience on the Sabbath issues.
