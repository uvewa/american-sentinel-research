As our readers are aware, one honest Christian man is already undergoing imprisonment at Tiptonville, Lake County, Tenn., for fidelity to his conscientious convictions of duty in the matter of Sabbath observance. Four other men of like character will appear for trial July 13, and will in all probability not only be imprisoned, but compelled to work in a chain-gang. The SENTINEL is arranging not only to have full reports of these trials and of any subsequent proceedings, but to publish a number of illustrations in connection therewith.
