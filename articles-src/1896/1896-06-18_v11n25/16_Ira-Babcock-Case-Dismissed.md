It will be remembered that some months since Ira Babcock, a Seventh-day Adventist, of Greensboro, North Carolina, was arrested, charged with working on Sunday; but as it was not clear that there was any statute in North Carolina forbidding private Sunday work, the charge was changed to one of "disturbing public worship," when it reached the District Court, notwithstanding the fact that there was not a shadow of ground upon which to base such a charge. We are informed that the case has recently been dismissed. This outcome is doubtless due to the active interest taken in this matter by the International Religious Liberty Association.

When the case was first called in the District Court the latter part of last February, the authorities were not disposed to give Mr. Babcock any show whatever. But when the best attorney in the county was put in charge of the case, and it was seen that Mr. Babcock would not tamely submit to injustice, the program was changed; the case was continued to the next term of court, and has now been dismissed at it ought to have been at first.
