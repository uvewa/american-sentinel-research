J. W. LEWIS, the Seventh-day Adventist, imprisoned at Tiptonville, Tenn., for obeying the fourth commandment just as it reads, writes us that at the conclusion of his trial two ministers were at the jail to see that he was "thrust into the cage, which is the inner prison." We presume if there had been stocks they would have seen to having his feet made fast in them.

One of these ministers has discovered that the International Religious Liberty Association, which has been looking after Mr. Lewis' interests, is composed of infidels, and that Ingersoll ought to be its president! For the information of this minister, as well as others who may not be aware of the facts, we print herewith the Declaration of Principles of the International Religious Liberty Association:—

We believe in the religion taught by Jesus Christ. We believe in temperance, and regard the liquor traffic as a curse to society. We believe in supporting the civil government, and submitting to its authority. We deny the right of any civil government to legislate on religious questions. We believe it is the right, and should be the privilege, of every man to worship according to the dictates of his own conscience. We also believe it to be our duty to use every lawful and honorable means to prevent religious legislation by the civil government; that we and our fellow-citizens may enjoy the inestimable blessings of both religious and civil liberty.

The object of the International Religious Liberty Association is thus stated in its constitution:—

The object of this Association shall be to protect the rights of conscience; to maintain a total separation between religion and the civil government; and by means of the platform and the press to educate the public mind on the relations that should exist between the Church and the State.

Article 3 of the same instrument provides that—

All persons approving these objects, and who will subscribe to the Declaration of Principles, may be members of this Association by the payment of one dollar, and an annual due thereafter of one dollar.

Evidently the Tennessee preacher has not been as fully informed concerning the Religious Liberty Association as he ought to have been before attempting to tell others about it.
