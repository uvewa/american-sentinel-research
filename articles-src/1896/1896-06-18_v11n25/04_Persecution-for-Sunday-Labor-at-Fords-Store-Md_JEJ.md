# PERSECUTION FOR SUNDAY LABOR AT FORD'S STORE, MD.

BY J. E. JAYNE.

MR. ISLAND BAKER, of Ford's Store, Md., has been arrested, tried, and I suppose convicted, of Sunday labor. Briefly the circumstances are as follows.

On Sunday, May 24, L. T. Vansant, a constable, "chanced to be" at the home of one of his neighbors. They looked across a piece of land and strip of water, a distance of about two miles, and saw what they thought was a man at work in a field. They walked to the water and then rowed about three quarters of a mile and accosted Mr. Baker, who was marking out ground for corn.

The constable laid complaint before a magistrate on Kent Island, who issued the warrant, and set the trial for June 1. Mr. Baker was allowed his liberty, and on the day for trial the constable visited him at his home intending to accompany him to the magistrate's office. Mr. Baker objected to going, stating that he would take the case before a magistrate for their own town, who had been recently appointed. The constable did not require him to appear in court, but himself arranged for the trial to be held before another magistrite on Thursday, the 4th of June.

When the case came to trial the magistrate was very much confused, and the crowd that filled the room did about as they pleased. Mr. Baker employed no attorney. So far as I could learn, no record of the proceedings was kept, except what I took for my own use. The trial proceeded about as follows:—

Magistrate to Mr. Baker.—"Are you ready for trial?"

Mr. Baker—"I have not heard the warrant read."

The magistrate then read the warrant and said:—

"I don't suppose there is any use of swearing witnesses, for you will plead guilty of the crime."

Mr. Baker.—"I do not plead guilty of violating any law in harmony with our National Constitution."

Magistrate.—"O, that's no plea."

Mr. Baker was not required to plead, and the constable was sworn.

Magistrate to constable.—"What was he doing?"

Constable.—"He was marking out ground for corn."

Magistrate.—"Anything else?"

Constable.—"No."

Magistrate.—"There were three State's witnesses summoned, are they here?"

Constable.—"All but Mr. Mansfield." (Who is a Seventh-day Adventist.)

The magistrate talked of how he would punish Mr. Mansfield for failing to obey the summons.

Bystanders to Court and constable.—"Mr. Mansfield has not been summoned."

Constable.—"I summoned him."

Bystanders.—"You did not read the summons, nor tell him when or where the trial was to be held, nor who was to be tried."

Magistrate.—"Do you swear that you summoned him?"

Constable.—"Yes."

Bystanders.—"You did not read the summons."

Magistrate.—"Do you swear you read the summons?"

Constable.—"No; I read his name to him off the back of the warrant. I had no summons. You did not give me any, and I am green and do not know how to do this business."

Magistrate.—"Why did you not tell me you had no summons?"

Constable.—"I did try to tell you, but I could not make you understand."

Magistrate.—"Well, there are no witnesses in this case except yourself. I guess we are both pretty badly mixed."

Mr. Baker to magistrate.—"Well, I guess it makes little difference as I should have to appeal the case anyway."

The magistrate then tried to make out an appeal bond but was so confused that he could not do it. He then tried to find a friend who has sometimes assisted him at his work, but this friend had absented himself, refusing to have anything to do with the matter.

Magistrate to Mr. Baker.—"There is one way left for me, you state any day you like within a week and appear here, and we will proceed with the trial."

Mr. Baker to magistrate.—"I am here for trial now and want the matter settled to-day."

Magistrate.—"I can't do it; I don't know how to make out the bond. I am in no condition to proceed with the trial. Who are to be your bondsmen?"

Mr. Baker made arrangements with two of his friends, and then the magistrate proposed that it was not necessary that Mr. Baker again appear in court, but that he (the mag-

istrate) would present himself before Mr. Baker's bondsmen some time within one week and arrange it satisfactorily with them.

Magistrate to Mr. Baker.—"Costs are eighty-five cents."

Mr. Baker.—"I will not pay costs, as I have done nothing wrong. Had I done anything wrong I would not refuse."

Magistrate.—"I have been very lenient with you, but I may not be so in the future; but as you will pay no costs, I will give you my costs."

And then without offering opportunity for defense, and without pronouncing the prisoner guilty or innocent, without imposing any fine, holding him in bail or dismissing the court, the magistrate gathered up his effects and disappeared.

Just what turn matters will take no one seems to know.

I visited both the magistrate and and constable at their homes before the trial and talked with them of the matter, and am thoroughly convinced that before the case was heard they had determined to convict Mr. Baker.

The magistrate is an "aldside" Methodist class leader, and the constable attends that church. Religious prejudice is at the root of the difficulty, but without a Sunday law intolerance would be powerless.
