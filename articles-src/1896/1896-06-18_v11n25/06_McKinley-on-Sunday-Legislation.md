# McKinley on Sunday Legislation.

Under the heading of "A Decided Opinion by Major McKinley," the New York Sun, of May 25, prints the following:—

At a meeting of the Brooklyn Philosophical Association yesterday afternoon, held in the Long Island Business College in that city, one of the speakers asserted that her father had told her that Major William McKinley had once expressed to him a decided opinion, and this, too, at a time when he was running for governor:

"I am," said Major McKinley to the lady's father, "in favor of Sunday legislation and a strict observance of the Christian sabbath."

Mr. McKinley's prominence in the presidential race makes this utterance especially significant.
