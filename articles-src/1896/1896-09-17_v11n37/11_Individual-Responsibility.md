# INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITY.

[New York Observer, Aug. 20, 1896.]

The tendency of the present age is very markedly in the direction of cooperation of agencies and huge combinations of capital. It is an age of conglomerates. In its own lingo its cry is: "Get together!" Whether it be the legal corporation or the temporary committee, the aim is to combine and conquer.

The commercial and social effects of such combination are far-reaching, and impossible of complete calculation. The moral aspects of this "condition," however, afford quite as interesting a topic for study, though not so often discussed. What has been the effect of combination on conscience and character? How far have "trusts," "pools," "corners," "unions," and the like, affected the notion of individual responsibility? How far has the third personal "they" of a plural and promiscuous aggregation distracted attention from the insistent "thou" of an individual duty applied directly in the second person singular? These are important questions.

And if we do inquire with respect to the practical effect on character of numbers of these "combines" we discover that many things are as a fact done by corporations that hardly any one individual member of the concern would think of doing. The popular impression has therefore not unnaturally come to be that the corporation has "no soul," no conscience, no creed, no charity, or that it can be credited at the most only with the nebulous invention of modern times, a "corporate conscience."

This notion of the "corporate conscience" is to blame for most of the dishonesty and immorality that is perpetrated by wholesale. So far as the phrase conveys any meaning at all to the venders of it, it seems to imply a kind of a moral composite photograph representing the average ethics of all the parties to the combine. Thus in many a corporation the acute conscience of the highest-minded member of the concern is not allowed to decide a policy, nor perhaps is the sordid preference of the meanest man in the organization decisive, but what is generally influential is a middle view lying somewhere between these extremes, so that as a matter of fact the corporate conscience becomes the compromise conscience. Others might be disposed to cynically define mercantile morality to be a kind of a diluted or distributed moral sense, on the principle that where ten men who alone among half a hundred have consciences are required to divide up ethically with their corporate fellows, the other two score men will severally fall heir to but the fiftieth of a conscience, even on the most favorable basis of moral communion.

But really the term "corporate conscience" is indefinable because it is unthinkable. There is no such thing as a collective conscience. The idea is not biblical and the thing is not actual. It is impossible to "pool" consciences, or to create religious "trusts" which bring dividends of divine favor in spite of individual derelictions in duty. The unit of humanity and the basis of moral measurement is the personal soul, and the unit is not lost when added up into the columns of a corporate association.

Therefore, in our ethics we must get down to the individual man. Whenever evil has been done there is always somebody who did it. When Epitimius, one of the ancients, had killed a horse by throwing a javelin during the progress of the public games, his father spent a whole day disputing with another man as to what might have been the the cause of the horse's death, the javelin, the thrower, or the president of the games! But it is puerile to obscure issues in this way. Such juggling with responsibility will not do. Epitimius killed the horse.

This illusion of irresponsibility which comes of action at long range is illustrated not alone in mercantile spheres, but as well in many lines of social, educational and even religious life. When men combine for any purpose the tendency is at once to refer conscience to committees. For what is a committee good for, if it is not to relieve one of one's own duty?

God deals with individuals. Conscienceless corporations he keenly analyzes into their constituent moral elements. The Recording Angel never debits a sin to a system or a crime to a company. What he tabulates is personality. Men will not be crowned or anathematized ex masse, but individually. Humanity is born, lives, dies, and is judged one by one.

It is this sense of responsibility which is

the steadying force in history, and that cannot be lost out of life national or individual with any degree of safety. The notion of accountability to mere human authority is often efficient, since it keeps the sentry on his beat, the cashier at his desk, and the captain on the bridge. But humanity is also taken account of by a heavenly tribunal, and therefore the most solemn reflection that can ever cross the mind of a human being is, as Webster realized, the persistent thought: "I must answer God!"
