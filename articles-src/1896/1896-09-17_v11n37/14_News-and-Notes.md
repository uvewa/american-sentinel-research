# NEWS AND NOTES.

REV. P. A. BRANFORD, a Congregational minister in Lanesboro, Mass., has resigned his charge, as the result of pressure brought to bear upon him on account of his political sentiments.

A RESIDENT of Englewood, N. J., has been prosecuted for playing golf on Sunday, under the provisions of the Vice and Immorality Act of that State. The case was brought before Recorder Fellowes, and the latter dismissed it, with this comment:—

"If this antiquated law were rigidly enforced, life in this community would be intolerable, and Englewood would be a place from which we would all be glad to escape. As long as I am on this bench I will interpret Sabbath observance from a modern standpoint, and I will not find anybody guilty of violating the statutes simply on the ipse dixit of a local officer, or for the purpose of gratifying anybody's personal spite."

There is room in the United States for more court officials of this kind.

A WINE manufacturer of Elmira, N. Y., has undertaken to test the Raines liquor law of the State, by bringing a suit against two churches for using fermented wine in the sacramental services on Sunday, as the law forbids any corporation, association, copartnership or person to give away any liquor on Sunday, it looks as though the case against the churches might be sustained.

The following observation made recently by the Christian Commonwealth, of London, fits the situation in this country about as well as that in England:—

"There seems to be just now a mania for flattering the Pope. It is very difficult to account for this foolery amongst Protestants. But then the English are never very manly unless they actually feel the sting of persecution."

A BARBER in New York City who ventured to cut hair after 1 P. M. on Sunday, Sept. 6, was arrested when his job was half completed, as a violator of the Sunday law. The complaint against him was made by a rival barber in his vicinity. To the arrested barber he said, "Your customer wanted me to cut his hair, and when I refused, because it was Sunday, he went to you. I couldn't stand that, you know."

A PANAMA dispatch, dated September 7, states that "the holy see has appointed an apostolic delegate to Nicaragua, with the idea of establishing better and closer relations between the ecclesiastical and civil authorities." In the United States the "apostolic delegate" is sent for the ostensible purpose of securing unity in the Catholic Church; but in the case of a country like Nicaragua, it is not deemed necessary to make any concealment of the delegate's real mission.

The contest between Church and State in Ecuador, which has been in progress for some months, has resulted in the triumph of the "revolutionary" or anti-papal party; but the Roman Catholic party being irreconcilably opposed to the Church's loss of State favors and support, and the Jesuits and priests who had left the country having been invited to return and resume their baleful functions, it is to be feared that the triumph of the liberal spirit will be short-lived.

IN St. Louis, Mo., the papal church authorities are manifesting their devotion(?) to the principle of religious freedom by promulgating a "law" for Catholic laymen requiring that they must send their children to Catholic schools and on no account to the public schools, under pain of being refused absolution for their sins if they fail to comply. The decision has been the subject of much comment. Other "laws" promulgated at the same time forbid membership in masonic or other secret societies under pain of excommunication, and debar Catholics from singing in Protestant church choirs.

THE Illinois Supreme Court, Appellate Division, has decided that plowing in a field on Sunday is not a disturbance of the peace and good order of society, even though done within the view of persons going to or from church. The defendant in the case was a Seventh-day Adventist, and the Supreme Court decision reverses the decision of the Circuit Court, from which appeal had been made. Rendered in the face and doubtless with full knowledge of the United States Circuit Court decision against R. M. King, another Seventh-day Adventist, for precisely the same "offense," this decision must be regarded as significant.
