# "THE SICK MAN."

[New York Journal, September 9, 1896.]

It is almost half a century since Nicholas I. of Russia christened Turkey "the Sick Man" of Europe, and though Nicholas himself, his successor, and most of his contemporaries have since died, "the Sick Man" is still holding on to existence. Nevertheless the partition of Turkey seems nearer at hand than at any period before since the memorable conversation of the Czar with Sir G. Hamilton Seymour in January 1853.

It was at a reception given by the Archduchess Helen, at her palace in St. Petersburg, that Nicholas confided his views with regard to Turkey to the British Minister to Russia. "We have on our hands," said the Emperor, "a sick man—a very sick man. It will be a great misfortune if one of these days he should slip away from us before the necessary arrangements have been made." Nicholas was much chagrined when the English Minister and the English Government, after he had repeatedly reiterated this idea that England and Russia should divide "the Sick Man's" property, answered his overtures by saying that they did not consider it usual to enter into arrangements for the spoliation of a friendly power, and that England had no desire to succeed to any of the possessions of Turkey.

It was at about this period that the report of a mysterious clause in the will of Peter the Great, that has since been proved not to be genuine, alarmed the European powers. According to this document, Peter enjoined all succeeding Russian sovereigns never to relax in the extension of their territory northward on the Baltic and southward on the Black Sea shores, and to encroach as far as possible in the direction of Constantinople and the Indies. "To work out this," the alleged will was supposed to read, "raise wars continually—at one time against Turkey, at another against Persia; make dockyards on the Black Sea; by degrees making yourself master of that sea as well as of the Baltic; hasten the decay of Persia and penetrate the Persian Gulf; establish, if possible, the ancient commerce of the East via Syria, and push on to the Indies, which are the entrepot of the world. Once there you need not fear the gold of England."

Although this alleged will has been proved to be mythical, there is little doubt that the policy of Peter and his great follower, Catherine, would have been in thorough harmony with such a project, and that it is still down in Russia's books as a possibility. The possible partition of Turkey revives interest in these half-century-old traditions.
