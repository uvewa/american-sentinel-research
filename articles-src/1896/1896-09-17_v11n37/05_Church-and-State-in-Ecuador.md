# CHURCH AND STATE IN ECUADOR.

THE Church and the State are on bad terms in Ecuador. One of those quarrels which are sure to result sooner or later from the unholy marriage which joins Church and State together, has occurred, and the Church finds herself unable to maintain her position of supremacy. The facts relative to the case are given as follows by the N. Y. Sun of September 8, which speaks from a Roman Catholic standpoint:—

The new revolutionary president of Ecuador has created alarm among the Roman Catholic clergy in that country. Soon after General Alfaro took the field against the government last year, he ordered the arrest of a number of Jesuits upon the charge that they were concerned in an intrigue to undermine the Liberal Party which had risen in revolt. Not long afterward hundreds of priests, knowing that they were held in suspicion by Alfaro, left Ecuador and took refuge in adjacent countries. Next we heard of the departure of many nuns, most of whom went to Bogota, while others of them came to this country.

Alfaro was very angry because the church authorities stood by the government and opposed the change which he sought to bring about. His anger was increased when a church dignitary, Bishop Schumacher of Portiviejo, took command of a military force, at the head of which he fought against the revolution. Both as a warrior and as a spiritual foe the bishop gave much trouble to the revolutionists, fighting them all the way from Calzeta to Quito, and denouncing them with all his energy.

Alfaro declared that the "clericals" were the enemy who must be crushed, and hence the severe measures to which he resorted against the leaders of what he called the "clerical party," the party that upheld the government of President Cordero. Since the revolution has been installed in power at Quito, and has obtained full control of the country, his animosity against the leaders of the defeated party has been manifested in his decrees and in the banishment of several of these leaders. One of his decrees, which has caused much uneasiness in ecclesiastical circles in Ecuador, provides that, in the event of further armed opposition to his revolutionary authority, the property of the enemy shall be seized and held subject to his disposal. This decree, it is understood, refers chiefly to the property of the Catholic Church which has been derived from the State, as the Church is supported by the State. Bishop Schumacher's property, for example, would come under the terms of the decree.

It is not surprising, therefore, that there is alarm in the "clerical party," which renewed the struggle for supremacy a few weeks ago, and has refused to become reconciled with the revolution which ended in Alfaro's triumph. Under the decree, even the religious houses might be declared confiscate, and the estimates for the church withdrawn.

By advises from Quito, however, we have learned that it is not now the purpose of the "Supreme Chief" to proceed to extremities in this matter. He has given assurance that, because of the security of his government, the property of the church will be protected, and the safety of all peaceful ecclesiastics will be guaranteed. The priests, nuns and Jesuits who left the country when they believed they were in danger, are free to return to it at their pleasure, and to resume their places and their duties as servants of the church. Hereafter the business of teaching will not be under the exclusive authority of the hierarchy, and new privileges will be granted to Protestants; but, at the same time, the liberties of the Catholic Church are to be fully preserved under the revolutionary government.

It is a judicious policy that General Alfaro has adopted. He could not permanently maintain his power in opposition to the church, which, over since the Spanish conquest, has been supreme in Ecuador. Liberty of religion is essential in a republic.

This contest is, of course, nothing more than the effort of the State to throw off the papal yoke and secure that "liberty of religion" which the Sun declares to be essential in a republic, but which under papal domination, means only liberty for Rome to do as she may please. And when Rome does as she pleases, both her adherents and people who are not her adherents must also do as she pleases, or suffer very unpleasant consequences. It is to be hoped that the rising spirit of liberty which is struggling for emancipation from the slavery of papal domination in the priest-ridden republic, will be able to secure for the people the birthright blessings so long denied them.
