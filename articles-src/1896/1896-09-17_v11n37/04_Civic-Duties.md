# CIVIC DUTIES.

IN an article in the Ladies' Home Journal for September, on the subject of "The Young Man as a Citizen," the Rev. C. H. Parkhurst seeks to mould public sentiment to the belief that the moral responsibility of an individual is inseparable from his activity in politics, that to fail to do active work in politics is to be neglectful of the interests of his community, and of the State. The man who will thus let "his State or city shift for itself," is, he declares, "false to his corporate duty," and "a despicable shirk."

This view represents a natural reaction from another view, noticed by Mr. Parkhurst in these words: "Meditation, worship, and orthodoxy have, through most of the centuries of church history, constituted the area within which Christianity has confined its interests and its endeavors. It has been thought of as a commodity that best fulfills its purposes, not by mixing itself with the affairs and events of the world we now live in, but by isolating itself from all such concerns and concentrating its ambitious upon the world we hope to live in by-and-by." A reaction from this view is certainly quite proper, but like all reactions from extreme positions, its tendency is to swing to the opposite extreme, and favor a mixing of political privileges with moral obligations which confounds the two and tends directly to a union of Church and State.

"A great deal of our political misery," says Mr. Parkhurst, "is due to the fact that men, who are fairly faithful in most of the relations in which they are placed, do not hesitate, and are not ashamed, to be drones and renegades in their relations to the town or nation that they belong to. They would," he continues, "consider themselves reprobates were they to allow a neighbor to suffer abuse without an attempt at intervention, but would see their entire city with all its machinery of government go to the dogs and the harpies without one definite effort at rescue or one distinct thought that such inaction was wicked and inhuman." The remedy, he declares, must lie in the creation of a public sentiment which will compel the individual having the privilege of participation in the government, to go to the polls and primaries and discharge his "duty." "Nothing will correct this evil but the creation of a sentiment so energetic and pervasive that decent people will not have the cowardly audacity to neglect the primary duties that pertain to them in their civic capacity. Citizens will attend the primaries, register, and vote, when the prevailing sentiment of attachment to our institutions is so pronounced and compelling that failure to discharge the functions of a citizen will be branded as contemptible."

The actual absurdity of this proposed remedy for civic wrongs appears when we descend from generalities to particulars. Imagine, for instance, a Republican berating a Democrat (or vice versa), firing at him the Rev. Mr. Parkhurst's denunciations for neglect of duty and branding him as a "contemptible shirk," because he failed to go to the polls on election day and cast his vote! This would add a new and strange feature to political campaigns. It is natural for political enthusiasts to talk in this strain, because it is natural for each one to think that the person who puts study upon the question which constitutes the political issue will see it as he sees it, and that the honest person must vote as he would vote. This is why people are urged by the politicians to study the question. If they thought for a moment that such study would lead to a vote on the "other side," it would not be urged. The conscientious, honest voter is relied upon to endorse by his vote the honest platform; and all the platforms are "honest," in the minds of those whose views they represent. All the political parties appeal to the honest intelligent voter for his support. Each treats the issues of the campaign as if there could be no doubt that a careful, candid investigation of the same would lead to an endorsement of its views.

It is safe to say that many thousands of votes in the coming national election will be cast upon opposite sides of the issues before the country, all in conscientious compliance with the demands of "duty."

It is evident, of course, that the same duty cannot lead men in opposite directions. And this brings us to a truth already stated, namely, that "politics" do not rest upon any basis of infallible authority. We have no political gospel. And while it is clear that one ought to pay tribute for the government's support, and in every rightful way, by precept and example, seek to uphold that means which God has instituted among men for the preservation of human rights, his adherence to party or platform represents his personal opinion rather than his moral duty. Of course, there may be issues in the campaign, such as that of simple prohibition of the traffic in strong drinks, or the abolition of slavery, with reference to which we may be guided by the statements of God's Word. But such occasions are few and far between.

Let Christianity touch every moral issue in the community, through the lives of those composing it, in the same way that it touched such issues through the life of Jesus Christ, and no one will have reason to complain that the interests of that community are being left "to go to the dogs and the harpies." Any religion which does not directly and powerfully tend to uplift the community in which it exists, is not Christianity.
