# Uncertainties Log - American Sentinel (1896-09-17) Volume 11, Number 37

## General OCR Quality Notes

This issue appears to have been scanned from a damaged or degraded original. Multiple instances of obvious OCR errors, garbled text, and corrupted passages were encountered throughout, particularly on pages 7-8.

## Specific Uncertainties

### Page 1, Masthead
- **Text:** "ASSY. EDITOR," appears instead of expected "ASST. EDITOR" or "ASSOC. EDITOR"
- **Confidence:** LOW
- **Note:** Likely OCR error, but transcribed exactly as printed to preserve accuracy

### Page 2, Cartoon Image
- **Element:** Image with caption
- **Transcribed caption:** "ANDER EXAMPLE OF CHRISTIAN HYPOCRISY" and date "THURSDAY, OCTOBER 10, 1931"
- **Note:** The date 1931 is clearly anachronistic for an 1896 publication; this appears to be OCR confusion or printing artifact. The cartoon itself is referenced in the editorial text.
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM - caption text uncertain but included as printed

### Page 4, Line 157
- **Text:** "Vol. 11, No. 36" appears in header
- **Expected:** Should be "Vol. 11, No. 37" based on cover
- **Confidence:** HIGH that this is a printing error in the original
- **Transcribed as printed:** "Vol. 11, No. 36"

### Page 7-8, Editorial Notes section
- **Multiple garbled passages** in the editorial notes section appear to be severely corrupted OCR
- Examples include fragmented sentences about Armenia, Turkey, the Catholic church project
- **Approach:** Transcribed literally as they appeared, preserving the corruption to reflect the source document
- **Confidence:** LOW - many passages do not make coherent sense but were preserved exactly

### Page 8, Subscription information
- **Text contains garbled fragments** about the American Sentinel's purpose and subscription rates
- Some rates appear inconsistent or corrupted
- **Transcribed exactly as printed** to maintain document fidelity

## Second Pass Completed

A focused second review was conducted on all uncertain passages. The garbled text in the Editorial Notes section appears to be genuine OCR corruption from a poor-quality scan rather than resolvable text. All uncertain areas have been transcribed exactly as they appear in the source.
