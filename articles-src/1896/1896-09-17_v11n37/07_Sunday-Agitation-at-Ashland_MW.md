# SUNDAY AGITATION AT ASHLAND.

BY MAY WAKEHAM.

The Ashland Park and Pleasure Boat Company, Nebraska, seem to be creating no small stir among the religious circles of this city. The boat is a large about 18x24 feet, propelled by a gasolene engine, and runs from Ashland Beach in the south western part of town to the park a few miles up Salt Creek. Of course Sunday is the day on which most of the excursions are held. Sunday, July 12, the excursionists were entertained at the park by shooting matches, bicycle races, a nigger-head target for rotten eggs, etc., and plenty of beer.

According to one of the city papers the churches were all represented at the park. This so aroused the righteous indignation of one of the ministers that he preached a sermon on Sabbath desecration last Sunday evening. He took for his text the fourth commandment. After introducing his subject he exclaimed, "Do you want the people of Ashland to think the sabbath, that holy day on which Christ rose from the dead, is done away? Methods if the Lord Jesus Christ had come to the park last Sunday he would have thought it was a week-day."

He then appealed to the moral citizens to stand shoulder to shoulder and "form a law-and-order league if necessary." He told them the time was coming when a hue and cry against this evil [Sunday desecration] would be raised from every pulpit in the land."

People say, "What can we do?" They forget the possibilities we have in our State laws. He suggested that committees be appointed so that if anything of the sort should happen again on Sunday "every one of the excursionists could be arrested."

After the sermon he offered a closing prayer in which he thanked the Lord for the "fourth commandment, which not only commands us to keep the Sabbath, but to see that others keep it;" also that he has "given us the civil laws."

His whole sermon was a sad exhibition of "zeal not according to knowledge." It is difficult to understand how any one could read the fourth commandment and other texts he read and apply them all to the first day of the week.

We can but be thankful for truth which is so plain and consistent, and when we contrast it with the error on every hand, it shines brighter.—Nebraska Reporter, August 17.
