# TRUE LIBERTY.

*[Bible Echo (Melbourne, Australia), July 20, 1896.]*

If all men would recognize the rights of their fellowmen, and live up to the Golden Rule, there would be perfect and universal civil and religious liberty. Selfishness, which is simply novetousness, or a violation of the tenth commandment, is the root of all evil.

Selfishness leads men to encroach upon and disregard the rights of others. It is this that leads to all tyranny, persecution, and sorrow in the world. Gratification of self to the disregard of the rights and needs of others, leads to all sorts of evil; to the bondage and slavery to self, to the following of false customs, to pernicious habits, and to the keeping of the commandments and traditions of men, which make void the law of God.

Jesus Christ came into the world to set men free from selfishness, and to plant in our souls the genuine principles of liberty—supreme love to God, and equal love to our fellowmen. These principles are right, and the two great commandments enjoining their observance are right, for God is our Creator, and our neighbor's rights are equal to our own. "If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed." A man governed by these principles and possessing this freedom, will have the moral power not to follow in the wake of the majority when the majority go wrong, neither will he try to coerce others to act and think as he does. Love is gospel liberty. Love is God's law. Love is true religion.
