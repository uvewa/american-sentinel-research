# PERSECUTION.

[From Liberty, a local Seventh-day Adventist paper published in Toronto, Ontario.]

As a people we have long believed and taught that the time would come when persecution would be felt among us in all its force. In several places the fulfillment of this belief and teaching has been realized during the past few years, and many of our brethren have been treated as though they were criminals, having been compelled to work on the roads in the chain-gange, wearing the prison garb, living on prison fare, and all because they have dared to keep all of God's commandments. And we expect to see more of it in the future.

But there is a different form of persecution to which we wish to call special attention in this article. It is the work of harassing one because of his religious belief. There are various ways in which this form of persecution is carried on, and the judgement alone will reveal the multitudes who have suffered everything even death itself in consequence of it. Work which belonged to a man, morally speaking, has been withheld, and people have been influenced to deprive him of the means of support in order to drive him to give up his faith or to drive him out of the neighborhood. Or if he has not the means of getting out of the presence of such Christian piety, for it is professed Christians who carry on this sort of work, drive him to starvation.

Such persecution requires more of the grace of God to endure than confinement in jail, or impressment into the chain-gang would require; because in the latter case one is sure of prison fare at least, whereas in the other case he is driven to depend upon charity. And "the tender mercies of the wicked are cruel." The charity of those who will engage in such persecution is not of a character to impress one as coming from a pure heart with faith unfeigned.

We had a case of this kind of persecution here in the city of Toronto not long since. A Swiss who had been living in the city for a number of years accepted the truth recently and began the observance of the Sabbath of the Lord. All went well for a time, but when it became known that he kept the Sabbath, he was waited upon by a number of clergymen who tried to persuade him that he was in error, but failing in this, they resorted to the gospel of force.

The Swiss kept a general repair shop, and he was an excellent workman; but those who

had brought him work before he became a Sabbath-keeper, suddenly dropped off, and even went out of their way to take it to an inferior workman. Others would use abusive and insulting language to him, and to those who still brought him work to do, calling him "sheeny," that is, a Jew. Finally his work dropped off entirely, and he was reduced to want.

On visiting him we found him in the greatest distress of mind, considering whether it was best to go on and keep the Sabbath and see his family starve, or to give up the whole thing. But he gained the victory, and though having had but little to eat for several days, and with no prospect before him for the future he firmly resolved to obey God, let the consequences be what they might.

We have talked about persecution in the past, and some have indeed had to go to jail, and to suffer other indignities, but let a man be brought to a place in which he must choose between starvation and obedience to God's commandments, and he will have a test of faith that very few know anything about as yet.
