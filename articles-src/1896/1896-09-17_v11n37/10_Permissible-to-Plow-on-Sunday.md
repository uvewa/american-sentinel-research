# PERMISSIBLE TO PLOW ON SUNDAY.

[St. Louis Globe-Democrat, Sept. 8.]

MOUNT VERNON, ILL., Sept. 7.—The Appellate Court of the Fourth Illinois District on the 5th inst. handed down a decision in the case of Ross Fell, appellant, vs. The People of the State of Illinois, reversing the judgment of the lower court. The case came up on appeal from the Circuit Court of Richland County, and was known as the Seventh-day Adventist case. Ross Fell, the appellant, was a member of the Adventist Church, the creed of which recognizes Saturday instead of Sunday as the Sabbath day. In accordance with this belief, members of this church observe the former as the day of rest and labor on Sunday. Fell was charged with disturbing the peace and good order of society by plowing corn on Sunday, July 28, 1895, near the public highway, in full view of people going to church and Sunday-school.

The opinion of the court was that the evidence did not show that the peace and good order of society had been disturbed by the defendant. None of the witnesses who testified thought the labor was of such a character as to require them to request defendant to cease. No disorder was occasioned. Defendant conscientiously believed Saturday and not Sunday was appropriated by the law of God as a day of rest. In following his religious convictions he was not intending to disturb the peace and good order of society, and was not aware that he had done so. The court held, however, that if the defendant did by his labor disturb the peace and good order of society, his religious opinions would not shield him from the penalty; but the evidence went to show that the mere act of plowing corn along the highway, thronged with people going to church, did not of itself constitute a breach of the peace.

The opinion was delivered by Justice Green, the entire court concurring.
