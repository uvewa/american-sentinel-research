# TURKEY'S RIVALS.

While all the world is shuddering at the tale of Turkish atrocities in Armenia, it may be fitting to call attention to the fact that that government is not without formidable rivals for the palm on the point of cruelty, among the so-called "Christian" nations to which appeal has been made for the Turk's suppression.

In our last issue we published a report setting forth the utter disregard of life manifested by the English soldiers toward the poor South African heathen whom they met in arms; and now the record of the French Government on the subject is brought to light by the reported escape of a French military officer who had been banished to "Torture Island" for alleged selling of government secrets to the Germans. This island is a short distance off the coast of French Guiana, and is a place of punishment for the worst class of political and criminal offenders. Of the fate of the hapless being sentenced to existence in this place, the New York Journal says:—

The punishment to which the French Government condemned Dreyfus is the most dreadful which the imagination can depict.

Banishment to the Isles de Salut means more than death. It means a period of bodily and mental torture which lasts for months or years, as the vitality of the convict may be great or little.

The islands lie off the coast of French Guiana, but a few degrees north of the equator. Their area is small, and they are covered with dense tropical forests.

It was the murderous climate of the Isles which caused them to be selected by the French Government as a place of banishment for its most desperate criminals.

For eight months in the year, or from November to June, the average rainfall is 180 inches, or four times as much as in New York. July, August, September and October are the dry months, and during this period the thermometer for weeks at a time registers 115 degrees in the daytime.

The lowest temperature at any time of the year is 85 degrees.

To stand even for a few moments in the blazing sun during the dry season is almost sure death to one not thoroughly acclimated. The year round the poisonous exhalations which charge the atmosphere bring on the deadly fever, which, unless the convict stricken with it has an iron constitution, soon makes an end of his suffering.

It has been estimated that should all the island's outlets to the sea be damned up the whole country would be fifteen feet under water at the end of the wet season.

The forests teem with animal life. Venomous reptiles and stinging insects swarm in the tropical growths. Panthers and other savage beasts abound, a constant menace to the lives of the poor creatures condemned to live among them.

From the moment the convict sets foot on the islands his identity is lost and he is known only by number.

His trials begin at once. He is forced to march with companions in misery to the "camp," which is to be his home while he lives. These camps consist of strongly-built, iron barred huts situated in the midst of the forest. The only articles of furniture in them are tables and benches fastened to the floor.

Hammocks are swung at night, but the swarms of stinging insects and the fear of the creeping reptiles which are sure to enter the huts unless a constant watch is kept make sleep next to impossible.

Exhaustion from want of rest is one of the lesser agonies which the convicts have to endure.

The labor they are forced to perform is the most arduous that can be devised—that of draining marshes and clearing ground.

This labor is performed under a blazing sun, which, beating down upon the poor creatures, withers up their bodies with its awful heat. So great is the power that the very picks and shovels with which they perform their toil become so hot as to blister their hands.

Standing knee deep in a trench of stagnant water, with swarms of gnats and mosquitoes stinging them into a frenzy, the convicts dig for hours while the alternate fever and ague racks their bodies.

The guards are armed with rifles and have orders to shoot to kill at the least sign of insubordination.

Scores of prisoners deliberately run over the dead lines to draw the shots of the guards and insure themselves a release from their sufferings.

The fact that these awful cruelties are inflicted upon criminals and not innocent persons, does not in the least alter the nature of the light which is reflected thereby upon the government which gives them sanction. To inflict torture upon any person or thing is an act utterly at variance with the spirit of Christianity and love of humanity.
