# VIOLATING LAW TO ENFORCE "LAW."

An interesting fact has come to light in the case of B. A. Philpott, the Seventh-day Adventist, recently arrested in Rutherford County, Tenn., for working on Sunday.

As most of our readers know, these prosecutions in Tennessee are not under the statute, which provides simply a fine of three dollars for Sunday work, to be recovered before a justice of the peace, by whomsoever first sues for the same; but under the common law of nuisance, by indictment by the grand jury and trial in the Circuit Court.

Now the law presumes that if anything is a nuisance somebody will be interested in prosecuting the offender, and therefore withholds from the grand jury inquisitorial powers in such cases. A valid indictment can only be returned at the instance of some citizen who comes forward to act as prosecutor, and whose name must be indorsed upon the indictment as prosecutor.

We are reliably informed that Mr. Byron Freeman, the gentleman whose name appears as prosecutor upon the indictment against Mr. Philpott, denies emphatically that he is prosecutor. He says he is only a witness, and an unwilling one at that, and never authorized the use of his name as prosecutor. If this statement is true, and we cannot doubt the gentleman's word in the matter, somebody has violated the law in his zeal to enforce "law."

This fact adds a new element of interest to this case, as it gives an opportunity to gauge the temper of the authorities of Rutherford County. If the judge and attorney-general are disposed to be fair in this matter they can do nothing else than dismiss the case when the facts are brought to their notice at the time of trial. If they are not disposed to be fair, they may force the case to trial. However this may be, they should have opportunity to show what manner of spirit they are of. If we were to venture an opinion it would be that the court will be governed by the law, and quash the indictment if the facts are as we believe them to be.
