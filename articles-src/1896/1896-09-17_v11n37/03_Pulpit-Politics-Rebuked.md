# PULPIT POLITICS REBUKED.

The stultification of person and office which results to the clergyman who turns his pulpit into a political rostrum, and to which so many of this class seem oblivious, is not hidden from the eyes of secular observers. In evidence, we reprint from the Chicago Times-Herald, of September 8, some forcible comments upon the case of a well-known New York clergyman, who has made himself conspicuous of late in this line of effort. The Herald's rebuke is all the more noteworthy because of the fact that the Herald and the clergyman in question stand together upon the issue which has been the latter's theme of discourse:—

"Christianity has been sufficient to dominate the most enlightened portions of the earth for eighteen hundred years. Its philosophy has overcome the legacy of Egypt, Greece and Rome, and continues to triumph over the intellectual syndicates of skepticism that follow each other in monumental groups, age after age. The irresistible sweetness of its creed has carried pioneers through the perils of the wilderness as broad streams bear the ships along during the night. Its warmth has kept alive humanity in everlasting snows and cooled the brow of suffering in the ever-

lasting tropic. Vast as imagination, adequate to every conceivable need of any clime, of every country, of all classes of the human race, eternal as its adherents believed Deity itself, there is a time when it is rolled up like a scroll, as the heavens some time are to be rolled, according to the prophet; and the rolling in these days is done by some little political preacher. On his lips Christianity withers and campaign sensation becomes its squalid substitute.

"The political preacher, no matter to what denomination he may attach himself, is almost invariably a man who, through lack of native ability to acquire distinction as an expounder of Christianity or grace to be content with obscurity, resolves to obtain notoriety by offending against religion. The first duty of a patriot priest is to preach respect for law and obedience to authority. The last offense a congregation should tolerate in a pulpit is incitement of anarchy and suggestion of treason.

"Rev. ——, of New York City, finds Christianity too pygmy for him while parties wrangle. His gigantic intellect, towering above that of Christ and his apostles and disciples, deliberately and with purpose aforethought, discarded religion from his alleged sanctuary Sunday last at New York City and delivered itself thus:—

If Bryan is elected two million more men will be idle, and, added to the million men idle caused by the present administration, we will have in this country three million idle men. Will these men starve? No; they will fight for bread. They will pillage, burn and murder. What will Mr. Bryan do? He will turn the army and navy on these men. The starving men will fire on the flag and war will follow. When the flag is fired on farmers of the West, the men of the South, who are to-day talking free silver and supporting Bryan, will rally round the flag and shoot down these three million starving men. The starving and desperate men will be killed and the nation will be saved. For this nation will survive for ever, as I believe we are God's favored people.

"This is the language of a lunatic or of an incendiary. The brutal farce into which he degraded his office was terminated, we are told, in the pathetic irony of a 'benediction.' There logical indeed would it have been if his congregation had replied with a malediction upon him who did not bless but on that occasion at least defiled a temple they had dedicated to Christian truth.

"There are times when patriotism may with propriety be voiced from a chancel. There is never a time when partisanship . . . can enter a church without leaving behind it a need of holy water. . . . Let the people take care of their political concerns and let the pulpit preach the gospel. 'Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's.' If the pulpit observed this commandment better the pew would not be empty so large a part of the year."
