More definite information concerning the recent arrest of Alexander Philpott, a Tennessee Adventist, for Sunday work, reveals the fact that it occurred not in Bedford County, but in Rutherford County. Ex-Senator W. P. Tolly, well-known to Sentinel readers as a staunch and able advocate of religious liberty, is a resident of that county and will doubtless be heard from in defense of freedom of conscience. The trial of this case will not occur until sometime during the week beginning October 19, or possibly not until the following week. Murfreesborough is the county seat of Rutherford County, and the trial will take place there.
