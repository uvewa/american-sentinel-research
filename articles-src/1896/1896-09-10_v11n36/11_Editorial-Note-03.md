The article on another page, "The Business of Preachers," should be carefully read. The subject is one that should be understood not only by preachers, but by the people.

That the preacher as a man has the same rights as other men cannot be denied; but when he uses his official position of an ambassador for Christ for the promotion of interests not within the sphere of his commission from Christ, he is a guilty of perversion as any other accredited agent who uses for one purpose money or influence intrusted to him for quite another purpose.

The minister who takes politics into the pulpit both misrepresents Christ by going outside of the gospel commission while professing to be acting under it, and imposes upon his congregation who expect him to preach, not politics, but religion.

Politics in its best sense is simply the science of conducting business for the public; and as well might the minister drag the business of rival firms into the pulpit, recommending the one and denouncing the other, as to discuss the policies of parties. The man has a right to do such things in a proper way; the minister has no such right, for it is the divine commission and call that make him a minister, and his commission is not only silent as to politics, but inferentially forbids the theme by assigning the minister his subject, namely, the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ.
