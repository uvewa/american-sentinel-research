### THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND IN PARLIAMENT.

In England, as probably all readers of the SENTINEL know, there is a State Church—the "Church of England." Other church members are "nonconformists." The latter probably outnumber the adherents of the State Church, but receive no governmental recognition. The State Church receives the attention of Parliament, and being composed of two divisions—"High Church" and "Low Church"—sometimes gives that body no small amount of work in the settlement of church differences. This is especially noticeable the the present year. Not since the disestablishment of the Church in Ireland in 1868, we are told, has there been a session in which the concerns of the Church were more before Parliament than was the case during the summer just past.

In England, the State Church system is seen at its best; for the prevailing sentiment of the people is enlightened and liberal. But seen at its best, it presents no features that are not antichristian. The Outlook, of Aug. 29, gives us the following view of its practical workings, as now observed:—

The majority of English church living—rectories, vicarages, and perpetual miracles—are private property, and oftentimes go with the landed estates out of which the ecclesiastical parishes are formed. Some English landlords have as many as nine or ten of these living in their gift. What is meant by "in their gift" is that, when a living becomes vacant, the lord of the manor has the nomination in his hands. He presents to a living, and the new incumbent, having proved himself satisfactory to the bishop of the diocese, is formally admitted. Once admitted, he is in possession for life; and the lord of the manor, or whoever the patron may be, has nothing more to do with the living until the next vacancy occurs. When ecclesiastical patronage is attached to estates in the possession of Roman Catholics, the owners lose their rights to presentation. It is invested for the time being in one or other of the universities of Oxford and Cambridge.

The great landowners, as a rule, exercise these peculiar rights in connection with the Established Church with care and discretion, and usually with satisfaction to the bishops. There is seldom a scandal in connection with these presentations. Scandal arises in connection with living in the gift of needy people, who, when a living seems likely to become vacant, turn the right to the next presentation into cash. In connection with living in such hands there has long existed a regular trade. There are numerous agencies in London which make a specialty of advoysons, and when these agencies have a living on hand they advertise it, in just the same way as estate agents advertise houses and lands. These advertisements can be seen any day in the columns of the Times or the Standard.

The expert advertisement writers of New York could not produce more attractive advertisements than some of those emanating from the brokers in church livings. The advertisements usually make a central point of the advanced age of the present incumbent. This, of course, is a most important fact for a purchaser; for no one desires to invest money in a living when he may have to wait twenty years before he can present to it. A living is not a marketable property unless the incumbent is advanced in life, and the vacancy may be expected at an early date. The advertisements also describe the character of the Church service, whether it is High or Low.

High Church livings are in greatest demand, and it is always important for a prospective rector or vicar to know the character in this respect of the parish to which he is going. If the incumbent he is to replace has been a Low Churchman, the church wardens will be Low Churchmen too. They stay on after the old incumbent is gone, and may give trouble to a new incumbent of High Church tendencies. The age of the incumbent and the character of the service having been stated, there usually comes in these advertisements of advows on for sale a glowing description of the parish and the surrounding country. The society of the neighborhood comes in for some notice, and oftentimes stress is laid on the fact that the fishing in the neighborhood is good, and that a pack of hounds meets a few miles away. Occasionally emphasis is laid on the fact that there are no dissenters in the parish—no Wesleyans, Congregationalists or Baptists; and that there is no school board.

For years past, sincere and earnest Churchmen have been shocked at the open manner in which the brokerage and auctioneering of church livings have been carried on. The Cranborne Bill is one of several efforts which have been made to regulate and check the sales.

It is only the spirit of the Reformation, which obtained such a strong hold upon the liberty-loving Anglo-Saxons, that has prevented England from reaping the more baleful fruits of this essentially papal system.
