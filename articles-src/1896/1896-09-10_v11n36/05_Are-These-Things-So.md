### ARE THESE THINGS SO?

[Special Cable Dispatch to the Sun.]

London, Sept. 5.—Turkey, it should be said, is not the only country where barbarities, without a shadow of excuse, are being committed. A terrible indictment has been made against the British forces engaged in suppressing the rebellion in Matabeleland. Several private letters from Buluwayo this week describe with an air of verity atrocities which amount to wholesale legalized murder. Nothing worse in general character is reported from Constantinople than this, from Englishmen engaged with the British detachment in pursuit of natives:—

"When out on patrol a week ago we suddenly surprised five Kaffirs sitting down watching some goats. They simply jumped up, threw down their shields and assegais, and covered their faces with their hands. One short command was given, and the five men were shot dead. We rode on as if nothing had happened.

"Another case is that of a young green doctor sent fresh from home by the Red Cross Society. He was tying up a wounded Matabele when a sergeant came by.

"'Hulls, doctor,' says he, 'what are you up to?'

"'Attending this wounded native,' replies medico.

"'Nonsense,' says the officer. 'Leave the nigger and come and look after some of my men.'

"'No,' says the doctor, 'I must attend to this native first.'

"'Oh, you must, eh? All right. Bandage away.' And he drew his revolver and blew half the Kaffir's head off."
