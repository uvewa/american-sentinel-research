## THE SULTAN'S MISTAKE.

The following, which is taken from some statements made by the Rev. Mr. MacQueen, of Boston, just returned to this country from Turkey, affords a pretty good index to the amount of good done by the harangues of the clergy in favor of war upon the Turk. The Sultan, upon the arrival of Miss Clara Barton and her company, to engage in Armenian relief work, provided them with escorts. Mr. MacQueen tells us:—

When they first started, orders for the escorts were countermanded. This was because a bundle of American papers had arrived containing Talmage's sermon in which he fiercely denounced the Sultan. Seven days after, when the Turkish authorities learned who Talmage was and that his speech was not equivalent to a declaration of war, the order was reissued.

Considering all the facts in the case, not omitting to take account of the nature of Mr. Talmage's oratory, it would seem hardly more than to be expected that the Sultan should get from his "sermon" the impression he did. It is a rather peculiar state of things, from a Christian point of view, when what purports to be the preaching of the gospel of peace, by American clergymen, sounds to foreign rulers like an American declaration of war.
