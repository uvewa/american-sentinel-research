## THE BUSINESS OF PREACHERS.

The business of preachers is to preach the gospel. Probably all preachers are agreed upon this point, but the world suffers by reason of the wide disagreement among them concerning what the gospel includes.

The gospel is the word of God. It is the business of preachers, as such, to preach that word, and no other. No preacher has any business to present, as gospel truth, that which is merely his own conclusions, however sure he may be that those conclusions are correct.

We have reached a time when the relation of the preacher to politics has become a theme of widespread discussion. There seems to be some doubt in the public mind as to the propriety of political discourses from the pulpit. In theory at least, the general sentiment in this country is opposed to a union of Church and State—a combination of religion with politics; and when the two are spoken of and treated as belonging to the same sphere of action, the average mind instinctively hesitates to give its sanction. But many voices are now heard explaining away this apparent distinction of nature and purpose, and showing how a clergyman can properly engage as a gospel minister in the discussion of politics. For instance, we quote the following from the Herald and Presspeter (Cincinnati), of September 2:—

There is a false sentiment in some localities that the ministry should confine themselves to religion and the church, and have nothing to do with politics. There is no class or profession that has more to do with making good citizens. They gather the people from all classes and conditions of society; they bring them under the influence of gospel teaching; they instruct them in their duty to God and man, and build up the highest type of citizenship. Shall the man who teaches duty to God be forbidden to teach duty to society and the State? A minister is a citizen, and when he took the vows that set him apart to the sacred office, he became no less a citizen. There was nothing in his obligation which bound him to give up his civil rights. He does not cease to pay taxes, nor is he released from military service or jury duty. When the community is aroused over the discussion of questions that involve public morals, he as a public educator may have a duty to perform. Certainly he has a right to be heard when his home and friends are affected. We see no reason why any man should be denied a voice in any public matter affecting the weal of the State. On the contrary every man has a duty to the State which he should intelligently and faithfully perform.

This certainly sounds very plausible, and is objectionable only in so far as it tends to break down the distinction which should be clear in every mind between the spheres of civil things and things religious. In civil things the majority must rule, and their rule must be by force. In religious things each individual must decide for himself, and his decision must be voluntary, not forced. When religion and politics are mixed, force is brought into the domain of voluntary action, and votes are made to do the work of faith.

Of course a clergyman has, like any other person, a civil right to express his mind upon secular questions which concern the welfare of individuals and of society. He may even do this from the pulpit, so far as civil rights are concerned; though the pulpit is certainly not the most appropriate place for secular themes. But let him present these as his own ideas and conclusions, and not as the word of God. This is the important point in the whole subject. The minister of the gospel is not sent to preach his own word, but God's word. Why? Because there is no gospel in anything but the word of God. The gospel is "the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth." Rom. 1:16. What power is that? It is the power of God's word? And what is that power? "By the word of the Lord were the heavens made, and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth." Psalm 33:6. It is creative power. God's word created all things in the beginning; it creates a new man now when received in faith; and that is how a sluner is saved from sin. He is "born again"—created new in Jesus Christ. This is the mystery of God in the gospel.

Then what business has the gospel minister to put his own word in the place of the word of God? Is man's word a foundation for Christian faith? Is there any power in it to save the soul? Can it create a new and perfect man, as God's word can? The great trouble with most of the preaching of this day touches this very point. It substitutes man's word for God's. The "sermon" presents the ideas, observations and conclusions of the preacher, in the place of the divine truths stated in the Scriptures. This is the reason there is so little power in it against the wickedness which is so dominant in society. And this is why it is deemed necessary for the preacher to appeal to the civil power and seek for a combination of politics with religion.

When the Saviour was on trial before Pilate, the latter asked him, "What is truth?" The Saviour had answered this question a short time before, in these words of his prayer for his disciples: "Sanctify them through thy truth; thy word is truth." John 17:17. Would that preachers would always keep this text in mind! "Thy word"—not man's word—"is truth." It is the preacher's business to preach truth. He may feel very sure that his own conclusions are truth, but that is not to the point. No man is infallible. Of no man can it be said, Thy word is truth. This is not impeaching any man's honesty. It is but one way of stating the truth that all men are finite, and that "to err is human." No man's word can constitute the "sure foundation" which the Christian must have to stand upon in the contest with sin.

Several prominent preachers have of late been preaching strong "sermons" against "free silver," denouncing as robbery the plan of one of the political parties to bring about "free coinage." This affords an illustration of the point under consideration. These men are of course very sure that they are right, and it may be that they are. But again, it may be that they are not right. Multitudes of intelligent people believe that they are not. There is no certainty about it. What they state is merely their own conclusions, which no one is under obligation to receive as truth. So likewise the preacher may "preach" upon "any public matter affecting the weal of the State," or of the community where he resides, if he chooses to do so; but unless he can read what he would present from the word of God, he will present merely his own opinions—nothing more. If anyone wishes to "preach" in this way, of course it is his privilege to do so.

But the preacher is not willing that his political sermon should be viewed in this light. He wants it to be received as gospel truth. He wants the same obligation to attach to it which pertains to the word of God. He wants to be able to speak upon secular matters of public interest, with the accredited authority of a prophet of God. He is not willing to present his political views as merely his own opinions, to be taken for what they are worth. The distinction between man's word and God's word having been largely obliterated in the public mind by the preaching of human tradition, speculation and fancy, in the place of Scripture, it is now sought to break down the distinction between the sphere of religion, in which God's word rules, and the sphere of civil things, in which man's word must prevail, as expressed by the majority of the people. And never in the history of this nation was sentiment in favor of this intermixture of politics and religion being formed more rapidly than is the case at the present time. And the meaning of it is that Church and State are rapidly seeking to occupy the same spheres of human thought and life, which can be done only by a union of these two powers, contrary to the foundation principles of our American Government.
