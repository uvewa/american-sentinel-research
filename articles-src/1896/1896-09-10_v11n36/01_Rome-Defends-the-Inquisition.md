# ROME DEFENDS THE INQUISITION.

On another page we reprint from the Catholic Mirror an article which deserves more than passing notice, not alone because of what it contains, but because of the prominence of the Roman Catholic layman who writes it, and for the reason that it is published with evident approbation in the Mirror, the official organ of Cardinal Gibbons, Archbishop of Baltimore.

"The Church" Ruled the World.

In the very outset it will be observed that in the times of which Mr. Conway writes, "the Church of Christ," by which he means the Roman Catholic Church, "ruled with the scepter of faith the civilized world." The same fact, namely, the universality of Rome's political domination at the era of the Inquisition, is emphasized all through the first part of Mr. Conway's article. This fact itself, insisted upon by Mr. Conway, is sufficient to show that Rome and Rome alone was responsible, not only for the Inquisition, but for the untold horrors which everywhere attended its operations not only in Spain, but also in France, Italy, and the Netherlands, and, indeed, wherever it was established.

# Denials Not Proof.

It is true that later in his article Mr. Conway attempts to explain away some of the most damaging facts relating to the operations of the Inquisition, and that he even denies that the number of its victims were as great as is generally stated; but denials are not proof, and the facts of history concerning the work of both the Spanish and the Roman Inquisitions are too well authenticated to be successfully disputed at this late day.

# Racked Only Once!

To plead that "the Inquisition was a very merciful tribunal," indeed "almost a compassionate tribunal," as Mr. Conway does, because "a man was only allowed to be racked once," is poerile. One racking was sufficient to dislocate many of the joints and to leave the victim a physical wreck, and yet we are assured in the closing decade of the nineteenth century that the tribunal which habitually inflicted this fiendish torture was almost compassionate!

TORTURE CHAMBER OF THE INQUISITION.

Taking a Victim from the Rack.

The Inquisition was a very merciful tribunal; I repeat it, almost a compassionate tribunal. . . A man was only allowed to be racked once, which no one can deny was a most wonderful leniency in those times." See Mirror article on page 285.

## If Right Why Deny the Facts?

But why, believing as he does that the Inquisition was right, Mr. Conway cares to enter even a partial denial of the charges against it is more than we can see. If, as he insists, "the church" was justified in punishing heretics even to the death, then the exact number so punished can make no material difference. If, as Mr. Conway also insists, it was the bounden duty of the church to root out bersey, she certainly could not be blamed for using whatever means seemed most likely to accomplish that result in the shortest time; and certainly nothing could have been more effective than the utter extinction of the incorrigible.

## The Church Claims Infallibility.

It must be remembered that the Catholic Church claims infallibility through its head, the Pope. If this claim were true, the state of society and the customs of the times could make no difference with the acts of the church; they must be right. It is true that this infallibility is claimed only in "matters of faith and morals," but certainly the right of the church to persecute dissenters, even to the death, is a question both "of faith and morals." Members of that church evidently realize this, and practically admit it when they attempt to justify the action of the church in establishing and maintaining the Inquisition. Were it simply a question of expediency, of church discipline, or of anything outside of that for which they claim infallibility, they would certainly not stultify themselves by making any defense. Then might they well afford to say: "The church has never claimed infallibility in discipline; and in establishing and maintaining the Inquisition she erred." But as the dogma that the church has a right to coerce the conscience, to compel obedience, is a matter of "faith," and as torturing and killing men is a question of morals, they dare not say that the church erred in these things.

## Two Inquisitions.

"History," says Mr. Conway, "divides the Inquisition into two distinct tribunals; the Roman Inquisition and the Inquisition of the Spanish Government. Great care," he adds, "must be taken not to confound the two. One is purely ecclesiastical, the other strictly secular." In the light of this full and candid admission that the Roman Inquisition belonged wholly to the church, it is needless to dwell upon that phase of the subject. We shall examine briefly, therefore, his statement that "the other," namely, the Spanish Inquisition, was "strictly secular." And in so doing we shall find that "great care" is indeed required not to confound the two, so much are they alike, in origin, purpose and operation.

## Defends the Spanish Inquisition.

In the first part of the latter half of his article Mr. Conway discusses the Spanish Inquisition at considerable length and gives quite an account of its origin, which he endeavors to show was purely political. He ascribes it altogether to the desire of the king to establish such a tribunal for political reasons, but in doing this he himself very clearly shows that this desire sprang, primarily, from intense religious feeling; and, as in his defense of the Roman Inquisition, he appeals in its justification to the customs of the people who lived at that time.

## To Detect Jewish Hypocrites.

The claim made by Mr. Conway is that the Spanish Inquisition was directed particularly against the Jews, many of whom, "thirsting for wealth, while secretly remaining Jews, pretended to profess the Catholic faith, were baptized, pushed themselves into the courts and kingly palaces, became holders of large estates, and even were found among the priests and prelates of the Church of God. In this hidden, underhanded manner, they were seeking to overturn the institutions, not only of the Catholic Church, but also of the Spanish nation."

## Why Such Hypocrisy?

A pertinent question would be, Why did the Jews thus profess a faith which they did not believe? Was it not because of the corrupt union of Church and State which placed a premium upon hypocrisy, and upon moral and political corruption? and is it not evident from this that the logic of any union of Church and State is unbounded corruption in both? or an inquisition? because where it is made a matter of financial or political profit for men to profess a certain faith, many will be found to do so, and when they have so professed they will use their influence and positions for their own aggrandizement. To discover the secret thoughts of the hearts of such men the methods of the Inquisition must be used. Therefore Mr. Conway's statement of facts constitutes a powerful argument against all union of Church and State, because such union must, in the first place, beget and foster hypocrisy; and hypocrisy can be completely discovered only by wringing from men the secrets of their hearts; and this can be done only by torture.

## Was It Political?

But let us examine the political element which Mr. Conway insists entered into this matter. He says that these Jews in "this hidden, underhanded manner" "were seeking to overturn the institutions, not only of the Catholic Church, but also of the Spanish nation." The last accusation, namely, that they were seeking to overturn the Spanish nation, must be understood in the light of other utterances by the same writer, who, in his attempted justification of the persecution of "the heretic," styles him "a foe to civilization." Roman Catholics believe that the Roman Catholic Church is the only efficient promoter of civilization, consequently anything that is opposed to the Catholic faith is, as they view it, opposed to civilization. In like manner they believe that the Catholic Church is the only adequate conservator of stable, civil government, therefore that which is opposed to the Catholic Church is opposed to civil government; thus runs their theory. So that in its last analysis that which is here assumed and asserted to be political was in fact religious; and to reach this and stamp it out the Spanish Inquisition, equally with the Roman Inquisition, was established.

## The Consent of the Pope Necessary.

Again, Mr. Conway gives his whole case away when, in attempting to show that the Spanish Inquisition was "secular," he admits the fact that before it could be established the consent of the Pope was necessary; and seeing himself the incongruity of having to receive the consent of the church for the establishment of something "strictly secular," he asks: "What need was there of the permission of the popes? If the Inquisition was purely secular what had the Pope or the church to do with its actions?" And answering his own question he says: "The permission of Rome was necessary for many reasons, but chiefly for two, first, because the men who were appointed as inquisitors by the Court of Spain were priests and prelates and theologians of the church, and were for that reason under the jurisdiction of the popes; and secondly, and most especially, because the Inquisition was instituted to try people on matters of faith."

## Managed by Priests, Prelates and Theologians.

These facts thus clearly stated by a prominent Roman Catholic writer in a prominent Roman Catholic paper ought certainly to satisfy any candid mind as to the nature of the Spanish Inquisition. It existed by permission of the church, was administered by priests, prelates and theologians of the church, and existed for the purpose of trying people in matters of faith, and the punishments inflicted were for departures from the faith of the church.

## Two Vital Questions.

But perhaps too much space has already been devoted to the discussion of this phase of the question. Two vital points yet remain to be examined. First, the confession of adulterous union of the Church with the State; and second, the parallel afforded by his article between justification of intolerance in the Dark Ages and justification of intolerance in our own day.

## Confession of Adulterous Union.

Speaking of the relation which existed between the Church and the State in the days of the Inquisition, Mr. Conway says: "To put it briefly, in those Middle Ages there was the greatest union of Church and State. This union was the natural outcome of the beautiful marriage of civil and religious institutions. The State, then, as it should now, protected and defended her [his] holy bride from danger and persecution." It is true that in the 21st chapter of Revelation the City of God is called "the bride, the Lamb's wife." But all through the Scriptures marriage is used to illustrate the relation which exists between Christ and his Church, and the Catholic Church holds and teaches that the church is the bride of Christ. But here we have it declared by a prominent Catholic writer, in an official organ of the church, that the union which existed between the Catholic Church and the State in the Middle Ages "was the natural outcome of the beautiful marriage of civil and religious institutions;" and that this was nothing less than the marriage of the State and the Church is shown by the words, "The State, then, as it should now, protected and defended her [his] holy bride [the church] from danger and persecution." This is a confession of all that Protestants have ever charged against the Church of Rome, namely, that she is the lewd woman described in the 17th chapter of Revelation, "with whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication."

The church being first married to Christ, and subsequently joined to the State, is by the Scriptures declared to be guilty of spiritual adultery. "For the woman which hath a husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of her husband. So then if, while her husband liveth, she be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress."⁹

What a warning is there in this against that for which the National Reformers are laboring, and upon which they insist, namely, a union of the State with religion, not, they say, with any particular church, but simply with Christianity. That is exactly what they

⁹ Rom. 7:3-5.

had in Rome, and that which followed was only the logical and inevitable outcome.

## A Perfect Parallel.

One important point remains to be noticed, namely, the parallel between the "justification" of intolerance in the area of the Inquisition and the "justification" of intolerance now. We shall show this parallel by placing side by side a portion of two paragraphs from Mr. Conway's article and a short extract from Judge Hammond's dictum given August 1, 1891, at Memphis, Tenn., in the case of R. M. King, a Seventh-day Adventist, tried, convicted, and imprisoned for practical dissent from the religious faith of his neighbors as to the particular day to be observed as the Sabbath:—

CONWAY'S DEFENSE OF THE ROMAN INQUISITION. TENNESSEE INQUISITION.

"This was done when all the world embraced the teachings of the Catholic Church. King and subject, prince and peasant, rich and poor, all believed her doctrines not only to be true, but to be incapable of being false. Schools and churches, assemblies and meetinghouses, echoed and reechoed with her tenets and dogmas. And so, quite naturally, it seemed to all who lived in such surroundings, and rightly too, that any one who sought to destroy the faith of the nation, which is at all times its most priceless treasure, was as great an enemy to the State as one who contrived to undermine its civil institutions.

"Moreover, since all statesmen and public officers were at the same time Catholics, it is most easy to understand that they enacted laws and punishment in keeping with their religious convictions. . . . All the laws had a tinge of Catholicity, and they were carried out in a manner savoring of the principles of that universal religion. Consequently, it is evident, that one who was a heistic then, was, by that very fact in opposition to the spirit of the laws and customs of his country—in other words, a disturber of the public peace, and an underminer of civil society."

By a sort of factitious advantage, the observers of Sunday have secured the aid of the civil law, and adhere to that advantage with great tenacity, in spite of the clamor for religious freedom, and the progress that has been made in the absolute separation of Church and State. . . . The court cannot change that which has been done, however done, by the civil law in favor of the Sunday observers. The religion of Jesus Christ is so interwoven with the texture of our civilization and everyone of its institutions, that it is impossible for any man or set of men to live among us and find exemption from its influences and restraints. Sunday observance is so essentially a part of that religion that it is impossible to rid our laws of it. . . . It is idle to expect in government perfect action or harmony of essential principles, and whoever administers, whoever makes, and whoever executes the laws, must take into account the imperfections, the passions, the prejudices, religious or other, and the errings of men because of these. . . . If one ostentatiously labors for the purpose of emphasizing his distaste for, or disbelief in, the custom [of keeping Sunday], he may be made to suffer for his defiance by persecutions, if you call them so, on the part of the great majority, who will compel him to rest when they rest.

The parallel is complete, and he who assents to Judge Hammond's reasoning in defense of the Tennessee Inquisition, cannot consistently dissent from Mr. Conway's, in justification of the Roman Catholic Inquisition of the Middle Ages, as it existed in France, Spain, Holland and other countries. There can be no compromise on this question. It is "impossible for a magistrate [civil authority] to adjudge the right of preference among the various sects which profess the Christian faith, without creating a claim to infallibility, which would lead us back to the church of Rome."

It is unjust to imply as does Judge Hammond by the use of the expression, "ostentatiously labors," that the defendant is this case rendered himself purposely obnoxious to his neighbors. His work was of course open to the observation of the public, not had it not been done by an Adventist it would have occasioned little more than passing remark.
