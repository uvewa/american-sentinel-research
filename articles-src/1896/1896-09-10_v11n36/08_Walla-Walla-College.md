WALLA WALLA COLLEGE, COLLEGE PLACE, WASH.

The new college year begins September 16. A number of important changes have been made in the courses of study which allows the faculty to give its entire strength to the developing of students for the work in a shorter time than we have been prepared to do in the past with the old arrangement of courses. Any one desiring to become acquainted with our work may do so by applying to the president, E. A. Sutherland, for a calendar.
