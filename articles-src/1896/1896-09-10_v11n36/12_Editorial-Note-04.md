The American Sentinel has no opinion to express as to the merits of the respective candidates or platforms, but it has a decided opinion as to the propriety of degrading the pulpit to the level of the political stump. The practical workings and effect of doing this are well illustrated by the following which appeared in one of the morning papers in this city on the 7th inst.:

"Rev. Thomas Dixon, Jr., preached a sensational sermon at the Academy of Music yesterday morning on 'The Political Crisis.' He said many unkind things of William Jennings Bryan, the Democratic Party and the free silver movement. In doing so he managed to stir up a hornet's nest and create a scene in which cheers and hisses were about equally mingled.

"Professor Edwin V. Wright, who founded the Anti-Monopoly League and the Bimetallic Association, was in the audience. He has just returned from a stumping tour for silver with George Fred Williams through New England. He listened quietly to Mr. Dixon's excoriation until the preacher asserted that the Republican Party stood for all that was good and pure, while the Democratic Party was the champion of all that was the absolute reverse. Then Professor Wright jumped to his feet, shook his fist at the pastor and exclaimed:

"'What you say is false—absolutely false. You don't know what you're talking about.'

"All were dismayed for a moment and then a shout of applause arose, followed by a storm of hisses.

"The Rev. Mr. Dixon hadn't expected all this, and it took him several minutes to discover his own location. Then he proceeded calmly with his dissertation. He complimented the Populists and said the People's Party had been much maligned.

"'The Democratic party was in hell,' said he, 'when it pulled itself together by tying to the Populists in the Chicago convention. Don't you believe that all Populists are ignorant. The leaders of the party are men of brains and of education. And they are fine-looking men, too. Many of them are handsomer even than Theodore Roosevelt.'

"This, of course, scored a laugh, and Mr. Dixon continued:

"'In such a crisis as now confronts us, it is the duty of every patriotic citizen to vote the straight Republican ticket. I voted for Mr. Cleveland, and now before God I acknowledge my sin.'

"'I'm going to vote for Bryan,' some one shouted, 'and —'

"'Here, too!' came from another.

"However, Mr. Dixon was not taking a straw vote, so he paid no attention to the interruptions.

"'The proposition of Mr. Bryan and his party,' said he, 'to pay off the bonds of the United States, on which 100 cents on the dollar were raised, in coin worth only 53 cents on the dollar, is downright rascality. It is nothing more nor less than bunco steering.'

"'I wont stand this any longer,' said a patriarchal looking gentleman with a long flowing white beard, and he left the building. Fully one hundred others followed. Then Mr. Dixon scored Mr. Bryan for advocating a policy which, he said, would permit insurance companies to pay widows and orphans in depreciated coin. He predicted disaster in case of Bryan's election, and said that fully 2,000,000 men would be immediately thrown out of work. Every one to whom a dollar was due would get only 53 cents.

"'It is not true,' shouted James T. Madden. Then there was more applause, and more hisses. Mr. Madden went to the speaker, gave him his card, and left the place, followed by many more."

Such scenes should bring the blush of shame to the cheek of every Christian.

Surely "Babylon is fallen, is fallen," and is fast becoming "the hold of every foul spirit, and the cage of every unclean and hateful bird."
