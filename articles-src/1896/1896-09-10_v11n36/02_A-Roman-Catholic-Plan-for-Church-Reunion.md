## A ROMAN CATHOLIC PLAN FOR CHURCH REUNION.

### SAYS the New York Sun, of September 1:—

The movement for the reconciliation of the Anglican Communion to the Papal See has Catholic as well as Protestant supporters; for instance, the Abbe Portal, an eminent Catholic theologian, concurs with Lord Halifax in believing that the fusion should be and could be effected. The plan which he favors was defined in a recent speech. He concurs with Lord Halifax in deeming the true unifying process to be not the conversion of individuals, to which the Catholic propaganda in England has been hitherto restricted, but corporate union, by which he means an agreement for consolidation between the leaders and authorities of the Church of England on the one part and of the church of Rome upon the other. This mode of consolidation, he says, would save the individual from the torture of doubt and other risks incurred by a personal investigation of the faith, and, above all, it would avoid the danger of shaking the whole roots of his spiritual life by forcing him to break violently with his religious past.

The Sun proceeds to state that this plan for reunion of the Anglican and Catholic communions has received condemnation from a source supposed to be the pen of Cardinal Vaughan, the English primate; and which would not be surprising, considering its impolitic nature in this enlightened day. Nevertheless the plan is essentially papal, and by it vast numbers of the heathen were, back in the early years of the great apostasy, received into the papal fold.

It was this wholesale "conversion" and reception of heathenism into the church that made the Papacy essentially what it is to-day in respect to religious belief and ceremonies. The conversion of individuals from heathenism to Christianity was altogether too slow a process to suit the purposes of the church in those days when she was struggling to rise to a place of preeminence from amidst the tumult of hostile forces around her. Conversions were by tribes and nations, through their "representatives," and officials of the church were not always particular whether these "conversions" were made with the consent of the "converted." Not infrequently the latter were given their choice between "conversion" and death. Of course this was because the "mystery of iniquity," of which the Apostle Paul warned the church in his day, was working in the church and had perverted the latter from the way of righteousness and truth.

If the Abbe Portal were a resident in the United States, however, we would not feel certain that his plan had not been suggested by some events of our own times, and which also represent the action of "Protestants." There is the movement which recently came before Congress, and will come before that body again, to make this nation "Christian" by amending its Constitution. This done, the people of the nation could be counted as Christians, without "the torture of doubt and other risks incurred by a personal investigation of the faith." This project has the approval and support of leading "Protestant" bodies in this country. As the reader may remember, also, it was not very long since that some prominent American Protestants counted all the Roman Catholics as supporters of a project for a national Sunday "law," because the project had the approval of Cardinal Gibbons. That it is right for "the leaders and authorities" in the Church to think for the masses in the Church, and for the latter to do as their superiors bid them, is a principle always upheld by the papal church, and justified by Protestants on that occasion.

In rejecting the Abbe's plan of "corporate reunion," the papal authorities simply set the principle aside as inapplicable to the occasion of Anglican reunion with Rome at this time. The day of wholesale "conversions" to the "faith" seems to be past, and Rome prospers now by other methods. It is doubtless with surprise that Rome sees this principle taken up and indorsed in the name of Protestantism. Her surprise must be exceeded only by her exultation as she sees "Protestantism" opening the way for her to work with all the power and success of pre-Reformation times, for the spiritual enslavement of mankind.
