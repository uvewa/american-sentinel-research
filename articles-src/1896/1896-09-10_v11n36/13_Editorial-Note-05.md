Applains in the East are fast approaching a crisis. Advices from Berlin under date of the 6th inst. state that the recent "conferences between the Czar and the Emperor and the Russian and German diplomats are said to have related to a new concert of the powers with regard to Turkey. It is known in Berlin that Prince Hohenlohe, the Imperial Chancellor, and Count von Osten-Sacken, the Russian Ambassador to Germany, are discussing a plan to place the Sultan under the tutelage of the Ambassadors of the powers in Constantinople, who will be empowered to control the Sultan's selection of Ministers and also his appointment of provincial Governors. The settlement of the troubles in Crete upon the basis of European supervision appears to have been the keynote of this scheme, which at least would maintain the nominal integrity of Turkey and for a time enable the powers to escape being dragged into a European war over the division of the spoils of the Ottoman Empire." How much longer the utter extinction of the Ottoman power in Europe and the withdrawal of the Turk to Jerusalem foretold in the prophetic Scriptures, can be delayed, only God knows; but all who have heard the warning may know that "at that time shall Michael [Christ] stand up [reign], the great prince which standeth for the children of thy people; and there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time: and at that time thy people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the book." Dan 12:1.
