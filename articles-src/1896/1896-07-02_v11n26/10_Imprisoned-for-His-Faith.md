## IMPRISONED FOR HIS FAITH.

P. M. HOWE, one of the three Seventh-day Adventist ministers, convicted of Sunday work some months since at Darrell, Ont., has at last been committed to jail at Chatham. He writes as follows to the president of the International Religious Liberty Association:—

Chatham Jail, June 19, 1896.

ELDER ALLEN MOON—Dear Brother: I am a prisoner in jail since 9:30 yesterday morning. The chief of police of Bidgeton came for me at 7 o'clock. He made many excuses for not taking me before. He has told so many tales that we hardly know when to believe him.

The jailer came very near refusing to take me, but did at last, and went to Judge Bell to see if I could be legally imprisoned. He said I could, and so settled the dispute as far as this court is concerned.

They treat me well. I have the same food as the other poor fellows have to eat; and besides, the comfort of the Holy Spirit bringing me joy and peace, with a contented mind. I feel as satisfied to be here as though I were sent to work for my heavenly Master in the open sunshine of heaven.

The Spirit has impressed upon my mind for some years that I would be imprisoned sooner or later, and I am sure that He who doeth all things well, will care for me while here and make me a power to some souls hereafter.

I never felt more determined to live out the truth of the Third Angel's message than now.

I know the power of a fallen Israel will unite with the State to crush out the truth by every kind of persecution; but God says for the comfort and encouragement of his little flock: "Hear the word of the Lord, ye that tremble at his word: Your brethren that hated you, that cast you out for my name's sake, said, Let the Lord be glorified: but he shall appear to your joy, and they shall be ashamed." Isa. 66:5.

I am glad to suffer with Him.

Your brother in bonds.

P. M. Howe.

It will be rembered by our readers that this man's offense, for which he must spend forty days in jail, was assisting in preparing some mortar preparatory to erecting a church building at Darrell late last fall. The work interfered with no one, and disturbed no one, except as it occasioned mental annoyance to bigoted minds simply from the fact that it was done on Sunday. It was only the annoyance of intolerance. Imprisoning a man for such an offense is not as bad as burning him at the stake, but the principle is the same.
