## BISHOP WIGGER'S QUERY.

[Journal (New York), June 8.]

THE Catholic Diocesan Union of New Jersey held a large and enthusiastic meeting in the Y. M. C. A. hall in Harrison, N. J., yesterday afternoon. President Murphy, of Jersey City, was in the chair, and delegates from all parts of the State were present.

The coming Presidential election was discussed, and Rev. Father Hogan, of St. Mary's Church, Rahway, at the request of Bishop Wigger, of the diocese of Newark, offered a resolution that the secretary of the union be directed to forward to each of the Republican candidates for the nomination for President the following question:—

In the event of your election to the Presidency of the United States, will you, in the administration of that office, make any discrimination against Roman Catholics on account of their religious belief?

When the question was read there was great applause, and the resolution was adopted unanimously. Bishop Wigger was prompted in having the resolution offered by a letter which he received from the Marquette Club, of St. Louis, which recently took similar action. The letter was indorsed by Rt. Rev. John J. Kane, bishop of St. Louis. Other Catholic societies throughout the country will take similar action.
