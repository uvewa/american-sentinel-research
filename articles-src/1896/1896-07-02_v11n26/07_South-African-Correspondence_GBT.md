# SOUTH AFRICAN CORRESPONDENCE.

BY G. B. THOMPSON.

The South African Republic, or Transvaal, is governed by the Dutch, the larger part of whom are supposed to be descendants of the Huguenot refugees who landed in Cape Colony in A. D. 1688, and afterwards emigrated across the Vaal River, and thus laid the foundation of what is now the Transvaal.

The legislative power is vested in two chambers, called the Volksraad (from volks, people, and rand, advice, or counsel). The members of both chambers are elected by the people. The following qualifications for office are required:

The qualifications of a member of the First Chamber are that he must be thirty years of age, and that he must either have been born in the country or have been a qualified voter for fifteen consecutive years. He must, furthermore, be a member of a Protestant church, a resident in the country, and in possession of fixed property within its limits. No person of an openly bad character, or one who has been sentenced for some criminal offense, or an rehabilitated insolvent, or persons being to each other in the relationship of father and son, or stepson or colored persons, or bastards, or officials receiving salary, are allowed to take a seat in the Volksraad.—The Transvaal, by John De Villiers, p. 16.

Unbelievers and Catholics are thus excluded from a voice in the law-making assembly; also persons of color. Religion is a qualification for office. This is very different to the stipulations of the American Constitution; and much might be said concerning the iniquity and injustice of such requirements. With such legislators, and a strict Sunday law, such as already exists, the country is one on which the most puritanical National Reformer can look and exclaim, 'Thou art a child after my own heart!' It is a Christian government, according to National Reform Christianity. Yet, what do we find? Many of the inhabitants, thinking that their lives were in danger from revolutionary strife in Johannesburg, fled at the beginning of this year from the country. The country for months has been seemingly on the point of war, and every preparation for the probable conflict has been made. At the present time about three-score of the leading citizens are in the jail of the capital under sentences of imprisonment for the crime of treason in a greater or less degree. Rumors are everywhere rife of corruption, both State and municipal. Boodlers abound, and capital rules the same as in other places; prostitution flourishes, and poverty and wretchedness abound the same as in other lands.

The Volksraad is now in session, and some steps are contemplated toward a more strict censorship of the press. A new press law has been published in the Staats Courant which is to be laid before the present session of the Volksraad. One article of this contemplated law reads as follows:

The State president has at all times the right (with the advice and consent of the Executive Council) to prohibit entirely or temporarily the dissemination of publications printed outside the republic, the contents of which, are, in his opinion, contrary to good morals or dangerous to peace and order in the republic.

It is through some such imperial ukase as this that the Herold der Wahrheit a paper published in Hamburg, Germany, and devoted entirely to the teaching of Bible truth as understood by its managers, and which takes no sides whatever in political questions, has been proscribed in Russia. What was taught in the paper did not coincide with the "opinions" of the law-making power of the government, and was, therefore, deemed to be against the best interests of the State, and inimical to peace; so it was prohibited.

The prospective law of the Transvaal seems to find its precedent in the imperial ukases of the Czar. While the intent of the law-making power may be the very best, such a law is exceedingly dangerous, and apt to be made a wrong use of. Take, for instance, the literature which is printed outside of the domain ruled by the Republic which teaches that the seventh day is the Sabbath, and that Sunday is only a relic of popery, and a day on which it is no sin to do manual work. This, in the "opinion" of the State president (the executive concurring), might be deemed heresy, and therefore "contrary to good morals," or "dangerous to peace and order in the Republic." Especially so, when they could cite such examples as in Canada where some gospel ministers were sentenced to imprisonment for such acts as pouring water in a barrel, etc., on the "venerable day of the sun." And in various portions of freely America, where Christians who had kept the Sabbath "according to the commandment," have been immured in filthy prison cells for such misdemeanors(?) as husking corn, gardening, cutting a little fuel for a widow, plowing away from any residence or road, removing sprouts from stumps in a secluded place, lifting a wheel-barrow over a fence, etc., on Sunday.

Another important division of South Africa is the Orange Free State. This is also a republic governed by the Dutch. The Volksraad is now in session; and the Sunday question has been introduced, and an effort is being made to secure a more strict Sunday law. The following, taken from the Cape Times, of May 16, 1896, will show what is being done:—

This morning the Raad discussed the law for the better observance of the sabbath. The commission reported the work at the 'mines was necessary for the welfare of the industry, recommended doubling the tariff on Sunday telegrams, and were of the opinion that not much sabbath desecration in way of anusements existed. Mr. C. Wessels opposed it on the grounds that it infringed the liberty of the subject, and referred to the case of the Jews, whose Sabbath was on Saturday, but would, under the proposed law, be compelled to observe the Christian sabbath Messrs J. Wessels and Steyn objected that if the Jews did not care to observe the Christian sabbath, they should stay away. Mr. Clote argued that the law was contrary to the institutions which guaranteed full religious liberty. Mr. Van der Walt said that under this law the President could be arrested for driving to church on Sunday. This afternoon in the Raad the discussion was continued. The law was strongly supported by Mr. Fraser, who said that mine owners rest on Sunday as well as burglars, and there was not the slightest necessity for games such as tennis, football, etc. After a lengthy discussion, the Raad approved of the principle of the law.

It is thus that Church and State are bound together in all lands, and the dove of freedom, with weary wing, hovers over all civilized lands, seeking for a place of rest, but finding none. The place of her abode, if found, must be amid the haunts of the untutored aborigines. Can it be that religious freedom,—the right to worship God according to the dictates of conscience,—has taken its everlasting flight from the earth? Verily, it seems so.
