## THE TROUBLES IN CRETE.

[New York Observer, June 11, 1896.]

SERIOUS fighting in Canea, the political capital of Crete, between the Christians and the Turks, promises to bring the Cretan question again to the front. It is true that something approaching civil war has existed in the island for some months past, the Cretans have virtually besieged the Turkish garrison in Vamos, but as the disorder has been inland, and the lives of foreign consuls and merchants were not menaced, no attention has been given it. The outbreak in Canea, and the report that the Cretans are preparing for further trouble with a view to forcing some action in their behalf, has, however, at once aroused the interest of the powers, doubtless in the fear that the disturbances may reopen the Eastern question in an acute form. Though order has been temporarily restored in the capital, and the siege of Vamos has been raised, the Cretans retreating to the mountains, the hurried despatch of reinforcements by the Porte excites suspicion that it intends to restore order in its usual summary fashion. It is not impossible that this is precisely what the Cretan Christians hope it will attempt, in the certainty that it would compel the intervention of Greece, which claims Crete in reversion, and so that of all the powers if a general war were to be averted. Since the island was restored to Turkey in 1840, revolt after revolt has occurred, but either through concessions on the part of the Porte, or the use by the powers of concerted pressure upon Greece, any general embroilment has been staved off. The danger now is that the concert of the powers may no longer exist, and thus that the Cretan outbreak may give the signal for the long-expected convulsion; the assumption being that in the event of a change in the relations of Crete to the Porte, England would oppose its sessions to Greece, as being under Franco-Russian influence, while France, Russia, and probably Germany would support it. That any action will be taken by the powers until a general insurrection has occurred is not to be expected, though if proper pressure were brought to bear upon the Porte the whole question of Turkish sovereignty over the island, the rights of Moslems and the liberties of the Christians in it, might be bridged over until the Ottoman Empire is broken up. If the sultan were induced to recall his garrison and appoint a foreign Christian prince ruler of Crete for life, with absolute powers, binding him only to send an annual tribute to Constantinople, the Cretan

question would be settled for a generation. Such a prince could create his own army for the preservation of order, just as Prince Alexander did in Bulgaria, could protect Moslems and Christians equally as is now done in Bosnia, and could in time make government more liberal as was done in Serbia. The Cretans are not advanced enough for popular government, do not care for it so long as government is good and their rights are protected, any more than the prince would care whether his subjects were Moslem or Christian so long as they were orderly and paid their taxes. In this way the sultan could get all that he now gets out of Crete—his tribute—would still be sovereign, and as he has already promised the island a Christian governor, would not suffer indignity by delegating his authority to a Christian prince.
