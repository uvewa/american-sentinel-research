THE CASE FOR SUNDAY "LAWS."

"Time is money." What right then has the State to demand one-seventh of an individual's time by a Sunday "law"? If time is money, it is property, and the State cannot, by the express declaration of the National Constitution, deprive any citizen of it "without due process of law."

What does the State want with a person's time, anyway? Unless that time is spent in labor for the State, the State can have no possible use for it. And the State has no right to appropriate the labor of an individual except in the case of a criminal. But by a Sunday "law," the State appropriates no labor, but merely the individual's time. It simply robs the individual without enriching itself.

The Creator alone has the right to demand one-seventh of every individual's time, and he has done this by the commandment to rest on the seventh day. But he does not, like the State, demand mere idleness, but he asks that the seventh day shall be actively employed in communion with him, through his word, his works, and by prayer and other forms of religious devotion. This is the purpose for which the Sabbath was instituted, and the only basis upon which it can in reason be sustained.

And this is the basis which in the minds of men upheld the Sunday "laws," when such "laws" were first framed. They were, in other words, based solely on religious grounds. They were religious "laws," and as such they have come down the centuries to us. The thousand and one civil "reasons" for them were never heard of until their manufacture became a necessity on account of the enlightened sentiment of modern times, which repudiated the principle that the State can rightfully enact laws on religious grounds.

It is absurd for the State to assume the right to claim a part of the people's time; it is sacrilegious for it to thus—albeit unwittingly—put itself in the place of God. It is unjust for it to tax the people by taking one-seventh of their time, and foolish to demand a tax for which it can have no possible use. This presents in part the case for Sunday "laws," considered from the standpoint of reason and justice.
