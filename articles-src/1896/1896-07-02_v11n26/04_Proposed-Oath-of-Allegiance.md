PROPOSED OATH OF ALLEGIANCE.

A CORRESPONDENT sends us the following for publication:—

OATH OF ALLEGIANCE

To American Constitutional Liberty, designed to pose a part of the Legal Qualification of every American Victim.

I, A B, do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I be here in and will ever strive to preserve, unimpaired, American Constitutional Liberty, as thus defined:

The right and privilege of every civilized American citizen of adult age and sound mind, to act upon his or her personal conscience and judgment, in every action that may arise, without interference from others, till it can be plainly shown that his or her action is a positive interference with or a serious menace of the equal rights of others.

Our correspondent adds this comment in a subsequent paragraph:—

Most intelligent American citizens are willing to defend American liberty if they can only get a clear concept of what it is; and this measure is designed to give every voting citizen, and, through them, all others, such a concept.

This suggests the only value such an oath could possibly have. The man who is genuinely attached to the principles of liberty will cheerfully award to every other man the rights which he demands for himself; and this he will do to the best of his understanding, whether bound by an oath to do so or not. On the other hand, the man who has not this genuine love of liberty, but who is actuated simply by a selfish desire for freedom for himself, will not regard the rights of others, even though he has taken a solemn oath to do so. What the American people want is not to take iron-clad oaths to do justice, but the principles of justice implanted in their very souls. The form of oath to which we have given place may, as our correspondent suggests, assist some to an understanding of the subject, and for this reason we print it.
