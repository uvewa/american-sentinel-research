THE ILLINOIS SUPREME COURT ON SUNDAY LEGISLATION.

We print on another page of this paper the recent decision of the Supreme Court of Illinois declaring void the so called "Cody Law" of that State prohibiting barbering on Sunday.

The opinion of the Court in this case is of more than ordinary interest, because unlike many judicial decisions it deals more in principles than in technicalities.

The broad principle underlying the decision is that "if the law prohibits that which is harmless in itself, or requires that to be done which does not tend to promote the health, comfort, safety and welfare of society, it will in such a case be an unauthorized exercise of power; and it will be the duty of the courts to declare such legislation void."

It is true that the court does say that "if the public welfare of the State demands that all business and all labor of every description, except work of necessity and charity, should cease on Sunday," etc., "the legislature has the power to enact a law requiring all persons to refrain from their ordinary callings on that day." But before using this language the court very clearly shows that no such condition exists, and that in the very nature of certain employments it could not exist, for barbering and other secular pursuits are declared to be not only not harmful but landible and even necessary to the health and comfort of the people; and if harmless and even nec-

essary six days in the week they certainly cannot become harmful upon one day by reason of anything of which the legislature can take cognizance.

Some of the remarks made by Justice Craig in passing seem very favorable to general Sunday legislation, but common sense forbids such an interpretation of his language. The court holds that the workingman's labor is his capital, and asks: "Can a law which takes that from a laborer be sustained?" The question admits of only a negative reply; and it is obvious that the case would not be made better by making the law broad enough to deprive all laborers in the State of one-seventh of their capital instead of taking it from a certain class only. It is a well-established principle of constitutional law that no one can be deprived of property without compensation. A man's time being property the State has no right to deprive him of any portion of it unless the public service requires it, and even then a man's time can no more be taken from him without compensation than could his land or his money.

The fact is, that under this decision the State of Illinois cannot maintain any Sunday statute prohibiting either labor or business on that day, but only such laws as may be necessary to protect "the peace and good order of society," which in the very nature of the case could not be disturbed by ordinary employments on Sunday followed in a quiet and orderly manner. It is safe to say that for the present, Illinois is safe from the inroads of Sunday "law" fanaticism. But be it remembered that "eternal vigilance is the price of liberty."
