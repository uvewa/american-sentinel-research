# INGERSOLL ON LEGAL RIGHTEOUSNESS.

(Contributed)

IN a recently published work by Melville D. Landon (Eli Perkins), entitled, "Kings of the Platform and Pulpit," I find the following:

He [Mr. Ingersoll] is opposed to the enforcement of the old Connecticut Blue Laws to make people good. He believes a man made good by law is not really good at heart, but is simply made to appear good. He is a legal hypocrite.

One day a fanatical talker—a Puritanical Blue Law man—who was in favor of enforcing strict Sunday laws, absolute prohibition, etc., came in on the New York Central train. Mr. Ingersoll heard him talk a spell and then asked him several questions.

"Would you like to live in a community where not one cigar could be smoked and not one drop of spirituous liquors could be sold or drunk?" Certainly," said the Blue Law man, "that would be a social heaven."

"And you would like to live where no one could play on the sabbath day; and where no one could laugh out loud or enjoy a frolic?"

"Yes, sir: that would suit me. It would be a paradise to live in a community where everyone was compelled to go to church every Sunday; where no one could drink a drop; where no one could swear; and where the law would make every man good. There the law would make every man's deportment absolutely correct."

"Then," said Mr. Ingersoll, "I advise you to go right to the penitentiary. At Sing Sing there is a community of 1,500 men and women governed in precisely that manner. There all are good by law."

There is many an infidel who to-day stands nearer the ideal taught by Christ than some of his professed followers. The same thing Jesus himself declared true in his time. "The publicans and harlots go into the kingdom of God before you." Matt. 21:31. This was addressed to those who made the loftiest profession ever made by men.

These modern would-be reformers who are so anxious to regulate the conduct of others had their prototypes in

the first century. Jesus addressed them, "Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye, and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the moty that is in thy brother's eye." Matt. 7:5.

Jesus Christ never used force and never approved of it, but always condemned it. If our friends who are trying to make men good by law would drink in a little more of the Spirit of the Master, it would lead them to labor more to convert the hearts of men, and not to be so strenuous about the outward conduct of sinners and those Christians who differ from them in some prominent points of doctrine.

When I consider how recent events in Canada and Tennessee and other places have revealed the disposition of professed Christians to inflict hardship and suffering on other professed Christians because they differ in the matter of Sabbath observance, I am almost dumb with amazement. Are not these Sabbatarian Christians men who live above reproach and endure many inconveniences to carry out those principles which are impressed on them as they read the sacred volume? Is it not as painful to them to see men work on the seventh day of the week as it is to others to see them work on the first day? Are not these men kind neighbors, honest in their dealings and faithful in all their duties as citizens?

Their only offending is the violation of Sunday statutes which have come to us from the Dark Ages. And these modern professors who put this law in operation have forgotten the Golden Rule if they ever know that almost amazing, of all of the thousands of religious papers in the world, only about one in a hundred raises its voice in protest against these unchristian proceedings.

If these things had transpired a century or two in the past, they would have been classified with the doings of Nero and the Spanish Inquisition. It seems almost useless to appeal to the sensibilities of men who are so blind to the blazing light of the Christ who even prayed for his enemies. But let the hearts of those who cry for religious freedom take courage. Outside of the ranks of professed Christians are those who, like the hemaritans of old, will gladly welcome the divine light of the King of kings, who is the King of peace. "The Gentiles shall come to thy light, and kings to the brightness of thy rising."
