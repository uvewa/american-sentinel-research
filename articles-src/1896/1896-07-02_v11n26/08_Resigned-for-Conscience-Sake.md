## RESIGNED FOR CONSCIENCE' SAKE.

[Cincinnati Commercial Tribune, June 18.]

MIDDLETOWN, O., June 17.—Rev. Lyman J. Fisher, a retired Baptist minister, has resigned from the Board of City School Examiners, giving as his reason that the duties of that office conflict with his conscience. He sent a paper to the Board saying that he had, after a life-long investigation of the Scriptures, concluded that Saturday is the Sabbath, and as most of the examinations fall on that day he can not, in keeping with his conscience, hold the position longer. He says:—

I will attempt no self-justification further than to say that my convictions of personal responsibility in the matter are the result of a life-long search of the Scriptures. For a longer period than I have held the position to which you called me, I have been persuaded that the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord. But it was first a disclosure mainly to my intellect. Meanwhile, the immenseness of the fact of Sabbath perversion dazed me, and left me with a feeling of helplessness to stem such a current. I still feel like a breaking, momentary bubble on the bosom of a resistless tide. But not wholly so, at least. An appeal breaks in from the skies. With tender directness it speaks to my conscience and heart. I feel my littleness snobled in the presence of a duty, which I am sure I can do for my King.

The resignation was unanimously accepted.
