"THE SHADOWS OF VICTORY."

The National Bureau of Reforms was incorporated on the 23rd of May, under the name of the Reform Bureau. In a circular issued under date of May 25, the secretary, Mr. Crafts, states that "the receipts for the last four weeks have been only $109.14, while the liabilities for the same time are $290."

The work of the Bureau for a single week is thus recounted by Mr. Crafts:—

The Shadows of Victory.

On May 25th, President Cleveland sent to the office of the Reform Bureau the pen with which he had just signed the F. H. Gillett divorce bill, in recognition that the Bureau had originated and promoted the bill, in cooperation with the Congressman named, who had ably done his part. Only a week previous, May 17, the Bureau, in cooperation with a movement originated by the Endeavors of Mt. Vernon, N. Y., had secured not only the sabbath closing of the post-office in that place, but also the implied adoption of the local option principle, originated by Hon. John Wanamaker, for all such cases, of which Endeavors and others in many towns should hasten to avail themselves. The Saturday preceding, the distinguished trustees of the Bureau named elsewhere, incorporated it: and the Monday following the Commissioners of the District of Columbia approved the sabbath, and for the Capital which the Bureau had introduced in Congress in cooperation with the Churchman's League. This is but a week of the Bureau's work.

Do our readers realize that a powerful ecclesiastical lobby is at work in our national capital, and that already our institutions have begun to bend under the weight of its influence?
