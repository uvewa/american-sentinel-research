DID SHE CORRECTLY REPRESENT CHRIST?

Miss Rebecca Fream is an east-side "missionary" in this city. The question, "Did she correctly represent Christ?" can be answered by each reader for himself in the light of the following facts from the Evening World, of the 12th inst:—

Miss Rebecca Fream was complainant in the Essex Market Court to day against Fannie Fager, a poor widow, who lives with her three young children at 23 Norfolk Street, and Philip Gordon, fifteen years old, of 56 Essex Street.

Miss Fream testified that the woman was selling notions from a wash basket in Hester Street yesterday afternoon. The woman said she was penniless, and to buy bread for her children she sold her wares on Sunday. She claimed that she was a Hebrew and did not peddle on Saturday. In German she begged Miss Fream not to prosecute her on account of her children, but to no purpose.

In procuring the arrest of the widow Miss Fream caused a small riot, and the crowd that collected threw stones and rotten fruit at her. The boy Gordon was arrested for striking her with a stone. Gordon admitted that he threw stones, but was uncertain whether he had struck her.

The crowd in the court room was anxious to see Miss Fream, who seemed proud of her work.

Magistrate Cornell fined the woman and the boy $5 each. With tears rolling down her face Mrs. Fager was led to prison, screaming to be allowed to go to her children. The spectators sympathized with her and a subscription was raised and her fine was collected. She was then set at liberty. The boy will be sent to the Juvenile Asylum for five days.

Reference was made to this case last week in our columns, but at that time we did not have all the facts. Miss Fream's action does not appear any better in the additional light thrown upon it in the police court.
