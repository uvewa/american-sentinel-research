"APPLIED CHRISTIANITY."

One of the objects, or we might better say, the object of the Christian Citizenship League is to apply the principles of Christianity in civil affairs. One plank in its platform declares that "to make the will of God to be done on earth should be the chief aim of every follower of Him whose meat was to do the will of his Father." To express it in the briefest terms and in their own terminology, "applied Christianity" is the goal of "Christian Citizenship."

"Applied Christianity" is not Christianity applied by the individual to his own acts in all the walks of life, in the home, in society, in business, in the church, and in the State; but "applied Christianity" is the application of that which is called Christianity by means of civil law, not only to civil society, but to the conduct of the individual as well; that is, "applied Christianity" not only means that civil society shall be governed by so-called "Christian" principles crystallized into "law," but that civil society shall see to it that to the same extent the individual shall adopt and practice these principles under penalty of civil law.

For instance, it is not enough in the view of the advocates of applied Christianity that public business shall cease on Sunday, that civil society shall respect the day, but they insist that individuals shall likewise cease labor and suspend business, and refrain largely from the pursuit of the ordinary pleasures incident to holidays. Thus, "applied Christianity" extends not only to civil society but to the individuals that compose society.

The AMERICAN SENTINEL believes firmly in Christianity, and that its principles should be the principles of every individual in the world; and since in its last analysis all human action is individual action, this is only saying that all action in every sphere of life should be governed by Christian principles. But this is very far from saying that Christianity should be applied by the State either to society or to the individual.

Christianity is more than a system of ethics; it is more than a code of rules governing action; it is a living principle, a vital force, a divine life; it is not only God with us, but it is God in us, through Christ. Says the apostle: "I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live: yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God." This is true applied Christianity, and nothing else is.

To further develop this thought, let us adopt a simple illustration: Two men engage in business. One says, I shall be honest in all my dealings with my fellowmen though I suffer loss, for this is right; it is the will of God, and by his help I will put into daily practice the Golden Rule, doing unto all men as I would have them do to me. The other man has been taught honestly also, but from a different standpoint; he says: I am resolved to be honest in my dealings even though I may sometimes lose thereby, for "honesty is the best policy," and in the long run I shall be the gainer. I shall acquire a reputation that will be worth much to me in my business, and shall leave behind me a good name, etc.

Outwardly these men may be equally upright so far as the world can see. Practically, both men may be equally honest, but the one is acting from Christian principle; the other from the most sordid motives. The life of one is applied Christianity, the other an exhibition of the most subtle human selfishness.

The moral is that Christianity is a matter of the heart, and is worthy the name only as it springs from love to God and to his law. It can be applied only by the individual, and only to his own life; for only the individual can possess it; and every man shall give account of himself to God.

It must be perfectly evident to every one that the State cannot even judge what is Christian principle, for, as we have seen, Christian principle is in the motive and not in the act alone. As we have shown, the same act may in two individuals spring from an entirely different principle or motive. The State can deal only with acts, and for the State to decide that certain acts are Christian, or that a certain line of action is Christian regardless of the motive of it, would only be to deny the fundamental principles of Christianity. It would be to degrade Christianity to the level of a mere code of ethics, and to deny the spiritual power of Christianity.

The sphere of the State is not to decide between the claims of rival religions, or even to decide what are the principles of any religion, but to conserve the rights of all men. This it can do without trenching upon the rights of conscience and without being required to judge the motives of the heart. Of course in many purely civil matters the motive is inquired into in order to determine the degree of guilt, or whether indeed there is any guilt. For instance, homicide may be either justifiable or unjustifiable. It may be manslaughter in one or several degrees, or it may be murder in one of several degrees according to the motive. But this is a very different thing from saying beforehand that a certain line of conduct will be Christian, and that another certain line will be unchristian, regardless of the motive which prompts it.

As the State has only to do with acts in their relation to human rights, it has no occasion to inquire into the motive, farther than we have indicated. It has no occasion to pass upon the moral equality of acts, but only to determine that certain acts are civil and certain other acts are uncivil, and to require that all men shall refrain from doing those things which are uncivil, that is, to forbid acts which trench upon the equal rights of others.

It must be evident to all who have followed this line of thought carefully, that the State can know nothing of Christianity. It can know and take cognizance only of human rights; hence any effort to apply Christianity by civil law, either to the State or to the individual, is an effort to unite Church and State; an effort to subordinate the State to the Church; an evil scarcely second to the subordination of the Church to the State. Indeed the results in both instances are the same, namely, to degrade the Church to the moral level of the State, to place Christian morals upon the low plain of utilitarianism. It follows that "applied Christianity" can be nothing more nor less than applied paganism, because Christianity without the spiritual power that belongs to it ceases to be Christianity, and is only paganism.
