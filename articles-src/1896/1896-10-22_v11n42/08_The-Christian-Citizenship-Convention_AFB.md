### "THE CHRISTIAN CITIZENSHIP CONVENTION."

BY A. F. DALLENGER.

The 10th annual convention of the New Jersey Young People's Society of Christian Endeavor was held at Plainfield, October 7-9. Thursday evening, October 8, was devoted to "Good Citizenship." Governor John W. Griggs was advertised as one of the speakers, but he sent a letter stating that the political interests of the presidential campaign would prevent him from attending. Dr. Scudder, a Congregational minister of Jersey City, spoke in his place, followed by Rev. A. C. Dixon, of Brooklyn, a Baptist minister. These speakers were preceded by the report of the work of the department of "Christian Citizenship." This report stated that every county in the State had been permeated with "Christian citizenship" ideas, and that the influences of the organization had made themselves felt in a number of large cities in procuring certain reforms. It was declared that what was being done for the State of New Jersey was being done by the organization for every State and Territory in the Union where the Christian Endeavor movement had been organized.

Many of the statements made by the speakers were astounding. They boldly declared that the idea that the minister of the gospel should confine himself to preaching the simple gospel was an old fogy idea now out of date. It was declared that from this time on the pulpit was to be a potent factor in politics, and that the organization expected to unite the "Christian vote" and use it to bring politicians to terms. It was stated that the time would soon come when politicians would humble themselves in the dust before the preachers. It was said that as the pilgrims first landed on their knees and then on the aborigines, so to-day the preachers after landing on their knees would land on the political aborigines who refuse to carry out the wishes of the organization. It was stated that as God sent hornets among the Canaanites, so the preachers of to-day were to be hornets that would sting the representatives of evil and drive them from the land. It was declared that the man who was too pious to vote should be sent to the penitentiary. The sentiment was often repeated that the object of this "Good citizenship" movement was to fulfill the Lord's Prayer, and bring the kingdom of heaven to this earth. The enforcement of Sunday laws was one of the principal measures advocated to bring this about.

The writer has attended numerous National Reform conventions and has noticed the lack of enthusiasm and attendance at such meetings. He has wondered how it was that the rank and file of the popular churches was ever to be interested in this movement; but now it is all plain. Through this Christian Endeavor movement the leaven of National Reform is pervading all Christendom. The National Reform Association has succeeded in inoculating the Christian Endeavor Society with its virus, and the disease is spreading with marvellous rapidity. The leaders themselves declare that they are astonished at the rapidity with which this movement is going.

The International Religious Liberty Association placed upon the chairs of the convention 1,500 copies of the little tract, "How Shall We Reform Society," which is made up of quotations from prominent representatives of the several denominations, warning the people against this very movement. It is believed that the little message of warning will bear fruit in some honest hearts who listened to the convention addresses, contrary in tone and spirit to the principles of the gospel and the sentiments of church leaders in times past.

Never in the history of this Church and State movement was there such a need for vigilance, for earnest, energetic, prompt advocacy of the principles of liberty, as there is to-day. Never has there been so serious a menace of what there is left of the liberties of the American people, as is to be found in this Christian Citizenship movement within the Christian Endeavor Association. The movement is in the hands of earnest, and in many cases, conscientious young people, who are fired with youthful zeal and with the idea that their cause is just and the only method by which the wrongs of the present day can be righted and the kingdom of God set up in the earth. The reader will readily see that this vast company of young people, actuated with the idea that they are to be instrumental in setting up the kingdom of Christ on the earth and ushering in a reign of peace, will be terribly in earnest. Let the friends of religious liberty awaken to the needs of the hour and come up to "the help of the Lord against the mighty."
