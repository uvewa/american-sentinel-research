### NEWS AND NOTES.

It is asserted that the pope has been conducting negotiations with King Menefek, of Abyssinia, for the release of Italian prisoners held captive by him, and that in this he has been successful where the Italian government has failed. Thus the papacy has won a substantial victory in the eyes of the Italian people.

The political preachers continue to show their fidelity to the so-called American principle of the separation of Church and State by delivering stamp speeches in their pulpits for their favorite Presidential candidate. Are their congregations henceforth to be parson-ridden? Shall clerical influence be a factor in all future elections?—Catholic Review, October 17.

The Toledo (O.) Weekly Blade, of October 8, publishes an inquiry from a correspondent in West Virginia, in which it is stated that if Mr. McKinley favors Sunday laws, he will lose about 40,000 votes of Seventh-day Adventists. The Blade, in reply, states that the Republican nominee does not favor Sunday laws. Neither the Blade nor its correspondent touches the truth in the matter.

A dispatch from Lima, Peru, dated the 13th inst. stated that the Chamber of Deputies had that day rejected the proposition recently made by the Senate, to provide for the registration of non-Catholic marriages, thus making them legal. The proposition was the outcome of the agitation recently raised on the subject of marriage disabilities imposed on Protestants in Peru, Ecuador and Bolivia.

The last Sunday in October has been designated by the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church, and the General Conference of the Methodist Church, as a day to be devoted by church pastors and Sunday school teachers to the consideration of the obligation to "remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy," and to the imparting of special instruction with reference to the Lord's day. We trust these instructors will not on that occasion overlook the fourth commandment, nor that part of it which says, "the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God."

Archbishop Ireland, of St. Paul, Minn., has come forward as the first Roman Catholic of note to espouse publicly the cause of a political party in the present campaign. In a written statement of his views made at St. Paul, Minn., October 11, in response to invitations from a number of prominent business men of that State, the archbishop strongly denounced the Democratic platform, as being equivalent to a declaration of secession. The New York Herald, of October 16, states that "the Vatican, although favoring the candidacy of Mr. McKinley, does not approve of the recent letter of Archbishop Ireland supporting Mr. McKinley, because it mixes religion and politics, which the Vatican thinks would best be kept separate in the United States."
