### SUNDAY LAWS VS. LIBERTY.

RELIGIOUS liberty is guaranteed to every one within their jurisdiction by the fundamental laws of nearly all the States.

It follows that in those States, and upon this the highest legislative authority, Christianity itself is not a part of the law of the land.

The constitution of the State of Tennessee reads as follows: "That all men have a natural and indefeasible right to worship Almighty God according to the dictates of their own conscience. That no human authority can, in any case whatever, control or interfere with the rights of conscience; and that no preference shall ever be given by law to any religious establishment or mode of worship."

Hon. Don M. Dickinson says: "It is not true that in a Christian country any mere dogmas of one sect of Christians, though concurred in by all other sects of Christians, except one, can be set up as a legal rule of morality, decency and social order, binding on the dissenting sect, however small the dissenting minority."

In legislation upon the subject in most of the States care is taken to except from the operation of the Sunday laws those who conscientiously keep the seventh day of the week (Saturday) as a holy day.

Inasmuch as the adherents of all religions are political equals in this country and may vote and hold office, it is conceivable that in some States those citizens who believe that Saturday should be respected as a holy day, may be in the majority, and then enact legislation, valid under such reasoning as now sustains the Sunday laws, setting apart Saturday as the day of rest.

Would not all good Christians who observe Sunday in those States denounce such an enactment as decidedly oppressive?

This illustration should make luminous to all the application of the Golden Rule in the matter of the present Sunday legislation. There should be no laws upon the statute books which in their enforcement conflict with the religious convictions of any citizen within the sphere of civility, for the simple reason that such laws often become instruments of religious persecution. All Sunday statutes should be universally amended so that no man may be punished or harassed under them when conscientiously attempting to obey the divine command, "six days shalt thou labor," whether he keeps the first or the seventh day of the week.

Hon. Thomas M. Cooley, the great authority on constitutional law, said: "This is a country of religious liberty, not of religious toleration merely. Every person is entitled to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience under the obligations which rest upon all alike, that public order shall be respected, and the requirements of morality and decency observed. Whenever the law, either in terms or by method employed in its enforcement, goes beyond this, and undertakes to compel observances that are only required by particular creeds, no matter how numerous may be those who consider them divine obligations, it becomes tyrannical and destructive of the fundamental principle of American liberty. It is also tyrannical when it punishes, as a public offense, the management of a citizen's private affairs, in such a manner as his own conscience approves, taking care in doing so neither to wrong nor disturb those of his fellow-citizens who differ with him in their views. If in their opinion the course he pursues must be displeasing to the Ruler of the world, the question involved belongs not to human tribunals, and it is the purpose of our constitutional system that human laws administered by imperfect human instruments shall not assume to deal with it. This is commonplace in the United States of America, but it cannot be too often repeated or too distinctly borne in mind."—Allen Moon, President of the International Religious Liberty Association, in Independent Banner, Murfreesboro, Tenn., October 2.
