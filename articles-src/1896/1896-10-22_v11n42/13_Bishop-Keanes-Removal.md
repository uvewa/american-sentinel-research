### BISHOP KEANE'S REMOVAL.

[N. Y. Independent, October 15, 1896.]

It is of no use for us to pretend that we know why the Pope has removed Bishop Keane so suddenly from the rectorship of the Catholic University. We do not know, and those that do know, if there are such, keep absolute silence. Of course there are surmises enough, which may or may not be correct. Everybody knows that Bishop Keane is an adherent of the more liberal Catholic policy of which Archbishop Ireland is the leader, and Cardinal Gibbons is said to be, and perhaps is, a rather quiet adherent. But Archbishop Ireland has not been in Rome lately, and Archbishop Corrigan's lawyer representative has been there a year, and Dr. Schroeder, the conservative professor in the University has been there: and it looks as if the liberal policy and its leaders were now out of favor at the Vatican, even as they were unable to hold the control of Satolli's policy; so that this is the explanation of Bishop Keane's removal which first strikes every one. The order removing him says it is in accordance with a permanent policy which does not allow anyone to remain permanently in charge of an institution of learning; yet no one seems to believe that this is the full statement of the case. Archbishop Ireland was hot in his first utterance on the subject, perhaps imprudent; for we hardly think he can control the selection of Bishop Keane's successor. But the Archbishop who has been so bitterly attacked, especially by the Germans, for his policy in public schools, has been strengthening his own position by his advance step, making his parochial schools all free, by which act he has proved himself a better friend of the parochial schools than any one of his enemies.
