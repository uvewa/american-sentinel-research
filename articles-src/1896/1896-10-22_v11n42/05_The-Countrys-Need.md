# THE COUNTRY'S NEED.

NEITHER open mills nor open mints will do so much to abolish poverty and bring prosperity as closed saloons. No power of legislation and no power obtained by labor combinations can help the laboring man who spends his money for drink. The men who talk of reform without pointing to the saloon as the first cause of poverty and the hard times simply talk in the air. It is not our industrial system, nor the industrial conditions surrounding the workmen, that is at the bottom of the misery—it is drink. So say Carroll D. Wright, John Burns, Chief Arthur and Mr. Powderly.

The money which the wage earners of this country have thrown away in the past ten years would have provided each family in the land with a home free of rent. If invested in railroad stocks and bonds during the past ten years it would have transferred the ownership of all our railroads to the laboring classes. Drink is the chief cause of the poor man's bad luck. Put the money which the laboring men of America spend for drink in the treasury of the United States and all forms of taxes might immediately be abolished, all public improvements be doubled, with work enough to give every man in the country employment.

Ten dollars spent for whiskey and beer will bring only 96 cents to the farmer for his grain and 38 cents to the men who manufacture them—total, $1.34; while the man who spends $10 for clothes, furniture or food pays about $5.25 to the farmer and the workman. Every time the poor man spends a nickel for bread, instead of for beer, 35 per cent. of his nickel goes to the farmer for grain and 33 per cent. to the baker and to the miller in wages; in all 68 per cent. Of the nickel spent for beer only one-sixth benefits the farmer and workman.

You cannot spend your money on bread and beer also. Our trouble is not so much overproduction as underconsumption. Let our workmen spend their money for shoes, clothes, furniture and food, which they now spend for drink, and more goods of all kinds would be demanded, more would be manufactured, every man would be at work at high wages and everybody would be happy.—Rev. Madison C. Peters.
