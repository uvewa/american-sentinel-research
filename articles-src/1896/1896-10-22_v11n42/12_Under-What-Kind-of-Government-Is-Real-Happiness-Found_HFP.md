# UNDER WHAT KIND OF GOVERNMENT IS REAL HAPPINESS FOUND?

BY H. F. PHELPS.

TRUE it is that the Word of God says: "The powers that be are ordained of God." From this it is argued, and with reason too, that civil government—the genius of civil government, not the particular form of government—is ordained of God. But civil government did not exist previous to the fall of man. It became a necessity because of the supreme selfishness of man; which selfishness leads him to invade the rights of others. For it is a recognized fact that men are by nature endowed "with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed."

But among all the different forms of government under heaven there is not one in which true happiness can be found. While the pursuit of happiness is one of the inalienable, natural rights of mankind to guarantee which governments are instituted, yet it is not in the power of man to devise a civil government under which perfect happiness can be found. All this because of man's selfish nature. Man must first be made a new creature. His very nature must be changed from a natural to a spiritual. This perfect and completed change can only be brought about under a true theocratical government.

Such is the government of God. And such was the government of God in the beginning in this world. God is a spiritual being, and a true theocracy being a government of God, must of necessity be a spiritual government, a government of love, ruling through the higher faculties of his creatures. All those who are subjects of a true theocracy must be spiritual beings, enabled to discern spiritual truths, able to comprehend the principles of a spiritual government. Such are the inhabitants of other worlds; and such would have been the condition of Adam and all his posterity had it not been for sin. Indeed, such will be the condition of this world when God's purpose concerning it is accomplished.

Then, inasmuch as man, by nature, by creation, possesses the right to seek for happiness, and perfect happiness at that, why should not the Christian seek to build up a theocracy in this life, both for himself and all others? Because a spiritual government must be instituted by a spiritual being, one who is perfect in all his ways and works. Man is not such a being, and never will be till Christ comes again to set up his kingdom, which will be a true theocratical government in every sense of the word.

Under a false idea of what such a government should be, men have made the attempt to establish a theocracy in this life, and in the attempt have made a most terrible failure. And this they always will do, for in their present imperfect condition of mind and body, it is an utter impossibility for them to comprehend what such a government should be that perfect happiness may come to all its subjects. This being the case, should the attempt again be made—and that is just what is now being attempted by the so called Christian world—nothing but misery and ruin, and utter defeat will come to those who attempt such a thing.

From the foregoing, it becomes almost, if not quite, a self-evident proposition, that of all intelligent beings in the universe, not one except God the Father and Jesus Christ occupies a position where he can institute a true theocracy. No others understand so fully the proper relations that exist between ruler and the governed, and the exact laws that grow out of these relations; nor yet the necessity of perfect obedience upon the part of subjects of a theocracy to those very laws. And more than this; none but spiritual beings, those who have been enlightened by the Holy Spirit, can understand those laws, and that for the very reason that these laws are spiritual, and spiritual things are spiritually discerned. God is a Spirit—a spiritual being—his government is spiritual, and the laws that are the foundation of that government are spiritual also, and grow out of the relations that exist between spiritual intelligences.

Let me illustrate: There was a time in the eternity of the past when there were no created beings; consequently no relations existed. But just as soon as there was one created being, at that point, in the very nature of the case, there existed the relations between Creator and creature. Out of this relation came, in the very nature of the case again, "the first and great commandment," "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy mind, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength." Thus supreme love to the Creator, the giver of all things enjoyed or to be enjoyed by the creature, grew out of this relation.

Following this, just as soon as there was another created being, just so soon there existed the relation between created beings; and because of this relation, in the very nature of the case, there existed at once, without any legislation or formal announcement of the same, the second commandment: "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself."

As before stated, none but spiritual beings can understand these relations, and those great commandments which grow out of these relations. Hence the utter folly of the claim that "a theocracy is yet to come; the kingdom of Christ must enter the realm of law through the gateway of politics." Men of former generations were dazed with the idea of a theocracy,—not so much for the good of themselves, but for the good, as they thought, of others,—but that theocracy was a man-made theocracy, and the enforcement of church dogmas, and decrees of councils, all of which were considered as emanating from the laws of God; and all this was persecution of the other man, the weaker party.

Now the men, and the women, too, of this generation declare that "a theocracy is yet to come," and they are working to this end; but when made it will be only man-made—a false theocracy. And that which is sure to follow will be enforcement of human interpretation of God's divine spiritual law. This will be persecution again of the weaker party.

In this place let us consider another point. The Creator who understands best the form of government in which true happiness can be found, instituted a theocracy in the very beginning, yet left every intelligent being in the enjoyment of the utmost freedom of choice, as to whether to be a subject of that theocracy or not; for He delights not in slavery. "Where the Spirit of the Lord is there is liberty." A true theocracy depends—not upon force or compulsion by civil law, or by any other power in heaven above or in the earth beneath, but upon the voluntary submission and the willing choice and consent of the governed. Anything short of this upon the part of the governed would be rebellion or sin. And this is just where Adam and Eve failed. They did not make choice, or consent to the divine Governor and his laws. And this has ever been the failure of the race. But all through the ages there have been individuals who have consented to this form of government and found happiness in believing in God, and in obeying him.

There is just one thing, therefore, that our theocratical friends may do—just one thing that they should do, and all others as well; and if they will only do this they will do the correct thing. Inasmuch as none but God can understand just how these laws should be obeyed; and inasmuch as man cannot and does not either understand or obey, and therefore stands in need of a touch of the recreative power of the Holy Spirit; and as none but the Creator has that power to bestow through his Spirit, men can, one and all, submit to the influences of that Spirit, yield to the moulding, recreative power of God, and thus be made new creatures in Christ Jesus. If all will do this there will never be a desire to compel—no thought of coercion—and consequently no persecution. Persecution by any people is an utter impossibility when they are in submission to the will of God. It is in submission to God, a voluntary choice of the individual, that all may become subjects of the spiritual kingdom of Christ, and subjects of that theocracy which will be set up when "He comes whose right it is" to rule. But it must be by voluntary consent of the governed. "And the Spirit and the bride say, come." "And whosoever will, let him come." Now is the time. Soon it will be too late.
