A FALSE PRINCIPLE.

A cardinal principle upon which the papal system of religion rests, is that the Scriptures ought not to be placed in the hands of the common people, because the latter would not know how to interpret them correctly.

Acting upon this principle, pope Pius IX. anathematized the "Bible societies" for their work in promoting the circulation of the Scriptures, and the papal church refuses for communicants the privilege of knowing the Scriptures, except as interpreted and explained by the church "fathers," and by the decisions of councils and popes.

But the Creator has not made one man dependent upon some other mortal like himself for a knowledge of the truth which is essential to salvation. The natural mind sees with the natural understanding, and it is from the latter that this papal doctrine proceeds. Spiritual truth is but foolishness to the natural mind; it cannot be grasped as can those truths which pertain to natural things. The Jews made foolishness of Christ's statement that it was necessary to eat his flesh and drink his blood in order to obtain salvation, applying it to his natural body and blood. Nicodemus did likewise with the Saviour's assertion that a man must be born again in order to enter the kingdom of heaven. The natural mind can grasp only natural truths. That the natural mind may by cultivation acquire great abilities, does not change its inability in this respect.

Had the Saviour chosen as his apostles men of great learning or of exceptionally brilliant intellect, he might by this have given some ground of justification to the idea that only those thus qualified were prepared to be the repositories of his word. But he chose instead the unlearned fishermen of Galilee. When Peter and John were brought before the rulers and elders of the Jews at Jerusalem, the latter "perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men." Yet "they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus." Their ignorance was not ignorance of that truth which is necessary to salvation. Though they knew not the wisdom of this world, they were not lacking in that wisdom that "cometh down from above."

God can do for every "unlearned and ignorant" man what he did for Peter and John. Indeed, it is necessary to set aside all dependence upon human wisdom, if we would receive the knowledge that comes through the revelation of God. These truths are hidden from the wise and prudent, and revealed unto babes. It is as little children that we must receive the kingdom of God.

"If any of you lack wisdom,"—the wisdom of an understanding of God's word—"let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally and upbraideth not, and it shall be given him." The whole testimony of Scripture is opposed to the papal doctrine that we must seek for spiritual wisdom to pope, council, priest or pastor. The word of God is his revelation to man, but it is a revelation to the spiritual, and not the natural, mind. Nor can the spiritual mind explain it to the natural understanding. The seeker for spiritual wisdom must first acquire the spiritual mind, which cannot be furnished by pope or pastor, but by God alone. The truths of the Word can be revealed only by the divine Spirit. They cannot be revealed by man to man.

The doctrine therefore that the common people are dependent upon the wisdom of the "fathers," or of any other men in the church, for guidance in the pathway of spiritual truth, is directly contrary to the Scriptures. It not only provides the individual with no spiritual wisdom, but shuts the door to the way by which he might attain it. For if ignorant himself, he can become wise by seeking God for wisdom through the illumination of the Spirit upon God's word; but he cannot possibly attain this wisdom by seeking to any man. It is therefore to every person both an inalienable right and a Christian duty that he should read and understand the Word of God for himself, and should not be bound in belief or practice by the opinions and interpretations of any other person or persons whatsoever.
