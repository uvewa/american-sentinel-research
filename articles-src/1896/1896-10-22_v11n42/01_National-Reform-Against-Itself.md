## "NATIONAL REFORM" AGAINST ITSELF.

The official organ of "national reform" in the United States, the Christian Statesman, publishes in its issue of October 3, 1896, a forcible exposition of Romanism, as "logically an intolerant and persecuting system." In doing this it seems not to be aware that it publishes a condemnation of the very system for which it stands, and which it is endeavoring by every means at its command to elevate to a position of predominance in the policy of State and national government.

For nothing is more certain than that "national reform" is in principle identical with the papal system, though advocated by men who are hostile to that system as represented by the papal church.

It matters not that the system goes by another name among its advocates outside of that church. A difference of name counts for nothing when the results produced are the same. The victim of religious persecution finds no mitigation of suffering in the fact that his persecutors are known as Protestants and not as papists, or that the system invoked against him takes the name "national reform" in professed distinction from Romanism.

The papacy is a system which puts man in the place of God. Any system which does this is identical with the papacy, no matter by what name it may be known.

The Roman Catholic papacy puts the bishop of Rome—the pope—in the place of God. The American "national reform" papacy aims to put certain "Protestant" church leaders in the place of God. In either case man is elevated to the place of deity, "so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God," the church.

The pope of Rome speaks to men his own words, commanding all to obey his decisions made, "ex cathedra," as being of divine authority. The "national reform" papacy would bind all men not by its own words spoken "ex-cathedra," but by its interpretation of God's words. Obedience thus demanded is not one whit less obedience to a man in the place of God, than is that which Catholics give to the pope.

The pope of Rome admits that the fourth commandment enjoins the observance of the seventh day of the week as the Sabbath, but affirms that "the church" has by divine right changed the Sabbath to the first day, so that the latter is now binding upon men as the weekly day of rest. The "national reform" composite "Protestant" pope declares that men are bound by the fourth commandment in the matter of Sabbath observance, but interprets that commandment as applying to the first day of the week instead of the seventh.

National Reformers do not claim infallibility for their own independent word, but only for their interpretations of God's word! But a claim to infallibility in the interpretation of the divine word is as truly popery as is the papal claim of infallibility for utterances made "ex-cathedra." It is even a greater claim, if possible, than the latter, since the Pope of Rome does not claim infallibility in ordinary discourse concerning Scripture teaching, but only for those occasions when he speaks from the "chair of Peter" expounding a question "of faith and morals" for the guidance of the church.

The only infallible interpreter of the divine Word is the Holy Spirit, declared by the Saviour to be the guide "into all truth." No person therefore can come into the possession of any spiritual truth, except by the Spirit's guidance. And hence to claim infallibility as an interpreter of spiritual truth is as truly an assumption of a divine prerogative as is any claim which presumptuous man has ever made.

Spiritual truths must be spiritually discerned. It is only in this sense and for this reason that the Word of God needs interpretation, and not, as many seem to think, because its Author has purposely made his thoughts obscure.

It is the inalienable right of every individual to read and believe the Word of God for himself, and to act upon that belief, independently of every other individual on earth. And from the Christian standpoint, it is the duty of every individual to believe for himself the words spoken by inspiration, since each person must have faith for himself, and can have it for himself alone. In this he must, of course, seek the guidance of the Holy Spirit, remembering that spiritual truths, however plainly stated, are but foolishness to the natural or carnal mind.

The National Reform party and the vast host of "Christian Endeavor" and "Christian Citizenship" unions who have espoused the principles of that party, are seeking to establish the compulsory observance of Sunday as the Christian sabbath. They are to demand legislation to this end from Congress and the State legislatures. Thus they will seek to enforce upon all their interpretation of the command of God. And as the interpretation and enforcement of religious truth and obligation belong to God alone, they will put man in the place of God if their effort succeeds. And as before stated, any system which puts man in the place of God is the papacy, no matter what other name may be given it.

This effort will result in the persecution of those who refuse to be governed in moral conduct by this human interpretation of the divine will, just as there was persecution in former times to those who refused to be governed in moral conduct by the fiat of papal prelates. Persecution is the logical and inevitable result of the system which puts man in the place of God, and it matters not a particle to the victims of that system whether the man or body of men thus wickedly exalted take the name "Protestant" or Roman Catholic. The pains and penalties of the "law" which will be invoked against dissenters will be exactly the same in either case.

Well does the Statesman say of the papal system: "A system that exalts man into the place of God's law; that makes a sinful man lord of the conscience; that takes upon itself in its assumed authority to change laws of God's appointment, and lower for itself and others the standard of morality, may be expected, by every means on which it can lay hold, to force conformity to its own decisions, and to sacrifice on the idol altar of its unholy and blasphemous ambition the civil and religious liberties of our race." This, then, is just what may be expected of the system which aims to compel men by law to observe the first day of the week as the Christian sabbath. 8.
