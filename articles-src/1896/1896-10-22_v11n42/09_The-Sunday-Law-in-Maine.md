### THE SUNDAY "LAW" IN MAINE.

[From the Portland Post, October 6.]

MAX GINSBERG was arraigned before Judge Robinson in the Municipal Court yesterday, charged with keeping open shop on the Lord's day. He pleaded not guilty. City Solicitor Chapman appeared as his counsel.

Mr. Chapman read from the Declaration of Rights in the constitution of Maine to support his position, showing that all men have a right to worship God according to their conscience, and that the Jewish Sabbath is Saturday.

Officer Frank testified that he went to this place and found Ginsberg fitting out a peddler. The door was closed and the curtains were drawn. He didn't see any clothes or goods sold or delivered. The officer neither saw nor heard any disturbance about the premises. He testified that he saw seven or eight people in there, one of whom he recognized as being Mattson, a peddler. As near as he could remember, the people in the store were all Hebrews.

Officer Morse corroborated Officer Frank's story, except the part about the curtains, a matter he did not remember.

Mr. Chapman in his defense cited cases of farmers performing their labors on Sunday, and claimed that his storekeeper, a wholesaler, so long as he honestly observed his Sabbath, had a right to do business upon the day that we call the Sabbath, provided that he did not disturb the peace of the public, and the only evidence to show that there was any disturbance to the peace of mind of the good people on India Street on a Sunday was the fact that the window curtains of his store were down and the saloon-keepers down the street were ready for business.

Judge Robinson said that he saw no reason why he should change his decision made a week or so ago on a similar case, and fined the respondent $5 and costs. An appeal was entered and bonds furnished, and the case will be fought.
