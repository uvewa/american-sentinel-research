# A MENACE TO FREEDOM OF CONSCIENCE.

THERE is nothing more dangerous to religious liberty than the assumption by powerful organizations of a divine right to rule their fellowmen. It is for this reason that the Young People's Society of Christian Endeavor and kindred organizations are a most serious menace to freedom of conscience in this country. They assume to be the divinely authorized interpreters of God's law; and they aspire to be its administrators. They would use the civil power to enforce moral duty; but such a use of civil power is illegitimate, and is to be opposed by all who are not prepared to surrender their soul-liberty.

The AMERICAN SENTINEL does not believe in anarchy. It is a patriotic and religious duty to yield cheerful obedience to civil rulers in civil things. By the very act of making men social beings, mutually dependent upon one another, and under mutual obligations each to respect the equal right of the other, God ordained civil government, that the weak might be protected against the aggressions of the strong, that unlawful greed and oppression might be restrained, and that civil order might be maintained. But the ordinance of civil government gives man no authority in spiritual things.

It is evident that inasmuch as civil government cannot by any possibility free any man from the obligations which God has laid upon him, and can abate nothing from the penalty of the divine law, it can rightfully exercise no authority whatever over any man touching his duty toward his Creator. Let government once invade the domain of conscience and it will surely dominate it, thus setting God aside and usurping his authority. Indeed, the mere assumption by any man or by any set of men of the right to dictate in matters of religious faith or practice is a denial of the moral sovereignty of the Creator.

Christians in all ages and of all creeds have claimed for themselves religious liberty; but sad to say, very many professing to be followers of Christ have not been willing that others should enjoy equal freedom; while some not Christians have clearly seen and fully recognized the principle that the moral sovereignty of the Creator renders absolutely essential the free moral agency of the creature. No man ever stated this principle more clearly than did the doist, Thomas Paine; and his clear vision on this subject ought to put to shame those who, while calling themselves Christians, are afraid to trust God with the administration of his own moral government. Paine said:—

There is a single idea which, if it strikes rightly upon the mind, either in a legal or a religious sense, will prevent any man, or any body of men, or any government, from going wrong on the subject of religion; which is, that before any human institutions of government were known in the world, there existed, if I may so express it, a compact between God and man, from the beginning of time; and that as the relation and condition which man in his individual person stands in toward his Maker cannot be changed by any human laws or human authority, that religious devotion, which is a part of this compact, cannot so much as be made a subject of human laws.

Paine was an unbeliever, and his name is cast out as evil because of his denial of the Christian religion; nevertheless he fully recognized the moral sovereignty of God. What then should be thought of those who, while claiming faith in Christianity, deny that sovereignty which Paine acknowledged, and which is the very basis of Christianity? Are they better than Paine? Are they not worse? for do they not by their intolerance so misrepresent Christianity as to turn men away from it and cause them to become infidels? Before the Christianity of Christ, even infidelity stands with uncovered head. It admires even though it does not embrace. But in the presence of the miscalled Christianity that would coerce all that it cannot convert, unbelief is hard and defiant. Whose is the responsibility? and whose the final retribution?

The worst infidelity is that which betrays our Lord in the house of his friends; that under the guise of friendship misrepresents his teachings, and in his name seizes power which he himself refused, and which he never authorized his followers to exercise in his behalf. Christ now, as of old, hides himself from those who, instead of crowning him sovereign in their own hearts, and introducing him to others as "the chiefest among ten thousand, the one altogether lovely," seek to take him by force and make him king, in order that by placing him on an earthly throne, they may compass their own aggrandizement.

Christ's word to his followers is, "Whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant." And the only commission or authority he has given is: "Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature." He plainly declared: "My kingdom is not of this world;" and yet in every age his professed followers have aspired to temporal power in his name, and professedly for the furtherance of his cause and the promulgation of the gospel! Is it any wonder that judging Christianity by such Christians, thousands have rejected it as no better than Mohammedanism, which was also promulgated by fire and sword?
