# "LIBERTY."

BY P. M. HOWE.

[Written in Chatham Jail, Kent County, Ontario, where Mr. Howe was imprisoned for ohe'rence to his faith, namely, for working on Sunday as he felt it to be his duty to do. Of this article he says: "I wrote this in jail. My desk was a short bench, and my seat the stone floor. I had no knife, so had to sharpen my pencil with my teeth; so it is not very well written."]

One can hardly appreciate the word "liberty" until he is shut away from the open expanse of nature, where the sun shines so beautifully, filling the earth with light and gladness; where the birds sing their joyous songs, and all Nature seems to ascribe praise to the Creator.

Most people nowadays seem to have gotten a false idea of what constitutes real, true liberty. "Let every thing that hath breath praise the Lord." This is liberty. God does not bind this privilege about, nor in any way limit anyone's capacity to praise him. Praise to God coming from his own created intelligences, unfettered and untrammeled, is true worship.

Let us consider this thought as applying to the highest type of creation—man. God created him perfect, complete in his own image, and gave him all things. No privileges were denied him. His freedom to choose and act for himself was unlimited. He could partake of the forbidden fruit, and sin, or reject it and remain righteous. God's ideal was, a man left free to choose whom he would worship. God's mind has not changed, for with him there is not even a shadow of turning. Satan's ideal was entirely different. By his plan some one must be put down; some one, yes, every one, must be subject to his satanic rule. God's idea was the rule of love. It was thus that he ruled in heaven. But Satan reasoned that God was restricting his liberty. At this juncture self became a god, and Locifec, the covering cherub, "son of the morning," was no longer loyal to God. He was no longer a worshiper of his loving Creator and Father, but a worshiper of self.

Man, so perfect and free in the new world, was seduced into believing Satan. He forgot how independent God had made him, and soon had no greater ambition than to worship self. The perfect law of liberty was lost sight of, and satanic ideas took the place of true ideas of liberty; love and reason were banished. Selfishness was as complete in man as in Satan, and self, Satan's ideal god, was enshrined as the only being to be considered and worthy to be worshiped. Man had made the choice and was lost. He had become a bond-servant to self, with no power in himself ever to be free. He could worship no other being; for no one but self could be seen.

But, miracle of grace! God loved him still. The light that shone out of darkness through the interposition of a righteous Redeemer was permitted to shine into man's heart. God had an eternal purpose in the creation of man, and that purpose was to be accomplished.

God has never restricted man's freedom to choose. He has forever left him free to worship, or not, all these six thousand years. Through the merits of Christ Jesus our Lord he has ever been calling: "Come unto me and find rest." "Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts, and let him return unto the Lord." "Whosoever will, let him come." No force but love has ever been applied. Man has been left free as in the beginning, when, with perfect liberty to choose for himself how and whom he would worship, he fully met the mind of his all-wise Creator.

In bringing man back from the slavery of sin to his original estate God still leaves him the freedom of choice. This liberty which has been so freely offered in Christ Jesus and made known to us by the gospel, is as dear as life itself. In the perversion of this divine plan Satan has endeavored to get all Christian people to suppose that any deviation from their ideas of religious worship is a menace to their rights and liberty. As religious bodies become powerful, their tendency as they contemplate the future is to see only self. All look for a universal church, and pride says, "we are that people." But a little company are found who are willing to believe God's plan the best—to leave all free to worship him or not—and grant their brethren and neighbors the same right. A few only are willing to work in God's way—by love—to turn the sinner from the errors of his ways.

To enforce religious ideas and crush out free choice that might may rule, is the plan which is now favored. The cross, which is the power of God, is no longer lifted up. Christ the crucified one, is forgotten, and only man's power, the "law of the land," is invoked. Satan's diabolical scheme is to be put in operation. Long dreary days and nights of waiting and watching in cold, damp prison cells will be the experience of not a few. The State will be held up as the only source of power. A fallen church will exalt man's dreams and laws above the perfect law of liberty. That law that is declared to be "perfect, converting the soul," will be less and less reverenced and obeyed, and but very few, a remnant of Israel, will stand boldly proclaiming the naked word as the perfect guide to heaven.

The only question in this time of trouble and confusion should be, What does God say? Hear the answer, as I read it printed on the top of my jail desk, "Fear God and keep his commandments, for this is the whole duty of man." Religious liberty is not lost when we are deprived of civil liberty. Christ had it on the cross; Paul praised God and was free in the dungeon and the stocks; the loved and loving John knew its blessedness on the lone isle of Patmos; Huss and Jerome, Luther, Latimer and Ridley, John Knox, and the faithful John Wesley, all acknowledged the precious boon of liberty, and within a few short months and years many who follow on to know the Lord can testify even from chain-gangs and prison cells that perfect liberty is found only in Jesus; and though the law of the land be against us, he is for us and with us. This is the mystery that soon will be finished. "Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made you free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage."
