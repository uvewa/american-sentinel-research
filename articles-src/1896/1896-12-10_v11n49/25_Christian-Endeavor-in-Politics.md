For illustrations of the familiar phrase, "a distinction without a difference," Christian Endeavor literature treating on the attitude of that religious body toward politics, offers a fruitful field for search. Here is an illustration from the Christian Endeavorer, for December, 1896:—

It [Christian Citizenship] does not mean that the society or church as such is "going into politics," but it does distinctly mean that every Christian shall demand with all his righteous might that Christ shall rule the caucus and the common council as he does the Church.

How much more than this could the Endeavor society or the Church, as such, effect by "going into politics"? Or in what other way would they seek to manipulate politics to gain their ends?
