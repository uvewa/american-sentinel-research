Some time ago when the Times asserted, in response to a correspondent's inquiry, that this is not a Christian government, it expected that the assertion would be accepted as a statement of unquestionable fact. Much to its surprise, there was considerable resentment expressed by several persons who can write very good English, at what they conceived to be a slur both on the government and on the Christian religion. Of course, it is not necessary to say that nothing of the kind was intended.

But if this was God's government, as some who are trying to be religious seem to think, who would be His authorized mouthpiece with authority to declare his infallible will? That is always the question when any element in the community declares that the rest must be governed by the will of God. And it will be generally found that every theocrat regards himself as in some way specially commissioned to speak for the Almighty, and so have his own way with those who have not been favored as he thinks he has been.

The question of who is to be the special representative of the Divinity in the control of the sword and shackles of the State is as old as the desire to oppress. It has existed since the beginning of history, and has caused more bloodshed than all other questions combined.

In this country the attempt was made to give the same answer to it that the Christian religion gives. In the spirit of the Christian religion the American people, at the start, assumed full responsibility for all blunders and crimes of government committed or to be committed during its existence. They denied God's responsibility for the ignorance and viciousness that prevent government from being the safeguard of complete liberty. They denied that any man or any number of men could, of right, proclaim the law of God to bind the rest. They denied that any king or oligarchy, or any majority, exercised a divine right to govern any person, or to bring about the subjection of any person. They laid the foundations of this Government in the spirit of the German hymn of freedom, which declares that:

"The God who made earth's iron hoard Scorned to create a slave!"

The maxim that "the voice of the people is the voice of God," did not obtain with the people who made the constitutions of the States and the United States. They vested limited power in a majority, not because they believed, or even hoped, that it would be right in everything, or in most things, but because they believed in the least oppressive method of government—the least evil where the choice was among evils.

In the Declaration of Rights on which all American constitutions are based, it is carefully set forth that the powers of the government are derived from the people—not from God, as was held by the Puritans of New England and as still held by the Mormons. Not until this declaration was made a matter of lasting record was the way cleared for progress; for under the theory of government by divine right the worst abuses were most apt to be specially defended as the ordinances of divine infallibility.

This is not God's government, but a government of the people. The people, and not God, are responsible for every wrong that is done by law; for every abuse that is perpetuated by precedent; for every crime that is permitted by power against weakness. God does none of these things as they are done by human governments, and it is sacrilegious to charge him with them.
