The Woman's Christian Temperance Union have united with the California State "Sabbath Association" in presenting to the State legislature the following petition:—

We, the undersigned, residents of California, respectfully ask your honorable body to enact a sabbath law that will prohibit all amusements inconsistent with the proper observance of the day, and that at the same time will secure the necessary weekly rest to all classes of weary toilers.

Notice that no attempt is made to disguise the character of what is asked in this petition. It is a "sabbath law." The petition is to be circulated for signatures in all parts of the State.
