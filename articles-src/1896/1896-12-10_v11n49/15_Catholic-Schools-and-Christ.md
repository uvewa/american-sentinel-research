The Roman Catholic doctrine that the public schools ought to be a medium for the inculcation of religion, is based by Catholics upon the ground that without this the schools are "Christless." "Everywhere," says the Catholic Review, of November 28, "the Catholic Church opposes the exile of Christ from public schools." But would Christ be exiled from the public schools by excluding from them the teaching of the Roman Catholic religion? What Protestant will maintain that He would? And yet this Roman Catholic claim rests upon exactly the same "logic" as that which underlies the idea that the national Constitution is a "Godless" document because it does not recognize any national deity.
