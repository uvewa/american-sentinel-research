The convention was well represented from all parts of the United States, and also from the Old World. Miss Agnes Slack, from England, World's Secretary of the W. C. T. U., seemed to be the leading spirit from abroad. She spoke in highest praise of Miss Willard. She believed that Miss Willard had done more to unite "the two great nations than any statesman."

From the beginning to the close of the convention it was plainly stated many times that their success in reforms was by the ballot. The Rev. Anna Shaw stated that the women were through weeping and would now demand.

"Christian Citizenship" seemed to be the theme that most animated them. The husband of the Indiana W. C. T. U. president, in his speech, referred to the Episcopal letter sent to all the Methodist ministers by bishops of that denomination, instructing the ministry that "the State is as divine an institution as the church;" and that "a minister is as much in place in politics as he is in the church."

Anna F. Beiler, National Superintendent of the "Christian Citizenship" department of the W. C. T. U., made many sweeping statements concerning this line of work. "Christian Citizenship" is what we want. It means individual purity, righteousness, supreme loyalty to Christ, carried into public life. It means Christ in each citizen, in the primary or in the convention, at the polls and in all offices, legislative, executive, and judicial."

Some of the principles at the foundation of this movement were stated to be (1) "That Jesus Christ is the Saviour and Lord of the State as well as of the individual. . . (2) That the principles of His divine government must be incorporated in the State and made effective in public affairs. 'It is the duty of the government to make it easy to do right and hard to do wrong." (3) "That the followers of Christ must unite to secure these high ideals."

She urged that each State, county and local organization create a "Christian Citizenship" department, or cooperate with such leagues and organizations and push the work until the forces that make for righteousness shall be more than those that make for evil.

This department is to be brought to "bear upon the great evils of the day such as restricted or lax suffrage, the unfair or corrupt caucus, the nomination of unchristian candidates, the failure to execute laws, the violation of the Sabbath [Sunday] as a public rest day, and the various social laws that may exist around us." "The spirit of this department stands unflinchingly for political as well as individual righteousness."

Miss Willard said that "St. Louis is the city in which the W. C. T. U. demanded, for the first time, 'gospel politics.'" "The meeting was in 1884, in the United Presbyterian church, which was opened to the W. C. T. U. when most other churches did not open." Again she said, "I claim that this great movement of 'Christian Citizenship' had its birth in the little Presbyterian church in St. Louis in 1884."

Some features of the convention were good; but in the main the effort was toward securing religion by law.
