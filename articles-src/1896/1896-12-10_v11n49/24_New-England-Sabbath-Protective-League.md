A meeting of the "New England Sabbath Protective League" was held in Grace Church, Providence, R. I., November 23. Martin D. Kneeland, secretary of the league, was present and addressed the meeting, and considerable time was also occupied by several local preachers. The meeting gave its attention principally to a consideration of Sunday desecration in Rhode Island, and especially in the city of Providence.

The Rev. Floyd Tomkins, Jr., who is president of the Rhode Island branch of the league, spoke especially of the methods to be employed in putting a stop to Sunday desecration in Providence. His speech showed that he had caught the true spirit of "National Reform" work. "Get hold of our aldermen," he said, "and plague the lives out of them until we get what we want. . . . Go to the Commissioner of Public Works and worry him incessantly until the work of repairing the streets is stopped on the sabbath day." "Get hold of the Park Commissioners and labor with them until they are ready to lie down and die, and we may yet accomplish something with them." It is only a slight variation of the usual "hold-up" demand—"Your money or your life." The "Sabbath Protective" leaguers mean that legislators shall either yield or "lie down and die."
