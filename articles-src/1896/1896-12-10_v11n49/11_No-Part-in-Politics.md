How the church of Rome "never takes part in politics" is illustrated by an editorial in The Sun, of Nov. 17, 1896, on "The Expulsion of the Jesuits from Ecuador." It says that "President Alfaro has issued a decree for the expulsion of the Jesuits from the republic of Ecuador, which is one of the most Catholic countries of South America. Last year, when Alfaro took command of the revolution which he brought to success, he met with the determined opposition of the church. Not a few of the ecclesiastics took up arms against him, and a member of the hierarchy, Bishop Schumacher, held command of a military division which fought for his overthrow. Alfaro also made the charge that millions of dollars belonging to the funds of the religious orders were used against him. 'My campaign,' he said in a manifesto, 'is a most difficult one, because of the enemy's hypocritical pretense that they are fighting for religion.'

"As soon as the revolutionary leader gained success in the war which opened last year and ended in the early part of this year, he began to enforce measures of revenge. His threats were so alarming that a large number of priests fled from Ecuador and took refuge in Peru and Colombia, and they were followed by the inmates of several convents, some of whom came to this country. He also began to confiscate the lands and other property of the church, which, as he said, had been dishonorably employed against the revolution.

"All this time he exercised power merely as a revolutionary chief, and without any authority derived from the constitution or from popular suffrage. Last month, when a convention to frame a new constitution was held at Guayaquil, Alfaro, now in office as chief executive, at once manifested his antagonism to the church party. He induced the convention to adopt provisions for limiting the power of the church, for diverting portions of the church income, and for putting restraints upon the church's control of its property. He also secured the adoption of constitutional provisions concerning the religious orders that were regarded as inimical by the church. It is doubtless under the authority thus conferred upon him that he has issued the decree to expel the Jesuits from Ecuador.

"We presume that he has been stimulated to go to this extremity by the still existing hostility of the church to the successful revolution. Bands of his enemies who fled to Peru and Colombia have recently made their appearance on the frontier of Ecuador and have attempted to stir up the people to renew the war against him. 'Hereafter,' said Alfaro a short time ago when assured that the church would still defy the revolution, 'I shall be as severe as formerly I was magnanimous toward the people at enmity with my government.' Soon after the opening of the war he charged the Jesuits with engaging in intrigues against him; he has many times repeated the charge. He parodied the cry of Gambetta when he said: 'Jesuitism is the enemy.'

"The hostility between Alfaro and the church, so long as it lasts, will surely constitute a menace to his government. As we have already said, Ecuador is one of the most Catholic countries among all the Catholic countries of South America. Under the constitution which has just been reformed, that religion has prevailed there to the exclusion of every other, and the income of the Roman Catholic Church was derived from the government.

"It will be unsafe for General Alfaro to persist in his opposition to the power of the church for the sake of the revolution. He cannot disregard the danger of a counter-revolution."

And this is the way that that church "never takes part in politics."
