A correspondent of the N.Y. Sun, of Nov. 17, 1896, in the following pertinent paragraph, calls attention to a condition of things that must certainly arrest the serious consideration of all thoughtful persons:—

"In the face of the facts that Bibles by the million almost may be had for the asking, that is, the Word of God is easily obtained without money and without price, and that editions of the New Testament have long been published for a penny a copy in England, and nearly as cheap in this country, and immense sums of money are gathered by Bible societies, to be expended in disseminating the Scriptures printed in the English language and in almost every existing tongue, the language of the Bible is, apparently, more and more ignored by the people at large. While ministers of the gospel profess to preach Christ and him crucified, it is a fact too well known that utterances from the pulpits of the nation savor more of the things of this life than of the life that is to come. True, a text and a portion of Scripture are read and followed by long prayers and artistic singing, but one listens in vain for the glorious and comforting language found in the 'Sermon on the Mount,' preached by the man Jesus, who had not where to lay his head. Is it not a fact that the growing neglect and ignorance of the Bible among the people is an outgrowth of secular preaching that has taken the place of gospel preaching in the pulpits of all denominations of Christians?"
