One noteworthy result of the recent election in New York State, is the elimination of the Prohibition Party, their ticket having failed to poll the number of votes (10,000) requisite to entitle it to a place on the official ballot, under the laws of the State. The New York Sun points out that the Prohibition ticket will not be entitled to a place in the State campaign again until after 1898.
