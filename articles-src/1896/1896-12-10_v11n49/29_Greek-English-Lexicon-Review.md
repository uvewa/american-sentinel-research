There has been laid upon our table a copy of Green's Greek-English Lexicon to the New Testament, revised and enlarged, published by H. L. Hastings, 47 Cornhill, Boston, 1896. It is a neat little book of 216 pages, 3½x6½ inches in size and ⅔ of an inch thick, containing every word in the Greek New Testament, with reasonably full definitions, and with references to passages where the words are used. The preface says: "There are contained in the Greek New Testament about 5,594 words; but in the whole Greek literature the words are a great multitude, which perhaps no man has ever numbered. The student of the Scriptures is not anxious to master or explore this vast wealth of Greek literature; but his ambition is to know something of those 5,594 New Testament words in which the message of God's mercy is conveyed to fallen man. Hence he must pass by the bulk of Greek literature, and confine his investigations to those few Greek words which are used in the New Testament to convey to man the treasures of divine truth. . . . It is for the accommodation of such students, who know little of the Greek language, but who desire to 'Search the Scriptures,' and of others more scholarly who yet find it needful to refresh their memories as to the sense of Greek words, that this Lexicon is offered." It is printed in medium type that brings no strain on the eyes. Taken altogether it is the neatest and handiest book of the kind that we have ever seen. To those who would like such a book, certainly this is just such a book as they would like. And who that wishes really to study the Scriptures would not like to have such a book? Price 35 cents.
