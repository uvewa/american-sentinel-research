In the Union Signal, of Nov. 19, 1896, the Reform Bureau, of Washington, D. C., says that "at the Washington Endeavor convention, of 1896, which met at a time when the sabbath was more attacked and less defended than ever before," it was suggested by this bureau, "that all young people's societies should this year make the defense of the Lord's day a specialty, each society appointing a permanent Lord's day committee, as a part of its organization, which committees should endeavor, (1) to close post-offices by local option petitions to the postmaster-general, and on a larger scale by petitions to Congress; (2) to circulate pledges against Sunday cycling for pleasure; (3) to urge the patronage of daily papers having no Sunday editions, etc. This plan was officially approved, so far as Endeavors are concerned, by the Golden Rule. The postmaster-general, after conference and correspondence with the Reform Bureau, had previously closed the local post-office in Mount Vernon, N. Y., a city of seventeen thousand inhabitants, on petition of a majority of the adult receivers of mail—a petition originated by the Endeavors but supported by all the other young people's societies—by this act giving the public to understand that he would do so in other like cases, restoring the local option plan originated by Mr. Wanamaker.

"Subsequent to the convention the movement was taken up by the young people's societies of all kinds in all parts of the land, not in small towns only, but also in large cities, especially for suburban offices.

"The Woman's Christian Temperance Union, which was earlier in the crusade against Sunday mails, will welcome this reinforcement of young people and give it the benefit of its maturer thought and its staying qualities; and preachers' meetings will, of course, see that it has no lack of wise and brave leadership."

Has the Scripture said in vain, "The leaders of this people cause them to err, and they that are led of them are destroyed?"
