A NATIONAL REFORMER, writing Sunday-school notes for the Christian Statesman, lays down this proposition:—

Whenever altars and temples and religions multiply in a nation, national unity ceases, and national disintegration and decay set in. Civil governments are to preserve national unity not by compelling uniformity of faith, but by national recognition of one supreme God, of one divine ruler.

Should we admit that the first of the above statements is true, what follows? As surely as national disintegration and decay is a condition that every nation should dread, and prevent if possible, so surely must Spain, Russia, and other States having one faith very generally believed in and obeyed, be justified in doing all they can to prevent the entrance into their realms of other faiths than the one already established there. For what nation desires disintegration and decay? Upon that ground, even Turkey would be justified in refusing her consent that missionaries of other faiths than Islam shall enter the country.

The second statement contradicts itself. Civil government should not compel uniformity of faith, but should compel the recognition of one divine ruler! This may not be compelling uniformity of faith in a very narrow, sectarian sense; but in a broad sense it is. To compel the recognition of God is as surely compelling men as it is to compel a specified form of baptism.

Human beings have a very constant habit of thinking that nothing is arbitrary and unnecessary compulsion, unless it trenches upon their particular habit or doctrines. To make others believe, or at least nominally accept, what they believe, is perfectly proper, but for others to do the same by them is quite another thing.

But we have not yet fully considered the principle laid down in the first statement that while religions multiply, "national unity ceases, and national disintegration and decay set in." The United States of America is a living, national witness that the statement is incorrect. Here is a nation, one of whose fundamental principles of government is that religion shall be free, that all faiths might here multiply. And to prevent all friction and consequent disintegration as the result of religious friction, which surely has ruined many nations, the Church and the State, religion and the civil government, were separated, so that whether a man professes any religion or no religion at all, that would not prevent his cordial support and maintenance of the government. It was also the intention of the founders of this nation that it should forever so remain. "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof," was the first amendment to the United States Constitution. This provision was intended to cut off all hopes of establishing a national religion here even in the broadest sense. The Jew, Christian, Catholic, Protestant, infidel, agnostic, and Mohammedan—all are equal, and all can subscribe to the Constitution; and the addition of anything to the national law which they cannot subscribe to, would be dangerous to the country.

This system of government has been in operation one hundred and twenty-one years, and no one questions the fact that a very large share of our national prosperity is the result of it. This nation has stood forth as a marvel of progress, a miracle of national growth. Its power and influence have been felt across the sea, in the lands where persecution once held sway; and the degree of liberty now enjoyed by the people of those nations is but the reflection of our own superior freedom. Does any one dare to assert that, if this nation had adopted a narrower system of government, had established a national religion even of the broadest kind, the nation would have grown as it has, or that its influence over other nations would have been so marked and beneficent? For our part, we do not hesitate to state that it would not.

Christianity is the last religion which should plead for national recognition. Before it received such recognition it was beautiful in holiness and magnificent in power. When it became the recognized religion of Rome its beauty was tarnished, its power gone, and itself but a name for an engine of tyranny. When the adherents of any religion plead for a national recognition of their religion by law, they show that their hope is in an arm of flesh. A yielding to such demands by this nation, to the degree that this has already been done, is in itself a signal of disintegration and decay. If our nation is to be preserved, it can be done only by scrupulously maintaining the religious freedom guaranteed in the Constitution, as its framers originally intended.
