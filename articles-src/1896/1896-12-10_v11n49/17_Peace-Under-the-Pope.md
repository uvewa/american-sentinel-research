The Catholic Review, of December 5, concludes some mournful reflections upon the warlike conditions which prevail to-day throughout Europe, with this statement: "There can be no peace, no disarmament, without mutual confidence, and this can never be hoped for until the natural union has been affected of the European States under the presidency of that potentate in whom alone all would have perfect trust and by whom none of them would be betrayed—the pope."

It was under the presidency of the pope that the nations of Europe experienced the "peace" of the Middle Ages, during which such military figures as Charlemagne and Charles V. rose to prominence. The "Christian" nations of the world were then happily united in one "faith," which they firmly maintained while their armies clashed on the field of battle! Besides this, no little exercise of arms was required in the extermination of the millions of "heretics" with which Europe was filled. Truly it was great "peace" that the civilized world enjoyed under the "presidency" of the pope! We do not sigh for a return of that régime.
