The Roman Catholic Church in Canada is not satisfied with the terms of the settlement of the Manitoba School controversy, notwithstanding it allows Roman Catholic teaching in the public schools after a certain hour each day wherever there may be twenty-five Catholic children in attendance. Archbishop Langevin is quoted by a Catholic journal as saying, "The settlement is a farce; the fight has only begun." Having obtained one concession in the line of what she seeks, the church will of course fight all the harder for more.
