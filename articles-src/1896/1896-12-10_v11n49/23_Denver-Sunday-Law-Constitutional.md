JUDGE ABBOTT, of Denver, Colo., has decided that the Sunday law of that State is constitutional. In remarking upon the conflicting decisions extant upon the subject, he said that "the decisions against the constitutionality of sabbath laws seem more logical;" yet in spite of logic he decided this law to be constitutional! We have not learned whether an appeal will be taken to a higher court; but upon such a decision as that we should think that it surely would.
