The Sunday-law forces in California have of late been laying siege to the Oakland City Council, with what results we have not yet learned. They asked the council to pass an ordinance suppressing "Sunday sports, such as shooting matches, bicycle races, Sunday concerts, picnics, dances, races, ball games, and all such carnal amusements as lead to dissipation and disturbance of the peace." And they asked this, says their official organ, the Christian Statesman, "as a police arrangement and sanitary measure, and that a weekly rest may be secured to laborers and employés." The public will probably be puzzled to understand why the civil power should prohibit amusements on the ground that they are "carnal;" for it is obvious that this word expresses the objection to them in the minds of those demanding this Sunday legislation. All is "carnal" that is not "spiritual." The distinction which the term expresses is religious entirely. And the use of this religious term shows plainly enough that it is a religious observance of Sunday which the Oakland City Council is asked to enforce.
