The Christian Statesman, of November 21, publishes a "call for a convention, in the interest of national righteousness and Christian Endeavor," to be held in Chicago, December 16, 17. The convention will be purely a "National Reform" affair, yet the organ of the "National Reform" party advertises it as being "in the interest of . . . Christian Endeavor." This is a public announcement of what was already visible to observing eyes,—namely, that National Reformers and Christian Endeavorers stand on the same platform.
