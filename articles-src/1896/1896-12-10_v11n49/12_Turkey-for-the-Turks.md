Turkey for the Turks, seems to have been the watchword of the Turkish government in the terrible scenes lately enacted on Turkish soil; and this watchword is certainly as justifiable as that of "Russia for the Russians." It is true that Turkey differs in her methods from her great "Christian" neighbor on the North, but it may be a question whether simple butchery at home is not preferable to a lingering death from the hardships of Siberian exile.
