A writer in the Western Watchman (Catholic), of November 19, states that the pope has sent the papal delegate at Constantinople, Mgr. Bonatti, to the Sultan, "bearing an autograph letter from the pontiff of the Christians to the head of the followers of the Crescent," in which Leo "besought the Sultan in the name of God to put an end to the Armenian atrocities." He hopes that the result will be such as will add new glory "to the halo which for ages has sat upon the radiant brow of that immortal guardian of right—the papacy." It is well to remember, in connection with such statements, that upon a former memorable occasion the "pontiff of the Christians" sent forth with his blessing a great "Christian" expedition to slaughter the Turks in and around Jerusalem and recover possession of the "holy sepulcher." "Peter the Hermit" first proposed the idea, and when he had made it popular, the pope took the movement under his auspices that the "glory" of it might accrue to the papacy. What the pontiff has in mind to-day is not so much the cessation of slaughter as the brightening of the papal "halo." If the former were his object, he might send an autograph letter to General Weyler.
