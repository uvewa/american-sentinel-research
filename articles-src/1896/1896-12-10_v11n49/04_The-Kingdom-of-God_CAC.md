Nothing can so effectually hinder the advancement of God's kingdom among men to-day as wrong conceptions as to what the kingdom is. In the Epistle to the Romans Paul wrote, "The kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost." . . . The kingdom of God consists of something infinitely higher and more important than laws and regulations as to what we shall eat and drink, or what we shall wear. The kingdom of God is a very different thing from what many conceive it to be and from what many are representing it to be.

In our Saviour's day the Jewish people had their conceptions of the kingdom of God, which were very far from what the kingdom really is, and were material and gross compared with the true conception. They, indeed, made the kingdom of God very much a matter of meat and drink. Their poets and prophets, under divine inspiration, had, it is true, prophesied and sung of a kingdom which would outshine, in its splendor, anything the world had ever known before. But, misunderstanding the prophets, the people looked for a kingdom whose greatness and glory would be more material and earthly than spiritual and heavenly. Overflowing wealth, plenty of corn and wine, and every earthly pleasure and comfort, entered largely into their conceptions of the kingdom. There would be no want, no sickness, no oppression from any quarter, no pain or trouble or distress of any kind anywhere. It was to be "a triumphal millennium of earthly blessedness." This ideal good time did not, however, include the dominance of righteousness and purity, except as they supposed men would live better lives when they had all their material needs and wishes supplied.

## The Kingdom Many Look For.

Akin to this conception of the kingdom is the conception which is attracting many in our own day. Many are looking, desiring and working for a kingdom that will affect men's eating and drinking, and which will have to do chiefly with their material comfort. There is a hope that when the material environments of men are improved they will live better lives, society will be purer, political life will be lifted to a higher level, and righteousness and justice will everywhere abound. . . . Men propose to establish a sort of heaven upon earth by bettering the condition of the poor, and by adjusting all the differences between labor and capital. Humanitarianism is made to take the place of Christianity, and the reformation of society is made to take the place of the regeneration of the individual. The spiritual is made subordinate to the material, instead of the material to the spiritual. The kingdom of God is made meat and drink rather than righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.

All this is contrary to the teaching of Christ. He said, "My kingdom is not of this world." He said, "Seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you." He said, "A man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth." Neither plenty of gold nor plenty of silver will make men happy and upright. They very often make them just the reverse. Righteousness of life is not fostered by the wealth of Fifth Avenue any more than it is by the poverty of Rivington Street. There are as many godly people among the poor as there are among the rich. Blessedness lies not in what men have, but in what they are. The kingdom of God has to do with a man's inner life rather than with his outer environment.

The kingdom of God, at the present stage of it, is established among men by godlikeness of character, and godlikeness of character comes not by any natural development, nor by any growth which will result from improved material environments. It comes by a new birth, by men becoming partakers of the divine nature. "Except a man be born from above he cannot see the kingdom of God." "Except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven." "Ye must be born again."

## What the Kingdom Is.

In this kingdom sin is no longer the dominating force. To those in whom the kingdom of God has been set up it is said, "Sin shall not have dominion over you." Sin may be in the man, and indeed will be, but it will be there as a broken power, not ruling and controlling and enslaving the man, but being ruled, controlled and subdued by Him who triumphed over death, and led captivity captive. The kingdom, in our highest experience of it, is having the King of kings reign within us. This is what men need everywhere, the whole inner realm of the soul, and the whole outer life brought under the divine government. Wherever there is that, there is the kingdom of God.

The kingdom of God is righteousness, a being right with God, and a being right with men. When men are right with God they will be right with men. Then they will be honest, and true, and kind, and unselfish, and brotherly. When employer and employ'd are right with God they will be right with each other. And so of every other relation in which men may stand to each other. Nor will men be made right with each other until they are made righteous—that is, right with God. All the schemes of socialists and labor conventions and such like must fail except as they are worked on this basis.

The kingdom of God is peace—fullest peace—peace with God—reconciliation—the peace of God—soul rest—"the infinite calm of God's eternal heart." Wherever God's kingdom is there is peace.

The kingdom is joy. Joy in the Holy Ghost—holy joy—abiding joy—joy like a fountain, ever bubbling up from the secret depths of God's infinite and everlasting love. Righteousness! peace! joy! Men want to reverse the order, and have joy and peace and the blessedness of the kingdom before they are made right with God. But the divine order of the kingdom is unchangeable. We must be right before we can be at rest.

Getting into the kingdom is simply getting the kingdom into us. The Holy Spirit brings the kingdom in, and when he is allowed to have his own way in the heart and in the life he fully and blessedly establishes the kingdom. It is our beast in this country that every citizen is a sovereign. But no man is truly a sovereign until he becomes part of the kingdom of God, until he has learned through the powers of the kingdom of God within him how to be a sovereign over self and sin and Satan. The kingdom of God is a kingdom of kings. The Christ who loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood, hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father. To him be glory and dominion, forever and ever!—Rev. Charles A. Cook, in The Examiner (Baptist), Nov. 12, 1896.
