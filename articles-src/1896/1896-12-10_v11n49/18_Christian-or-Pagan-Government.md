The Ram's Horn, a prominent religious journal, says in its issue of November 5: "This nation is to be Christian or pagan. There is no middle ground. Which shall it be?" This is true enough if the nation is to profess a religion, for paganism embraces the whole field of religion outside of Christianity. And it is further true that if we are to have a governmental religion, that religion will most certainly be pagan, since Christianity does not operate by the force of civil governments, but by faith and love. There have been many instances of the profession of Christianity by a civil government; but in every case the religion manifested was pagan; in every case it led the government to persecute true Christians. Every student of history knows this. How then will it be with the profession of Christianity by our own government?
