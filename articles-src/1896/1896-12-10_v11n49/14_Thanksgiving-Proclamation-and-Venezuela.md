The official organ of the party whose aim is to force the United States Government to profess religion, has discovered a logical connection between the President's National-Reform Thanksgiving proclamation and the settlement of the Venezuelan difficulty. The proclamation was issued November 4, and the agreement between England and the United States touching the Venezuelan question was concluded only eight days later. "Was there ever," says that journal, "a more complete or fuller illustration of that golden promise of God's word: 'Them that honor me I will honor'?"

To be sure, this controversy might have been settled long ago if these two "Christian" powers had not been so jealous for their national "honor"; and, moreover, the English government, which has acquired no particular "honor" in the Venezuelan settlement, has long maintained a State church, which is certainly a more direct national espousal of "Christianity" than is contained in the President's proclamation; but, for "National Reform" purposes, any objection which these facts might present to the view that in the Venezuelan agreement God honored the present administration for the character of its Thanksgiving proclamation, is outweighed by the evidence contained in the mere proximity of the one event to the other.

The "National Reform" organ finds a reason for this religious action by the President and Secretary of State, in "the Christian Endeavor convention held in the Capital of the nation last July, with its three great tents pitched on the government's property at the very door of the White House," and in this it probably comes much nearer the truth.
