THE *Catholic Review*, of September 7, announces that "the poor souls in purgatory expect much relief from the good works that will be offered up for them by the Church on earth. They cry out from amidst the purifying flames, 'At least you, our friends, have mercy on us!' They will remember those who remember them and repay them a hundred-fold for their mediation in their behalf." The "good works," of course, will be largely such as will contribute to the revenue of the church. Thus are the echoes of Tetzel's drum-beats heard even in the nineteenth century.

THE above quotation sets forth the papal doctrine in a nutshell. The dead who have only committed a few sins, comparatively, are suffering in the "purifying flames" of purgatory. What they want is release from the flames, but the Lord put them there and only he can release them; and this he is not disposed to do. But man surpasses God(!) in pity, and so to man the poor spirits turn, exclaiming, "At least you, our friends, have mercy on us!" Thus appealed to, the friends in their pity do some "good works," by which the stoicism or indifference of God is overcome, so that he is moved to release the poor unfortunates from their pains! Hardly would it be possible to more misrepresent the character of the eternal Father!
