[The Examiner (Baptist, N. Y.), Sept 24, 1896.]

The greatest calamities and crimes which have afflicted Christendom have grown out of efforts, no doubt well meant, of good people to improve upon the methods which God has made known in his Word. It is altogether likely that the man who first proposed to sustain religion by the arm of the State thought that he was rendering a great service to the Church, and was inaugurating a scheme which, for some inscrutable reason, the Deity had overlooked. It is hardly necessary to say that experience has justified, if justification were needed, the declaration of our Lord, "My kingdom is not of this world." No doubt the thought of a primate among the clergy, having supremacy over all the Christian Church, seemed at the start to be a great improvement upon the loosely organized and perhaps sometimes disorderly democracy which had prevailed. Monasteries and convents, to which religious persons should retire for lifelong meditation and prayer, free from the contaminations and temptations of the world, seemed not only harmless but beautiful and edifying. Oracular confession and absolute obedience to a spiritual director were thought to be very promotive of humility and spirituality on the part of the laity. The celibacy of the clergy was devised as a means of preserving the clergy from entanglements in worldly affairs, and of putting them more at liberty to obey the commands of their spiritual superiors, in whatever directions these commands might lead. It is not at all impossible that the establishment of the Inquisition proceeded from a sincere desire on the part of its originators to repress error in thought and action. They very likely believed that they were doing God's service. We are not disposed to deny or doubt that Loyola, in establishing the Society of Jesus, was governed by a sincere desire "for the greater glory of God." It is hardly necessary to speak of the results which experience has brought to light as to the effects of these various extra-Scriptural institutions, in which men have endeavored to improve upon God's plans.
