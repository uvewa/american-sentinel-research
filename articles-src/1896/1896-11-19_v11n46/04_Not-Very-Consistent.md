Our modern Sunday "laws" present, in most cases, a queer combination of that religious intolerance from which all religious legislation arises, with that regard for religious freedom and natural rights which has been a prominent characteristic of American government. Under such circumstances it is not surprising that such "laws" should present inconsistencies. Two sentiments so opposite in character cannot be put into harmonious combination.

In most of the States the Sunday statutes contain an exemption clause covering the cases of those individuals who conscientiously observe the seventh day instead of the first. Such exemptions were doubtless prompted by a desire not to infringe upon liberty of conscience. Of course, all religious legislation does infringe upon conscience; but the evident desire not to do so which appears in some of the legislation of this kind has created an inconsistency which robs the statutes of even logical force.

Thus, Sunday statutes forbid all Sunday work or amusements, except works of necessity or charity. No baseball, golf, or outdoor sports, no hunting, fishing, etc., must be allowed; and no place of business must be kept open for the manufacture or sale of goods. The essential idea of Sunday legislation is that this is necessary for the good of the people. But in the same statute appears a clause which states that such prohibitions shall not apply to those who conscientiously believe the seventh day to be the Sabbath and actually observe it as such. But upon the seventh day, as everyone knows, business is in full blast everywhere, and outdoor occupation and amusements are pursued to the fullest extent. Saturday is, indeed, more fully devoted to business and recreation than any other day of the week.

Now if it is necessary for the good of the people that all business and recreation should be suspended on the first day of the week, except works of necessity or charity, why does it answer the purpose just as well that people should rest on the seventh day, when there is no cessation of business or recreation whatever?

What defender of Sunday statutes will enlighten us on this point? s.
