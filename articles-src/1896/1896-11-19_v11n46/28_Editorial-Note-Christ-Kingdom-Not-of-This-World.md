JESUS CHRIST said, "My kingdom is not of this world," yet he was condemned and put to death as a plotter against the Roman government. This history repeats itself today. Those who proclaim now that Christ's kingdom is not of this world, are accused of carrying on a warfare against the government under which they live. This is the charge now brought against observers of the seventh day.
