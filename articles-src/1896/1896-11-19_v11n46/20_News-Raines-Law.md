It appears that the Raines liquor law, which is pronounced to be one of the best measures ever devised for "regulating" the liquor traffic, does not even stop the sale of liquor on Sunday; for, as the Examiner, of October 29, states, 2,000 saloons in Brooklyn alone have been transformed since its enactment into "hotels," which are free to dispense intoxicants any day in the year. The only effective way of dealing with the saloon is to outlaw it.
