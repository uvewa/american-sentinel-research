One of the reforms sought to be inaugurated by the "Reform Bureau" at Washington, D. C., of which Wilbur F. Crafts, well-known as a leader in the movement for religious legislation, is the head, is that of closing post-offices throughout the country on Sunday. The following petition to this end is being showered in vast quantities upon the postmaster-general by Christian Endeavor Societies and similar organizations in many States:—

To the Honorable, the Postmaster General:—

The undersigned, adult receivers of mail in the city of ——, earnestly petition you to order the Sunday closing of the post offices, and the discontinuance of Sunday work therein, in consideration of the rights of conscience, and the right to rest of the postal employees and the public.

It seems that the principle of local option is applicable to the matter of Sunday closing of post-offices, and under this arrangement Sunday closing has already been effected in a large numbers of places.

The "rights of conscience" to which the petition refers are doubtless those of the post-office employees. But considering the function of conscience in its relation to the purpose of God in the gospel, it would certainly seem that if the employees conscientiously object to Sunday work, they ought to cease such work in obedience to what they believe to be the divine will, without waiting for the order or permission of the civil authority.

To be sure, this might cost them something; but if it is a matter of conscience and of serving God, it would possess no virtue unless done in simple obedience to God's will, regardless of whatever cost might be involved. He who will not serve God in a certain course of action when it costs something, cannot in that thing render acceptable service when all difficulty attending it has been removed.

God has certainly not made it the function of the civil power to make broad and smooth the pathway of his service.

The petition intimates, also, that not only the right of the employees to rest, but also that of the public, is involved under the existing arrangement. It would seem to have been the idea of the framer that the public will feel much relieved when, Sunday closing having been accomplished, they learn that they are no longer obliged to go to the post-office after their Sunday mails.
