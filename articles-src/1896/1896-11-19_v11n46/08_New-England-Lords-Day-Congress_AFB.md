The writer attended a meeting of the New England Sabbath Protective League, held at Salem, Mass., the historic witch-hanging city. Many relics of interest are preserved, among them the original documents, sentencing the "witches" to death.

The meeting of the League was called under the imposing name of "Lord's Day Congress," but its projectors were much disappointed by the meager attendance. The meeting was in charge of Rev. DeWitt S. Clark, D. D., Secretary of the League, a very genial, companionship gentleman. Through his kindness the writer was able to place literature treating the topics under discussion on the stand in the vestibule of the church when the congress was held.

One paper read by Mrs. L. R. Earle, of the W. C. T. C., on the subject of "Women and the Lord's Day," was excellent, in that it argued that the place to begin Sabbath reform was in the home. She said it was in the power of mothers to make the Sabbath a joy in the estimation of the children instead of a day to be dreaded by them.

Following the discussion of the paper the audience was invited to send written questions to Dr. Clark, the secretary.

The writer sent up the following questions:—

1. If Christianity is made dependent on the Sabbath and the Sabbath on civil law, is not Christianity thereby made dependent on civil law?

2. Is Christianity dependent on civil law? Did it not triumph over the iron monarchy of Rome, whose laws were against it?

3. Is it not "the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus" that is needed rather than the law of the commonwealth?

In replying the secretary denied that the Sabbath was dependent on civil law, notwithstanding the fact that this position was repeatedly taken by speakers in the "Congress," and notwithstanding the organization under whose auspices the "Congress" was called asserts that it is in "object" to "maintain the observance of the Lord's day" by the following "methods": "Its methods include organization and agitation, instruction by press, pulpit, and platform, education of the young and morally ignorant, the protection and enforcement of Sunday laws and the securing better legislation in the interests of the workingmen and good citizenship."

The secretary announced that three bills would be introduced into the Massachusetts legislature with a view of improving Sunday legislation. Although the air was full of talk about "resisting the overwhelming flood of Sunday secularization" by the enactment and enforcement of Sunday laws, yet the secretary was compelled to answer the question as he did to escape its fatal logic.

The answer to the last question was astonishing, and the writer cannot believe the answer was the result of mature thought. The secretary boldly declared that the "law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus," and the law of the commonwealth should be practically the same.

At the evening session, Dr. Little spoke on the subject of "The Divine Sanction for the Observance of the Sabbath." He argued rightly that if the people are made to believe that the day is holy and God commands it, the matter of Sabbath observance both in the family and in the community will adjust itself. Speaking of the days when Sunday was better observed, he said: "They had what they thought was scriptural support for the Sabbath;" now, however, reverence for Sunday was departing, and when a people lose reverence for any institution they swing to the opposite extreme. That there were doubts regarding the "scriptural support" for Sunday observance was shown by some of the questions like the following: "How shall we meet those who insist on the observance of the seventh day?"

One of the speakers mourned that leaders of workingness should meet them before legislative committees and oppose their plans of Sunday enforcement.

Personally the secretary, Dr. Clark, is a pleasant-spirited man, and the writer had the privilege of an enjoyable visit with him during the journey from Salem to Boston.

One fundamental error which gives rise to this movement, is that the world is to grow better until the kingdom of God shall be completely realised in this world. But inasmuch as the progress is really in the other direction it is necessary to try to turn the tide by civil law. In the cause of truth these Sunday-law advocates would be clear and logical, but in the cause they have championed they are weak and illogical.
