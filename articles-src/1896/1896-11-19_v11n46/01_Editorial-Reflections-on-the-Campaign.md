Now that the great national campaign is over, and the elements have become quieted, it will be well to take a view of the things that were prominent there. This can be done now without even seeming to be partisan; and the lessons to be learned will not have lost their value. It must be said too that there are important lessons to be learned. Some vital principles were involved on both sides. As to what cast was given to these principles, is a question of interest and is worthy of most careful study. The SENTINEL proposes to review the situation, for the sake of the principles involved, and the lessons to be gained for the present and the future. The field is wide—wider indeed than perhaps many would suppose; but the study will well repay careful investigation and deep thought.

The French Revolution, its characters and its characteristics, was one of the things that was frequently cited in illustration, or warning, in the late campaign. This too on both sides. Each side saw on the other side characteristics of that notable period. These things were not cited by the light-minded and for mere political effect at the moment, but by the most influential,—and in all seriousness, as real dangers to be seen and considered and avoided. This fact is of itself worthy of serious consideration yet by all the people of the land. If only one side had seen in the other these characteristics, and had seriously cited them in warning, it would have been worthy of careful thought; but when each side saw them in the other, and both were seriously citing them in warning to the people, the subject becomes doubly worthy of careful consideration by all. The SENTINEL hopes to look at this matter in a way that will be of interest, as we know it is of importance, to all.
