It is a very noteworthy fact that the President's Thanksgiving proclamation, while not specifically designating the "Ruler of the Universe," does contain what all Christians will understand to be a distinct reference to Jesus Christ, in the words: "And let us, through the mediation of Him who has taught us how to pray, implore the forgiveness of our sins and a continuation of heavenly favor."

This departure from the precedent established by former proclamations was doubtless not accidental; nor has it escaped general observation. The National Reform party view it as the direct result of their propaganda for governmental recognition of Christ as the nation's King; and that their view is correct there seems little reason to doubt. Their organ, the *Christian Statesman*, in its issue of Nov. 7, refers to it as a "Christian Proclamation," and says: "This proclamation is the fruit of the earnest efforts of National Reform workers. Their repeated presentation of the claims of Christ upon this nation have not been in vain."

The authors of the State Thanksgiving proclamations do not appear to have taken the cue provided them on this point in the national proclamation; but in Pennsylvania, it is said, such action was prevented only by determined opposition on the part of those who discern the evil contained in religious proclamations by the State.

It is but one step further to an open recognition of the Christian religion as being the religion of those who constitute the nation. Indeed, the words "Jesus Christ" might have been substituted for "Him who has taught us how to pray," without doing any violence to the meaning of the paragraph. And the recognition of the Christian religion as the religion of the nation, by the government's chief executive, is in effect a governmental declaration that those who do not profess that religion, or who may be counted as its enemies, are not really a part of the nation. Very harmless this declaration may be in a Thanksgiving proclamation; but once established by governmental sanction, it will speedily appear elsewhere in a character anything but innocuous.

Who will still say there is no significance in Thanksgiving proclamations? Is it not high time that the friends of liberty everywhere wake up, and with earnest effort prepare to meet the issues which now confront us?
