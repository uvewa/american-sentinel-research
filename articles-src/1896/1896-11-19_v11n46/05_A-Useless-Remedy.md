In the November issue of The Defender, the organ of the New England "Sabbath Protective League," Rev. J. G. Merrill, D. D., speaking of the increasing prevalence of Sunday desecration in the country, says:—

It goes without saying, that the months just passed have abundantly made evident the fact that the danger point has been reached, that unless the tide of sabbath desecration is stayed speedily and effectually, the American Sunday will have to come to an end; and those who believe in the absolute connection between the perpetuation of the American Sunday and the life of the republic, are convinced that there should not be another moment's delay, that wise, strong, vigorous action should at once be had.

It seems rather strange, certainly, to think that the American Sunday is to come to an end because the mass of the people will not observe it religiously. Will the church bells cease to ring on Sunday, the congregations remain at home, and the pastors forsake their pulpits, because other people are desecrating the day? Does the statement mean that when Sunday comes to be a little more openly disregarded by the public, church people will think it is no use to persevere longer in their observance, and so let Sunday drop in order to be in harmony with the majority? It is hard to see how the day is to come to an end, unless the church people themselves are to give it up.

The proposed remedy, of course, is legislation. But upon this point history gives a testimony that is most forbidding. For it is well known that in the days of the apostles the civil law of the whole mighty empire of Rome was against Christianity; yet that did not prevent Christianity—of which Sabbath observance is an essential part—from spreading rapidly in every part of Rome's domain. If the civil law in that day utterly failed to bar the way to Sabbath observance, it is certainly equally impotent now to maintain the Sabbath against its foes. If Sabbath observance could be maintained by human law, it could have been prevented by the same means in the days of that pagan empire.

And the very fact, moreover, that Christianity spread throughout the world in opposition to all the power of Rome's iron monarchy, affords most conclusive proof that Christianity is not dependent upon the civil law at all. It is no more dependent upon that power now than it was when its profession meant death by the decree of Nero. And when it becomes evident that a religious observance depends upon the civil law for its maintenance, it becomes equally evident that that observance is not a part of Christianity. The Sabbath of the Lord—the seventh day—is prospering without any aid from the civil power. s.
