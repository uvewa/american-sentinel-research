THE Defender, organ of the "New England Sabbath Protective League," in its November issue, defends the recent arrest of three persons for bowling on Sunday in Somerville, Mass., on the ground that "every human being has the right of rest and the privilege of worship, one day out of seven." Does the fact that one person is engaged in recreation at a certain time prevent another person from resting or worshiping at the same time?

If so, how do seventh-day observers manage to rest and worship at all? Yet they find no difficulty in resting and worshiping on the seventh day, with worldly business, pleasure, and recreation in full blast around them.
