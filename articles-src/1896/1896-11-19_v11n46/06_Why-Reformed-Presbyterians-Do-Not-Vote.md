SEVERAL Reformed Presbyterian ministers have been telling recently why members of their communion do not vote. Among those who have been enlightening the public on this subject is Rev. J. M. Foster, pastor of the Second Reformed Presbyterian Church, Boston. Mr. Foster spoke on this subject Sunday afternoon, November 1. The Boston Globe, of the next day, contained quite a lengthy synopsis of his discourse, from which our quotations are made.

Referring to the candidates, Mr. Bryan and Mr. McKinley, the speaker said that the pulpita of the country were almost unanimously opposed to the election of Mr. Bryan, because the platform upon which he stood represented "repudiation and anarchy," while the platform upon which Mr. McKinley stood represented "honest money and patriotic loyalty." He continued:

Both these platforms stand on the national Constitution, and that instrument represents disloyalty to Christ the King.

If good citizens should refuse to accept the Chicago platform, then Christian citizens should refuse to accept the Constitution of the United States.

We cannot swear to support the Constitution of the United States, because it does not recognize God as the source of all authority, the Lord Jesus Christ as the ruler of nations, and the Bible as the fountain of all law.

For the nation to ignore these facts in its fundamental law is the most flagrant affront to the King of kings.

We cannot swear to support the Constitution of the United States, because the Constitution substitutes the people's sovereignty for Christ. "We, the people," are the supreme arbiters in national affairs. This is not a reliable standard of morals. Public opinion is unstable as water. To-day it shouts "Hosanna," to-morrow it cries "Crucify him!" A government of the people, by the people, and for the people, is only possible in subjection to the righteous and benignant dominion of the Lord Christ. To endorse the people is to dethrone Christ. To adopt the will of the people as supreme law is to set aside the will of Christ. The Constitution ought to read, "We, the people, recognizing Christ the King."

We cannot swear to support the Constitution of the United States, because the Constitution contains provisions that are unscriptural. It provides that when the President is inaugurated he shall swear or affirm, an appeal to God is the very essence of the oath. To leave that out is to take the heart out of the body. The Scriptural rule is explicit, "Thou shalt fear the Lord thy God and swear by his name." To leave out the name of God violates this divine law.

It will be seen by the foregoing quotations that Reformed Presbyterians utterly fail to distinguish between civil and moral authority. Moral authority is that which is exercised directly by God himself; and his will is expressed in the ten commandments which are to be the rule of the divine judgment. All power and authority is originally from God, but he has committed to men the administration of civil rule; and this he has given to men as men, and not to governments. He has made man a social, moral being, and so endowed him with the instinct of self-preservation, that for their own protection men organize into civil governments.

"Each person has the natural right to protect his person and property against all invasions, but if this right is to be personally exercised in all cases by each person, then in the present condition of human nature every man's hand will be against his neighbor. That is simple anarchy, and in such a condition of affairs society cannot exist. Now suppose a hundred of us are thrown together in a certain place where there is no established order; each one has all the rights of any other one. But if each one is individually to exercise these rights of self-protection, he has the assurance of only that degree of protection which he alone can furnish to himself, which we have seen is exceedingly slight. Therefore all come together, and each surrenders to the whole body that individual right, and in return for this surrender he receives the power of all for his protection. He therefore receives the help of the other ninety-nine to protect himself from the invasion of his rights, and he is thus made many hundred times more secure in his rights of person and property than he is without this surrender."

So far as the rulers are concerned they derive their power from the people, while the people derive their authority or power from God, not by special revelation, or in any miraculous way, but because it is implanted in their very natures. It is a "self-evident truth that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights: that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; that to secure these rights governments are instituted among men."

Civil government is for all men, and it exists in some form or other in all parts of the world. Of course the higher and better forms of civil government are found in so-called Christian lands, but life and property are protected to some extent even in the most benighted countries.

The superiority of civil government in "Christian" lands is no doubt due to the influence of Christianity, in elevating, enlightening, and refining men, giving them better ideas of justice, etc. It does not follow, however, that Christianity or the Christian Scriptures should be recognized by law, or by the government. To do so would be to make government the judge of the divine law, or of men under that law, and thus in turn destroy individual responsibility to God; because men, being the interpreters of God's law—not each man for himself, but those in authority interpreting it for the people—the individual would not seek to know the law of God for himself, but simply the interpretation put upon that law by the government.

# The Principle Illustrated.

This principle is aptly illustrated by the attitude which some people assume toward the Sabbath question. Civil governments almost universally recognize the first day of the week as the Sabbath; and all civilized countries have more or less stringent laws requiring its observance. The Bible declares that "the seventh day is the Sabbath," and requires that it be kept holy. When the claims of God's law are urged upon the people, very many of them respond that the laws of the land require the observance of Sunday, and that as it is their duty to be subject to "the powers that be," they observe that day instead of the seventh day. Some who readily admit that the Bible requires the keeping of the seventh day, take the position here indicated, and feel themselves excused from all obligation to obey the divine law.

Again, the same principle is illustrated in the matter of divorce. The Scriptures permit divorce for only one cause. The laws of many of the States permit divorce for numerous causes. Now, no one will deny that this has a great influence upon the minds of many persons, and that it eases the consciences of even professed Christians, they feeling satisfied that as long as they have complied with the civil law they are free; while the fact remains that they are none the less amenable to the claims of the divine law.

Not only does compliance with the civil law of divorce ease the consciences of the people, but nearly all religious denominations bow to the decisions of the civil courts in such matters, and retain in their communion numerous persons who, according to the Scriptures, are living in adultery; retain them simply because while living in open violation of the law of God, they have complied with the law of the State.*

# Changing the Divine Law.

The fact is that government cannot properly take cognizance of the divine law without in effect changing that law. For instance, the divine Sabbath law says: "Six days shalt thou labor and do all thy work: but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work." As before remarked, almost all countries have so-called Sabbath laws, that is, laws requiring the observance of Sunday. These laws are based upon a human interpretation of the fourth commandment; and not only do they nullify that commandment by substituting another day for the one specified in the commandment, but they likewise nullify it by introducing exceptions not contained in the commandment. The commandment says: "In it thou shalt not do any work." All Sunday laws contain numerous exceptions permitting very much that is not permitted by the divine law; and thus thousands of people feel warranted in doing on the day which they suppose is the Sabbath, things which are forbidden by the fourth commandment on the Sabbath, but which are permitted by the law of the land. Thus their consciences are eased because the law of the land interposes between them and the law of God a human interpretation of that law, thereby, like the apostate kings of Israel, causing the people to sin.

Mr. Foster's charge that the "Constitution contains provisions that are unscriptural," is due to a misapprehension on his part of what the Scriptures teach in regard to civil government. Civil government is ordained of God for a specific purpose only, namely, for the securing of natural rights. As we have often shown in these columns, God reserves in his own hands all moral rule; he tells us through our Lord Jesus Christ to "render unto Cesar the things that are Cesar's, and unto God the things that are God's."

# The Constitution Scriptural.

Instead of being unscriptural, the Constitution of the United States is decidedly scriptural in that it does not trench upon the prerogative of God, but leaves every man perfectly free in matters of religion; and there is certainly no good reason why any man, rightly understanding the province of civil government, could not be in perfect harmony with the Constitution of the United States. Understand, we are not insisting that voting is a moral duty. Individuals are found everywhere who are conscientiously opposed to voting. Their consciences in this matter should be respected. And indeed it is a serious question whether, under prevailing conditions, the Christian can do any good by exercising this right; and certainly political contests do not foster spirituality. But it seems frivolous for any man otherwise anxious to vote and to hold office, to object to so doing simply because the Constitution respects the rights of conscience in all men, leaving all absolutely free in matters of religious faith and practice.

Again Mr. Foster, and presumably all Reformed Presbyterians, object to the Constitution because it permits an affirmation instead of an oath. But as civil government can of right assume no jurisdiction over the conscience or over the religious beliefs of its subjects, it would be manifestly improper for it to require a religious oath. All that any government has a right to require is that men shall testify under the pains and penalties of perjury, for false testimony. We are not, however, of the number who would abolish all appeal to God in judicial oaths. That form of oath which tends most to bind the conscience of the one to whom it is administered would seem to commend itself to reasonable and impartial men as the one which should be used, leaving, however, great latitude in the matter to the individual conscience.

Sometimes the civil law requires that certain matters shall be settled by lot. The writer once heard one of Mr. Foster's brethren in the ministry object to settling a certain civil matter by lot, on the ground that casting lots was a religious function, coming to us from Scripture. To the writer, the objection appeared frivolous; nevertheless in such matters the individual conscience should be respected. But is it not manifest that whereas some men object to being compelled by the civil law to decide certain matters by lot, there is even greater danger of doing violence to conscience by requiring men, indiscriminately, to take an oath? Some Christians do not think it right to take an oath, believing it to be a violation of the injunction, "Swear not at all." Such are willing, however, to affirm and to testify under the pains and penalties of perjury, for false testimony. This the law now almost, if not quite universally, permits. Mr. Foster would, however, require all men to swear by the name of God, thus violating the consciences of not a few of those who, equally with himself, believe in and reverence the name of God; besides trenching upon the equally sacred rights of unbelievers, who, while honest men and good citizens, deny all divine revelation.

## Wants a Religious Test.

Continuing his discourse, Mr. Foster said:—

Again, "No religious test shall ever be required as a condition for office or trust in these United States." That means that every man, even an avowed infidel or atheist, is eligible to the highest office in the land.

Justice Story, in his commentaries on the Constitution, describes that instrument as a compact by which the "Mahometan, the Jew, the infidel and the Christian sit down in common at the tables of our national councils."

The scriptural rule is distinct. "Thou shalt choose out from among you able men, men of truth, fearing God and lasting covetousness, and place such to be rulers over you." Our Constitution voids this divine law.

Again, "Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion nor prohibiting the free exercise thereof." This was intended to avoid the establishments of Europe, but it has carried us to the opposite extreme of irreligion in political life. In avoiding Scylla we fell on Charybdis. It places all religions—Greek, Roman, Pagan, Mahometan, Morman and Christian—on an equality.

This shows clearly the hostility of the Reformed Presbyterians to the fundamental principle in our Government, namely, that of the equality of all men before the law, regardless of religious persuasion or profession. Mr. Foster would apply in civil government the rule given to ancient Israel for the selection of men to exercise authority among them. His language shows plainly that it is the purpose of that church and of those who are coöperating with it in the National Reform scheme, to establish a religious test for office in this nation, and so to subvert the Constitution as it is upon that point.

It is a marvelous thing that any Christian would wish to do this, for the simple reason, if for no other, that to do so would be to put a premium on hypocrisy. Does not every man know that there are now thousands of men who make a profession of religion for the sake of social and business standing? and do they not know that if a religious test were required for civil office that other thousands, now making no profession, would seek membership in the church for the sake of political preferment? And do they not know also that this would bring into the Church a flood of corruption which would overwhelm it in spiritual declension, and render it bankrupt in spiritual power?

The AMERICAN SENTINEL is Christian, and for this reason opposes this antichristian scheme which proposes to restore to the Church that which God has removed from it, namely, political power. The Church should trust in the power of God, not in the power of the State. All authority, power, and dominion will one day be given to God's people, but it will not be done until "He come whose right it is." But the ushering in of his kingdom cannot be accomplished by the efforts which are made by ambitious men to seize and control civil power in the supposed interests of the Christian religion.

*The Sentinel does not deny the right of the State to legislate upon marriage and divorce. We cannot, however, close our eyes to certain evil results, only one of which we have mentioned.
