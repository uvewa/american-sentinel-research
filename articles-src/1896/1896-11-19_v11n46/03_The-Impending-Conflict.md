The fathers of the American Republic fondly hoped that they had so firmly established religious liberty in this land that it would never be overthrown.

Knowing the inherent evils of Church and State union, they sought by establishing a purely secular government to separate forever between civil and ecclesiastical authority; to dissever for all time priestcraft from statecraft.

It was in no spirit of hostility to Christianity that the founders of our Government established a purely secular State. While some of those noble patriots were unfortunately unbelievers in divine revelation, others were devout, God-fearing men, and were influenced quite as much by reverence for genuine Christianity as by love of civil liberty.

In the work of laying broad and deep the foundation of liberty of conscience, devout ministers and wise statesmen labored side by side. To Rev. John Witherspoon probably as much as to James Madison was due the First Amendment to the Constitution as well as the provision of Article VI., that "no religious test shall ever be applied as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States."

In that day the Christian Church in America was "strong in the Lord and in the power of his might." Ministers and people alike realized that religion was an affair of the heart, and that only as it was such was it of any value. Believing this they readily discerned that to be more than a mere form it must be wholly voluntary; hence their decision to leave the conscience free as God made it.

Recognizing the sublime truth that "all men are created equal," our fathers realized that all had by nature equal rights. If by reason of the new birth some men came to have special claims upon the common Father, and to receive from him special blessings, only God could certainly know who they were: so far as civil society was concerned, they could of right have no preeminence over other men who respected the equal rights of their neighbors and discharged their duties toward society. "Equality of all men before the law" was therefore the watchword alike of the Christian and of the non-Christian patriot of the formative period of the American Union.

But a change has come over the dreams of the "leaders in Christian thought" in the United States. For thirty years untiring efforts have been making to undo the grand work of the fathers of the Republic, to sweep away as atheistic the Constitutional safeguards of religious liberty, and to erect upon the ruins of the temple of American freedom, a man-made theocracy in which the allied churches of the country, shorn of the power of God, shall wield instead thereof the power of the civil State.

For many years this work of undermining our free institutions was carried on by the so called National Reform Association, it must be confessed with little apparent result; but finally our institutions have commenced to bend under this mischievous influence. Within a decade the National Reform Association has been reinforced practically by the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, the Prohibition Party, the American Sabbath Union, with its State auxiliaries; and last, but not least, by the Epworth League and the Young People's Society of Christian Endeavor, until now, in the last half of the closing decade of the nineteenth century, the safeguards of liberty of conscience which our fathers gave us are threatened by a mighty host numbering millions, who, fired by youthful enthusiasm, and nerved by the strength and vigor of early manhood and womanhood, constitute a most formidable army.

Nor are these enthusiastic millions dishonest schemers; they believe they are doing service both to God and to their fellowmen. They are not consciously the enemies of the Republic, for they believe themselves the vanguard of a grand army which is to expel from our borders the malefic influences which have hitherto poisoned our national life and embittered and even blasted the lives of so many of our people. They can be successfully met in but one way, namely, with the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.

The original National Reformers proposed to accomplish their so-called reforms by constitutional amendment. This is still the dream of some, but the vast majority now believe that everything desired can be accomplished under State and national constitutions as they now exist, and the thought is not unwarranted.

The Supreme Court decision of February 29, 1892, declared this "a Christian nation." The following summer the World's Fair legislation was enacted, in which Congress, regardless of the Constitution, assumed to decide a religious question by declaring Sunday to be the Sabbath, within the meaning of the fourth commandment. May 18, of the present year of grace, the Supreme Court of the United States handed down another decision in perfect keeping with the "Christian nation" decision, fully affirming the constitutionality of Sunday legislation in the several States, and leaving no room to question what the decision would be were the power of Congress to enact such a law called in question to the courts. The United States, in all its departments, legislative, judicial, and executive, stands committed to the evil principle which for a century the people fondly imagined was prohibited by the Constitution.

These facts are not unknown to the aggressive millions now marshaled on the side of so-called moral reform by civil law. "The country for Christ" is their battle-cry, and they propose to effect its capture, not by the slow method of making the individuals his prisoners, but by seizing in his name the machinery of government. As shown recently in these columns, a religious test is to be applied by wholesale boycott of all candidates who will not bow to the will of the "reformers," and already the First Amendment has been nullified by decision, dicta, and construction.

With these facts staring us in the face, and with a National Reform Association of over two and a half million of earnest, aggressive, though misguided people, not simply laying siege to, but already in possession of, the outposts, and now actually preparing for the final assault upon the citadel of American liberty, is it not high time that every lover of freedom of conscience awake, if not to save the nation from impending ruin, at least to be the means of saving from eternal death some of their fellowmen who, deceived by the glamour of "National Christianity," are being led captive by Satan at his will.
