A PROMINENT city official connected with the police department spoke at some length at a meeting of the City Vigilance League, Nov. 9, on the difficulty of procuring convictions for violations of the Sunday law. Nevertheless, they have been able in several instances to arrest and punish by fine poor people who at best can hardly supply themselves with the necessaries of life. It is because of the evident injustice of such measures that they are found difficult of enforcement.
