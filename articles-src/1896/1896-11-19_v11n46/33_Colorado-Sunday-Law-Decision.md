COLORADO is the latest State to pronounce upon the constitutionality of Sunday "laws." We have not yet seen the decision, but a Denver journal of recent date stated that a pronouncement on the validity of the Sunday closing ordinance of that city was expected Saturday, Nov. 7, from Judge Abbott, who had delayed the same for some days in order to obtain a copy of the recent Illinois Supreme Court decision touching the Barbers' Sunday bill. It will be remembered that the latter was declared unconstitutional by the Illinois court; and it is to be hoped Judge Abbott has been guided by the principles of justice to a similar conclusion.
