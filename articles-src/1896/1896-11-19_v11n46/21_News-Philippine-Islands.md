SPRAKING of the revolt against Spanish rule in the Philippine Islands, a Spanish Roman Catholic journal asserts that "the people do not care for progress and civilization," and "are happy when they are let alone." This it says in connection with an argument for the complete subjection of the people to the priests and the extinguishment of all liberalizing agencies, as the only method of securing peace and happiness. Rome would hardly dare to state her policy so plainly in this country.
