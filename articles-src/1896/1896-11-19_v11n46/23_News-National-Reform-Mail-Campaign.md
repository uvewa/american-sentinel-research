A LITTLE glimpse at what is being done in the way of permeating our legislative bodies with "National Reform" sentiment, is afforded by the following item from the Chicago Times-Herald, of November 9:

BRATON FALLS, Pa., Nov. 5.—There was hauled today to the post-office 60,000 large envelopes containing a copy of a supplement to a Christian paper in which was printed a report of the bearing before the Judiciary Committee of the House of Representatives, Washington, March 11, 1896, and the proposed Christian amendments to the Constitution of the United States.

Also a memorial to the "Body of followers of the Saviour King on the Christian amendment now pending before Congress for the acknowledgment of God and Christ and the Bible in the Constitution of the United States."

A blank petition to the House of Representatives and Senate of the United States is also included, asking those bodies to adopt the joint resolution which is now before them on the above-named amendment. These inclosures were addressed to individuals all over the United States, and were issued by the National Reform Association of the Covenanter Church, 107 Park Way, Allegheny. The mass of stuff filled a two horse wagon and required two hundred tie sacks to carry it in the mails. The postage cost $1,200. The postmaster was given special instructions to mail none of it until Monday, so that it would not travel on the sabbath day to reach its destination.
