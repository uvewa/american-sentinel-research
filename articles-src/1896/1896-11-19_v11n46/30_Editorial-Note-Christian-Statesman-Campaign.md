THE *Christian Statesman*, of Nov. 7, laments that the late political campaign was not conducted on the basis of an appeal to God's law. "National dishonesty" was not, it says, denounced as "a sin against God;" and "the triumph of 'sound money' is not therefore a moral victory such as could have been desired." It was a very noticeable fact in connection with the campaign that the preachers—very many of them—entered into the campaign and tried to conduct it upon the basis of a contest between righteousness and sin, thereby creating a political side show neither edifying nor instructive to the people, and productive of great harm to the spiritual interests of many. From the spectacle they afforded one can get some idea of what would have been had the two leading political bodies divided upon religious grounds, and turned the campaign into a religious controversy.
