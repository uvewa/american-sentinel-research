A DES MOINES (Iowa) journal of recent date publishes a call for a "Sabbath Rescue" State convention, to be held in that city December 1-3. The call is signed by committees of the Iowa Sabbath Association, Des Moines Ministerial Association, Y. M. C. Association, Christian Endeavor societies, Iowa, W. C. T. U., partisan and non-partisan, and the Iowa Sunday-school Association. The call states that "it is desired to place the Sabbath Association on a broader and better understood basis, making it representative of all religious bodies in the State that are in sympathy with efforts to preserve the sacredness of the Christian sabbath. The association will then be the servant and central agency of this interdenominational constituency and prove such a center of organized activity as a State central committee is in a political campaign."
