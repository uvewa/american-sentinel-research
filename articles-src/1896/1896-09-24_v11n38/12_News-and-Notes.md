## NEWS AND NOTES.

The New Orleans Times Democrat, of September 14, announces that the Sunday law was enforced at the suburban resorts at that city the previous Sunday for the first time since the act was passed in 1886.

The "Woman's Sunday League," of New York City, have begun a crusade against Sunday trade in stores. On a recent Monday a dealer in dry goods was fined $10 for selling a handkerchief on the previous day.

"For every dollar spent by the United States for religion, twelve are spent for drink." Such is the estimate made by Dr. Carroll, editor of the Independent. What better proof could be wanted that the United States is truly a "Christian nation"!

Frederick Herden, a poor man, residing in the Jewish settlement of Carmel, N. J., was arrested on the 14th inst. for selling watermelons on Sunday, the 13th. The press report of the case states that "the old blue laws" were invoked by the complainant, Henry Miller, against Herder. Judge Williams fined the latter $10 and costs, which the prisoner was unable to pay. Hence he was sent to jail, where he remained until his wife managed to secure the money.

At Deruyter, N. Y., the Board of Education have passed a resolution discontinuing all religious exercises in the public schools. This action was in response to a protest against such exercises which had been made by a resident of the place, the law of the State requiring that such protest must be heeded. The Board stated that they took the step with deep regret. The protesting citizen averred that the protest was called forth by a recent attempt to coerce pupils into attendance at these exercises.

The pulpit politicians of the country continue to wax fiercely eloquent before their Sunday congregations in the discussion of the monetary issue of the campaign. Press reports of "sermons" delivered Sunday, the 13th inst., by prominent clergymen in New York City, Brooklyn and Jersey City, furnish reading which in point of dignity and freedom from personalities is far below the level of the campaign speeches of the leading political candidates. One Brooklyn clergyman, the Rev. Cortland Myers, pastor of the Baptist Temple, went so far as to say that the Democratic platform was "made in hell," and that "Alleged and his comrades were the stenographers of his satanic majesty." Their remarks were greeted at intervals with "laughter" and "applause" from their congregations.

The question as to whether Jews in New York City should be allowed to work on Sunday was decided in the affirmative by City Magistrate Cornell, Sept. 14. A number of Jewish establishments had been visited the preceding Sunday and Saturday by detectives under instructions from the chief of police, and three arrests were made for the purpose of testing the legality of such work. It was claimed that the prisoners had worked both Saturday and Sunday, but the latter denied this, saying that the Saturday work was done by their business partners. The magistrate said that the section of the Criminal Code which covered the cases provided that a man can work on the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday, provided he kept the day set apart by his religion. Under this ruling the prisoners were discharged.
