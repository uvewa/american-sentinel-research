## HEAPING CONTEMPT ON A SOLEMN THEME.

PROBABLY never before since the subject of the end of the world was presented by William Miller and his associates previous to and including the year 1844, has this subject received so much attention from the secular press as during the few days preceding and following Sept. 2, 1896,—the date fixed upon by the leader of a fanatical band in Brooklyn for the dissolution of earthly things. The geographical location of this band unfortunately placed them and their doctrine among the observable features of life in the nation's metropolis, and naturally they were not overlooked by the sensation hunters whose task it is to keep a modern enterprising daily "up with the times." For several consecutive days the leading secular journals of "Greater New York" published extended accounts setting before their millions of readers the foolish prophecy of these misguided religionists that the world would end on September 2, and the preparations made in view of the expected event, not forgetting the inevitable reference to "ascension robes," etc.

The absurdity of the prediction put forth to the world in this instance—that on September 2 the sun would reach and melt all the ice at the north pole, causing a deluge which would sweep over the earth, while the little band of "the faithful" would be borne away to paradise—doubtless added to the effect which the setting of a date for the end of the world must have upon the average mind. That this effect is to bring the whole subject of the end of the world and the second advent of Christ into disrepute, as a theme only for religious speculators, visionaries, and fanatics, no one will deny.

The subject of the second advent of Jesus Christ is the most prominent and momentous theme of insired prophecy. Its importance to every inhabitant of this earth cannot be exaggerated. The day of his appearing is the day of all days. The first inspired prophecy ever uttered by man and recorded for man's instruction was a prophecy of Christ's second coming—"Behold, the Lord cometh, with ten thousands of his saints, to execute judgment upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds," etc. It was Enoch, the contemporary of Adam, who proclaimed these words, and the last revelation which the Book of God records, is "Surely I come quickly." The same momentous theme burdens the pages of Holy Writ everywhere throughout both Old Testament and New.

Signs of the end have appeared in the heavens and upon the earth. Sun and moon and stars have given their testimony to the reality of the approaching dissolution. "The sea and the waves roaring," "earthquakes in divers places," "distress of nations, with perplexity," are earthly heralds of the same event. It would require a volume to set forth the prophecies upon the point, with that which has occurred in their fulfillment.

The Savioury, in speaking upon this subject to his disciples, as a caution to all men which he foresaw would be most essential, plainly declared: "But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only." Matt. 24:36. This language is unequivocal. It cuts squarely across all setting of time for the end of world. It compels time-setters to stand before the seeker for truth in their true light, as ignorant or dishonest speculators, and not guides to Scriptural truth.

It is characteristic of such persons that they still cling to their folly after the dates which they have published are in the past. So it is, we are told, in the present instance. They are certainly to be pitied. But if the harm done by their unscriptural speculation and vagarizing were confined to themselves, their work would not possess a hundredth part of the baleful significance which it has.
