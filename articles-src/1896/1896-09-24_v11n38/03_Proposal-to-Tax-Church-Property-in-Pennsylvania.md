## PROPOSAL TO TAX CHURCH PROPERTY IN PENNSYLVANIA.

It is reported that a movement is under way in Pennsylvania to repeal the tax exemption upon church property in that State. A press dispatch says:

A movement is on foot that will create a frurore in Pennsylvania. A measure is to be introduced providing for the taxation of church property.

J. Carson Mercer, county commissioner of Allegheny, is having prepared a bill to be introduced at the next session of the legislature providing that hereafter all church property shall be subject to taxation the same as any other property. Commissioner Mercer will also bring the matter before the annual convention of the State, which will be held in Reading probably next month.

Heretofore church property in Pennsylvania has been exempt from taxation for any purpose. The holdings of church property, by all denominations, however, have increased to such enormous proportions, that it is now proposed to tax them. It is contended that the properties of immense values held by rich congregations should be taxed because, otherwise, it is a discrimination against the small property owner, who is a member of the small congregation and has his taxes increased because the more valuable properties are exempted.

The Dunmore (Pa.) Pioneer, in which the above appeared, makes this pertinent comment upon the proposed bill: "This is opposed by some people on the ground that churches are built and maintained by taxpayers, and that it is not fair to tax church-goers twice. The same reason would apply to the members of secret societies who erect buildings, or to anyone else who erects buildings and runs them. That equal and exact justice, which Jefferson contended, for would tax churches the same as any other property. Exempting church property from taxation is only a step toward a union of Church and State, which can never be countenanced in the United States."
