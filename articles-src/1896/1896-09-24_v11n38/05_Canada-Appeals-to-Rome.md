## CANADA APPEALS TO ROME.

The Catholic school controversy in Manitoba has taken a novel and startling turn. Up to this time it has seemed that the advantage in the contest was all on the side of the Protestants. It appears now, however, that Rome purposes to reap a very substantial benefit from the controversy, even nothing less than the exaltation of the Pope to the position of arbiter in the affairs of the Dominion. It is an adverse wind indeed which Jesuitical craft and cunning cannot turn in some way to the benefit of the papal ship of State. The facts of the situation are set out, with appropriate comments, in the Toronto Mail and Empire, of September 10, as follows:

Ottawa, Sept. 2.—(Special)—A new and extraordinary development of the Manitoba school controversy is about to take place. The government has purchased from Manitoba, as the price of a portfolio, certain concessions to the Roman Catholics of that province. At to day's meeting of the Greenway Cabinet the bargain was ratified, and it is expected that Mr. Sifton will enter immediately, by the grace of the electors of Brandon, into the enjoyment of the consideration.

Your correspondent is informed to-night that an emissary of the Laurier Government will leave immediately for Rome to ask from the Pope ratification of the bargain. If acceptable to his holiness, the terms of the agreement will be implemented, but if not, the threat of Mr. Laurier to enforce the constitution in its entirety, will be carried out. The whole question now hinges upon the view of the case which will be taken by Pope Leo XIII.

According to the information that comes to hand to-night, the gentleman who is to undertake the unusual task of consulting his holiness has been chosen, and is known to the informant of your correspondent. This course is taken to meet the views of the Quebec Liberals, who insist that before they take their hands off her throat, Manitoba must satisfy the church. In adopting this policy the government is gaining time, which is important, and it is invoking the aid of the visible head of the Catholic Church, which is more important.

Never before has a Federal administration in Canada taken so remarkable a step. Mr. Mercier made an act of the Quebec legislature dependent upon the approval of the Pope, but though Mr. Laurier had nothing but praise for the sainted count, he never flattered him before to the extent of so close an imitation. It will be an unpleasant piece of news to the Canadian public to know that the latest development of the Liberal policy is that in matters educational there is an appeal from the judgment of the Privy Council of England to the judgment of his holiness of Rome.

The course of the government has all along been directly contrary to its election promises. There was to have been an immediate investigation of the question, but there has been none. Sir Oliver Mowat was to be one of a great tribunal to which the issue would be submitted, but Sir Oliver has done nothing beyond sitting comfortably in the Senate. Mr. Laurier was to bring about harmony with Manitoba by means of his sunny ways, but he has traded a portfolio for a settlement.

Finally, instead of the people's representatives, who were elected to deal with the subject, being permitted to voice the sentiments of their constituents, they are to await the pleasure of the Pope, and follow his directions. It is to be hoped that it is not too late for Mr. Laurier to retrace the unfortunate steps he has taken and to make an honest effort to carry out his pledges to the people.

During the campaign nothing was said of a reference to Rome. This is therefore an absolutely new departure, so far as the public is aware, from the Liberal policy. The information that it has been decided upon comes from so reliable a source that it is difficult to conceive that it can be at fault, but there is reason to hope that as the matter has leaked out the administration will modify its intentions in this respect.

Will it not be in order next for Rome to spring this arbitration scheme upon the United States? Surely this development of affairs in Canada affords food for serious thought to American citizens.
