# RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION IN ONTARIO.

In the county jail at Chatham, Ont., immured with common criminals, there lie today three victims of religious persecution, good and upright men, and ministers of the gospel of Jesus Christ. As is usual in such cases, the persecution was conducted under cover of "due process of law."

We who have thought that the enlightenment and progress of the nineteenth century had carried us beyond the era of persecution for conscience' sake, are called upon to face this fact and to ponder its meaning.

That the case is one of persecution for religious belief, is clearly apparent from the nature of the charge brought against the prisoners and the circumstances attending their prosecution, of which the following is an outline:

During the summer of 1895, P. M. Howe and William Simpson, ministers of the Seventh-day Adventist denomination, began a series of meetings in Darrell, a small town about five miles north of Chatham, Kent County, Ontario. They were joined later by Rev. Mr. Burrill, who had been in charge of the Adventist church at Selton.

The success which attended their efforts aroused the antagonism of a neighboring denomination, and a minister of the latter was sent for to oppose the Adventists and put a stop to their work. He came and proceeded to advise that these men be driven from the province, alleging that they were traitors to the Queen, and aliens. The only specific charge, however, that he could truthfully make against them was that they did not keep Sunday.

As a result of this effort, a church society of young people was formed, to spy upon the Adventists and see if any work was done by them on Sundays. There is among the statutes of Ontario an ancient piece of legislation handed down with but slight alterations from the time of King Charles II., known as the "Lord's Day Act," one section of which says:

It is not lawful for any merchant, tradesman, artificer, mechanic, workman, laborer, or other person whatsoever on the Lord's day, to sell or publicly show forth, or expose or offer for sale, or to purchase, any goods, chattels, or other personal property, or any real estate whatsoever, or to do or exercise any worldly labor, business or work of his ordinary calling (conveying travelers or her Majesty's mail, by land or by water, selling drugs and medicines, and other works of necessity and works of charity excepted).

It was thought that under the provisions of this statute the work of the Adventists could be stopped by invoking the arm of the civil authority.

On Sunday, the third day of November, one of these spies discovered Ministers Burrill, Simpson, and Howe at work making preparations to lay the foundations of a church building which it had been decided to erect for the accommodation of the Adventist believers. One was seen to be slacking lime, another mixing mortar, and the other pouring water into a barrel. This was forthwith reported to the Sunday school, and at its close a dozen or more individuals proceeded to the spot, as one of them afterwards testified in court, "for the purpose of witnessing." One of this number was deputed to go to Chatham to lay information against the ministers before an officer of the law.

Attorney Douglass, Queen's Counsel, being visited, advised the prosecutors to wait, saying that the law in the case was not clear; and further to show his depreciation of the proposed action, addressed a letter to the people in and about Darrell, to the same effect. The informers then went to Justice Forham, of Chatham, but he refused to issue a summons, and upon being pressed to do so, replied that sooner than be a party to such proceedings he would resign his office.

Not deterred by this set-back, the representatives of the league bethought them of a magistrate in Ridgetown, twenty-two miles distant, who had sent to jail an Adventist named Matthews for the "crime" of cutting hay on Sunday; and to him they went. After a guarantee fund had been raised by the prosecution (Mr. Matthews' prosecutors had not yet paid their bill) the justice was willing to undertake the case, and the necessary papers were issued for the prosecution.

A large crowd filled the court room on the day of the trial, December 5, and made boisterous demonstrations of approval as each step was taken in the process of fastening conviction upon the prisoners. So plainly marked was the animus of religious intolerance in the proceedings, as to elicit from leading citizens who were present, strong expressions of disapproval.

Two grounds of defense were open to the prisoners under the statute. The accepted legal interpretation of the latter had made it applicable only to work of the nature of one's "ordinary calling," and in order to conform to this, the information laid against the defendants was amended in each case so as to specify "that he did exercise worldly labor, business, or work of one of his ordinary callings." This assumed that each defendant had more than one ordinary calling, and made it necessary to prove that these ministers of the gospel were engaged in their "ordinary callings" in the work done by them on Sunday.

The other ground of defense was that such work was prohibited by the statute only on "the Lord's day." As the statute did not further specify the day, it was open to the defendants to show that they had not transgressed it, inasmuch as the "Lord's day" was not Sunday, but the seventh day of the week,—which day they regularly observed as the Sabbath. In proof of this they were prepared to submit to the court the plain testimony of the Scriptures, as follows:—

The fourth commandment of the Decalogue plainly declares that

"The Seventh Day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God."

In the fifty-eighth chapter of Isaiah the Lord again speaks of the Sabbath as "My holy day." Isa. 58:13. This language unquestionably applies to the seventh day. Again, the Saviour, in justifying the action of his disciples when they plucked and ate some ears of corn while they were passing through the fields "on the Sabbath day," said, "The Son of man is Lord also of the Sabbath." Mark 2:27, 28. As he said this in answer to the charge of the Pharisees that his disciples were breaking the Sabbath, he unquestionably referred to the seventh day.

On the other hand, there is not one text of Scripture anywhere to be found that speaks of Sunday, or the first day of the week, as being the Sabbath, or which says that it is a holy day, or is the Lord's day, or that commands any person to refrain from ordinary labor upon it.

By the testimony of Scripture, therefore, we are shut up to the conclusion that the seventh day, and not Sunday, is the Lord's day.

Bible Evidence Excluded.

The prosecuting attorney, however, would not allow this evidence to be presented, and he was sustained in his objection by the court. He refused to consider the case as one involving other than purely civil considerations, saying, "It is not a question of religion, but of law;" yet the very act of bringing the defendants into court involved the decision of a purely religious question,—that of what day is the Lord's day. The civil magistrate was obliged to decide the Lord's day to be Sunday, before he could take jurisdiction of the accused persons under the statute. Yet after he had himself decided this purely religious question, without which he could not have proceeded in the case at all, he refused to allow the same question to be considered by the prisoners in their defense, holding that no religious question was involved. The attorney for the defense, Mr. Mills, had prepared several type-written pages of notes relative to the origin of Sunday laws, showing the religious character of such legislation; but this testimony was ruled out, as having no bearing on the case. Thus the defendants were virtually shut out from making any plea in their own defense, their reasons for non-compliance with the statute being religious ones almost entirely.

It was held that the work done by the defendants was work of their "ordinary callings," although it was clearly shown that their calling was that of ministers of the gospel, and no evidence was forthcoming that they possessed more than one "ordinary calling."

The Queen's Proclamation Brushed Aside.

One other ground of defense for the prisoners was the proclamation * issued in 1858 by Her Majesty, Queen Victoria, forbidding, "under pain of our highest displeasure," any molestation of her subjects on account of religious belief or practice. This was read to the magistrate, but was brushed aside by him as having no application to the case of an Adventist suffering persecution at the hands of his religious opponents.

Had the prisoners been permitted, they would have presented the strongest and best of reasons for their course in not complying with the statute of King Charles II. Theirs was not the plea of the vicious and criminal, but of men who feel bound by the word of God. In the sacred book they had read these words spoken by the Almighty from the burning top of Sinai, with a voice which shook the earth †:—

Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy; six days shalt thou labor and do all thy work, but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God; in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manoeuvrant, nor thy maidowrant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates; for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day; wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed it.

They Dared Not Keep Two Days.

In the face of this command—placed by God in the bosom of his eternal law—to sanctify the seventh day by resting thereon from secular work, they dared not sanctify the first day of the week in its stead. God's holy and immutable law had established the character of the days of the week in their relation to mankind, setting apart the seventh day from the others as the day of rest; and his divine order they dared not disregard or attempt to change. They saw that it is impossible to keep the seventh day "holy"—or separate—as established by the Creator, and at the same time set apart the first day in like manner. The one distinction would necessarily destroy the other. Moreover, the law and example of the Creator had fixed the first day as one of the six common or working days, distinct as such from the seventh day. "Six days shalt thou labor and do all thy work, but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God;" and "in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day; wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed it." They knew that no human statute could set aside the decree of the Almighty, or absolve them from obligation to his law; and they chose to obey God rather than man.

For this they were convicted by the court and sentenced as criminals to pay fines of ten and fifteen dollars, respectively, together with costs of prosecution; and in default thereof to serve out their sentence in jail at 25 cents per day.

An Appeal Taken.

An appeal was taken to the higher court, and on March 16 the cases were argued in the Divisional Court at Toronto, before Chief-Justice Meredith and Justices Rose and Street. There the judgment of the lower court was affirmed, but without costs, which leaves the latter to be paid by the prosecution.

That which most concerns us, however, and every reader of these lines as well, is the fact that we have come upon an era of intolerance, when obsolete religious statutes are being revived and made the instruments of persecution. All so-called Sabbath laws are religious laws, since they pertain to an institution which is wholly religious. The Sabbath is the Lord's, not man's. God is its author. It is the memorial of the Creator; "for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day; wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed it." His ownership of the sacred day is repeatedly affirmed in his word by such expressions as "the Sabbath of the Lord," "My Sabbaths," "My holy day," etc. Ex. 20:8-11; 31:13; Isa. 58:13; Exe. 20:12, 20. Belonging thus wholly to God, it is wholly religious, and cannot properly be made subject to human legislation. Man has no authority to enact religious laws; that is the prerogative of God alone.

The intellectual enlightenment of this age ill comports with the revival of the penalties of this antiquated sabbath "law." While not able to eliminate it from the statute books of the Province, the modern spirit of liberty in religious faith and practice has shown its disapproval of the statute by the restrictions placed upon it; holding it to be applicable only to those in the cities and towns, and then only to work of the nature of one's "ordinary calling." The unusual proceeding of the appeal Justices, also, in affirming the decision of the lower court "without costs," stamps the proceedings under the statute as petty persecution. Had the justices viewed it otherwise, the costs would not have been charged to the prosecution.

A Conflict Impending.

But the fact remains that religious intolerance, defying all enlightened sentiment and blind to the lessons of history, seizing upon the ready weapon of religious "law," is casting upright, Christian men into prison, and in that act striking a blow at the liberties of all. It proclaims to the people that they are slaves, not free to worship God according to the dictates of his word and of conscience, but bound by the dictates of a man-made statute, and that in a matter so sacred and essential as the observance of the Sabbath. Those who believe in sanctifying the seventh day, according to the commandment, are not free to set apart that day from all others without paying the legal penalty; and those who have been accustomed to observe the first day, thinking it to be the Sabbath, are not free to change their views in this respect, no matter what the evidence, without meeting the like fate. And those who have no belief in God or religion, are not free to pursue an honest, consistent course in this respect, but must make a hypocritical show of regard for a religious institution, by doing no work on Sunday, if they would be free from legal pains and penalties. The gospel of Christ, on the other hand, proclaims "liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound." Isa. 61:1.

A conflict is impending. As the Sabbath of the Lord is being more widely proclaimed and observed, the spirit of religious intolerance is rising and manifesting itself in such scenes as that we have described. The arraying of the opposing forces of religious freedom and of intolerance, is but the shaping for the final struggle of the long conflict between good and evil. The battle ground will afford no room for idle spectators. We must choose this day whom we will serve,—whether we will worship him who is the Creator, by keeping his Sabbath, or that other power which has set up a rival day. Let us then have faith in God, and leave with him the consequences of obedience to his word.

The only ground, on which restrictions on Sunday amusements can be defended, must be that they are religiously wrong; a motive of legislation which can never be too earnestly protested against.—John Stuart Mill.
