# GOOD BAPTIST AND ADVENTIST: DOCTRINE.

BY J. G. LAMSON.

AN editorial in the Canadian Baptist, of February 20, relative to the Remedial Bill now engrossing the attention of the Dominion House of Commons, states very clearly some general principles upon which the AMERICAN SENTINEL has often spoken. Coming from the source it does in the present instance it is doubly agreeable; and it would hardly be out of the way perhaps to ask the Canadian Baptist what position it proposes to take relative to the Christianity, or the righteousness, or the lawfulness, or even the expediency, of the recent efforts to make the State enforce a dogma of the Church, as is very evidently being done in the case of the three Adventist ministers of Kent County, Ont. The editorial mentioned says:--

But as Baptists we object most strenuously to the bill because it violates the great Baptist principle—a principle which is, we are glad to believe, now held almost or quite as firmly by many churches and individuals of other evangelical denominations—that the State has no right and no mission to interfere in matters within the domain of the Church, and the Church no right to interfere in those within the domain of the State. This principle is violated whenever the State legislates, or bestows funds which are taken from the whole people by taxation, in aid of any work of any church or denomination. It is equally violated when the State hands over to the control of a particular church the administration of any function or trust which belongs to the government as the servant of the whole people.

This principle, which is constantly winning wider recognition, is the logical outcome of the spirituality of all true religion—that which makes it an individual, personal thing, belonging exclusively to the sphere of conscience, a sphere into which the State cannot enter without sacrilegious intrusion into the relations which exist solely between man and God.

The writer says, Amen! loud and strong.

In the case of the men spoken of above, the observance of the seventh-day Sabbath, and the making a difference between it and other days of the week is a "personal thing belonging exclusively to the sphere of conscience, a sphere into which the State cannot enter without sacrilegious intrusion into the relations which exist between man [themselves] and God." No truer statement of the case can be made; and yet the State has interfered, and is now endeavoring to prevent these men from doing that which the Bible tells them to do.

These men believe that the seventh day is holy time, and that the first day is not holy. They believe that God has commanded them to make a difference between the sacred and the profane. But the statute of Ontario, as construed by the court that convicted these men, ignores the matter of conscience, and endeavors to compel them to cease all labor on the first day. Has not the State then interfered in matters of religion? Has not the Baptist principle stated in the foregoing quotation, been violated? Above all, has not the Christ principle been betrayed,—some of his professed followers trying to unite the kingdom which is not of this world with the governments of earth?

Following the quotation above given is another statement, purely true, as follows:—

For the same reason, all State teaching of religion in the schools is worthless or worse. If it is the duty of the government to enjoin and enforce religious exercises and instruction in the schools, it is manifestly the duty to see to it that the teachers appointed for this work shall be qualified for it. This implies that it is the duty of the government of the day to make careful inquiry into the religious opinions and characters of all candidates for teachers' certificates. In other words, it must satisfy itself that any one who seeks license to teach shall be a truly religious man or woman; for how else can one teach religion? But before the government can grant certificates of qualification to teach religion, it must clearly decide what constitutes true religion, and make it known to its subjects.

The proposition beginning with the word "if," is one that is now appealing in many ways to the citizens of the United States as well as in the Dominion; but if the truth of that supposition be granted, the conclusion of the Baptist follows as surely as the night the day.

Why cannot men see the end of the road from the beginning? Why is it needful that this same path of oppression and death must needs be traveled so many times? God grant that thousands may rise to see the need of keeping a dividing line between the duties we owe to God and those we owe to (Cæsar) the State.

A BAD "law," we are told, ought to be enforced, as the speediest way of getting rid of it. What folly! Bad "law" is not law at all, for justice is law, and there cannot be such a thing as bad justice. Bad "law" is simply counterfeit law, and is no better than anything else that is counterfeit. There is in the country a considerable amount of counterfeit money. What shall be done with it? Oh, circulate it; for then the people will raise an outcry, and we shall get rid of it! But the government is wise enough to promptly confiscate and destroy it whenever it is discovered. Why cannot men be equally wise with respect to counterfeit law?
