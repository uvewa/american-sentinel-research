# REJOCING UNDER PERSECUTION.

The three Adventist ministers imprisoned at Catham, Ont., have not courted persecution. They have consistently defended themselves in the courts and have claimed their rights as men and as Christians; but, now that the decision has been rendered against them, and they are required to suffer imprisonment for conscience' sake, they are enabled to rejoice even under persecution. On the eve of his imprisonment one of these men writes thus to a friend:—

Darrell, Ont., March 20, 1896.

The sheriff has not as yet called to take us to jail. We are expecting him at any minute. My heart is filled with gratitude to God for the privilege I have of thus witnessing for the truth. My earnest prayer to God is that his name may be glorified and his truth advanced in the earth. I praise him for the assurance I have that he will be with me, that he will sustain me. The words of Christ by his apostle are precious to me: "If any man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God on this behalf;" and I praise God continually that I am accounted worthy to suffer for his precious name. The enemy of all righteousness may separate us from earthly friends, but they cannot separate us from that dearest of all friends that sticketh closer than a brother. Prison cells and bars may cut off all communication with the world, but they cannot cut off communication with Him in whom I trust. The enemy may distress, but he cannot contaminate; he can cause agony, but not defilement. The thought that Christ has fought the battle and conquered for me, fills me with courage. With that still, small voice saying, "I'll be with you," I gladly accept the cross knowing that this light affliction which is but for a moment worketh for me a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.

Your brother in Christ.

There is in this nothing of fanaticism: it is simply the expression of a firm reliance upon God. "All things work together for good to them that love God" (Rom. 8:28); and in the sermon on the mount, the Saviour said: "Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake. Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you." Matt. 5:11, 12.

We are sorry that Ontario imprisons such men, but since they are called upon to thus endure hardness, we are glad that they can do it as good soldiers of Jesus Christ. 2 Tim. 2:3.
