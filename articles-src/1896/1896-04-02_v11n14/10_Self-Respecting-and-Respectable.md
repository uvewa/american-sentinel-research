# "SELF-RESPECTING" AND "RESPECTABLE."

WHAT the SENTINEL has repeatedly affirmed concerning the Sunday excise "law" as a bulwark for the saloon and therefore a block in the pathway of prohibition and temperance, is openly admitted by the author of the Raines excise bill, which has recently become "law" for the State of New York. The statement is made by Mr. Thomas C. Platt, "who," says the Independent, "is understood to be responsible for the new scheme":

The Raines bill makes the liquor dealer a self-respecting citizen. So long as he observes the law his vested rights cannot be infringed. From the day the bill becomes a law he walks forth a free man, and after he has discharged his obligations to the State, no one can make him afraid. It is in the very widest and best sense a bill to secure the liberty of the subject.

This is what will be secured by the Raines bill, which provides that saloons shall not be open on Sunday. After six days' liquor selling, the saloonist will close his resort on Sunday in accordance with the provisions of the Raines "law," and on Monday open it again, "a self-respecting citizen;" for, has he not kept the "law"? More than that. Has he not shown regard for a religious institution? And is he not secure under the sanction of the "law" that he has kept? Yes; he will be a self-respecting citizen, and his saloon will, by the same token, be a "respectable" resort, securely entrenched behind the Sunday-closing "law."

But can the friends of temperance afford such a sacrifice?
