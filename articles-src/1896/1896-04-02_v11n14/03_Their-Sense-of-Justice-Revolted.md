# THEIR SENSE OF JUSTICE REVOLTED.

It is evident that the part which Justices Meredith, Rose, and Street felt themselves compelled to take in the persecution of the Adventist ministers, Burrill, Howe and Simpson, was distasteful to these honorable judges.

The decision of the lower court was sustained, but without costs, contrary to the usual practice. What does that mean? It means

simply this,—that the court considered the case as one of petty persecution, and that if the prosecutors could get any satisfaction in carrying it on, they would be permitted to do it, for "the 'law' allows it," and therefore "the court awards it," but it must be done at their own expense.

Nor is this all. Chief-Justice Meredith said: "We think that there is evidence by which we might have come to another conclusion had the case been before us at the first."

But one other decision was possible, namely, to grant the request of the defendants to quash the conviction in the lower court. So that by this the prosecutors were given to understand that had the cases been tried before these judges at the first, the decision would have been against them. This is rather poor encouragement for the latter to undertake another case, inasmuch as it would be as likely to come up before Justice Meredith as before anyone else.

It seems strange that in such cases courts follow the "statute" instead of the law. It is a fundamental principle of English jurisprudence that government exists to secure rights. These rights are not created by statute but exist in the very nature of things. "This law of nature," says Blackstone, "being coeval with mankind, and dictated by God himself, is of course superior in obligation to any other. It is binding over all the globe, in all countries, and at all times. No human laws are of any validity if contrary to this, and such of them as are valid derive all their force, and all their authority, mediately or immediately, from this original."

Had these Canadian justices followed the law as defined by Blackstone, they would not have sustained the conviction of the Adventist ministers,—not prosecuted for an offense against their fellowmen, but persecuted for conscience' sake; for following their own convictions of duty in a matter that in no wise trenched upon the equal rights of others.
