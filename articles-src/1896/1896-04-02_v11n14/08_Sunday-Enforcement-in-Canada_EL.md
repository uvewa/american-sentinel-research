# SUNDAY ENFORCEMENT IN CANADA.

### BY EUGENE LELAND.

### The Day in Toronto.

The people of Toronto are noted the world over for their zeal in the observance of Sunday. No street cars are permitted to run on that day, and if one wishes to get about, he must use his own resources, but if those resources are not in harmony with the ideas of those having control of Sunday legislation and enforcement, he is not allowed even this privilege. It may sound very well outside to speak of the great respect which Toronto has for Sunday, but right here at home, the people know that it is simply a case of "have to." The people cannot do otherwise than keep Sunday; and to speak of this as being an exemplary sabbath-keeping community is as absurd in principle as it would be to speak of the good behavior of prisoners in a penitentiary. How could they do otherwise than behave themselves? That is what they are there for, viz.: that they may behave themselves, and their keepers see that they do it. So of the people of Toronto; they are compelled to keep Sunday. They cannot do otherwise. There is but one alternative, they must keep Sunday strictly, or pay the penalty.

Those of us who have lived in Toronto, know what it means to be virtually kept prisoners in our rooms on Sunday because the places of resort are closed against us. We know what it means to be obliged to walk from four to ten miles to church because it is considered impious to permit any public conveyance to run on Sunday. Yes; we know all about Toronto's pious Sunday, and from it all we most devoutly pray to be delivered.

### The "Law" Makes Them All Prisoners.

A great deal of sympathy is expressed for the three Seventh-day Adventist ministers who are obliged to serve a term in the county jail at Chatham, Ontario, for violating the "Lord's day" act by working on Sunday. But these three men are not the only ones deserving of sympathy on account of being prisoners. The men who caused their arrest, the magistrate who imposed the fine, the Chief Justice and his associates who confirmed the decision in the lower courts, are every one of them prisoners restrained of their liberty by this same "Lord's day" act every Sunday of their lives as verily as are these three ministers whom we think so deserving of sympathy. The only difference between the prisoners is in the place of imprisonment. The three ministers are confined in the county jail, fed and clothed at the expense of the county during the term of their imprisonment, while the other prisoners are confined in their own houses, fed and clothed at their own expense, not actually under lock and key, it is true, but restricted as to their actions and forbidden to do on this one day of the week things that are regarded as not only harmless but meritorious upon other days. And the difference is rather on the side of the three ministers; for they can look forward to the time when their term of imprisonment will expire, whereas the other prisoners have no hope that they will ever get out. They are life prisoners serving out a life sentence.

As to the comparative privileges, the three ministers have the same opportunity of attending service on Sunday as these prisoners at large, and very likely they will have the advantage of having straighter gospel preached to them than these other prisoners, for, are they not considered criminals who need some straight things said to them? while these other prisoners, sitting perhaps upon softer seats, have only the privilege of listening to the ordinary Sunday discourse.

Yes; as between the Adventist ministers locked in Chatham jail and these life prisoners of a religious statute, the latter stand in the greater need of sympathy, and for a two-fold reason: for while really fettered with the most galling shackles of all bondage, religious forms of worship imposed upon them by civil "law," they think themselves free and at liberty, and that the ministers only are prisoners. But though the ministers are deprived of civil liberty, immured in dungeons vile, the prison walls cannot be made thick enough to deprive them of that liberty which is found only in obedience to the law of God through faith in a living Saviour.

Toronto.
