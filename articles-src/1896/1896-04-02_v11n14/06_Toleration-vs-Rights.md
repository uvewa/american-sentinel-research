# TOLERATION VS. RIGHTS.

In 1827, Lord Stanhope, speaking in the British House of Lords, said: "The time was when toleration was craved by dissenters as a boon; it is now demanded as a right; but the time will come when it will be spurned as an insult."

The time thus predicted has come, not only in England but in all English speaking countries, to the more powerful sects of dissenters, but even in England and her dependencies there exists to-day only toleration for the weaker sects.

According to the "Encyclopaedic Dictionary," toleration is "the act of tolerating or enduring; allowance of something not fully approved." This is exactly the status of the Seventh-day Adventists in Canada to-day,—they are simply tolerated under certain restrictions.

By the Toleration Act of William and Mary (1689), freedom of worship was permitted to Protestant dissenters from the Church of England, provided they made a declaration against transubstantiation, and took the oaths of allegiance and supremacy. This act has been amended from time to time until now all dissenters, including Roman Catholics and Jews, enjoy all the privileges of the constitution, except Sabbatarian Christians, who are denied rights freely enjoyed by Jews, simply because they are few in number.

Religious toleration in the Dominion, as in some of the States, nominally guarantees to all sects equal rights, but with this proviso, that they observe the "sabbath" or "Lord's day" of the dominant sects. This corresponds very closely with the conditions of the original English Toleration Act, which, as before stated, required a declaration against transubstantiation, etc.

Much credit is due Anglican influence for the measure of religious liberty enjoyed, not only in England and America, but throughout the world to-day. But not all foretold by Lord Stanhope has yet been realized even in the most favored lands. To-day too many mistake toleration for liberty; but it is in reality a denial of it, for the power that assumes to tolerate thereby asserts the right to restrict or even to prohibit. Therefore toleration is opposed to the free exercise of natural, God-given rights.
