# ARMENIA'S FAREWELL.

It is stated that "a highly educated, a prominent and influential Armenian in Turkey has written a document declaring that the extinction of his race is not far distant."

Following are some abstracts from a translation sent to Boston by the author and received there only a few days since:—

"We are evidently a doomed people. A hundred thousand of us have been butchered and more than a million of us are in extreme suffering from hunger and cold and nakedness.

"Multitudes beyond the reach of foreign aid must inevitably perish before Spring.

"As to the rest of us, our supplies of food and money are rapidly diminishing. We can prosecute no business, we are not at liberty to earn our daily bread and for even the most fortunate the future has only the prospect of starving a little later than our poor brethren.

"We hear the announcement that order and peace are being restored, but to us these are empty words.

"The terrible and wholesale massacre at Oorfa and Biridjik occurred long subsequent to the most solemn and emphatic assurances that nothing more of the kind was to be apprehended—long after the commission sent out from Constantinople to carry the message of peace and reform to Armenia had reached its field of labor.

"Massacres are not now so frequent as they were a few months ago, but the attitude of relentless hostility on the part of the Government towards us, the ferocious aspect of our Moslem neighbors has not a whit improved.

"They seem to be eagerly watching for an opportune moment in which to finish their bloody work and rid themselves forever of this troublesome demand for reform.

"May we not then rightfully offer our farewell message to our fellowmen?

"First—To our Moslem fellow-countrymen:

"We desire to express our deepest gratitude to those of you who have sympathized with and helped us in these days of calamity and bloodshed.

"Towards those who have robbed and massacred us and plundered and burned our houses, we have chiefly feelings of compassion. You have perhaps done these terrible things in what has seemed to you the service of your religion and government.

"Second—to our Sultan—most dread and potent Sovereign:

"Apparently you have been persuaded that we are a rebellious people deserving only utter and speedy extermination. For such as you this work of destruction is no doubt an easy one, the more so that we have had neither the means nor the disposition to resist it.

"Third—to the European Powers:

"We have not been an importunate nor a turbulent people. We did not excite the Crimean War, nor any of the subsequent wars which have stricken this empire. It is not of our will that we were begotten to a new political life by the treaty of 1856.

"Our complaints and appeals have been based solely on the sentiment of humanity and the common rights of man. It was you who arranged the 'scheme of reforms' and urged it upon our Sultan till he was irritated to the extent that he seems to have adopted the plan of ridding himself finally of this annoyance by exterminating us as a people, and now, while he is relentlessly carrying out this plan you are standing by as spectators and witnesses of this bloody work.

"We wonder if sympathy and the brotherhood of man and chivalry are wholly things of the past, or are the material and political interests dividing you so great that the massacre of a whole people is a secondary thing? In either case 'We who are about to die salute you.'

"Fourth—To the Christians of America:

"Although we have cherished strong prejudice against your mission work among us, recent events have proved that our Protestant brethren are one with us and have shared fully our anxieties and our perils. You have labored through them to promote among us the peace and prosperity of the gospel. It is not your fault that one result of their teaching and example has been to excite our masters against us.

"The Turkish Government dreads and dislikes nothing so much as the ideas of progress which you have sent us."

And all this in the closing decade of the nineteenth century! Alas for the world's boasted "Christian civilization"!
