# RELIGIOUS LIBERTY.

[Paper read by Miss Anna Coveny, before the Charleston Union Sunday School Association, Dartt Settlement, Pa.]

RELIGIOUS liberty is absolute freedom of opinion and worship.

Jesus is the author of true liberty. He gave all men freedom and liberty to worship him according to the dictates of their own consciences.

The rights of all men are equal; we find this taught in the words of our Saviour, in Matt. 23:8: "But be not ye called Rabbi, for one is your Master, even Christ; and all ye are brethren." One man has no more inherent or natural rights than another. The framers of the Declaration of Independence enunciated a great truth when they said, "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these rights are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."

In recognition of the equality of men, Jesus says, "Judge not, that ye be not judged."

It is not so much by the number or length of prayers, or by the amount of religious ceremonies performed that God estimates our religion, as by the way we treat our fellowmen. They are his creatures, beings whom he has made in his own image. We are to see the workmanship of God in each human being, and recognize and treat each individual as God's property.

We also read in Rom. 14:4 these words: "Who art thou that judgment another man's servant? to his own master he standeth or falleth." These words not only forbid us to judge our fellows, but they guarantee to us liberty, for they say to every individual just what they say to us.

Freedom is a condition desirable to all. Everybody likes to be free—free to think, to act, or to speak; it is an inborn principle. God made man free in the beginning and it is only sin that has brought bondage into the world. The words of Patrick Henry, "Give me liberty or give me death," are but an outburst of this natural desire for freedom.

Freedom is the greatest blessing that God could bestow upon us his creatures, without which we would be most miserable.

It is only the willing service that is acceptable to God. We cannot compel men to be righteous. All the force of the civil power since the world stood could not compel one soul to be righteous.

Governments were ordained to keep men civil, and not to make them religious. God's plan is this: "Come, let us reason together." God does not force the will of his creatures. He cannot accept an homage that is not willingly given.

A mere forced submission would prevent all development of mind or character. It would make man a mere automaton, and such is not the purpose of the Creator. He desires that man, the crowning work of his creative power, shall reach the highest possible development.

To give to men their natural rights is not in the power of the State. Rights come from God. The State can only declare and secure them.

To protect liberty of conscience is the duty of the State, and this is the limit of its authority in matters of religion. The State has no right to enforce upon any the religious views of others. The free exercise of religion according to the dictates of conscience is something which every man may indeed demand as a right, not something which we must ask as a privilege.

Whatever the circumstances may be, religious persecution cannot be right, for persecution itself is wrong. Even though the persecutor were defending the truth, his persecution would be wrong.

Thomas Clark, an English writer, has well said: "There are many who do not seem to be sensible that all violence in religion is irreligious, and that, whoever is wrong, the persecutor cannot be right."

The Elector Fredrick said: "Persecution will never advance the cause that it pretends to defend."

"You must remember," said Sir George Dibbs, ex-premier of New South Wales, "you cannot make people good or religious by act of Parliament."

"Almighty God," said Jefferson, "hath created the mind free. All attempts to influence it by temporal punishment or burdens or by civil laws, tend to beget habits of hypocrisy and meanness, and are a departure from the plan of the holy Author of our religion, who, being Lord both of body and mind, yet chose not to propagate it by coercion on either, as was his power to do."

Martin Luther said: "It is with the word we must contend, and by the word we must refute and expel what has gained a footing by violence. I would not resort to force against such as are superstitious, nor even against unbelievers. Whoever believeth let him draw nigh, and whoso believeth not stand afar off. Let there be no compulsion; liberty is of the very essence of faith.

"Vengeance, retribution, and justice belongeth to God to execute, and not to man, because all men are alike accountable to God for their worship to him."

But these principles do not rest upon the opinions of men; we find them in the words of our Saviour, "Render therefore unto Caesar [or civil power] the things that are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's."
