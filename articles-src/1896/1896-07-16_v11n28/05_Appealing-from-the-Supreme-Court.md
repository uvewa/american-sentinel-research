## APPEALING FROM THE SUPREME COURT.

The "Washington Ministers' Union (colored) has issued a protest respecting the recent United States Supreme Court decision upholding the Louisiana separate car system for colored persons. The ministers say:—

We feel it a duty to protest against both the Louisiana statute and the sanction of it by the Supreme Court; (1) as an injustice; (2) as a violation of personal rights; (3) as a thrust at the legal equality guaranteed by the Declaration of Independence and the Fifteenth Amendment.

The union appeals from the decision of the Supreme Court to the bar of God, and pays a compliment to Justice Harlan, who alone dissented from the view of the court. It is well to have the truth brought before the American people that even the Supreme Court of the nation is not the final tribunal to which appeal may be made for right and justice. The Dred Scott decision of this same court was appealed to the people; and had this appeal failed, there would still have been left the appeal to that Court which never errs in its rulings,—the tribunal where God is Judge.

No question is settled until it is settled rightly. To that court our forefathers appealed when they declared independence from Great Britain. To that court the martyrs have appealed from the condemnation which has sent them forth from earthly tribunals to their death. And when all questions shall have been adjudicated in strict conformity with truth and right, by Him who is "Judge of all the earth," many decisions which have had apparently the highest human sanction will be found to be forever overruled and reversed.
