## SPREADING BLUE LAWS.

The "blue law" tyranny has invaded the town of Westfield, N. J. A "Sunday Observance League" has been formed in the place, composed of members of the Methodist, Presbyterian, and Baptist churches. In anticipation of the transaction of business on Sunday, July 5, by liverymen, barbers, and sellers of fruit and confectionery, soda-water, cigars, etc., the league sent to all the business men of the place the following notice:—

Dear Sir: It has been a matter of public comment for some time past that the laws prohibiting the sale of all classes of merchandise on Sunday have been flagrantly violated by the storekeepers of Westfield.

No doubt in most instances this is due to thoughtlessness, and not with vicious intent. The Sunday Observance League of this town has been formed with a view to requiring a compliance with the laws, and this letter is written to request that you take the necessary steps to carry out the provisions of the laws—that is, that you cease selling or delivering any commodities on Sunday, so the law prohibits the sale or delivery of any merchandise, or article of ware, on that day.

We wish it, however, to be understood that, in cases where this violation is continued, this society is prepared to prosecute the offenders by process of law.

Yours truly,

SUNDAY OBSERVANCE LEAGUE OF WESTFIELD, N. J.
ROBERT JOHNSTON, Secretary.

On being interviewed, a number of those who were served with the notice and had failed to comply with the same, said: "What are we going to do if they arrest us? Well, we're going to fight. We'll test the law, and, if it's valid, we'll make the Jersey Central stop running trains through here on Sunday, and we'll close up everything, undertaker shops and all, and we'll see how that goes. If they mean business, we do."

This of course is but a sample of what is being done in very many cities and towns all over the land. It affords a cheap way of posing as a moral person, and is taken advantage of by many who feel that some bolster to their moral standing in the public eye would not come amiss. It is this sort of general fight which is stirred up everywhere by the Sunday-law leagues, under the mistaken impression that they are doing gospel work. The gospel of the lowly Nazarene does not seize men by the throat, but it draws and wins them by the power of love.
