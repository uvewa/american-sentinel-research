## THE POPE INVITED TO "UNITY" WITH THE GREEK CHURCH.

As noted recently in our columns, not much progress, apparently at least, is being made in the direction of "Christian unity" upon the plan proposed by the Papacy. Pope Leo's recent appeal to the Christian world for unity on this basis has been received with some favor by certain "Protestant" bodies, but has called forth a counterblast from the Greek Church, over the signatures of the Greek Patriarch at Constantinople and his bishops. This has been translated into English, and is being circulated in Anglican and Catholic countries to check the influence of the Pope's appeal.

The letter asserts that reunion is possible only by a return to the orthodoxy of the first nine centuries, and of the first seven ecumenical councils; in other words, to the point where the Eastern and Western churches separated. It sets forth that the Eastern church remained orthodox, and that consequently, instead of that church returning to Rome, the Pope and his flock must return to the Eastern church, if reunion is ever to take place.

The Roman Papacy invites dissenting "Christendom" to unite under its standard; the Greek Papacy invites the Roman Papacy and all the churches to unite with it; and a fast-developing American Papacy is endeavoring to rally the religious world to a unity of endeavor in behalf of an institution of "the church,"—the man-made sabbath. On the basis of zeal for this institution, all three papacies can join hands; they can come into "Christian unity." It was instituted by "the church" before the Eastern and Western divisions arose, and is held by Protestants as divine in nature and of binding obligation. The religious world will not be slow in perceiving where the only ground for union lies.

But meanwhile there is, and will be, true Christian unity among the followers of Jesus Christ. Led by one Spirit, they will not walk at variance with each other. The "narrow path" which leads to life eternal affords no room for walking in any other way than in the closest union. Christian union is of God, not of man. It does not exclude diversity, but it does exclude dissension. It excludes self-exaltation. He who is willing to humble himself and be taught of God, will be led into perfect Christian unity with the true Christian church, which is the body of Christ.
