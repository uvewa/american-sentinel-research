Any one receiving the American Sentinel, without having ordered it may know that it is sent to him by some friend. Therefore, those who have not ordered the Sentinel need have no fears that they will be asked to pay for it.

SUNDAY-AFTERNOON concerts have recently been suppressed in Pittsburg, Pennsylvania.

It is stated that Mrs. Cleveland is a member of the Woman's Sabbath Alliance of the District of Columbia, the organization referred to in our Washington correspondence last week, having for one of its objects the securing of a Sunday law for the district.

A RECENT Associated Press dispatch from London, says: "An interesting step towards the Sunday opening of museums and other public institutions in England is the decision of the Corporation of London to open the next Guildhall picture exhibition on Sunday."

THE Sunday-closing crusade, so vigorously pushed for some months past in this city, has reached Brooklyn. At present it is confined chiefly to saloons. It will doubtless, however, soon be extended to bake-shops and other equally harmless and even necessary things.

REV. E. T. HISCOX, D. D., of Mount Vernon, this State, had a ringing article recently in the Christian Index, denouncing as religious persecution the prosecution of Seventh-day Adventists and Seventh-day Baptists for Sunday labor. We will print it next week. It ought to have a wide circulation among Baptists.

THE Christian Statesman reports for the closing months of 1895, fifty National Reform meetings; scores of sermons; two conventions; and the dissemination of a large amount of literature. The editor of the Statesman challenges any organization to show any greater amount of work accomplished with the same expenditure of means.

COMMENTING on the Barber Sunday-law decision in the Appellate Court of this State, the New York Observer, of February 13, says: "The sabbath-loving portion of the community will welcome this decision. The outward and public observance of the sabbath is a matter concerning which the State has something to say, and is likely to be so regarded for some time to come." As the reader will observe, this language is in harmony with what is said of this decision on page 60, viz., that it gives legal support to a religious institution—the Sunday-sabbath—and affords satisfaction to believers in that institution, contrary to the wishes and belief of other classes of the people. It plainly justifies the SENTINEL's frequent references to Sunday laws as religious legislation. There is no institution more thoroughly r us in its nature than the Sabbath.

WE trust that no one will hesitate to read the article, "Clerical Civil Government," on page 60, because of its length. It fairly bristles with facts most pertinent just now, in view of the persistent assault of the National Reformers, so-called, upon our American system of government. Read it, and ask your friends to do the same.

THE promoters of the so-called Christian Amendment and of the Sunday "law" for the District of Columbia, have issued orders to their followers everywhere to circulate petitions and to write letters to members of Congress in favor of said measures. The idea is to create the impression that there is a spontaneous demand for such legislation.

IN saying as we do on page 61, "Let religion be kept out of politics," we do not mean that in political life men are free from moral restraint. Any religion worth having will make its possessor honest in all the walks of life. To desire just and honest government is one thing; to attempt to use civil power to advance religion is quite another. The SENTINEL is a friend to the former; it uncompromisingly opposes the latter.

THE Christian Reformer calls attention to resolutions passed at the recent National Free Thought Congress against the so-called "Christian" amendment, and intimates that all Christians who do not indorse the amendment are allies to the infidels. This is not at all strange since such tactics are quite characteristic of the "Reform" movement. In a convention held in this city in 1873, Jonathan Edwards, D. D., then prominent in National Reform councils, in classifying those whom he considered enemies to the National Reform cause, said:—

The atheist is a man who denies the being of God and future life. To him mind and matter are the same; and time is the be-all and end-all of consciousness and of character.

The deist admits God, but denies that he has any such control over human affairs as we call providence, or that he ever manifests himself and his will in a revelation.

The Jew admits God, providence, and revelation, but rejects the entire scheme of gospel redemption by Jesus Christ as sheer imagination, or—worse—sheer imposture.

The Seventh-day Baptists believe in God and Christianity, and are conjoined with the other members of this class by the accident of differing with the mass of Christians upon the question of what precise day of the week shall be observed as holy.

These all are, for the occasion, and as far as our Amendment is concerned, one class. They use the same arguments and the same tactics against us. They must be counted together, which we very much regret, but which we cannot help. The first-named is the leader in the discontent and the outcry—the atheist, to whom nothing is higher or more sacred than man, and nothing survives the tomb. It is his class. Its labors are almost wholly in his interest; its success would be almost wholly his triumph. The rest are adjuncts to him in this contest. They must be named from him; they must be treated as for this question, one party.

The truth is, however, that nobody is so far from infidelity and atheism as the man who recognizes the existence of inalienable rights; who believes that in matters of religion God is supreme, and that every man should be left free to render to God that service which the Creator requires of every man. "For he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a reward of them that diligently seek him;" and he who worships God "must worship him in spirit and in truth," not by compulsion.

Primarily, infidelity means unfaithfulness, and who is so unfaithful as those who deny the power of God, and who show their lack of faith in God by appealing to civil authority for the accomplishment of those things which God has reserved in his own power?

THE case of the three Seventh-day Adventist ministers—Burrill, Howe, and Simpson, arrested some months since in Ontario, for doing secular labor on Sunday, is now pending in the High Court on a motion for a writ of certiorari.

In Manitoba a sentence of twenty days for Sunday work is hanging over Mr. Whitehouse; but so far no steps have been taken by the justice to enforce it.

In the United States, cases for Sunday work are pending against Robert Nash, in Mississippi; J. W. Lewis, in Tennessee; and Ira Babcock, in North Carolina. The latter case will be tried in February, the two former in March.

None of the work complained of in these cases was of a character to cause any disturbance other than the mental unrest always felt by those who are not willing that people who differ from them in the practice of religion should enjoy equal freedom with themselves. In every case the prosecutors are members of Sunday-keeping churches, and their appeal to the civil "law" is for the avowed purpose of compelling the Adventists to respect their religion.

THE AMERICAN SENTINEL, published at New York, in naming a list of papers which have spoken against sumptuary Sunday laws, names only the Tampa Tribune for Florida, whereas the Buoy has spoken against them repeatedly in tones not to be misunderstood, and it will continue to do so.—St. Andrews (Fla.) Buoy.
