# Uncertainties Log - v11n08 (1896-02-20)

## General Notes

This issue was transcribed from a Mistral OCR source file. The OCR quality was generally good, but several uncertainties were noted during transcription.

## Specific Uncertainties

### Page 1, Article "The Eastern Question"
- **Issue:** "bury the earth" in Revelation 7:2 quotation
- **Transcribed as:** "bury the earth"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM
- **Reason:** This appears to be an OCR error. The biblical text should read "hurt the earth" not "bury the earth." However, the OCR source clearly shows "bury" and the instruction is to preserve the exact OCR text.

### Page 2, Footnote marker
- **Issue:** Asterisk reference marker placement and numbering
- **Transcribed as:** As shown in OCR with numbered footnotes at bottom
- **Confidence:** HIGH
- **Reason:** OCR clearly shows the footnote structure, though the formatting is somewhat irregular.

### Page 3, Article "Peace, Order, and Good Government in Brooklyn"
- **Issue:** "valour" in resolution text
- **Transcribed as:** "valour"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM
- **Reason:** This appears to be an OCR error for "saloon" but the source clearly shows "valour" so it has been preserved exactly.

### Page 5, Article "Divine Right"
- **Issue:** "heersh" in sentence about word of God
- **Transcribed as:** "heersh"
- **Confidence:** LOW
- **Reason:** This appears to be an OCR error for "hears" but has been preserved as shown in source.

### Page 6, Footnote formatting
- **Issue:** Footnote marker "¹" appears in multiple locations
- **Transcribed as:** As shown in OCR
- **Confidence:** HIGH
- **Reason:** Footnotes appear to reference same note multiple times in the article about Divine Right.

### Page 7, Bible specimen page
- **Issue:** The entire specimen page contains numerous apparent OCR errors in biblical names
- **Transcribed as:** Exactly as shown in OCR
- **Confidence:** HIGH
- **Reason:** This is a photographic reproduction of a Bible page showing how names are phonetically marked, so apparent "errors" are actually showing the pronunciation guide feature of the premium Bible being advertised.

### Page 8, Editorial Notes
- **Issue:** "r us" fragment at end of paragraph about sabbath
- **Transcribed as:** "r us"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM
- **Reason:** This appears to be a truncated word, possibly "religious" but OCR shows only "r us" so it has been preserved exactly.

## General OCR Quality Assessment

The Mistral OCR was generally accurate for this 1896 issue. Most errors were minor and involved:
- Occasional character substitutions (valour/saloon, heersh/hears)
- Some fragmented words at line/column breaks
- Biblical text quotations had some variations from standard KJV text

All text has been preserved exactly as it appeared in the OCR source file, per project instructions.
