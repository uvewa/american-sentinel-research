### To the Editor of the Herald:

The claim that was made at the annual meeting of the New England Sabbath Protective League in Music Hall Sunday, January 26, that its sole object was to secure a day of rest for the working man through legislation, that the character of the league was wholly humanitarian, and that it was in no wise its purpose to enforce a religious observance of the day, is certainly open to criticism, in view of the character of the legislation sought and the statements made in the Defender, the official organ of the league.

They insist on legislation compelling every one to desist from both labor and amusements, except works of necessity and charity, upon the particular day that they believe to be sacred. Now, if it is simply and wholly to secure a day of rest for the workman, without any regard for the religious observance of the day, why do they insist on taking away his natural right to engage in labor or amusements at any time that will best suit his convenience, providing it is not near enough to a church and of a character to disturb the worship?

It is a well-known fact that a large proportion of the wage-earners in our large towns and cities are closely confined during the week, with little or no exercise, and that nothing could be better for them physically than the exercise that would come from many kinds of labor that they might engage in or in many of the healthful amusements and sports, like base-ball, that are now prohibited, on the ground that they infringe upon the sacred character of the day.

Now the fact is that labor and amusements of this kind upon the Lord's day would be to this large class of workmen rest, physically and mentally, and to those who are indifferent to the sacred character of the day morally beneficial, for "Satan finds some mischief still for idle hands to do," which is as true of Sunday as any other day of the week.

If the league fear oppression for the work-ingmen by their being compelled to work seven days in the week, a simple law obliging every individual, firm or corporation, to give every employé a day of rest after six days of consecutive labor would certainly accomplish all they claim. Why is the present bill to prohibit delivery of ice from wagons on Sunday urged by the Sabbath League before the State Legislature if not on account of the sacred character of the day? If it was simply a day of rest they wanted to secure for the ice-men, why not ask for legislation securing for ice-men a day of rest, and leave the day optional with them?

That it is the religious observance of the Lord's day, by cessation from both labor and amusements, that is the object of the New England Sabbath League is evident to every reader of the Defender, its official organ. In the declarations of principles it is said: "The New England Sabbath Protective League is formed for the purpose of defending the sabbath against the persistent encroachments upon its sacredness by business and pleasure." The word "defending" certainly implies something beside moral suasion.

Another statement that is strongly emphasized is: "These decisions render it clear that no work will be considered by the court a work of necessity and charity, and, therefore, be permitted under existing statutes, which merely prevents the loss of property, the loss of money or gain, or an additional employment of labor." The evident meaning is that the loss of property, of money or gain is not to stand in the way of the sacred character of the day.

Again: "Should the Legislature of Massachusetts pass a law abolishing our civil rest day, and proclaim it a holiday or a work day, the religious sentiment and conscience of the State would rise in an overwhelming tide of righteous indignation and protest." If it is neither a holiday nor work day, it means a sacred day, and that would be the reason for the rise of righteous indignation and protest. "Who, that has any regard for the sanctity of the day, will say that there is justification for the 545 scheduled Sunday pass super trains?" "If the railroad corporations of this State, with their numerous freight and passenger trains, do not desecrate the day, then no individual or corporation can profane the day."

Many other quotations like the foregoing might be given to show that it is the preservation of the religious character of the day that is the object of the New England Sabbath Protective League; indeed, its name indicates that, and not simply to provide a rest day for workman.

Can anything be more unpatriotic and un-American than for part of the community who believe in the sacred character of a particular day to try to enforce their views of it by law upon others who think differently?
