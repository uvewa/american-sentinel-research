On the evening of January 29, a large "mass meeting" was held in Dr. Meredith's church, Brooklyn, for the purpose of securing a more rigid enforcement of the excise Sunday law in that city. Speeches were made and resolutions passed which were deemed appropriate to the occasion. The preamble and first resolution read thus:—

Recognizing the sacredness of our Christian institutions, and the obligations of all Christians to sustain the legislative enactments which minister to peace, order and good government; and,

Whereas, It is the conviction of this representative assembly of the city of Brooklyn that peace, order, and good government are discouraged, and, to a great degree, prostrated, by the partially unrestricted sale of intoxicating drinks on the day recognized by the majority of our citizens and by statute as our day of rest, quiet and public worship; therefore, be it

Resolved, First, That we pledge our united support to his honor, Mayor Worster, in an impartial enforcement of that section of the excise law providing that no liquor be sold or offered for sale during the hours of Sunday in any valour or store, and that he be urged to clothe the police force with all the authority provided by statute.

The introductory words, "Recognizing the sacredness of our Christian institutions," are significant of the real purpose of the gathering. This recognized "sacredness" is to be given the benefit of legal enactments.

But is this recognition a proper reason for petitioning for a stricter enforcement of any statute? The laws are for all alike: but this "recognition" is altogether partial. Very many people in the land do not recognize the sacredness of Christian institutions, and some who do, do not recognize Sunday as one of them. Hence the recognition named affords at best only a ground for legislation which would be class legislation, and therefore partial and unjust.

The second clause of the preamble cites the "conviction of this representative assembly of the city of Brooklyn that peace, order, and good government are discouraged, and to a great degree prostrated, by the partially unrestricted sale of intoxicating drinks on the day recognized by the majority of our citizens and by statute as our day of rest, quiet, and public worship." Undoubtedly this conviction states the truth, and Sunday liquor selling should be prohibited; but if "the partially unrestricted sale" of intoxicants on that day is destructive of public peace, order, and good government, what must be said of the wholly unrestricted sale of the same (except to minors) on all other days? In other words, if peace, order, and good government in Brooklyn is the real object sought at such mass-meetings, why is the partially unrestricted sale of intoxicants on Sunday a greater hindrance to the attainment of that end than is the unrestricted sale of intoxicants on other days of the week?

If peace, order, and good government are to be secured in a city, why not call for prohibition of the liquor traffic on every day alike? Can that object be secured by anything short of this?

It may be said that liquor selling cannot be stopped by laws prohibiting it. Very true; neither can stealing and murder be stopped by laws against them. Yet such laws are proper and necessary, and no one advocates their repeal, or the prohibition of such acts only on Sunday.

If liquor selling is just—not destructive of human rights—let it be allowed all the time. We have nothing to fear from what is right. No person can be unjustly hurt by that at any time. But if it be unjust—an invader of the rights of mankind—let it be prohibited as such; let it be outlawed like all other enemies of our rights. Let it be kept away from us all the time.

We do not believe in a kind of prohibition which allows an intoxicant to be sold six days in the week (thus enabling the consumer to have it in his possession on every day of the week and to become its victim and a perpetrator of crime upon every day), and really accomplishes only the exaltation of a religious institution.
