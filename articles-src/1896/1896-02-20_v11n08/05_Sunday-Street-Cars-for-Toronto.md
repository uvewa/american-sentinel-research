By the recent decision of a court of appeal in Canada it is decided that Toronto shall have the use of street cars on Sunday. This city has been Puritanically Saldatarian, and the cars have been prohibited on the streets until after midnight Sunday. The inconsistency of such legislation is shown in the fact that, while the horse cars have been prohibited, carriages and bicycles have been allowed to run. People rich enough to own a carriage could therefore ride to church, and those having bicycles could ride in other directions. The great majority of church-goers were compelled to go on foot. For the young and healthy this is no hardship; for, what with elevators, street cars, and bicycles, we are losing the use of our legs. For the aged and infirm and for many others who want street cars for other purposes than church-going the saldatarian law has been very inconvenient; and there is nothing to show that Toronto is any more religious than other cities for imposing this form of public inconvenience.
