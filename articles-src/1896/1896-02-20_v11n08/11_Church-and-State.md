This subject is ably discussed in "Religious Liberty Library," No. 36 Extra, by Rev. Geo. B. Kulp, pastor of the M. E. church, Battle Creek, Mich. The subject under discussion is the pope's encyclical to the people of this country. Mr. Kulp not only does justice to the designs of the Papacy upon this country, but he denounces in no uncertain terms as persecution the prosecution of Protestants by "Protestants" for Sunday work. It is a valuable tract.
