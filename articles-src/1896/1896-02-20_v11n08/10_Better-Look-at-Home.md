"It appears," remarks the Mail and Express, "that Ahlwardt, the German demagogue who came over here a month or two ago to start a fanatical and brutal agitation against the Hebrews, is still in this country—very still indeed. The misguided bigot appears to have had the sense to take out an injunction against his mouth to restrain it from making any further trouble for him." This is all very well aside from its rather virulent tone. But simply because this German agitator has not found the Americans ripe for an anti-Jewish crusade, it will not do to conclude that there is here no spirit of bigotry or intolerance. The Mail and Express itself has a record as the organ of the American Sabbath Union, which proves that intolerance is not confined to foreign lands.
