Religious legislation in the State of New York has been recently strengthened by a decision by Justice Ingraham, of the Appellate division of the State Supreme Court, affirming the constitutionality of the law requiring all the barber shops in the State to be closed on Sundays, except in the cities of New York and Saratoga, where they are permitted to be open on Sundays till 1 o'clock P.M. The language by which the Justice sought to sustain his decision is as follows:—

There is nothing in this act that attempts to provide that the appellant shall not carry on his particular trade or calling in any manner, or at any place that he pleases. He is simply prohibited from carrying on that trade on Sunday. An examination of the legislation of most of the States will show that that subject was regulated by statute prior to the adoption of the Federal Constitution and the constitution of the State, and that prohibition of work upon Sunday, more or less severe, was in force in all the States at that time, and the right of the legislature to regulate the observance of the sabbath has been recognized without exception by this and some of the other States since the formation of our Government.

The first two sentences of this opinion are simply contradictory to each other. Prohibition of one's regular business on Sunday is a prohibition of that business in any place and in any manner, so long as it lasts; and prohibition at one time of any business or pursuit is justifiable only by the propriety of its prohibition at all times, save under emergencies which arise from extraordinary circumstances. In other words, the character of a thing is not determined by its length; a piece of rope is no less rope because it may be only one seventh as long as another piece of rope. And so with the prohibition of Sunday business; it is no less prohibition in toto because it is intermittent in character and only one seventh as long as if it were continued throughout the week.

It follows, also, that if the legislature can rightfully prohibit a business on one day of the week, it can rightfully prohibit it on all days of the week. The two pieces of legislation would be, in principle, precisely the same.

In the plea of unconstitutionality upon which the law was brought before the supreme court, the point was raised that it is class legislation, since it confers special privileges upon shops in New York and Saratoga. Concerning this the Justice said:—

We do not think that the act can be questioned on this ground. If the legislature has power to regulate the observance and prevent the desecration of the sabbath, it has power to say what acts in the different localities of the State it is necessary to prohibit to accomplish this purpose. It is quite conceivable that an act should be prohibited in one locality, thickly settled, which, in sparsely settled districts of the State, could be allowed; and for this reason an act might be objectionable in one district while not in another.

It will be noticed that this decision does not recognize the "civil sabbath" idea at all, but treats of the statute as one to "regulate the observance and prevent the desecration of the sabbath." In other words, the statute is recognized as a piece of religious legislation. "Desecration" of the "sabbath" cannot mean any other kind of act than one pertaining to religion.

The point that the statute is class legislation is well taken. All religious legislation is class legislation in the interests of the class professing the religion thus "favored." And this statute is further identified as class legislation by the reason alleged in the appeal. While it is no doubt true that under some circumstances "an act should be prohibited in one locality, thickly settled, which in sparsely settled districts of the State could be allowed," this fact constitutes a very poor reason for forbidding the act in Brooklyn, Buffalo, Rochester, etc., and allowing it in Saratoga.

In conclusion, it may be said that the Justice's appeal to the long-standing Sunday legislation of this country as a justification of such legislation now, is an appeal to a very bad source. Such legislation was wrong then, just as it is wrong now. Lapse of time does not make wrong right. Its pedigree is traceable directly back to the Old World legislation of Church and State times. It should have been repealed at the birth of this free Republic.
