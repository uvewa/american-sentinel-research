## CHURCH AND STATE UNITED.

[Manhattan (Kan.) Republic, Sept. 20, 1895.]

The people of the United States are theoretically opposed to any union of Church and State, and they ought to be. But they practically favor such union when they silently consent to abrogate that idea in permitting the United States Government to arm the so-called military schools of the churches, as it is doing in so many places. Who can name a Republican paper, a Democratic paper, or a church paper that opposes such proceedings?
