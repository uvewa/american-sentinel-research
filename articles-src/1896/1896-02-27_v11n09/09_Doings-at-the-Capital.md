## DOINGS AT THE CAPITAL.

[Special Correspondence from Washington.]

The Woman's Sabbath Alliance of the District of Columbia, mentioned in my last letter, has appointed its Missionary Committee, consisting of two persons in each church congregation in the city of Washington. Already this committee has entered upon its work of Christianizing the community in the most approved way. The visit of one of these lady missionaries is best described by one of the ladies visited, as recorded in the Washington Post, of Sunday, February 16. She said in part:—

My visitor was gorgeously gotten up, and wore great solitaires in her ears, but she still suggested an Amma. She has a peculiar soft skin, a bovine expression in her eyes, a stupid, heavy look, characteristic of women who follow this profession.

"I am come to you, my dear Mrs. Climber," she said, after the conventional greetings were over, and I had seated myself in a chair opposite her, "to talk to you about a very serious matter."

"Yes?" said I, inquiringly, producing my pocket-book.

She shook her head smilingly. "No charities," she said, and then lapsed into a long silence.

"Well," said I at last, perhaps a little impatiently, remembering my engagement at Mrs. Bienchere's at 12 o'clock—it was then 11:30—"what can I do for you?"

"The subject I have come to talk to you about is rather a delicate one of a personal character, and I must confess I feel some hesitancy in broaching it."

"Why do you broach it then?" I asked, with some severity, wondering what subject of personal character she could possibly have to talk to me about.

"Because, my dear Mrs. Climber," she said impressively, "I consider it my Christian duty."

"Very well," said I, resignedly, though with some surprise, "but as I have an engagement with my dressmaker at 12 o'clock, I must ask you to use dispatch."

Mrs. Tenpercenter braced herself against the corner of the sofa and squared her shoulders like a grenadier. "I understand," she said, "that you, among others, receive, give dinners, and accept invitations on the sabbath day; and I have come to speak to you about it. Don't you think that we of the upper classes should set an example to the lower? Are you not willing, for the sake of your soul, for the sake of the souls of those dear to you, to give up these temporary pleasures?"

She had become very excited by this time and was down on her knees before my chair, talking with the velocity that a toboggan acquires when it has taken a good start down the slide. I could hardly distinguish her words, which were nothing more than a whirr. What I could make out was something like this:—

"My dear Mrs. Climber, my dear friend, my dear sister, let me exhort you to remember the sabbath day. Why, it is in the commandments, 'Six days shalt thou labor and do all thy work. . . .'" I was too indignant to listen further. I rose from my chair and began walking up and down the room, leaving her still kneeling by it. In a few moments she scrambled to her feet and stood, her great bosom heaving with excitement. It was some time before I could calm myself sufficiently to speak to her.

Here was a woman whose husband had made his money, not by the sweat of his brow, but by usury, who bore the reputation of having been guilty of every mean and contemptible practices known in business, exhorting me to save my soul. When I had become calm again I went to where she stood.

"Mrs. Tenpercenter," I said, "I will accede to your request. I will give no more dinners, neither will I receive or accept invitations on the sabbath day."

"Oh," said the hysterical creature excitedly, "how glad I am. What a victory! What a victory!"

"But," I continued, "there are certain conditions I must insist upon. You came here to teach me my duty. I demand the same right. I propose to teach you yours. I give up certain things at your request. I ask you to give up something at mine."

"What are the conditions?" she asked, the joy quite gone out of her voice.

"First," I said, "I ask that you shall see that your husband charges his customers, the majority of whom, I understand, are poor government clerks and helpless widows, only the legal rate of interest instead of the 10 per cent. a month he now demands. Second, it offends my idea of what is proper and conventional that a woman should wear solitaires in the morning on her way to market or a revival. I ask you, therefore, to promise never to wear your diamonds again before the gas is lighted."

I waited for her answer, watching her face grow white with anger.

"Well," I said at last, "will you promise?"

"My husband understands his own business, I guess," she said, angrily, "and can manage it without any advice from you. And as for these diamonds, they're mine, aren't they?"

"Yes," said I, "your husband understands his own business without doubt, and you can wear your diamonds when it suits you. But remember, I also understand my business better, very much better, than you do. However, when you are willing to let me dictate to you, I will allow you the same privilege. Mrs. Tenpercenter, I question if your ideas of life are any higher than mine, or if your daily life is any better, poor as mine may be. Remember the story about the beam. I have the honor to wish you a very good morning."

And the ambitious home missionary bowed herself out.

Judging from recent occurrences, one would suppose that a great many people had reached the conclusion that the strict observance of Sunday would be the means of neutralizing every defect in the character. It would purify the saloon-keeper, that robs his victim of money and bread for his family, of his health and happiness, and of life itself. The Saylock that robs the poor of their hard-earned pittance, to purchase diamonds and gorgeous apparel for his wife and daughters, may calm his conscience, if he will lay aside his ledger and bank-book, and go to church on Sunday. And the nation that legalizes all these, may be holy by decreeing to keep holy the Sunday.

The effort to secure the enactment of the District Sunday law is still unabated.
