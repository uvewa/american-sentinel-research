## RELIGIOUS LEGISLATION.

Danger to Liberty Lurking in Bills that are now before Congress.

[By Mr. Charles E. Buell, Chief of the Division of Church Statistics in the Eleventh U. S. Census.]

THERE is urgent need that the public should better understand what has been attempted in the past, and is being done in the present Congress, in the way of religious, class legislation.

In 1829–30 the United States Senate was called upon to consider the question of a civil enactment for enforcing Sunday-observance, particularly in the matter of stopping the transportation of mails; and, in the report that was then made by the Senate Committee, the situation was stated, in brief, as follows:—

The committee would hope that no portion of the citizens of our country would willingly introduce a system of religious coercion in our civil institutions: the example of other nations should admonish us to watch carefully against its earliest indications. Among all the religious persecutions with which almost every page of history is stained, no victim ever suffered but for the violation of what government denominated the law of God. To prevent a similar train of evils in this country, the Constitution has wisely withheld from our Government the power of defining the divine law.

Extensive religious combinations to effect a political object are, in the opinion of the committee, always dangerous. This first effort of the kind calls for the establishment of a principle, which, in the opinion of the committee, would lay the foundation for dangerous innovations upon the spirit of the Constitution, and upon the religious rights of the citizens. If admitted, it may be justly apprehended that the future measures of the Government will be strongly marked, if not eventually controlled, by the same influence. All religious despotism commences by combination and influence, and when that influence begins to operate upon the political institutions of a country, the civil power soon bends under it; and the catastrophe of other nations furnishes an awful warning of the consequence.

The evils which this wise body of Senators warn us against are the very same which those who are now urging similar legislation, openly claim that they desire to bring into existence.

The proposed religious legislation is very similar to that which, from year to year, has been urged before both branches of Congress, at a considerable cost; for religious legislation is, like other legislation, attended with expense. Like former efforts the measures that are now urged are represented in two bills. One is a joint resolution proposing an amendment to the Constitution, acknowledging Almighty God as the source of all power and authority; and Jesus Christ as the ruler of nations, and his revealed will as of supreme authority in civil affairs.

## Who Are Urging These Measures?

The Reformed Presbyterians are the authors of the measure for amending the Constitution, as suggested in the above mentioned resolution.

There are four denominations of Reformed Presbyterians that, more or less strenuously, urge that the civil government shall formally recognize God in our Constitution.

These denominations differ among themselves as to the extent to which their protest against existing conditions should be carried. Some of them refuse, because the Constitution of the United States does not contain a phrase acknowledging the existence of Almighty God, the supremacy of Christ, and the authority of the Scriptures, to "incorporate with the political body," and hence do not participate in elections, and in other political rights and duties. Others protest against "a godless government," but are not actually debarred from voting.

The first of these denomination is the Synod of the Reformed Presbyterian Church, a branch that was organized in 1809, and had, in 1890, 10,574 enrolled members, in nineteen States.

The Synod's "Terms of Ecclesiastical Communion" declares that those accepting membership are pledged to labor for the "constitutional reform," above recited, and to refuse to "incorporate by any act with the political body until this blessed reformation is secured." The members of this branch, therefore, do not take part in state or national elections. They neither vote nor hold office.

The next of these, the General Synod of the Reformed Presbyterian Church, organized in 1833, permits members to exercise their franchise and to hold office, but under restraints that keep them from voting. They are not permitted to lend themselves to elect to any office that will require an oath to support the Constitution, or to vote for men who would administer such an oath. This denomination numbers 1,602 enrolled members scattered through nine States.

The third of these is the most strict of all; but numbers only 37 members. The last numbers 600 members, and these are known respectively as the Reformed Presbyterian Church (Government), and the Reformed Presbyterian Church in the United States and Canada.

If it were not for the constant agitation by these four religious bodies, the effort to bring about obnoxious religious class legislation by Congress would undoubtedly die out.*

The regular Presbyterian denominations should not be confounded with these above-mentioned, for while they furnish a contingent that, having heard but one side of the question, assent to the work that is being urged by the Reformed Presbyterians, and undoubtedly furnish money towards maintaining "the Christian Lobby," and for promoting the projects, they do not originate such legislation. The Presbyterian Church, considered as distinct from the Reformed Presbyterians, comprises eight denominations, and aggregates a membership of more than a million persons.

## National Reform Allies.

The several societies that are more or less actively the allies of the effort to obtain religious legislation, which if it is successful, would disfranchise a vastly larger number than they have enlisted in the effort, are, the Sunday League of America; the National Reform Association; the Woman's Christian Temperance Union; and as far as possible, the members of these organizations are united in the third party Prohibition Party, making the utmost display with the number of the individuals that are involved.

In 1887, the organ of the National Reform Association stated: "The political side of Christianity is to bring forth a time in which Christianity shall control the caucus, religion

*We think that Mr. Buell greatly underrates the strength of the National Reform forces in thus limiting it to the four denominations named. In his book "Practical Christian Sociology," Mr. Crafts, a Presbyterian, says: The civil kingship of Christ is not a mere denominational peculiarity of the Governors and United Presbyterians. It is nowhere more ably defended than in one of the Popular Lectures of the late Prof. A. Hodge, D. D., of Princeton, whose name, with those of equally illustrious ministers from all the great branches of the Protestant Church, was enrolled among the vice-presidents of the National Reform Association." It is true, however, that the denominations named by Mr. Buell are the prime movers in this assault upon the American system of government.—Ed. SENTINEL.

shall control the politics, the politicians shall be saints, and, the polls holy ground."

The following, voiced by the Woman's Christian Temperance Union in National Convention in 1887, discloses how these would combine Church and State:—

The Woman's Christian Temperance Union, local, State, national, and world-wide, has one vital, organic thought, one all absorbing purpose, one undying enthusiasm; and that is that Christ shall be this world's king; yes, verily, this world's king in its realm of cause and effect,—king of its courts, its camps, its commerce,—king of its colleges and cloisters,—king of its customs and constitutions. . . . The kingdom of Christ must enter the realm of law [force] through the gateway of politics.

"He who spoke as never man spake" rebuked the suggestion of the establishment of His kingdom by force, as is urged and emphasized in the highly wrought language of the preceding paragraph; and as he stood before the Roman governor to be tried, scourged, and killed by the civil law, he assured Pilate that "my kingdom is not of this world."

Organizations known as the Christian Endeavor, Epworth League, King's Daughters, etc., have been more or less joined to the effort to bring Christ forcibly into the "realm of law through the gateway of politics."

In 1888, the Prohibition party added its tribute to the history of the effort to make Christ's kingdom of this world, in the preamble which they adopted at Indianapolis.

Such is the attitude of these would-be reformers to-day as they stand before the country, to become more active, and aggressive, by an achieved victory in Congress on one or both of the measures now being urged there by a "Christian Lobby."

## Gives Congress Jurisdiction of Religious Questions.

Their cunningly devised scheme aims a death blow at all religious liberty. It places the interpretation of creeds, and of Scripture, within the jurisdiction of Congress, and of courts.

Under such a law as this bill contemplates, those who through politics have been placed in charge of the arrest and trial of the criminal class shall decide for a free people what constitutes "work of necessity and mercy:" these shall decide for free denominations of conscientious religious people in this country, what properly constitutes the "religious observance of Saturday;" and, what is to "disturb and involve others" in the tolerated labor which a band of zealots assume to permit to others.

## One Million Sabbatarians.

There are five denominations numbering a million persons who "Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy" in the strict obedience to the fourth commandment that was written by the finger of Omnipotence in tables of stone, never to be blotted out; and, having kept this, the seventh day of the week, in honor of the Lord their God, they then, thereafter, perform honest labor for six days, according to the commandment, having the God-given right to do so without let or hinderance, as men breathing the free air of a free country. Why should the civil law be placed as a weapon of toleration in the hand of one class of religionists to deprive another class of their liberty?†

In 1890, when the religious census was taken, the entire membership of all religious bodies—Jews, Catholics, Protestant, Mormons, the Ethical Culture, and Communistic Societies, Theosophists, all, of whatsoever name or creed—did not exceed one-third of the population of this country, and one-third of these would amply represent the proportion of adult males that were members of the religious organizations of the United States, at that time.

Of the adult males comprised in this religious census, not less than one million were foreign born, and had not been naturalized in 1890. To these must be added the mighty host of southern negroes, Mormons, the religious orders, societies, and denominations, that are debarred, or withheld from voting, in order to get an approximate idea of the number of votes that are cast by actual members of religious organizations; the vote of this class did not number more than thirty per cent of the total vote that was cast in the last presidential election.

When the religious census was taken in 1890, the percentage of the adult population that was opposed to religion exceeded the membership of the largest religious denominational family.

In 1890, in the District of Columbia, only five per cent of the adult males were actual church members, only fifteen per cent attended church with regularity, and twenty-five per cent. was the limit of those who attended church at all.

## Do not Believe in Sunday, Sacredness.

A majority of the members of the denominations that tacitly assent to a sacredness for Sunday, do not fully agree with the traditions upon the "Sabbath Question."

Probably the largest denominational family among the Protestants throughout the world, is the Lutheran. In this country in 1890, this church comprised seventeen denominations and one hundred and twelve independent congregations. These, together with the German Evangelical Synod of North America, which represents the State Church of Prussia here, have all built their system of faith and practice upon the teachings of The Augsburg Confession; this says, relative to the observance of Sunday, that the keeping of the day is not regarded as a necessary worship of God, nor are any to feel that they would commit sin if they violated the regulations which the clergy have set up merely for convenience, and states in Italics:—

"Those who suppose that the ordinance concerning Sunday instead of the Sabbath is enacted as necessary, are greatly mistaken."

There are four denominations of Friends,—Quakers, who teach, "We know no moral obligation by the fourth commandment, or elsewhere, to keep the first day of the week, more than any other, or any inherent holiness in it."

That most eminent prelate of the Roman Catholic Church, James Cardinal Gibbons, in his work entitled, "The Faith of our Fathers," p. 111, says: "You may read the Bible from Genesis to Revelation, and you will not find a single line authorizing the sanctification of Sunday."

## The Legal Status of Sunday.

The following shows briefly the legal status of this, "The Venerable Day of the Sun:"—

Constantine exempted agricultural laborers from Sunday observance by his edict in 321. In the ninth century, another Roman Emperor, Leo VI., known as the Philosopher, commanded that agricultural laborers should observe the venerable day of the sun, thus making the edict of Constantine apply to all. The character of this ruler is shown by the fact that the Greek Church, which could overlook much in an emperor, refused to administer the sacraments of the church to him. (See American Encyclopedia, Vol. X. Art. Leo VI.)

The next enactment bearing upon the civil enforcement of Sunday observance, as it affects modern laws, was by James I, King of England, who authorized the version of the Scriptures bearing his name. The historian says of him: "He early exhibited that fondness for masculine favorites which left a cloud upon his name. His death was caused by a tortian agus, acting upon a constitution that was undermined by intemperance." (American Encyclopedia, Vol. IX, Art. James IV. of Scotland, and I. of England.)

The laws in Great Britain that relate to Sunday observance, and upon which the laws in the United States for the same purpose have been based, were enacted by Charles II, in 1661 and 1663. Of him the historian says: "His life was most dissolute; his adulteries and the profligacy of his court are scarcely paralleled in British history." (Chambers' Encyclopedia, Vol. II., Charles II.)

Aside from State legislation, the latest attempts to enforce an observance of Sunday by act of Congress is doubtless House Bill 3854, of the Fifty-first Congress, 1st Session, 1890. This measure originated in a joint effort by various organizations to reform by civil law, and the bill was introduced in the House of Representatives, and championed by "Mr. Breckenridge of Kentucky," as appears upon the bill in its printed form.

The claim that is sometimes made, that Constantine was a Christian, does not accord with facts. Within a year from the time of the issuing of the famous edict exalting the pagan day in place of the true Sabbath, he murdered his own son and his own wife. This edict was followed by another on the next day, that commanded that if any royal edifice should be struck by lightning, the soothsayers were to examine the entrails of an animal that had been killed in pagan sacrifice, and determine what the awful portents were. This does not indicate that he was a Christian. Moreover, the edict was strictly pagan; no reference was made in it to Christ or Christianity.

## New York Tribune on Sunday Sacredness.

The following from the New York Weekly Tribune, of Oct. 10, 1894, gives an interesting condensed history of the origin and the acceptance of Sunday-observance:—

J. B. (Rugby, Tenn.): Please tell me in the "Asked and Answered" column of the Weekly Tribune when, why and by whom was the Christian sabbath changed from Saturday to Sunday?

The observance of Sunday instead of Saturday as a day of rest was instituted by an edict of the Emperor Constantine, issued A. D. 321. It reads: "Let all judges, and all people of the town, and all the various trades be suspended on the venerable day of the Sun (venerable die Solis). Those who live in the country, however, may freely, and without fault, attend to the cultivation of the fields, lest with the loss of favorable opportunity the commodities offered by heaven be destroyed." This was the first of a long series of imperial constitutions, most of which are incorporated in the Code of Justinian. Book III, Title 12. By the constitutions comprised in this title of the code and headed by the quoted edict, pleasure was forbidden as well as business. No spectacle was to be exhibited in a theater or circus. If the emperor's birthday fell on a Sunday, its celebration was to be postponed. On the other hand, Code III., 12, 10, distinctly directs the torture of robbers and pirates, even on Easter day.

"History does not furnish us with a single proof or indication," says Sir William Domville, one of the most eminent Protestant divines of his age, referring to the subject of Sunday observance, "that it was observed as a sabbath previous to the sabbatical edict of Constantine in 321" (Six Texts, p. 241). Various reasons are assigned for the changing of the Sabbath from Saturday to Sunday, all of which being founded upon the proof established by Scripture pas—

sage (Acts 20:7-11; 1 Cor. 16:2; Heb. 10:25; Rev. 1:10, and others) that the apostles and first Christians were wont to assemble and hold public meetings on this day. But some churches met also on Wednesday, some on Friday and some on Saturday; none of these days, however, was observed by the church as a sabbath. Says Mosheim, with reference to this subject: "Many also observed the fourth day of the week, on which Christ was betrayed; and the sixth, which was the day of crucifixion" (Ecclesiastical History, Part II., chap. 1; and the Rev. Dr. Baylyn, after stating that Saturday was retained in many of the Eastern churches, says: "The Sunday in the Eastern churches had no great prerogative above other days, especially above the Wednesday and the Friday." (History of the Sabbath, Part II, chap. 3.)

The only valid reason why Sunday was selected for the Christian sabbath seems to be one of expediency. This day consecrated to the sun was already held sacred by the pagans, and so it was much easier to compel them to abstain from labor on this day than on any other. Besides, in order to make the new faith acceptable to the Gentiles, compromises had to be made, and one of these compromises was the adoption of the old pagan holiday of Sunday for the Christian sabbath. This is admitted by many prominent clergymen. Thus, Mour, an eminent English divine, after admitting that we borrow the name of this day from the ancient Greeks and Romans, and allowing that the old Egyptians worshiped the sun, and as a standing memorial of their veneration, dedicated this day to him, says: "So that Sunday being the day on which the Gentiles solemnly adored that planet and called it Sunday . . . the Christians thought fit to keep the same day and the same name of it that they might not appear canselessly peevish, and by that means hinder the conversion of the Gentiles." (Dialogues on the Lord's day, p. 22.) Another advocate of the first-day observance makes a similar apology in the North British Review. (Vol. XVIII, p. 409.) "That very day was the Sunday of their heathen neighbors and respective countrymen, and patriotism gladly united with expediency in making it at once their Lord's day and their sabbath."

No well informed person believes that there is a Scriptural command and authority for the religious observance of Sunday.

Under the name of sun-worship this day was dedicated to the vile rites of a not to be named worship; the unnatural and monstrous vices of which are portrayed by Paul in his epistle to the Romans, chapter first.

By a pagan edict this day was exalted, and its observance was forced upon the world, and upon the Christian church, which had observed the seventh day of the week as the Sabbath day until the time of this edict.

It is evident that the assumed premises of the bill, namely, that the first day of the week is generally considered of divine appointment as a day of rest and worship, is an ill advised statement, and is not in accordance with facts.

If the bill should become a law the people of this country, through their representatives, would have surrendered their liberty to a minority* and would become law-breakers whenever they should engage in harmless amusement, or perform honest labor on the first day of the week, if such labor was not "works of necessity and mercy," as those words would be interpreted by zealots.

* We do not think that Mr. Buell would wish to be understood to imply that such legislation would be any better ever if the majority favored it. In this connection he is discussing the facts, not the prior. It is the inalienable right of every man to be left perfectly free in matters of religion. And this right is just as sacred and inviolable in a single individual as in the majority. "What other nations call religious television, we call religious rights. They are not exercised in virtue of governmental intelligence," said a committee from the United States Senate of 1805. "but as rights, of which government cannot deprive any portion of citizens, however small. See-polic power may invade those rights, but justice still confirms them."

This is altogether unfounded that whatever the majority does is right. It is closely akin to the motto, "The king can do no wrong," and both are alike denied by the declaration that "all now are created equal," and "that they are enslaved by their Creator with certain unalienable rights." It is manifest that a right is not a means in the matter of the contentions alienated is beyond the reach of all legitimate, civil authority, no matter how represented, whether by the few or by the many.—Ed. SENTINEL.

There is no evil existing, no threatened danger, that calls for any such measure as is contemplated in House Bill 167, and it is the wise part of our people to "let well enough alone," and, to keep entirely aloof from the gigantic stride to the union of Church and State that this bill proposes.
