## THE PARCE OF GOVERNMENTAL RELIGION.

[Twentieth Century, January 20.]

The chaplain of the House is certainly doing a great deal by his "prayers" to stir up rancor among the members. Being very partisan in his views, he manages each day to inject something into his prayer offensive to those holding opposite views, thus taking an unfair advantage of his position. If this thing is going to continue, it would be only fair that each party represented in the House should have its own chaplain, so that when, as recently, additional protection to American manufactures was prayed for another could respond by praying for the blessings of free trade. Of course, this is bringing the question of religion into ridicule. But every question should have fair play, and if the farce must continue of holding public prayer in the House, at least the views of one member are as worthy of being prayed for as those of another. Let us be just in all things.
