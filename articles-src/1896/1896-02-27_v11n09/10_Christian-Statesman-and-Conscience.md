## "CHRISTIAN STATESMAN" AND CONSCIENCE.

[The Evangel and Sabbath Outlook, Nov. 21, 1895.]

The Christian Statesman complains of our severity in charging the destruction of conscience upon it and those who like it teach that the Sabbath has been displaced by Sunday, rightfully, and by divine authority. Our answer is: "By their fruits ye shall know them." The Statesman being witness, Europe is generally sabbathless. The seventh day is almost entirely disregarded and Sunday is the "continental" holiday. The peoples who have come to this point have been educated for centuries under the system we condemn, and which we hold responsible for the lack of conscience that prevents the reestablishment of the Sabbath, and forbids Sunday

to rise above holidayism. The core of the Statesman's complaint is couched in the following:—

According to this arraignment, to teach men to observe one day in seven as a day of rest and worship; to advocate the stopping of the whirl of business that men may have a day of refreshment at home and in the house of God; to sustain our State sabbath laws that there may be no infringement of the right of the citizen to such a day of rest and worship, is to save decay of conscience and to destroy conscience, just because the day which it is thus sought to have observed is not the seventh day of the week.

This is by no means a full statement of the case, nor a fair statement of our position. We have said repeatedly that the Sabbath question is far greater than the issue between two days, a fact which we beg the Statesman to note and remember. The Sabbath has been displaced under the theory that it belongs to the Jews only, and is not binding on Christians. No-Sabbathism and the falsehood of an abrogated fourth commandment lie at the bottom of the present state of things. And however devout the Statesman may be in trying to compromise between the whole truth and no-Sabbathism by "teaching men to observe one day in seven as a day of rest and worship," it does not rise above the essential error which has poisoned the public mind, destroyed regard for the Sabbath, and made it impossible to secure a conscientious regard for Sunday. The only approach to anything like Sabbathism which Sunday has ever gained was during the brief Puritan period when men taught that the law of God was absolutely binding in its application to one definite day. But since the effort to transfer the law to Sunday had neither logic nor Scripture back of it, it soon failed. The Statesman is still intent on the hopeless task of resuscitating Sunday by its "one-day-in-seven" theory, although by its own confession, the decline of Sunday is rapidly increasing even where the Statesman has most influence. We do not give it as an "opinion" that this one-seventh-of-time theory, and the no-Sabbathism which underlies it, destroy conscience. History shows that whenever and wherever that theory prevails holy dayism abounds and conscience disappears.

The charges against Christians which abound in the columns of the Statesman prove what we say. It says that Christians generally believe that Sunday is the Sabbath according to its one-day in-seven compromise, and though believing thus that their lack of conscience,—as in the case of the Sunday newspaper—makes them the determining factor in supporting what it calls the greatest foe of Sunday sacredness. Copious extracts from the columns of the Statesman would prove all that we charge against it and the Christians whom it so freely denounces when it is not trying to answer and evade the demands of the Sabbath.

The Statesman declares that it does not charge us with destroying conscience because we insist on the observance of the Sabbath. Why not? Because we base the entire Sabbath issue upon conscience as related to the law of God. We make no appeal to civil law or the custom of the majority; the two things which the Statesman always pushes to the front. The most it ever dares to say about the Sunday and the law of God is that certain inferences make it appear that Sunday "as a day of rest and worship," has taken the place of the Sabbath under the general principles of that law. "General inferences" form no basis for conscience.

If this were a matter for courtesy and good feeling we would try to outdo the Statesman in reciprocating its refusal to charge us with destroying conscience. We mean to abound in courtesy and good fellowship, but the points at issue are facts, not courtesy. It is a cold, hard, sad fact that where the theories which the Statesman teaches abound, and where they have ripened into fruitage, conscience touching either the Sabbath or Sunday is dead or dying. Nay, more. Conscience toward God's law as a whole is also gone, and much of the prevalent wickedness in Christian nations comes because the theory of an abrogated fourth commandment means an abrogated Decalogue. It is not "interpretation," but fact, that anarchy and nihilism are born and bred where the no-lawism which the Statesman teaches in fact, though trying to conceal it by words, have ruled the Church for centuries: where civil law and popular custom stand between men and the law of God. It is such facts which neither the Statesman nor the Sabbath Outlook can evade on which we build.
