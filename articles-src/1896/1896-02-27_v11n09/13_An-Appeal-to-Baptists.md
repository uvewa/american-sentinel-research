## "AN APPEAL TO BAPTISTS."

We have received from the author, George B. Wheeler, for "fifteen years a Baptist clergyman," a copy of a 38-page pamphlet bearing the above title. It is neatly printed on excellent paper, and every page of it is full of interesting facts and telling arguments. We do not just like the arrangement of this pamphlet, especially would we criticize the title-page: it is too abrupt and has too much on it. The pamphlet is however valuable, presenting as it does an array of evidence that must carry conviction to honest minds. Price 5 cents. For sale by the New England Tract Society, South Lancaster, Mass.
