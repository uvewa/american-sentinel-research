## CAST-OFF RAGS OF POPERY.

[N. Y. Sun, Aug. 11, 1895.]

The strict observance of the Lord's Day as the successor to the Jewish Sabbath is a Roman Catholic peculiarity which Protestants have retained. Indeed, when Rome, after the fourteenth century, began to relax the severity of the regulations she had previously enforced, forbidding not only servile work but amusement on Sunday, the Puritans of King James's time adopted them without modification. No doubt it would horrify our straitlaced Sabbaterians to be told that their pet ideas are but cast-off "rags of Popery," but so they are. There is not a blue law of the bluest dye that cannot be paralleled by the Sunday laws of the Roman Catholic rulers of England and of France from the sixth to the fifteenth century. Any one who doubts this may have his doubts removed by consulting Hessey's "Sunday" and Neal's "Feasts and Fasts."
