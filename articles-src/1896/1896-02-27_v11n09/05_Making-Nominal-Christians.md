# MAKING NOMINAL CHRISTIANS.

[Present Truth, London, England.]

A JAPANESE missionary, discussing the influence of missions in that country, says that the recent war with China has been the occasion of great changes in the general sentiment. Anxious to show that in their idea following the Lord does not in any wise hinder men from fighting and killing their neighbors, the natives professing Christianity distinguished themselves in the field, and the old do-like to "Christianity" has so "broken down that the whole army has been thrown open to Christian influences."

The missionary hopes that the Educational Department will be influenced to take the same course, in which case he sees a rosy future before Japan.

It would not then be impossible that Christianity might take on the form called political, in which the upper classes would profess it and thus hasten the day when Japan would become nominally a Christian nation.

It is plain that the same danger that is before the churches in professedly Christian nations is before missionaries in these great heathen lands which are coming under Western influences. It is the temptation to make Christians in some easier way than by the preaching of the Cross. The missionaries who first went to those lands had no arm of flesh to rely upon, and in the face of the keenest opposition of the powers that be they proved the higher power of the Cross of Christ. As the primitive church endured the opposition of the Roman world and grew under it, but fell before the friendship of that world, so now in these older mission fields a greater danger confronts the gospel than the hostility of earthly powers.

This growing dependence on political influence for doing a religious work is a sign of the times. It is at the root of the Sunday-law movement and all the religio-political controversies continually agitating churches and legislative bodies. It is a sign of a weakening hold on gospel principles here, as it is in Japan. Indeed, the missionary whom we quote says that the life of the Japanese churches is not seen in large additions, "nor in any special activity in creating a Christian literature." They "are suffering from the same world-causes that affect church attendance in our own land." This explains the readiness with which an easier way of making nominal professors is welcomed. It is one of the dreams of the last days that all the world is to be Christianized. The prophet predicted this in the words: "And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the Lord's house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it. And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the house of the God of Jacob." Isa. 2:2,3.

The "many people" make fair professions,—they will walk in the Lord's ways, and beat their swords into ploughshares, and learn war no more. But while the nominal profession is made, and they say one to another, "Come ye and do these things," we know from the Word that none of them will take the Lord's way, nor give up swords and spears, however much they may cry peace. The actual practice will be directly contrary to the profession and, as Joel says, the ploughshares will be turned into swords, until the coming of the Lord brings his wrath upon the angry nations.

When it is shown that the warning messages of Revelation 14 are directed against the principles of the Papacy, it is sometimes asked how that can be when these great Eastern nations are professedly non-Christian. Really, the principles of the Papacy are but borrowed from the Oriental religions, and there is a striking similarity in doctrines and practices. But aside from this, every year sees these countries brought nearer the formal recognition of nominal Christianity.

Nominal Christianity fused with pagan philosophy to make the papal religion. Now we see a like movement, by which Christianity is toned down to a mere philosophy, and it is considered a mark of breadth of view to be able to recognize points of contact between Christianity and the Oriental religions. A Sunday law passed in Korea at once leads religious journals to the conclusion that Korea is nearly a Christian country. Thus European Governments are made nominally Christian, and it perhaps not unreasonably supposed that the nations of the East will yet follow in the same way.

But it will be the work of the missionary with Christ's message to teach that no nominal profession can save from unrighteousness. All the governments may unite to make it easy for the people to be nominal Christians, but only in the preaching of the Cross, with its denial of self and its crucifixion unto the world, will be found the power that actually saves from sin. And the world will always make it as difficult as possible to be this kind of Christian.
