# HAS GEORGIA RELIGIOUS LIBERTY?

[Rev. E. T. Hiscox, D. D., of Mount Vernon, N. Y., in Christian Index, Atlanta, Georgia, Jan. 16, 1896. The Index is the organ of the Baptist denomination in Georgia. Dr. Hiscox is a well-known Baptist minister and author.]

DONS religious liberty exist in the State of Georgia? Yes; to a certain extent. To a considerable extent. But not fully. This may be a surprising statement to many of the citizens of that most noble and excellent State. Toleration generally prevails, but not universally. For while the Seventh-day Adventists are arrested, fined, and imprisoned for doing secular work on Sunday, the State assumes dictation in matters of conscience and religion, with which questions it has no right to meddle. And while the State makes laws to compel the observance of a Sunday sabbath, and to punish by civil penalties all who do any secular work on that day, it violates its own bill of rights as well as the Constitution of the United States, and the moral sense of the civilized world. And such laws should be universally reprobated. Those who observe Sunday as a day of rest and worship, have a right to be protected by law in the peaceable enjoyment of the day. If the Adventists do disturb them, they are amenable to law as disturbers of the peace. So have the Adventists and Jews the same right to be protected by law in the observance of Saturday as a Sabbath. As the Sabbath is a religious institution, each man is to decide for himself which is his sabbath, a question which the State has no right to determine for any citizen, any more than which church he shall attend, or to what Sunday schools his children shall go.

The persecution of these Adventists by several of the Southern States, notably Tennessee, Arkansas, Maryland, Missouri, and Georgia, is a shame and a disgrace to our so-called Christian civilization. It is persecution for conscience' sake, pure and simple; and would not surprise us did it occur in Russia. All right-minded people must, deplore and condemn it, especially Baptists, who recall the hardships of their fathers two and a half centuries ago,—Roger Williams, Obadiah Holmes, John Clark and others in New England and Virginia.

I am not one of the Adventists, nor have I any personal knowledge of them, but my information comes from court records of their trials in those various States, and other authenticated documentary evidence. But who shall suffer for his religion's sake, be he Baptist, Jew, Mohammedan, or pagan, and I burn not, so long as he practices his religion without abridging or disturbing the equal rights of others?

More of these cases have occurred in Tennessee perhaps than in any other State, and but few in Georgia. In Arkansas they have been quite numerous.

Judge Parks, of Tennessee, before whom many cases were brought for trial, while sentencing them to fines and imprisonment, expressed his regret at being compelled by his oath of office to do it, and declared the men good neighbors, most peaceable and worthy citizens, with no fault, except that they were proven to have done some work on Sunday, which they acknowledged, but which the law forbade them to do. Other judges and other records have given like testimony. Their Sunday working consisted in one case of setting out strawberry plants; in another of hoeing in the field; in another of hauling wood for the fire; in another of helping a poor widow without compensation. Nobody was disturbed, and these acts for the most part were away from public notice, and were sought out by the complainants. At the same time no notice was taken of saloons running contrary to law; of rail trains and steam boats running for excursions or ordinary traffic, doing secular work on Sunday; of furnaces and factories operating with thousands of men, violating the State statutes, without question or restraint. All the force of unjust legislation and spiteful informers has been evoked against a harmless and devout people, whose only crime is that they observe Saturday as the Sabbath, according to the higher law, as they understand it, and go quietly about their secular duties on Sunday as we do on Monday.

Dr. Hawthorne said, at Saratoga, in May last, when a resolution condemnatory of this kind of persecution was under discussion before the Baptist Publication Society, if such things should be done in Georgia, they would hear from three hundred thousand Baptists in that State. Well, my dear doctor, just such a thing has been done in Georgia, but they have not yet heard from the three hundred thousand Baptists. Strictly speaking, according to the last year book, Georgia has 367,498 Baptist church members, with 2692 Baptist ministers. Surely enough to make their influence felt against unrighteous legislation, and for the repeal of unjust and oppressive laws. But they have not been heard from on this behalf, perhaps for the want of such a leader as Dr. Hawthorne has shown himself to be in the other fields of reform.

Now this is what happened in the great State of Georgia only about a week before that discussion in Saratoga: On May 15, Mr. J. Q. Allison, a Seventh-day Adventist, was tried before the circuit court at Douglasville, in Douglas county, for "sabbath breaking," and sentenced to pay costs amounting to $22.05, or in default of payment to serve twelve months in the chain-gang, Judge Janes presiding. The offense for which Mr. Allison was tried and convicted was plowing in the field, the amount of the plowing being "a small garden spot," as appears from the

testimony before the courts. No one was annoyed or disturbed by the plowing, but the act violated the statute. The State had fixed by statutes a sabbath and attempted to compel its observance by the enforcement of civil penalties.

Now a sabbath is a religious institution and when a State decrees religious institutions, and attempts to compel conformity, it violates and nullifies its own constitution, and the Constitution of the United States, both of which guarantee religious liberty to all the people, and forbid legislation on matters of religion. As to Mr. Allison, the judge pronounced him a worthy and estimable man, with nothing against him, save this charge of plowing on Sunday. The judge, however, told the defendant that he would let him off easy this time, by simply paying the costs; but if he came before him again, he would not fare so well. The costs, or the chain-gang! And further advised him that if he could not obey the laws, he had better move out of the State.*

A letter received by a New York journal from a gentlemen in Atlanta, Ga., late in June last, stated that a few days previous, he visited one of his brethren "in a loathesome prison, enclosed in an iron cage, with incendiaries, thieves and murderers, awaiting their departure for the chain-gang. He had done some work on Sunday, having observed Saturday as his Sabbath." The clerk of the court told him he had lived neighbor to this condemned man for years and there was not a better man in the county. The sheriff declared him to be a good man. After prayer together they parted. It is to be noted that in all the other States where these harsh laws exist against the Seventh-day Baptists, the informers against them are almost invariably professing Christians, and not infidels, nor drunkards, nor pagans; quite frequently ministers of the gospel. In one case at least, shame to say, a Baptist minister, who probably never heard of Baptists being persecuted for conscience' sake. They of all others should "remember those in bonds as bound with them." Of the hundreds of thousands of the Baptist faith in Georgia, there are not a few who occupy high and influential positions in the State. It would be strange if they did not strive to remove this foul stain of religious persecution from the record of so noble a commonwealth.

*Mr. Allison did not pay the costs, and the sheriff started with him to Atlanta to put him in the chain-gang. He was released, however, en route, an unknown friend having settled the costs without his knowledge.—Ed. SENTINEL.
