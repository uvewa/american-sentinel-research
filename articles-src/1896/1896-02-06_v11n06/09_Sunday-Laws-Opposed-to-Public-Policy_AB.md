# SUNDAY "LAWS" OPPOSED TO PUBLIC POLICY.

[By Addison Blakely, Ph.D., Lecturer in Political Science and History, University of Chicago.]

ANYONE who has observed the recent contests in reference to compulsory idleness on Sunday in the various States will readily admit that it has a very disquieting effect upon the peace of the community. From the time that the Sunday question entered actively into the political arena in California fifteen years ago, until to-day, the attempted enforcement of Sunday rest has stirred up ill feelings in every place where attempts have been made to force it on the community. In California the question of the constitutionality of the Sunday statute came before the Supreme Court in 1882. By a majority of one vote the "law" was upheld, and an attempt was made throughout the State to enforce it.

The decision of the majority of the court, however, was not approved by the people of the State, but in order to test the question thoroughly it was made the political issue of the elections of 1883. One of the political parties espoused the "law," while the other declared it to be unconstitutional and opposed to public policy. As a result, Sunday statutes or no Sunday statutes was the question of the hour. Sunday legislation was argued by the press in all its bearings, and the question probably had never been so thoroughly canvassed and its nature so well understood by the public before. The party opposing the law on the ground that it was contrary to our constitutions and fundamental law was successful in the election—successful, too, for the first time in many years—and the opposition to Sunday legislation of any kind was victorious. As a consequence the Sunday statute was immediately repealed.

In Arkansas, a few years later, the clause exempting observers of the seventh day from the penalties imposed upon violators of the Sunday statutes was repealed. Almost immediately persecution sprang up in different parts of the State, and the prosecutors went so far as to arrest a minister of the gospel, who believed in the observance of the seventh day as the Sabbath.

Of these prosecutions, Judge Williams, of Little Rock, formerly a judge of the Supreme Court of the State of Arkansas, said that this law was used so oppressively upon the seventh-day Sabbath Christians that "the Bar of the whole State was shocked." "The judges, as men and lawyers," he declared, "abhorred it." The Bar Association of the State of Arkansas condemned it likewise, declaring that "the system now in force, savoring as it does very much of religious persecution, is a relic of the Middle Ages when it was thought that men could be made orthodox by an act of Parliament."

Prominent citizens declared that the indictments were malicious in their character and without provocation, and were more for the purpose of religious persecution than proper enforcement of law. In moving for the repeal of the statute, Senator Crockett said:—

"Sir, I take shame to myself as a member of the General Assembly of 1885, which repealed the act of religious protection which this bill is intended to restore. It was hasty and ill-advised legislation, and, like all such, has been only productive of oppressive persecution upon many of our best citizens, and of shame to the fair fame of our young and glorious State. Wrong in conception, it has proved infamous in execution and under it such ill deeds and foul oppressions have been perpetrated upon an unoffensive class of free American citizens in Arkansas for conscience' sake, as should mantel the cheek of every lover of his State and country with indignant shame."

The recent persecutions in Tennessee, Georgia and elsewhere are still fresh in the minds of the SENTINEL'S readers. With all this evidence before one, there can be no question whatever that the attempted enforcement of statutes designed to protect certain religious views are clearly opposed to the public good, and serve no purpose whatever except the venting of petty spite by the more narrow-minded portion of our citizens.

Nor is this result at all surprising. It is only what would be expected when there is an attempt to solve religious questions by the power of the State. These very results were pointed out by Congress sixty years ago, when the national legislature refused to interfere in the question of Sunday observance at the request of the numerous petitions that were sent in by that body.

"From the earliest period of time," declared the Congress of the United States, "religious teachers have attained great ascendency over the minds of the people; and in every nation, ancient and modern, whether pagan, Mahometaic or Christian, have succeeded in the incorporation of their religious tenets with the political institutions of their country. The Persian idols, the Grecian oracles, the Roman anguries, and the modern priesthood of Europe, have all, in their turn, been the subject of popular adulation, and the agents of political deception. If the measure recommended should be adopted, it would be difficult for human sagacity to foresee how rapid would be the succession, or how numerous the train of measures which follow, involving the dearest rights of all—the rights of conscience."

It would seem that these facts ought to be sufficient to convince people generally that it is better to keep religious questions out of politics. Religious institutions, if beneficient, are abundantly able to stand upon their own foundations without any assistance of law. The power of true religion is spiritual force. The power of false religion is physical force. Any religion or religious institution that asks the aid of the State is, to that extent at least, a false religion. All attempts, therefore, to enforce any religious doctrine or institution is opposed to the public good, and should be set aside by the courts accordingly.

Any law which tends to engender strife among peaceable citizens, and to bring discord and controversy where order would otherwise be, is opposed to public policy. The general welfare demands that laws shall promote peace and good order in society; and when they defeat this end they are opposed to the fundamental principles upon which government is founded, and for that reason the courts are abundantly justified in setting them aside as opposed to good order and the general welfare of the community. These laws are clearly opposed to the well-defined constitutional provisions in the various states, but even in the absence of such provision, they would still be void, as tending to disrupt and disorganize the peace of the body politic.
