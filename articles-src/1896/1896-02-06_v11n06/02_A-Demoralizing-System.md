## A DEMORALIZING SYSTEM.

The American Sentinel does not hold that it is the duty of government to teach morals in the proper acceptation of that term. But while this is true it is certainly the duty of government not to foster immorality by putting a premium upon those things which are demoralizing.

We are living in an era of "reform" when the "better classes" are demanding "decent municipal government."

New York City has been living under a "reform" regime for something over a year, and much good has certainly been accomplished; and for this all good citizens ought to be thankful. But while some good has been done not a little evil has likewise resulted.

The zeal of the police authorities to execute the excise and Sunday statutes has led them to act that are more demoralizing than the things they have sought to suppress.

A few facts will illustrate this matter. As recorded in these columns a few weeks ago, a policeman, zealous for "reform," and incidentally for promotion, went into a tobaccoist's where cigars were sold from one counter and stationery from the other. The "law" permits the sale of manufactured tobacco on Sunday, but does not permit the sale of paper or other stationery. This officer professed to be very anxious to write a letter, and induced the clerk to sell him a sheet of paper and an envelope for three cents, and then arrested the young man and dragged him off to the police station for violating the Sunday law!

Another police spy secured admittance to a small store on Sunday, and by representing to the proprietor that his wife was without a pair of stockings to go to meeting, as she happened to have none clean, induced the tradesman to sell him a pair of hose. Of course the accommodating merchant was arrested.

These particular arrests were made some time ago, but they are only samples of cases that are occurring all the time. No longer ago than the small hours of the morning of the 26th ult., a policeman, disguised as a sewer workman, with rubber hip boots, an old son'wester, and a dirty rubber coat, induced a watchman to let him have a drink of whiskey from his private flask, and finally to sell it to him, on the ground that he was sick and suffering from a chill and stood very much in need of the stimulant. No sooner was the transaction finished than the watchman was arrested on the double charge of giving away liquor and of selling it contrary to law.

The American Sentinel has no sympathy whatever with the liquor traffic nor with the use of intoxicating liquors as a beverage. Nor have we any sympathy with the idea that a man needs whiskey because he chances to feel a little cold. Nine times out of ten a cup of hot water or a little lively exercise would do much more good. But the question of the man's real need does not enter into this case. Whiskey is supposed by many to be a panacea for nearly all the small ills and discourlors incident to humanity; and it is certain that this sale of liquor was made by this watchman not with any intent to violate any law, but only at the earnest solicitation of a "man" who represented himself as being in a suffering condition.

The watchman was held for trial for violation of the law! The disguised policeman ought to be discharged in disgrace from the force. The man who induces another to commit crime is himself a criminal; if not always in the eyes of the law, he certainly is in fact and in justice; and a guardian of the peace who will stoop to such means to "detect" crime in order that he may arrest the "criminal" is certainly not a man to be trusted to guard the lives and property of the people. Such work is more demoralizing than would be the real crime which the law is designed to prevent.

One of the worst features about this latter case, is that the officer is said to be quite "pious." And as this procurer of "crime" professes faith in the Bible, we earnestly commend to his attention the text which says, "All liars shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death." And also that other text, which, describing the New Jerusalem, the city of the redeemed, says: "There shall in no wise enter into it anything that defileth, neither whatsoever worketh abomination, or maketh a lie."

The New York police force cannot be purged of such creatures too soon, nor will the civil atmosphere be fit for honest men to breathe until the system which puts a premium upon such "detective" work has given place to one which will tend to preserve the self-respect and manhood of the guardians of the peace.
