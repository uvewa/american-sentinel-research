# NATIONAL REFORM INCONSISTENCY.

The Christian Statesman, which is a most persistent champion of legislation for the enforcement of Sunday observance, is out in its issue of January 11, with severe strictures on Romanism. It quotes from other sources, and charges that "Pope Leo is at one time saying 'white,' and at another 'black.' It is the same Jesuitical policy in Europe as in America," etc. Now our chief objection to this language on the part of the Statesman is its inconsistency. One cardinal principle of the Roman Catholic church is the union of Church and State. Our ever watchful contemporary, the Statesman, adopts the Catholic's Sunday as the sabbath, rejects the only Sabbath of divine appointment, and then unites with the Roman Catholics in an attempt to enforce its observance through religious legislation which commits the government to this Catholic measure. This appears to us like decidedly crafty scheming in a line that is well pleasing to the very body against which the Statesman professes so much hostility. Pilot and Herod were once made friends for a very unworthy purpose. Can the Statesman see any parallel in that, and its own coalition with the "Jesuitical policy" of those whom it one day courts and the next day 'curses'?—Sabbath Recorder.
