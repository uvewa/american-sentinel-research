# THE AMBITION OF ROME.

According to the Catholic Universe, speaking of his mission to non-Catholics, "Father" Elliott said, Dec. 13, 1895:—

God has made this nation an arena of religious controversy. Here he has thrown a vast number of his children into civic fellowship in order that they may reestablish among themselves religious fellowship.

No man knows the joy of being a Catholic till he has made some one else a Catholic.

To be broad-minded is a characteristic trait of the one international religion, and to share our good heritage with all our brethren—Jews and Greeks, bond and free—is Catholic generosity. The time is ripe and the opportunity has arrived for the development of the apostolic element in the American Church, nor shall we long lack the men to do the good work of converting America. No greater thanks to God can ever be offered by hearts grateful for many favors than to extend the kingdom of his Son until it embraces the newest and most splendid of the nations of the world.

There is but one way to prevent the realization of this "dream," and that is by the power of the gospel. The same power that nearly four hundred years ago struck the popish fetters from half of Europe is sufficient to-day to withstand the assaults of Rome on this continent. Will the people give it free course?
