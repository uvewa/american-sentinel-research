## WHAT IS FAITH IN JESUS CHRIST?

BY CHAS. F. WILCOX.

The professed Christian world seem to be making one general move toward honoring Christ. Each denomination is vieing with all others to do him the most honor. Some choose one way, and some another. But under whatever name, all claim to have one object, and that is that Christ shall be exalted. In view of this, is it not appropriate that we seek the reason for this, and ask in what manner it can be properly done?

Faith is the foundation of all action. Man's effort is put forth for that in which he has confidence, based upon evidence. Christ has represented himself to the world as the only hope for mankind. Those who accept him act in harmony with his instructions, and thus he controls their lives to a greater or less extent.

Through confidence in the life and experience of Christ, through a study of the lessons he has left on record, man becomes educated in reference to his claims. If he has confidence or faith in these claims of Christ, he is guided by the principles and teachings of Christ, and his life will testify to the world that he is a disciple of Christ.

Now the question, Is the move to exalt Christ through an expression on the part of nations, as such, in harmony with his teaching? Unless it is, can it be said to be actuated by faith? and if it is not of faith, what is it? "Whatsoever is not of faith is sin." Then any move to exalt Christ, that is not based on a "thus saith the Lord," can be nothing but sin, for where there is no word of Christ, there can be no faith in his word.

Christ has said positively that his kingdom is not of this world. John 18:36. This positive statement should forever silence him who would do honor to Christ by giving him an earthly throne. To believe Christ's word is to have faith in him. And faith in this word will lead to obedience, and obedience will never cause one to seek to do that which Christ has said should never be done.

Faith in Christ will lead to a humble opinion of our own knowledge as compared with that of Christ. Whatever he says will be agreed to, whether understood or not. His word giveth light and when gladly received, it illumines the mind, and ere one is aware, he understands facts and truths that were obscure.

To-day the world is filled with popular denominations, popular churches, and popular preachers. Has faith in Jesus Christ built all these up to their present position? Is the good will of the world toward them an evidence that they have "the faith once delivered unto the sañats"? The word of Christ to his followers is, "Ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake." Again he says, "Woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of you." From these words it is evident that the true followers of Christ will not be considered the friends of the world. Like their Master, they will rebuke sin by holy lives, and this testimony against iniquity evil men will seek to silence.

Faith in Christ asks, Is this the way of the Lord? and then humbly walks in it. The popular cry is, The great majority think so, and I will go that way too. Faith in Christ may bring sorrow and trial now, but by and by it will give joy. The majority may laugh now at the simplicity of the true Christian, but their laughter will soon give place to bitter lamentation.

Faith in Christ does not lead any church to do contrary to the express word of Him who came to speak the words of life. So he who is connected with any body that is doing anything for which they have not the plain instruction of Christ, may be sure that in that thing they are not acting through faith in him. Many true and sound principles may be cherished and obeyed, but in the single particular wherein there is a deviation from right and truth, lies a grave danger. The only way to escape is to cast aside the false principle, accept the truth, and thus walk in the light as God is in the light.

In the strife for the highest place, for the largest honors, for the greatest power, true faith takes no part. Simple faith in Christ works by love, and this love is toward the Father and the Son, and seeks to uplift every soul for whom Christ died. It moves to obedience, for working by love it must express itself by the works of love, and this is to keep the commandments of God. John says: "This is the love of God, that we keep his commandments; and his commandments are not grievous." We may therefore know that the voice, be it from preacher, or church, or denomination, that says, the law of God is changed or done away, does not love God, hence shows no faith in Christ, and should not be followed.

He who would exercise faith in Christ must stand against the world and overcome it. Its applause is not sought after. Like the Master, the man of faith can wait for the glory that is to be revealed by and by. Join not the majority, but follow Christ and have faith in his word, which is faith in him.
