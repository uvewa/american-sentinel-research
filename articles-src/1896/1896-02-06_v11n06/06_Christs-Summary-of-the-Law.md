# CHRIST'S SUMMARY OF THE LAW.

CHRIST'S summary of the ten commandments does not indicate his indifference to the Sabbath. In that summary he brings out the highest reason why men should keep these commandments. Whoso loves God with all his heart will keep all the first table of the Decalogue, including the fourth; whoso loves his neighbor as himself, will keep all those commandments which regulate the relations between men. Laws are itensified rather than abrogated by being thus summarized, and lifted from the low ground of slavish obedience to the high lands of delightful service through love.

In this connection we must note a position which has been assumed by some. It is this: "God blesses his people in their worship on Sunday, and blesses the preaching of his Word on that day, therefore Sunday keeping is right." This claim is both weak and deceptive. God does not rebuke error nor punish disobedience, extulantly, nor by immediate judgments. He sendeth rain and sunshine on the evil and the good, the just and the unjust, alike. The Word goes on its mission with the power of truth, whenever or however proclaimed. Those who preach the word faithfully on Wednesday find it blessed as much as on Sunday. Neither does God refuse to bless devout worship even though it be mingled with much of error. A sordid ritualistic view of the Sabbath, or Sunday, or any other day, is on a level with the Jewish formalism which Christ condemned. Mormonism and Communism both shout their theories to crowds on Sunday, and their theories are received, and they increase, to the shame and peril of the land. Is it therefore right for them to thus observe Sunday? Sunday as a day of leisure is the harvest day of the runseller. Is it, therefore, right for him to thus devote Sunday? Financially, he is greatly blessed on every Sunday; so are Sunday newspapers and Sunday trains. Men could not resort to such pleas in support of Sunday if they were not conscious that the claims of the Sabbath cannot be fairly answered. These good brethren dodge the issue because they cannot meet it.—A. H. Lewis, D. D.
