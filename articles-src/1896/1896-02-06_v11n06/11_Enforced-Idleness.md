## ENFORCED IDLENESS.

A BILL recently introduced in the legislature of the province of Buenos Ayres, South America, provides that "in the territory of the province, besides Sunday, only the following days shall be feast days: 1st of January, 25th of May, 9th of July, Christmas, and Good Friday." While the intent of the bill, it seems, is to enforce labor on all the Catholic feast days excepting those named, and is therefore regarded unfavorably by many Catholics, the Protestants are objecting to it on the ground that the State has no right to require a cessation of work on any church feast days, and that enforced idleness is a great source of crime any war. These objections are valid, and we would that all Protestants were consistent enough to hold to them and not violate the principles involved in them by asking the State to compel men to observe the church festival of Sunday, and to enforce idleness on that day. Enforced idleness works the same on Sunday as on "Good Friday." Both are church festival days, ordained by the same church, one in honor of the crucifixion, and the other in honor of the resurrection of Christ, and neither by any command of God.
