**BOUND VOLUMES.**

We still have on hand a few bound volumes of the AMERICAN SENTINEL for the year 1895, which we will send to any address in the Postal Union on receipt of $1.50 for the Manilla binding, or $2.50 for cloth binding with leather back and corners.

The matter in this volume is second to none which has appeared in the columns of the AMERICAN SENTINEL. It covers a wide range of subjects, and touches every phase of the religious liberty question.

"Nine Years' Experience," a review of the National Reform movement in all its phases from its inception until the beginning of 1895, and the articles upon the Papacy and Papal Infallibility, The Real Presence, and The Immaculate Conception, together with our numerous illustrated numbers, make this volume one of exceptional value. Do not fail to order soon if you want one of these volumes.
