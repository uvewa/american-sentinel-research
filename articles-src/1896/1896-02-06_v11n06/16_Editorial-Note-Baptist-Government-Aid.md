A correspondent, writing from Ceresco, Mich., asks us to state the facts in regard to Baptists having received government aid for their denominational schools. The Baptists never received any aid, so far as we know, for Indian schools, but they did receive aid under a contract with Henry L. Morehouse, of this city, Secretary of the American Baptist Home Missionary Society, for the support of schools for the Freedmen of the Choctaw and Chickasaw Indians in the Indian Territory.

In a letter to Mr. Allen Moon, President of the International Religious Liberty Association, under date of Sept. 12, 1894, Hon. Frank C. Armstrong, Assistant Commissioner of Indian Affairs, gives the following dates and amounts:—

In 1879, six day schools at $875 for six months.
In 1882, one boarding school and eight day schools at $2,250.
In 1883, one boarding school and eight day schools at $2,750.
In 1884, four day schools at $700; and again in the same year, for six schools at $1,500.

These we believe to be the facts in regard to this matter, as anyone can learn by writing to the Office of Indian Affairs, Washington, D. C., and mentioning Mr. Armstrong's letter of the date given above.
