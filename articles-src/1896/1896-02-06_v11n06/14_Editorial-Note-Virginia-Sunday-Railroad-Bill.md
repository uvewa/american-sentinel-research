Mr. Charles T. Bland, of the Virginia Legislature, has introduced a bill "to prohibit railroad and steamboat companies from loading and unloading freight on Sunday, and also from running trains or boats, except such as shall be run for carrying passengers or mails. The text of the bill is as follows:—

Be it enacted by the General Assembly of Virginia, That no railroad company shall permit the loading or unloading of any freight car on Sunday, nor shall permit any car, train of cars or locomotive to be run on Sunday on any railroad except such as may be run for the purpose of transporting the United States mail, either with or without passengers, and except such as shall be run for carrying passengers exclusively, and the same restrictions shall apply to steam boats; provided that the word Sunday, as it appears here, shall be construed to embrace only that portion of the day between sunrise and sunset; and that trains and steamboats in transit, having started on Saturday, may, in order to reach the terminus and shops, run until 9 o'clock A. M. on Sunday, but no later, nor for any other purpose but to reach the terminus and shops. And any railroad or steamboat company violating this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor in each county in which such car, train of cars, locomotive or steamboat shall run, or in which any such freight car or steamboat shall be loaded or unloaded, and upon conviction shall be fined not less than five hundred dollars for each offense; the fine when collected to be paid to the State Treasurer for the use of the public schools.

2. And be it further enacted, That all acts or parts of acts in conflict hereto be and are hereby repealed.

3. This act shall be in force from its passage.

We propose to give our readers very soon a review of the principles embraced in this bill, and also a history of the establishment of religions liberty in Virginia more than a century ago. This will be decidedly interesting in view of Mr. Bland's bill.
