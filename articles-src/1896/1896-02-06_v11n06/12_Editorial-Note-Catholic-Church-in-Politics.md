"The Rev. Peter York," says the Catholic Review, "is doing valiant service for the church by the printed word in the sterling Monitor and the daily press of San Francisco." And in support of its assertion, the Review quotes as follows from a recent article from the pen of Mr. York:—

Again let me assert that the Catholic Church is not in politics. She plants her feet firmly on the principle of the separation of Church and State, which is the foundation alone of our country's prosperity. Neither by her bishops, nor by her priests, nor by her laymen does she wish to interfere in national or local politics.

What a mistake the world has been making to be sure! Sixty-six times have the Jesuits been expelled from various countries for interfering in politics, but it must have been all a mistake! for does not Mr. York confess that "the church" does not "wish to interfere in national or local politics"?
