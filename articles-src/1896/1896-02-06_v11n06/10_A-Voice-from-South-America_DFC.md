# A VOICE FROM SOUTH AMERICA.

BY D. FRANCISCO CORTIS.

IN THE AMERICAN SENTINEL OF New York, under date of Nov. 28, 1895, I notice a request from the Catholic Review for light upon the laws of South American countries concerning religious liberty.

While I am not a Methodist, I am interested in religious liberty, and firmly believe that every man is responsible to God alone for his belief in matters of religion. Therefore, in the brief space allotted, I will try to let one ray of light shine upon this subject from the Republic of Colombia. The authority which I shall give is the constitution of the republic, as published in the scientific commentary of José Maria Samper, which is used as a text book in the law schools of the republic. The comments made upon these articles of the constitution are the accepted ideas and teachings on the subject under consideration. In article 38 we read:—

The Apostolic Roman Catholic religion is the one of the nation. The government shall protect and cause it to be respected as the essential element of social order. It being understood that the Catholic Church is not, nor shall be, the official church; it shall remain independent.

The understanding of this article is briefly stated thus: "The nation unquestionably declares its profession of the Apostolic Roman Catholic religion; and, because of this, the government shall protect and cause it to be respected. This protection and respect are inherent qualities due to that religion, it being the essential element of social order; and further, it being clearly understood that the Catholic Church is not, nor shall be, the official church, it shall retain its independence."

Only a glance at the foregoing will show any candid mind that there is no room left for a single principle of civil or religious liberty. Civil government exists for the purpose of maintaining "social order." The Catholic Church is declared to be the "essential" element in the social order of the republic; therefore it follows that any doctrine, idea, or principle not in accord with the doctrines, ideas and principles of that church, are productive of social disorder, and the State must suppress them in order to continue its own existence.

Tolerance is the only thing that can exist, but tolerance is in no sense liberty. Liberty is an inherent right of every individual intelligence in heaven above or in the earth beneath. They are all alike responsible alone to the Being who gave them existence, and to no State, Church, or other power, in things pertaining to religion. Therefore when the framers of the Constitution placed in it Article 39, which reads, "No one shall be molested because of his religious opinions, nor compelled by the authorities to profess beliefs nor observe practices contrary to his conscience;" it was with the idea that the said opinions, beliefs and practices should not conflict with those of the Catholic Church. They thus state their idea of religious liberty:—

There is a substantial difference between liberty of conscience and religious liberty. The first is founded in the very nature of man. God made him a religious being, and gave him a conscience so that he could know, love, obey and worship him. For man, a religious life is a necessity, the greatest of all needs. It is the fountain of all his strength and blessings. Such being man's nature, the government and laws to secure the best good must adjust themselves not only so as not to violate any one's conscience, but they must also respect all manifestations of that conscience, provided, these manifestations do not bring with them danger to social order.

Religious liberty can go, and ordinarily does go, very far. It can manifest itself by many external acts which both affect society and the State; it establishes one or many classes of worship; it can perpetuate and make itself energetically felt; it can found a religious power and consequently a religious regime. This is work, and not simply liberty of conscience. It is external, organized, acting religious power.

Note the fact. You can believe and think what you may, but action is prohibited. The reason assigned for it runs: "Because the first only affects the life and rights of the individual, while the second affects the mass of the people, and closely, the life and rights of the State." Now the republic of Colombia denies the right to teach any religion except the Catholic, to the people of the republic. This statement will be made more evident by the following:—

If in any people one religion predominates, this should be particularly respected, aided and protected. The duty of protecting religion rests in the binding obligations of morality, for it is impossible for an irreligious people to have good institutions and laws. Therefore the object of civil governments is to promote the welfare and happiness of the people; but it is impossible to do so if they are opposing them in their dearest desires. But should there exist at the same time so many different religions that it would be impossible to decide which is the popular or national religion, the injustice of that which would protect one to the detriment of the other is evident; or the monstrosity formed by giving them equal protection, as though all were the true, thus imparting the same official respect to the false as to the true.

The Catholic Church is so identified with the moral life of the people of Colombia, that it is impossible to protect them without protecting their religion. In this we see the necessity and justice of recognizing their religion and giving to their church the prerogatives that are rightfully hers. Among these are independence, authority, dignity and respect. Such being the situation, would it be consistent to give absolute religious liberty to other religions or churches, even though they were Christians? No; because religious liberty requires liberty of action in religious matters; but to permit the free exercise of this would be inflicting a deep wound on the feelings of the nation, and would also become the cause of frequent conflicts. Catholicism being universal in Colombia, this equality cannot be admitted. Injury is also done in contending, that the rarest dissenters in the republic should enjoy equal liberties and advantages with the Catholics who constitute the vast majority.

Such is the reason assigned for not recognizing liberty of worship in Colombia. Dissenters are only tolerated and respected as exceptions; tolerance there is only that in harmony with the laws, and in consequence of treaties made by Colombia with other nations. Again we quote:—

Thus, to our mind, is harmonized the two consisting rights: that of the immense majority of the Colombian people, whose church and worship is Catholic, and who should receive particular respect and protection, because it represents the conscience of that vast majority; the other, that of the few dissenters, who, as beings of a distinct religion, positive or negative, are conscientious in action, and must, in their respective spheres, equally receive the respect and protection of the laws in their persons and belief. The constitution does not protect these beliefs when in the form of a church, but respects them and tolerates their profession, protecting them from violence and tyranny.

From these quotations one might draw the conclusion that the argument is rather conflicting, yet it is as good as can be furnished in support of a union between the State and the Church. We might also conclude that in this we have the expression of the majority of the people concerning liberty in religious worship. But from my experience among the people I am persuaded that it does not represent the mind and feelings of the vast majority of the Colombians, but only of a small minority who have been accustomed to rule, and who, knowing that their power would soon vanish if freedom was allowed generally, have succeeded in bringing about the present arrangement of affairs so as to retain themselves in power. I believe that the majority of the people are inclined to be liberal in their views and actions when they can act for themselves.

Why is even toleration granted to the dissenters? This question receives its answer under the 40th Article, which reads as follows:—

All forms of worship are permitted which are not contrary to Christian morals and the laws.

Acts contrary to Christian morality or subversive of public order, performed in connection or under the pretext of the exercise of worship, shall be subject to the common law.

Now in the Catholic's mind there is no other true religion but the Catholic religion; therefore the propagation of religions which differ from Catholicism must be prohibited, because they are subversive of Christian morals and tend to overturn the public tranquility. That this is the way the last two articles are understood by the people is evident from the following, taken from the *El Telegrana*, of May 14th, 1895, and published in connection with the archbishop's circular of May 12th. It reads:—

The constitution imposes tolerance under Articles 39 and 40 in matters of religious worship, but there must be no confounding of the right to perform public worship with that of publicly proselyting. This we know they have done with individuals from among the poorer classes. The permitting of this is to nullify the 39th Article of the fundamental law of the republic.

This we know is the idea they have of the liberty given to those who may differ with them on religious subjects. This the reader can see by a short study of the three articles previously quoted. But why is even tolerance granted? For this we also have their reason, and it reads:—

They [the framers of the constitution] wished to advance the liberality of the nation, by permitting the exercise of all worship not contrary to Christian morals or the laws. And why does it take the form of a permission? Other religions not being free in their own right, and a diversity of worships, according to the minds of the Catholic being an evil, this evil being less than to have the dissenters practice no religion, they admitted this tolerance, under which they may practice their worship.

But this permission is not, nor could it be unconditional: on one hand, the foreign worship must not be contrary to Christian morality; and on the other, not in opposition to the laws. Why the first? Because the Colombian people being Christians, could not, nor can they permit, that which is not in harmony with Christian morality—the morality taught by Jesus Christ.

To this we might add, "as accepted and taught by the Catholic Church." The reader must ever keep in mind that no other ideas of morality or religion exists among the mass of the people but those of the Catholic religion. If the reader fails in doing this he cannot comprehend the situation, religiously, as it exists in Colombia.

And why the second? "Because the legislator may find in the future principles or practices in the worship of the dissenters that which may be immoral, and cause damage to the nation." Mr. Samper then adds: "This makes sure the liberty of the Catholic Church." I agree with him. The church has been made as secure as she could well be, and the tolerance and rights of the one who might disagree with her as small as possible. If I were to judge from the sayings and actions of the past year, I would conclude that the little tolerance which is now accorded would be gladly withdrawn if a way were seen in which the probable complications that might arise with other nations could be disposed of. The writer trusts that the above may afford one ray of light for the party who asked for light from South America.
