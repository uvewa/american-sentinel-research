JANUARY 23 Ira T. Babcock of Lego, Guilford Co., N. C., was arraigned before a Justice of the Peace for cutting weeds and doing other similar work on Sunday, the 12th day of January, upon his father's farm near that place. He was required to give bond in the sum of $200 to answer before the Circuit Court at Greensboro on the 17th inst.

Mr. Babcock is a Seventh-day Adventist in faith, though not a member of the church.

The Sunday "law" of North Carolina exempts persons from arrest on Sunday; provides that any act required to be done in a certain number of days shall not be required to be done upon the date named if it be Sunday. Hunting "with a dog or dogs," and carrying "a shotgun, rifle, or pistol" on Sunday is prohibited under penalty of a fine not to exceed $50. Fishing "on Sunday with a seine, drag net, or other kind of net, except such as are fastened to stakes," is prohibited under penalty from $200 to $500, or "imprisonment not more than twelve months." Selling intoxicating liquors on Sunday except "on a prescription of a physician, and then only for medical purposes" is prohibited and is punishable "by fine or imprisonment or both in the discretion of the court." The loading and unloading of freight is prohibited on Sunday as is also the running of any locomotive or cars "except such as may be run for the purpose of transporting the United States mails either with or without passengers," etc. But so far as we have been able to ascertain by examination of the statutes, there is nothing in the Code of North Carolina that prohibits ordinary labor on Sunday; but the courts of that State may be able to find some hitherto obsolete statute that can be made to apply in the present case. If we mistake not we have heard that a "law" of this kind imposing a fine of one dollar for Sunday work does exist in North Carolina.
