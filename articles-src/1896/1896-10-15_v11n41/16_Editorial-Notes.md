NEW YORK, OCTOBER 15, 1896.

NEW YORK, OCTOBER 15, 1896.

ITY ANY ONE receiving the American Sentinel without having ordered it may know that it is sent to him by some friend. Therefore, those who have not ordered the SENTINEL need have no fears that they will be asked to pay for it.

ITY NOW SEEMS LIKELY THAT GENERAL WEYLER WILL BE RECALLED FROM CUBA AND THAT GENERAL CAMPOS WILL BE AGAIN PLACED IN COMMAND. IT IS TO BE HOPED THAT THIS WILL BE DONE AS IT WOULD CERTAINLY BE IN THE INTERESTS OF HUMANITY. WEYLER'S ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN A DISGRACE TO CIVILIZATION.

WITH UTRAMONTANISM AGAIN IN THE SADDLE IN THIS COUNTRY IT WOULD SEEM THAT IT SHOULD BE NO DIFFICULT TASK TO CONVINCE PROTESTANTS THAT "ROME NEVER CHANGES." IN THIS CONNECTION OUR FIRST PAGE ARTICLE, THOUGH YOU BRIEF TO BE MORE THAN SUGGESTIVE, WILL BE FOUND NOT DEVOID OF INTEREST.

IT IS NOW THOUGHT THAT AN UNDERSTANDING CONCERNING THE EASTERN QUESTION HAS BEEN ARRIVED AT BY THE POWERS OF EUROPE. IN THE EVENT OF ACTIVE MEASURES BEING NECESSARY THEIR EXECUTION WILL, IT IS SAID, BE ENTRUSTED TO GREAT BRITAIN, FRANCE, AND RUSSIA. BUT AT BEST ANY SETTLEMENT SHORT OF THE DESTRUCTION OF THE WHOLE OTTOMAN POWER CAN BE ONLY TEMPORARY; FOR THE SCRIPTURES PLAINLY DECLARE: "HE SHALL COME TO HIS END AND NONE SHALL HELP HIM."

"NO BUSINESS TRANSACTED ON SUNDAY," WAS THE DECREE PROMULGATED BY THE CHIEF MANAGER OF THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CAMPAIGN AT ITS OUTSET AFTER THE NOMINATION OF CANDIDATES AT THE ST. LOUIS CONVENTION; AND IN HARMONY WITH THIS PRONOUNCEMENT THE NATIONAL HEADQUARTERS AT CHICAGO WERE CLOSED ON THAT DAY. UNDER THE PRESSURE OF WORK WHICH THE CAMPAIGN HAS DEVELOPED, HOWEVER; IT WAS THOUGHT BEST BY THE SAID MANAGER TO HOLD A MEETING WITH SOME OF HIS LEADING POLITICAL ASSOCIATES IN THE EAST, SUNDAY, OCTOBER 4, AT THE FIFTH AVENUE HOTEL IN NEW YORK, FOR THE PURPOSE OF CONSIDERING THE ASPECT OF AFFAIRS IN THE "DOUBTFUL" STATES OF THE MIDDLE WEST.

THE NEW YORK SUN, OF OCTOBER 1, REPORTS TWO RECENT EXHIBITIONS OF RELIGIOUS INDIERANCE IN CITIES OF SPANISH AMERICA. IN AGUAS CALIENTES, MEXICO, SEPTEMBER 15, A MOB ATTACKED THE PRESbyterian Church, NEARLY Wrecking the structure, AFTER WHICH THEY STONED THE WINDOWS OF THE MINISTER'S RESIDENCE, BUT WERE PREVENTED BY THE AUTHORITIES FROM DOING FURTHER MISCHIEF. IN CUZCO, PARM, MORE RECENTLY, A MOB COLLECTED FOR THE PURPOSE OF ATTACKING AN AMERICAN PROTESTANT MISSION, BUT WERE DISPERSED BY THE APPEARANCE OF THE PREFECT AT THE HEAD OF A BODY OF TROOPS. THUS WHILE THE IGNORANCE AND SUPERSTITUTION FOSTERED BY PRIESTLY RULE STILL PROMPT THE PEOPLE TO MANIFESTATIONS OF RELIGIOUS BIBLIOGRAPHY AND PROBABLY PACKED BY UNANIMOUS VOTE THE FOLLOWING RESOLUTIONS RELATIVE TO THE USE, ON SUNDAYS, OF THE FREE ZYMNASIUM JUST OPENED TO THE PUBLIC AT DOUGLAS PARK:

WHEREAS, THE WEST PARK COMMISSIONERS HAVE BY THEIR OFFICIAL ACT GIVEN PERMISSION TO THE TURNER'S ASSOCIATION AND ATHLETIC CILDS TO MAKE SUNDAY, OCTOBER 11, A SPECIAL DAY FOR DISPLAY AT SAID PUBLIC ZYMNASIUM IN SAID DOUGLAS PARK; THEREFORE,

RESPONDENT, THAT WE, THE CONGREGATIONAL MINISTERS OF CHICAGO AND VICINITY, IN MEETING ASSEMBLED AND BY OUR UNANIMOUS VOTE, DISAPPOINTED THEM OF THE PART COMMISIONERS IN THIS MATTER, AND DO HEREBY ENTER OUR PROTEST AGAINST THE USE OF OUR PUBLIC PARKS FOR GAMES AND SPORTING PURPOSES UPON THE LORD'S DAY:

RESPONDENT, THAT BY THIS ACT OF THE PARK COMMISSIONERS THEY ARE FEEDING THE FLAME OF IMMORALITY WHICH IS SPREADING OVER OUR CITY AND COUNTRY, AND THEREBY PROMATING OCCUPATION IN SOCIAL AND PUBLIC LIFE, WHICH ALREADY HINDERS THE ENFORCEMENT OF LAW IN OUR CITY, AND IS BECOMING A MENACE TO OUR NATIONAL LIFE, AND ARE ALONGING A MENACE TO OUR NATIONAL LIFE, AND ARE ALONGING AMES AND SPORTING PURPOSES UPON THE LORD'S DAY:

SO, THERE IS A WELL-KNOWN FACT THAT THERE EXISTS A WIDE DIFFERENCE OF OPINION UPON THESE QUESTIONS, AND IT IS THE DOCTRINE OF FUNDAMENTAL AMERICAN PRINCIPLES OF GOVERNMENT THAT EACH PERSON IS AT LIBERTY TO DECIDE FOR HIMSELF WHETHER HE SHALL REGARD THE FIRST DAY OF THE WEEK AS THE "HOLY SABBATH DAY" OR NOT, AND WHAT SHALL CONSTITUTE A PROPER OBSERVANCE OF THAT DAY, ANSWERABLE ONLY TO GOD AND SUBJECT ONLY TO THE AUTHORITY OF HIS WORD. BUT THIS CERICAL BODY SAYS, NOT SO; BUT WE WILL PRONOUNCE UPON THESE MATTERS AND ALL INDIVIDUALS ARE MORALLY BOUND TO DO AS WE SAY; AND WE CALL UPON THE CIVIL AUTHORITIES TO SEE THAT OUR DECISION IS DULY ENFORCED. SO SPEAKS THE AMERICAN PAPACY, IN EXACT IMITATION OF THAT ORDER PAPACY WHICH HAS ITS SEAT UPON THE BANKS OF THE TIBER. THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME THE AMERICAN PAPACY HAS SPOKEN, NOR ARE THE MEMBERS OF THIS CERICAL BODY OF CHICAGO ITS ONLY REPRESENTATIVES. IT IS FINDING THE LATTER IN ALL THE POPULAR CHURCHES, AND THE TIME IS FAST APPROACHING WHEN THE DECISIONS OF ITS COMPOSITE POPE WILL BE ENFORCED WITH TRUE PAPAL INDIERANCE UPON ALL CLASSES OF AMERICAN CITIZENS.

TWO RIOTS WERE CAUSED ON THE EAST SIDE ON THE 11TH INST., BY ATTEMPTS TO ENFORCE THE SUNDAY "LAW." REBECCA FREAM, AN EAST SIDE "MISSIONARY," WHO BELIEVES IN USING THE "LAW" OF THE LAND TO ENFORCE HER INTERPRETATION OF THE LAW OF GOD, CAUSED THE ARREST OF MISS FANNIE FAGER, WHO KEEPS A SMALL DRY GOODS STORE AT NO. 22 NORFOLK STREET. ON THE WAY TO THE STATION-HOUSE SHE WAS MOBbed BY A CROWD OF MEN AND BOYS AND WOULD HAVE BEEN ROUGHLY USED HAD NOT SEVERAL POLICEMEN COME TO HER RESCUE.

THE OTHER RIST WAS CAUSED BY AN ATTEMPT TO ARREST A YOUNG MAN FOUND BEHIND THE COUNTER IN ANOTHER STORE. HIS FRIENDS CAME TO THE RESCUE, AND THE OFFICER WAS ROUGHLY USED. THE YOUNG MAN ESCAPED, BUT SEVERAL OF HIS FRIENDS WERE ARRESTED.

IN ITS ISSUE OF THE 12TH INST., THE NEW YORK HERALD SAYS EDITORIALLY THAT IN IRELAND "ENGLISH HAS AN ARMENIA OF HER OWN." "THERE IS," SAYS THE HERALD, "PERHAPS NOTHING CONCEIVABLE THAT IS MORE RIDICULOUS THAN ENGLAND TALKING ABOUT THE ATROCITIES OF ARMENIA AND CONVENIENTLY FORGETTING THE NAMELESS AND NUMBERLESS ATROCITIES OF WHICH SHE HAS HERSELF BEEN GUILTY IN IRELAND."
