### THE WORLD COMPETING WITH THE CHURCH.

The inroads of the bicycle "craze" upon Sunday attendance at church service is a matter which agitates the minds of many clergymen, and draws from them many complaints, if we may believe what is reported. A writer in the Christian Statesman, of September 26, says that the clergy "are sorely perplexed in trying to get something more lively in their sermons than the dazzling, half-flying steed of steel. But flights of rhetoric," he continues, "are nothing to it, and excursions into scientific objections to Christianity are sleepy beside the thrilling wheel. Not even an almost swearing sermon against the Chicago Democratic platform is now sufficient" for the purpose.

Would it not be well for the clergy to pause and consider whether this effort to compete with the attractions of the world is in the line of the gospel commission which they are supposed to be carrying into execution? May not one great reason for non-attendance at church services be found in the nature of the sermons which are commonly preached? If successful preaching be a matter of competing with the worldly attractions furnished in this age of excitement and invention, then the popular sermonizing of the day is in the right direction; but a serious doubt must be felt respecting the ability of any preacher to achieve success in this line. It must be evident that in the matter of giving apice and variety to the church service, and in devising attractions to win the support of the people for church work, the limit has been about reached. Soon it will be necessary to find some means to corral the people in the churches on Sundays in order to make sure of good-sized congregations.

But the truth is that the Saviour has not sent forth his representatives to compete with the world in furnishing that which will attract and please the senses. The gospel of God was not made dependent for its success upon any such means. There is a power in that gospel which no worldly device or attraction can possibly have, and by this power the gospel is to appeal to men. It is "the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth." Rom. 1:16. It is the power of the word of the Creator. There is a power and an attraction in the word of the living God which the world knows nothing of. Let that word be presented as God has spoken it,—"quick [living] and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword," "sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb,"—and the question of means to maintain church attendance need never demand attention. It is now just as it was in the early centuries after the "falling away" from the truth of which the Apostle Paul spoke, when the church leaders complained that they could not compete with the attractions of the world, and that the circus and theater held larger congregations on Sunday than did the churches. They secured legislation to suppress Sunday shows and force the people into the church; and precisely the same thing is sought by the clergy to-day. They cannot compete with the world's attractions without the aid of Sunday "laws."

But neither the compulsion of Sunday statutes, nor the inducements which appeal to the worldly-minded, can bring into the church any others than hypocrites, and the less of this class the church has in her membership, the better it will be for her, and for the country. The testimony of history is clear and emphatic upon this point.
