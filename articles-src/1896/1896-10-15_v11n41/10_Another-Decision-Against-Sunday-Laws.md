### ANOTHER DECISION AGAINST SUNDAY LAWS.

[From Tacoma Daily News, Sept. 29.]

The Supreme Court decided yesterday in favor of Henry Krech on his appeal from the Superior Court.

Krech was convicted in the Municipal Court of violating the Sunday-closing ordinance in keeping his barber shop open Sunday. He has been proprietor of the Hotel Fife barber shop for ten years, and the prosecutions against him were instituted by rivals in the business. He could have availed himself of the exception to the law in favor of barber shops in connection with hotels, but insisted that he had a right to keep his place open Sundays.

The Supreme Court says that the ordinance is unconstitutional, as being special legislation, granting privileges and immunities to one class of citizens which are not allowed equally to all. If this law is valid, says the court, then the legislature would have the right to prohibit farm labor, printing and nine tenths of the employments which citizens usually engage in in this country and leave the other one tenth to pursue their vocations. The ordinance in question is deemed as special legislation, and while it is true that there have been some decisions, notably in New York, holding the contrary view, this court is satisfied that the ordinance is unconstitutional and reverses judgment with instructions to dismiss the case.
