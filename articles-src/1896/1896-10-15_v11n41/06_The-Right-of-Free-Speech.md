## THE RIGHT OF FREE SPEECH.

The following item from the New York Observer, of October 1, was doubtless not intended as an attack upon liberty and natural rights, yet it points to a growing sentiment in this country upon which the friends of liberty may well look with apprehension:—

The right of free speech does not mean the right to all kinds of speech. There are certain styles of talk that no government, especially no republic, can safely tolerate. If gag law is not desirable, ungagged lawlessness is no better. Well said Archbishop Ryan the other day: "We justly boast of the great liberty of speech allowed in this free Republic, but we may ask, may not such liberty occasionally degenerate into the most dangerous license? It does so when it is used to poison the intellect and the hearts of men by evidently false principles."

But who is to decide what are "evidently false principles" in every case? That some principles are evidently false no one will deny; but it can safely be said that certain principles which would be "evidently false" in the view of Archbishop Ryan, of the Roman Catholic Church, would be just and right principles in the view of many who do not occupy a papal standpoint. And what are good principles in the view of one class of Protestants, may be "evidently false" in the view of other Protestants.

The principle that the State cannot rightfully concern itself with religion is fast coming to be an "evidently false" one in the view of many Protestants, as it is in the view of Roman Catholics; and who can say how long it may be before the advocacy of this just and most essential principle in all good government, may be deemed "ungagged lawlessness," when public sentiment shall have been won to the idea that the State may rightfully legislate to uphold religious dogmas, as for example, the dogma that Sunday is the Christian sabbath? There is certainly great danger to liberty in an attack upon the right of free speech.
