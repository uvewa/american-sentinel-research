### AS TRUE OF PROTESTANT PAPERS.

THE Catholic Review, in its issue of the 10th inst., administers this fitting rebuke to the Catholic papers which have also become partisan political journals:—

Catholic papers that are also partisan political journals, are a detriment to the church. In the public mind, they identify the religions and the political causes that they advocate; and they offend and scandalize those among their readers who cannot look at public affairs through their spectacles. In questions affecting faith, morals or Catholic rights, they have the right and they may also have the duty to speak out trumpet-voiced. But their influence will be less than proper, if they have prejudiced the people against their fairness by loud partisanship on matters purely political. They injure their cause by wandering beyond their sphere.

These words are just as applicable to Protestant as to Catholic papers. As indicated by the Catholic Review, there are in this discussion of purely political questions by the religious press, and by the pulpit, two great evils: First, it identifies in the public mind religious and political issues; and second, it tends to separate between pastors and people, and destroys largely the influence for spiritual good, which the ministers and religious papers would otherwise have.

The AMERICAN SENTINEL has no desire to influence a single vote in the coming election. All the advice we have to give to any man is, Be honest; if you vote, vote your convictions. There is a moral question for every man, involved not only in this but in every matter, a question which he alone can settle, namely, that of being honest with himself and with his fellowmen.

The man who in the present political contest votes for free silver believing that thereby he can defraud his fellowmen, is a thief at heart; but in this respect he differs not one iota from the man who votes for gold because he believes its triumph will enable him to accumulate, not his own earnings, but the earnings of others.

It follows that before the monetary question can become a moral question to any man lie must be satisfied as to the merits of the political question; his mind must be at rest upon the question of where right and justice are to be found. If, then, he violates his conscience, either for immediate or for ultimate gain, he, like Esau, sells his birthright for a mess of pottage.

The pulpit and the religious press should teach sound morals, leaving to statesmen and political economists questions of finance, protective tariffs, etc. The divine commission is, "Preach the World."
