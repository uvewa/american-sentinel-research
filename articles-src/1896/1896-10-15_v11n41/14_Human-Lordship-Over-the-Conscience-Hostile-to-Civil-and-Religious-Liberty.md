## HUMAN LORDSHIP OVER THE CONSCIENCE HOSTILE TO CIVIL AND RELIGIOUS LIBERTY.

[Christian Statesman, September 19, 1896.]

Obedience is to be rendered to rightful human authority for conscience' sake. But even in such cases the conscience is toward God. It recognizes the ultimate divine authority in all duties to man as well as in all duties to God. It is to be kept void of offense toward man as well as toward God, but its Lord is always and in all duty divine.

The assumption by any human being or social body of the right to pronounce final and irreformable moral judgments, and to hold men to conscientious obedience to these definitions and interpretations as of ultimate authority, is to claim divine lordship over the consciences of men. To regulate human life according to this assumption must beget and nourish the spirit of despotism. It cannot fail to repress the exercise of the intellectual faculties and dull the moral sense. It will ever stand as a wall of separation between God and man. It smothers discussion and investigation. It strangles liberty of thought and speech and conscience in their very cradle. It forces the free action of mind into the shackles of stereotyped impressions. It dwarfs and hinders the work of the Holy Spirit, repressing the longings of man's soul for the indwelling of the divine Enlightener, and erecting a barrier in the way of the communion of the souls of men, individually and socially, with God as God by his Spirit speaking directly to them in his Word. It impedes the immediate shining into the human soul of the truth by which the conscience is made quick and tender.

God has given moral law to men in all the relations of human life in such form as to stimulate thought and quicken conscience. Every individual is to decide finally for himself, like Peter and the other apostles, when he ought to obey God rather than man (Acts 5:29; comp. also 4:19). And councils and officers of the Christian Church as well as civil rulers are included here in the word "men" no less than the Jewish Sanhedrim. . . .

Whenever it is required of men to take the interpretation of God's law as given by any man or any body of men as infallible and ultimately authoritative and thus binding on the conscience, the mainspring of the study of God's word, and of the investigation of the claims of divine law, and thus of all man's highest moral quickening is weakened or it may be broken. Such a demand leaves no room for individual or social responsibility under the immediate obligations of divine law. Men become slavishly dependent upon the power that in any emergency of human life pronounces the infallible and irreformable decree to which, as with conscience toward God, all are bound to submit. This robs obedience to moral law of its highest sanction by making it obedience to man as if it were to God and not to God himself.

Reform and progress are terms that find no place in the vocabulary of such a system. The only liberty of which men can be possessed under this system is liberty to repeat a treadmill round within the boundaries of its paramount and unchangeable decrees. With despotic mien it stands at the doors of human reformation and progress locked and barred with irreformable definitions. And worse still, the intellects and consciences that submit to the fetters which this system imposes sooner or later lose their desire to enter these doors even when thrown wide open.

The system which has been described in an abstract way in the foregoing paragraphs is in the concrete the system of Romanism. Its assumption of infallibility, of which fact there is no question, is in its very nature a claim of divine lordship over the consciences of men. It is the claim by a great system as well as by its official head, of the rightful authority of a mere mortal man, when speaking ex cathedra, or as the ultimate human mouth-piece of the ecclesiastical government, to give deliverance on all moral questions that are to bind the consciences of all other men as if these utterances were the very voice of God.

This system appeals to the decision of the council at Jerusalem, of which we have the record in the 13th chapter of the Acts, as a warrant for the imperative and absolute authority of its own official decrees. But it must be remembered that that council or synod at Jerusalem was divinely inspired in doing what became a part of the infallible record of the Word of God. What it decreed was what seemed good to the Holy Ghost as well as to the council itself (Acts 15:28). Its decrees thus became God's revealed law with claims on the conscience which no uninspired record of ecclesiastical acts can ever possess. To put the decrees of later councils or of supreme pontiffs on the same high ground is to make them in effect a part of the inspired and infallible Word of God.

It is the determination of the system of Romanism to be possessed of an authority from which the consciences of men are to be allowed no release that has driven it with irresistible logic to the promulgation of the blasphemous dogma of the papal infallibility. And in this assumption it has planted itself in the pathway of the attainment and development of the civil and religious liberties of our race. Nay, more. Wherever and whenever it can assert its essential claims and develop its own inherent character, without the restraints of any controlling power, it throws its deadly blight over the fair tree of civil and religious liberty, and, however full of blossoms of promise or laden with ripened fruit, shrivels it to the root.
