## THE NEED OF THE HOUR.

The great need of our country to-day is not more politicians of a certain class, or more adherents to certain political doctrines, as might be inferred from what is said and written touching the issues which are now agitating the public mind. The true interests of this country demand, as most essential to its welfare, not more adherents to any political party platform, but more adherents to sound moral principle,—more adherents to the platform of Christianity.

The Saviour said to his disciples, "Ye are the salt of the earth." Just as salt preserves certain substances in which it is placed, so the followers of Christ,—those who are such indeed—preserve the earth and every country in it from destruction through the wrath of God against sin. Were there no Christians in the earth, the judgments of God would fall upon it as they fell upon Sodom and Gomorrah after the departure of righteous Lot.

The righteous are as truly the salt of the earth to-day, as when the Saviour walked with his disciples in Judea. Not only do they preserve the earth as ten just persons would have preserved Sodom, could they have been found in it, but in every land they contribute more powerfully than any other class to the country's welfare. The righteous person must be honest, peaceable, and industrious. He may at times err in judgment, but when he discovers his error, as he will sooner or later, he will at once renounce it and conform to the right.

If all the people in this land, or the great majority of them, were controlled in their actions by the principle of love to God and to one another, there would be no grave peril hanging over the nation's prosperity, as we are told that there is now. The "great crisis" about which we hear so much to-day, would not exist. In the hands of honest, conscientious, liberty-loving men, this country would be perfectly safe. They might be in the wrong in their political views upon some points, but they would cherish such views in honesty, and not from selfishness; and upon discovering their error, they would be quick to remedy whatever evil was working injury to the people. If it were ignorance alone which threatened the country's interests to-day, we should have but little to fear.

The righteous are those who have been turned, by the power of God's grace in the gospel, from allegiance to self and sin, unto allegiance to the divine law of love. Having been thus converted, they will seek not the interests of self, but the welfare of their fellowmen. The means of their conversion is the gospel, and the gospel is brought to them by those who preach it. And therefore those who occupy the position of ministers of that gospel can best serve the highest interests of their country, as well as those of individuals, by being faithful to their divine commissions, and striving to minister the grace of God to as many persons as possible. And when they leave this work and engage in the preaching of politics, they not only fail to serve those interests but work directly against them. The discord, division, and strife, which such discourses bring into their congregations, are sufficient evidence upon this point.

The great need of the hour in this country, and in every other as well, is the need of more true Christians,—more men and women from whom the life of Christ can flow out in blessing upon the communities in which they move, even as it flowed out from Jesus of Nazareth upon the people of Judea. Let the preachers cease to preach politics, and proclaim the word of the living God, which contains the power of God unto salvation. The prosperity of the country is affected much more by the conversion of a sinner from the error of his ways, than by the gaining of an adherent to a political creed. s.
