## ALL SUNDAY "LAWS" OUGHT TO BE ABOLISHED.

BY H. W. REED.

WHY OUGHT SUNDAY STATUTES TO BE ABOLISHED? Because such statutes are religious, and therefore contrary to the Constitution of the United States, though in harmony with English law, whence we directly received our Sunday statutes. These "laws" were transplanted to the colonies and were not dropped, as they should have been, when these colonies became States. Sunday "laws" were and are contrary to the Declaration of Independence, to the spirit of the National Constitution, and to the constitutions of the several States.

Some of our politicians are strongly opposed to England's lead or dictation to them in money matters. They are right. But why will they not be as consistent in opposing Sunday "laws" which we received from England? They should, and we ask that all Sunday "laws" be abolished in the United States.

The terrible "beast" of Daniel 7, with ten horns, represents Rome with its ten divisions. In the time of Constantine, Church and State were united in Rome, and after this union the horns were developed, and of course they partook of the nature of the "beast," that is, there was in them a union of Church and State. As England was one of these horns she had union of Church and State, and as she planted the colonies, that principle was in them, and when they became States, that union of Church and State should have been everlastingly broken, but it was not. How much better it would have been for this nation if she had broken that union instead of forging chains, as she has done, to strengthen it. Then there would have been no conscientious Sabbath-keepers imprisoned and deprived of their natural rights because they worked upon the first day of the week, as God commands them to do. If these Sunday "laws" were abolished, as they ought to be, then Mr. B. A. Philpott, of Dillion, Tenn., would not be under arrest for Sunday labor. Now he is to be tried as a criminal, at Murfreesboro, in the next session of the Circuit Court, for being in harmony with God, the Constitution of the United States, and the constitution of the State of Tennessee (in which State he was born); but not in harmony with an unconstitutional "law" received from England. How unjust these Sunday "laws" have been the eternal decisions of the court of heaven will decide. The persecuted, however, do not stand so much in need of pity as do the persecutors.

The Sunday "law" has come to us from the Papacy through England. What is the Papacy? The Papacy is the papal church, and the papal church is the awful result of an unlawful marriage between paganism and formal Christianity. Every specification that is predicted in Daniel 7:25, is found wrought out in the history of this power. The history of her guilt is exposed to the world; still she conceals much of her corruption in garments of purple and scarlet, ornamented with gold, pearls and precious stones. She boasts of having changed the law of God, and courts the worship of the world. The honest in heart will reject her bids and heed not her haughty claims to their adoration. Shall Protestants yield to her the victories gained by the Reformation and fall under her tyrannical rule? The father of Sunday was a pagan, but its mother was the "mother of harlots." Nourished by this maternal antichrist, it grew to be an enemy of God, and to-day, with giant-like powers, it is seeking to cast down the perfect gift of God—his law.

Unconsciously honest-hearted Protestants have nourished this child of the Papacy. They have done this not knowing its origin, or the corrupt propensities it possesses. To cherish and caress this papal sabbath is but to honor the worst system of religion in this fallen world. It is like pressing to the heart a venomous serpent, but the venom of error produces eternal death, while the venom of the serpent produces only temporal death.

This "mother of harlots" has with impious hands smitten the law of God, and with unhallowed feet she crushes the fourth commandment to the ground, thinking to stamp it out of existence. Thanks be unto God, truth can never die. Let us plant our feet on the rock of the living God—Christ Jesus—and through his grace magnify the law and make it honorable; but not by religious legislation, for this will either make martyrs or hypocrites. God forbid that we make either. Then in order that we do not, let us abolish religious legislation, and if we do this we will abolish all Sunday "laws." If the Sunday statutes are not abolished many just persons will suffer unjustly, for which suffering a just reward will be measured out upon its authors by Him who is the fountain of all law.
