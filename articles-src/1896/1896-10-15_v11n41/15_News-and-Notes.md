## NEWS AND NOTES.

The "Sabbath Alliance" of Scotland has started a crusade against public bathing in Glasgow, on the ground that such bathing on Sunday constitutes a violation of the "sabbath."

The Supreme Court of Indiana in a recent decision affirms the constitutionality of the Nicholson liquor law, and declares that the "natural right to pursue an ordinary calling" does not justify the act of selling intoxicating liquor at retail.

The St. Louis Post-Dispatch makes the statement that the total number of qualified voters in this country is 15,137,889, and that of those actually voting about 10,000,000 are nominally Protestants, and about 2,000,000 are Roman Catholics.

The Christian Statesman sees in the observance of October 8 as a day of fasting and prayer by Christian people in answer to the call sent out by the Chicago ministers' union, a token of success for "national reform" measures which will be brought before the country in the near future.

A roll of bishops, ministers, and delegates in attendance at the centennial celebration of the A. M. E. Zion Church of America, revealed the fact that the political sentiment of these representatives of that church is unanimously in favor of the Republican candidate and platform. The membership of the church is about 500,000.

The Congregational ministers of Chicago, in connection with the International Sunday Observance League, have begun an agitation against the use of a public gymnasium in Douglas Park, Chicago, on Sundays. A protest has been sent to the park commissioners against such use of the gymnasium, and it is expected that a spirited controversy over the question of Sunday observance will be the result.

Osheosh, Wis., is still agitated over the question of the suppression of Sunday baseball playing. Up to the present time Sunday games have prevailed against the opposition of the Sundayists in that place, and the baseball season being now ended, the settlement of the question will naturally be deferred to next year. The waning interest of the public in the "national game," with the resulting decrease in receipts has made Sunday games almost a necessity to the financial success of baseball as a business. Hence it may be expected that Sunday baseball will be a point about which the contest for enforced Sunday observance will wax warm during the summer of 1897.

Reports from several counties in eastern Kentucky state that the mountaineers are greatly stirred up against Mormon preachers who have been making converts there, and have decided upon summary measures for driving them from the State. The trouble began when the Mormons held a camp-meeting only three miles distant from a Methodist camp-meeting which was in progress in the vicinity of Jackson. Word was sent to the Mormons that if they did not leave they would regret it, and this was followed by some fighting, in which it is said the Mormons were roughly used. A committee authorized by the Methodists and Baptists, have notified the mountaineers in the counties most affected by the Mormon crusade, that if any person sells or gives to the Mormons any kind of food, his home will be burned and his stock killed.

THE New York Herald, of October 4, states that great commotion has been occasioned among "high church" people in London, Eng., by the display in the shop window of Mr. Kensit, the anti-Catholic bookseller, on Paternoster Row, of a variety of instruments of torture, with an accompanying statement that they are used by English "high church" people for the purpose of penance. The display includes a horse-hair belt, a steel "discipline," cord "discipline" (to be used for flagellation), breastplate covered with steel points, and steel spiked anklet. At the shop where these instruments were sold it was stated that many more were sold to "high church" Anglicans than to Roman Catholics.
