# THE POLITICAL "ATHEIST."

It has ever been the custom of persons who have been fighting to maintain the crumbling theories of Church and State, to call their opponents "atheists." It is done to-day (especially by Sunday-law advocates), and it was done by the enemies of American institutions a century ago. Our good old "fathers"—Washington and his co-laborers—had to receive the appellation over and over again.

Madison, in one of his essays, gives an illustration of the common anti-constitutional style of argument then, which sounds very like that of the religio-political reformer of to-day:—

"You are destitute, I perceive," says the anti-republican, "of every quality of a good citizen, or rather, a good subject. You have neither the light of faith, nor the spirit of obedience. I denounce you to the government as an accomplice of atheism and anarchy."

And so saying he (the anti-republican) let the argument drop, presumably because he thought that calling American principles "atheism and anarchy," was at once both the strongest argument and severest chastisement that he could give them.
