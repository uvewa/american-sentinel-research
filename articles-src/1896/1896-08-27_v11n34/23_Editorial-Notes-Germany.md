A SURVEY of the religious field in Germany, according to a writer in the Paris Revue, discovers 31,000,000 nominal Protestants, to 17,000,000 Catholics. The province of Brandenburg appears to have treasured up more carefully than any others the spirit of the Reformation. Hamburg and Berlin are described as "spiritual cemeteries." The present emperor, it is said, "was so impressed, on his accession to the crown, with the prevailing decay of religion, that he decided to build forty new churches at the expense of the State." The decay of religion, however, is a result of that very Church-and-State union of which the emperor availed himself in defraying the expenses of his "forty new churches." The idea that piety can be promoted by a liberal use of brick and mortar, at the expense of people who take no interest in the work, is quite in harmony with the theory upon which Church-and-State union rests; but it is entirely contrary to the teaching of Christianity.
