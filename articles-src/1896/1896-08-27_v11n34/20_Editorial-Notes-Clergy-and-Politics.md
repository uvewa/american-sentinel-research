The World (N. Y.) of August 17, prints a dispatch from Vineland, N. J., dated the 16th, which states that "at the Malaga camp meeting this afternoon the Rev. D. H. King, D. D., of Vineland, created a sensation by denouncing in strong terms 'our gold standard.' He has usually voted the Republican ticket, and his utterances were a great surprise." The incident only serves to point out the fact that on political questions ministers, as well as other persons, are bound to differ, and their differences when brought to the surface in pulpit discourses, are sure to promote discord in the church.
