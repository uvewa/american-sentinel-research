# RELIGION NOT WANTED IN THE POLITICAL CAMPAIGN.

[New Orleans Times-Democrat, Aug. 10, 1896.]

As the Times-Democrat has noted, a number of ministers have lately sought to bring religion into the present presidential campaign, although the great question at issue is a purely economic one. The goldbug papers are beginning to see that their cause is most likely to suffer from the effort to connect religion with finance, and the indiscreet utterances of some members on this subject. What seems to have caused the most surprise and disgust is the interview recently published with Bishop John P. Newman, of the Methodist Episcopal Church, who said:—

> In the conferences committed to my charge there are something over 1,000 ministers. I shall call their attention to what I believe is the plain duty of the clergy, and shall urge upon them the importance of using all the influence they possess, in the pulpit and out, against the danger which threatens our country, against the possible triumph of Bryan and Sewall and the election of a Congress that is pledged to pass a free-silver coinage measure.

The Springfield Republican, which is one of the most sensible goldbug journals of the country, and which has been giving its friends plenty of good advice, warns them again not to cherish the idea that these ministerial utterances will help their cause.

Remember Burchard, it cries warningly. Mr. Blaine's managers thought they were playing a trump card when they got the ministers together in New York to welcome him; and never dreamed that the ministerial card would bring ruin upon him.

We have had a still more striking proof of the mistake of this policy in Canada only a few weeks ago, when the Conservatives thought to strengthen themselves by religious support, only to find that it had proved a boomerang and ruined them. But let the Republican speak for itself:—

> Mr. Hanna should see to this at once. We do not want the fight for gold Burchardized by any indiscreet prelate. Such an act as Bishop Newman proposes would be the acme of stupidity and blundering.
>
> What happened to meddling clericalism in Canada the other day is quite as likely to happen to meddling clericalism in the United States. This silver question is a matter for discussion, and if it is a matter for discussion it is a matter concerning which honest men may differ, and a political and economic question concerning which honest men may differ is not a question calling for the interference of the church.
>
> Bishop Newman's thousand persons can be better occupied than in turning their pulpits and altars into political stumps.

The Republican is thoroughly right, and it is to be hoped that its advice will be followed. The campaign is broad enough already without bringing religion into it.
