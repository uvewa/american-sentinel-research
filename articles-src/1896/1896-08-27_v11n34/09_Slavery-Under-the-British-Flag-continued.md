to bring about the limitation of the power of the slave dealers and drivers, have been disregarded by the men to whom they were addressed; and it will be necessary to wait for further information in order to know to what extent the latest orders from London are obeyed by the British Consul and General Matthews, who administers the affairs of Zanzibar, and who enrich themselves by the profits of negro slavery.

Professor Nicholson says in his book that when a boy at school he had learned that "a slave cannot exist on British soil," or in any part of the British Dominions, or under the British flag, or upon a British ship sailing o'er the main, in any part of the globe. He was sadly undecieved when he visited the British protectorate of Zanzibar and discovered a quarter of a million of persons of both sexes and all ages held as slaves under the British flag. We cannot doubt British public sentiment will ultimately compel the extermination of the traffic, although the toleration of the system so long, and England's course with reference to the opium traffic in India and China, show that nations given to rebuking other nations for some particular sin are no less inclined to possess and cherish their own favorite vices.
