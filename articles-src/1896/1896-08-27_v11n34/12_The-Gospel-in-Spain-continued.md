delight of "having revived the auto da fê of Inquisitorial times!"

One of the active colporteurs of the American Bible Society in the north of Spain, a prudent and godly man, is continually reporting to me obstruction to his work, and personal violence on the part of the priests. One day he found himself a fellow-traveler in a diligence for several hours with three women and a village priest, all strangers to him. Under the folds of his ample capa he carried, concealed on his knees, his colporteur's pack of Bibles and scripture portions. The conversation of his companions was chiefly on the success of a "mission" that had recently been held in the parish of one of the women, the most interesting feature of which seemed to have been the tearing up of several Gospels in the pulpit by one of the "missioners," and a furious attack upon the Protestants, and especially upon a man who was going about through the district selling Bibles and Gospels to the ignorant and innocent people. If it sometimes does us good to see ourselves as others see us, our colporteur passed an edifying hour that forenoon—for it was of himself that they were unwittingly talking!

The priest was eager to meet him; he only hoped he would come into his parish, and that he should have the good fortune to meet him face to face. "I know how to rid my parish of such vermin. There is no better remedy for such than a pair of revolvers. Oh, yes, I know how to do it! It will not be the first time that I have carried them under my gown."

At last they stopped to change the horses, and the priest and the women left the diligence for a few minutes. At that instant the thought flashed across our friend's mind, "Put a Gospel of Luke into the priest's bundle, that lies there loosely folded!" and no sooner thought than done. The travelers take their seats again, and before long the journey is ended and each one goes his own way—the priest with his bundle.

Three months later the colporteur is in the neighborhood of that priest. In spite of the priest's boasting, he has made several friends there and has sold a number of Scriptures. He asks one of his friends if the priest ever talks about the Protestants. Yes, indeed. Some three months ago he fairly raved against them from the pulpit. He called them 'the spawn of hell. Look at this,' he cried, and he shook a little book in the face of the congregation. 'Worse than Satan they are; for by some black art they have thrust this book upon me. And do you know where I found it? On the floor in the middle of my room! I know not who put it there, nor how he did it; but this I tell you and of this I warn him: once I come to know what Protestant has dared to pollute my room with this, I will do to him what I now do to it!' And he wrenched the leaves from the precious Gospel, crushed them with his hands, and tore them with his teeth. And he added, 'If ever any of you meet any of these pests of the earth, anything that you may do to them, even to the killing of them, will be well done!'"

But why multiply these cases? They are but a few taken from many that show what the attitude of the immense majority of the Spanish priesthood is toward the Word of God—a priesthood without the Bible, ignorant of the Bible, and in many cases hating the Bible.

And "like priest, like people." Right here in this little terrestrial paradise of San Sebastian, so gently nestling by the side of the sea, surrounded by the protecting hills, that one would think that the love and the goodness of God proclaimed by nature would fill and soften every heart; right here, so recently that it seems but as yesterday, there occurred a case the memory of which makes one shudder. A member of our church, a daughter of the Baeques, loved her Bible and read it as a child reads with love and reverence the treasured letters of a dear friend, which late in life have been discovered by others and have been placed in her hands. Her fanatical Roman Catholic husband took that Bible, laid it upon the block at the door of their cottage, and with his act chopped it to pieces. When she died suddenly a little later we were not allowed to know of her illness or death until she was buried.*

But, not to make this recital too long, it may be said that the immense distance that all too often separates the intelligent heartfelt worship of the evangelical Bible-loving Christian from that of the Roman Catholic of this country is strikingly manifested in the public processions for prayer and thanksgiving, and in the relation of the bull-fight to the religious fiestas.

At the time of the last epidemic of cholera in Spain, when the population of Zaragoza was nearly decimated and great numbers died in the country near about us, San Sebastian escaped almost entirely. San Sebastian is the religious center of one of the most sincere and faithful Roman Catholic communities in the world; and how did it give thanks to Almighty God for the unspeakable blessing of having been practically freed from the scourge that had wrought such havoc in so many of its sister cities and provinces?

The city government, then made up of especially Catholic and devout men, ordered the singing of the Te Deum in the principal church of the city, at which all the government officials and the entire consular force of the city attended, and which was conducted with unusual pomp. This in the forenoon of a sabbath day; and at noon, and again in the afternoon of the same day, these city fathers arranged sham bull-fights, or, as the public announcement says, "Se correrón dos bueyes bravos" ("Two fierce bullocks will be baited").

The animals are tied with long ropes in the center of the public square, and are then tortured by a crowd of men and boys armed with pointed sticks and with goads until, in the effort to escape their tormentors, the bullocks rush one way and another, upsetting those of the rabble who may be entangled by the ropes. And this is the "thanksgiving" of Christians!

But to go no farther away than the very week in which I am writing this article. Last Sunday, the 24th of this month of May, was the Feast of Pentecost in the Episcopal and Roman Catholic Christian year. Judging from what we know of the Day of Pentecost, from the tender and stirring narrative in the Acts of the Apostles, one would suppose that any church calling itself Christian would try to celebrate the day, if it thought of doing so at all, in a truly spiritual and devout way. In the morning, it is true, there will be celebrated a mass; in rare cases, and only in the more important cities, will there be preaching; but in Madrid last Sunday there was a bull-fight, as there is there every important feast day of the year, including the Sundays—with the sole exception, I believe, of Good Friday! And the unfortunate cities that have not the money for so splendid an exhibition of their joy and thankfulness for the outpouring of the Holy Spirit on the primitive Christians on that memorable day do more humbly and economically show the fervor of their piety by worrying the baited ox in the town or the village plaza. Our dear little San Sebastian can aspire to that degree of emotion.

How far removed from all that is worthy the name of Christian must be the heart that would not be shocked by the matter-of-fact and common-place announcement in the morning paper, received by telegraph during the night, that "The bulls of Pentecost" (los toros de Pentecostés), of Madrid, proved to be "a poor lot; dull, lazy, and not showing fight until a number of explosive darts had been fired into them which rent great holes in their sides and awakened in them a fine frenzy." The multitude left the bull-ring quite disgusted that the pentecostal feast had been such a failure.

On the other hand, the bulls on the day of the Ascension of our Lord—some days before—were a "brave lot, and disemboweled the horses in splendid style," and well-nigh killed the brilliant torero Reverter, who was "colossal through all the fight." And this morning I read that in Bilbao they have taken time by the forelock and have already "engaged the bulls for Corpus Christi!"

Only one case more to close this study of the "Christianity of the Spain of to-day." For months the country has been afflicted with a drought that has threatened the crops in a great many of the provinces. As the weeks went by and no rain fell the anxious people scanned the heavens for signs of relief; at last these appeared, as in the order of nature they were sure to do, and then, and not until then, did the ecclesiastical authorities bring out their miracle working images, and bones, and relics to bring the rain.

San Isidro is the patron saint of Madrid. They say that they have preserved his bones in that city for centuries. For many years these had not been exposed for "veneration," nor had they been taken out in solemn procession through the streets. Never was there greater need than now that he should work a miracle, for the farms around Madrid were parched and dry. The day was announced when the bones of the saint would be taken out, and all the faithful were urged to swell the ranks of the procession. But the clouds that had been gathering for two or three days broke up and were wafted away, and the sun looked out again from a brazen sky. It was too plain that the bringing of rain out of so dry a sky would be too much to expect of even the patron saint of Madrid. So the authorities announced that it had not occurred to them that a bull fight had been organized for that same day and hour, and as they did not wish to force the faithful to lose the bull-fight while following the procession, they "had decided to postpone the procession," and all Madrid laughed, and the bones of San Isidro remained undisturbed until a more propitious occasion.

Travelers waited in Madrid from day to day, wishing to see the great function that would rival the procession of the holy week in Seville. But no, the sun blazed and the saint waited. At last nature came to the help of the sorely tried managers of the show, and the heavy clouds full of water hung over the thirsty land. The procession was formed, the saint was aroused, and the miracle was performed! While they were parading the streets a gentle shower fell, and shortly after the rain poured down not only in Madrid, but in other parts of the country, until in some places the floods have drowned or have
