The Catholic Review, of August 8, calls attention to the fact that there is occasion for Protestants to "sweep before the door of Protestantism" in the matter of oppressive marriage laws. It will be remembered that the chief point of complaint raised by the Methodist ministers who appealed to the pope in behalf of Protestants in South America, was that the laws of Ecuador and Peru did not recognize any marriage ceremony as valid unless performed by a Catholic priest. It appears that the Jew is under very much the same disability in Protestant Prussia. The Review cites the case of a Jew named Isaac Flatto, who was married in Prussia about eight years ago by a Jewish rabbi. "Shortly afterwards," says that journal, "they came to the United States and settled at Pottstown, Pa. They have four children. About two years ago, Flatto deserted his wife, went to Baltimore and 'married' Jennie Sindlehr, on Sept. 15, 1895. The wife heard of the bigamy and instituted proceedings against her unfaithful husband."

But it transpired that his first marriage was "not legal," because "in Prussia, since Oct. 1, 1874, a marriage can be legally contracted only before an officer of the State." So said the German ambassador at Washington, and "hence," he added, "a marriage ceremony performed after that date by a Jewish rabbi is void and has no legal consequences whatever." The Review therefore suggests that a petition be sent "to Emperor William, the head of the Protestant Church in Germany, to grant religious liberty to the Jews of Prussia."

We would remind the Catholic Review, however, that it is only adherence to a papal principle that makes Emperor William the "head of the Protestant Church in Prussia;" and hence the petition would be as much against the Papacy in the one case as in the other.
