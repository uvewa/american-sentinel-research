New York is now receiving the American Sentinel, without having ordered it may know that it is sent to him by some friend. Therefore, those who have not ordered the Sentinel need have no fears that they will be asked to pay for it.

The more the clergy have to say about politics, the less what they have to say about anything will be respected by the people.

WANTED—(by advocates of the politico-religious theory) a political gospel, and a political Saviour. Until someone is able to point us to these, we shall continue to advocate the separation of politics from religion.

It was Andrew Jackson who said, "There are no necessary evils in government, its evils exist only in its abuses." True; "for rulers," in their legitimates sphere, "are not a terror to good works, but to the evil."

One reason why Russia refuses religious liberty to her subjects, it is said, is that were religious liberty to be granted, the State Church would at once crumble to dust. This reveals what union of Church and State does for the Church.

As will be seen from the article, "Slavery Under the British Flag," on page 267, there is not so wide a gulf between that practice and modern civilization as might be supposed. Questions of principle often become much obscured by consideration of expediency, where pecuniary advantage is at stake. It is this that led to the imposition of the opium traffic upon protesting but helpless China, by which many of that nation are reduced to slavery in its worst form. It is the love of money that perpetuates virtual slavery in the ranks of labor in our own land.
