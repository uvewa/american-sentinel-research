SUNDAY, Aug. 16, the Rev. Dr. MacArthur, of Calvary Baptist Church, this city, edified(?) his church congregation with a political discourse in which he likened the Democratic candidate for the Presidency, W. J. Bryan, to Absolom, the renegade son of David. The SENTINEL has nothing to say concerning the merits of either side of the political controversy; but it would point out that common courtesy, to say nothing of Christianity, utterly condemns a comparison as manifestly unjust. It is the least that courtesy demands, that a man who devotes his time to the advocacy of a political principle, be credited with honest motives in so doing, at least until there is clear evidence to the contrary. Dr. MacArthur is in this not doing anything to help the cause of Christianity.
