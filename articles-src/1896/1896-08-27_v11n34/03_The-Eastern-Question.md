# The Eastern Question.

The Sun, of this city, in its issue of the 23rd, ult., printed the following from its London correspondent under date of the previous day:—

No information is vouchsafed yet about the negotiations between the powers for the settlement of the Cretan troubles, and it is shrewdly suggested of the whole Turkish question that the signs multiply that the British Government is at last making up its mind to a definite and drastic policy. It is highly significant that the London Standard has come over to complete acceptance of Mr. Gladstone's view of the situation. It says: "By its persistent neglect of the reiterated warnings to put its house in order, and the first step to that end should be the concession of autonomy to Crete, the Porte courts the punishment that must in the end overtake an empire which disregards its duty to its subjects. There was a time when this country, as it showed by its deeds, was willing to make any sacrifice in order to preserve the integrity of Turkey. We should still be unwilling to hasten its division, but the persistent misgovernment of the Sultan has made it impossible for an English minister to suggest the idea of going to war in defense of so rotten a system."

The same newspaper which, more than any other, voices government opinion also says: "Great Britain will act with the powers, not independently of them. She does not want Crete, as even the Continental press is beginning to understand. What she does want is to see that island so pacified that it will cease to be a danger to the peace of Europe, and pacified in a permanent sense. Crete will never be so long as she forms an integral part of the dominions of the Sultan."

This shows very clearly the exceedingly critical crisis which has been reached in Eastern affairs, and no man knows what a day may bring forth.

That the Armenians and the Cretans have both suffered untold wrongs at the hands of the Turkish power must be admitted by all. Turkish rule can not but be regarded as intolerable by all who know even the first principles of human rights, and these peoples justly command the sympathy of the civilized world. But that there is not wanting wrong on the part of political agitators is also patent.

While there has been persecution for conscience' sake in Armenia, while innocent noncombatants, have been butchered in cold blood or indescribably outraged simply because they were not Mohammedans, occasion for these atrocities has deliberately been afforded by agitators who hoped by provoking the Turks and Kurds to deeds of rapine, murder and outrage, to so rouse the powers that they would with one accord demand autonomy for Armenia. Never was more heinous crime perpetrated against unoffending people than that of which Armenian agitators have been guilty, if we may credit the evidence of men who, being upon the ground, are in a position to know the whole truth.

Rev. George C. Raynolds, missionary in Van, Turkey, in an article published in the Independent, of this city, August 13, says:—

The sympathy justly manifested toward the Armenians, in view of the cruel wrongs under which they were suffering, awakened hope on the part of the revolutionary leaders that the Powers would take up their cause, some of them being foolish enough to expect that an autonomous State would be established for them. When these manifestations of sympathy slackened, or the hope of outside interference lessened, they felt that something more tangible in the way of oppression was needed to spur on the flagging zeal of the Powers; and so, three or four years ago, we began to hear of plans to stir up the Kurds to commit some great outrage, which should horrify Europe and lead to the realization of their hopes. It was to no purpose to assure them that the least suspicion of overt effort on their part to secure such a result would estrange, instead of attracting, the sympathy of Europe. However, the Turk did not wait for their initiative, but substantially unprovoked, horrified the civilized world by the fiendish barbarity of Sasein.

A cry for redress went up from the civilized world, and especially from the English-speaking nations, which the ruling class could not ignore; and hopes, alas, false, were kindled in the hearts of the Armenians, and the revolutionary party among them took on new boldness, while the Moslems were stirred up to still greater fanaticism.

And now comes the saddest episode in all modern history, the terrible series of massacres which began last autumn—and which have culminated, I trust, in the events of the last fortnight—which have made this blue lake to binals with the blood of thousands slain among the green valleys and snow-capped peaks which surround it. That the Turks can be justified for the utterly barbarous and unspeakably cruel methods they have pursued in their efforts to eradicate rebellion, surely no one will claim. One is both to believe that human nature is capable of taking delight in chopping to pieces men, women and children—as has been done to scores of those brought to us every day—and in inflicting such unimaginable suffering as is now endured by the thousand wretches who crowd the places about us. Any claim the Turk may have made to rank among civilized or semi-civilized nations, they have thus resigned, and relegated themselves to the condition of their ancestors of the time of Tamerlane. The blood of slaughtered thousands, the mass of whom were in no sense rebels, protests to heaven against the savagery of this complacent people.

But, on the other hand, the revolutionists are not less to blame than the Turks themselves for the events of these bloody months. It was their ill advised demonstration at Constantinople that first lighted the fires of fanaticism last fall and early winter that swept over the land a very besom of destruction. Van alone of all the large cities of the land then escaped. It certainly seemed that the testimony of those months of carnage, taken in connection with the attitude of the Powers in drawing back and allowing the Turk to work his own sweet will, was enough to prove to any so obtuse as not already to have learned the lesson, that revolutionary methods and demonstrations could not fail to increase, instead of alleviating the intolerable burden that was resting on the Armenian people. But here in Van, three different revolutionary societies, each with its leaders from abroad, persisted in keeping up their criminal propaganda. Men dressed in a way especially to irritate the Turk, and armed to the teeth, kept up nightly patrols of the streets, frequently coming under the observation of the Turkish patrols, and, in one instance, having a brush with them, in which a Turkish soldier was killed. They issued proclamations abusing the Sultan and inciting the people to revolt, and nearly all of these documents fell into the hands of the Vali. They kept up a regular system of forced contributions to a "Patriotic" fund, with the repeated accompaniments of housebreaking and murder. They assassinated one prominent ecclesiastic and several prominent men for not being sufficiently subservient to their purposes. They would be found all armed and equipped, in private houses, when one went to make holiday calls.

A strange infatuation prevailed among the leaders and infused itself among their followers; and they would listen to no argument or appeal. It is easy to see how intensely such a course would arouse the Moslem leaders. The outlying Kurds, who had had frequent encounters with these revolutionists, as they passed between here and the border, and had lost a good many influential men by their rifle balls, were aroused to the extremist hate of the very name of revolutionists. It is not then to be denied that there was in Van an organized revolutionary party, of considerable strength, well known and sufficient to justify the government in taking vigorous steps to suppress it.

This revolutionary leaven has not penetrated the whole nation, though it has extended much further than we could wish; but what I desire to ask of the friends of humanity in my native land is that they will distinguish between the poor Armenians who are now suffering so cruelly in this land, and of whom so many have already given up their lives, rather than sacrifice their faith in our common dissener (italics ours, En. Sentinel), and the blatant revolutionists who have so cruelly betrayed them. For the former we still entreat that you will extend them the aid they are so much in need of, and without which they cannot survive, though we know many of you have al-
