When any person assumes to speak as a minister of the gospel, he should present what he has to say from the standpoint of the gospel, and no other. There can be no objection to his touching upon any question, provided he does so from this standpoint. But there is a vast difference between this standpoint and that of the politician or other secularist, as concerns the presentation of any matter, for the reason that the gospel is always "the power of God unto salvation" from sin, and from the standpoint of the gospel, the presentation of any duty must always include the presentation of God's power to enable the individual to perform it. The politician can say, "Thou shalt not steal;" but that is not gospel unless there is connected with it the truth of the power of God freely given and received through faith in his word to keep the individual from stealing. And this truth must be presented by the representative of Jesus Christ. The politician as such cannot do it. And it is a sad spectacle that is seen when a minister of the gospel, professing to speak from the standpoint of the gospel, leaves the truth of the power of God out of his subject, or chooses a subject of discourse with which the thought of the power of God unto salvation can have no proper connection.
