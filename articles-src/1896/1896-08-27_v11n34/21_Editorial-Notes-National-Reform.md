A MORE terse statement of the designs of the National Reformers and incidentally of the mission of the AMERICAN SENTINEL was never written than that contained in this from the Sentinel Library of April 15, 1889: "The success of the National Reform movement will be the destruction of the dearly-bought principle of American liberty; the destruction of the inestimable treasure of American citizenship, and the destruction of every principle of the rights of conscience under the Government of the United States. And because of this we labor for the defense of the genius of American institutions." These words were true of National Reform and of this paper in 1889, and they are equally true of both to-day.
