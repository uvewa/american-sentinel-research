# WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH SPAIN?

The decrepititude of Spain is to-day a matter of general note and comment among the observing people of all lands. Once the queen of the nations, she is now shorn of all just claims to the rank of a first-class power. Her glory is departed; the insignia of her former greatness is everywhere covered with the melancholy tracings of decay.

Recently an insurrection broke out among some Spanish tributaries in Morocco, to suppress which taxed Spain's military power severely; and for more than a year now past she has exerted herself to put an end to rebellion in Cuba, but the prospect is that the task will prove beyond her strength. A similar but less formidable Cuban uprising in recent times was put down only after a ten years' struggle. From the modern newspaper narrative of Spain's military attempts, it is with a feeling almost of amazement that our thoughts revert to the exploits of the men who bore the Spanish ensign through Mexico and Peru.

The barbarities which mark Spain's course in the present contest are but another token of her weakness. And while there is rebellion abroad, there is division and bankruptcy at home.

The question we have propounded is fully answered in the article which we reprint in this issue from the Missionary Review on the need of the gospel in Spain. It is not Time, but Rome, which has made Spain what she is to-day. More faithfully than any other nation, Spain has adhered to the papal church, and the results are visible in a corresponding degree. And it was not long since that a papal spokesman in this land openly declared, "What Rome has done for other countries, she will do for the United States." Yes; without a doubt she will, if she is given the chance. It is this that adds a terrible interest to the spectacle which Spain presents to-day. The fearful question is, Will the American people allow Rome to do for our country what she has done for Spain?
