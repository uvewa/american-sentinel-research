# THE PREACHER IN CIVIL AFFAIRS.

## An Opinion by Judge Sage, of Cincinnati.

At a recent session of the United States Circuit Court in Cincinnati, O., Judge Sage presiding, a case was tried in which the defendant, who was convicted, plead for some mitigation of the penalty on the ground that two of the witnesses against him, one of whom had acted as a detective, were ministers of the gospel. This drew from the judge the following comment:—

Two gentlemen, who are clergymen, were called upon the stand, and testified as witnesses for the government. It appears that they had at different times in this case acted as detectives. One of them had been employed specially in this way. Now, the counsel for defendants have commented on this. They have the right to comment. They deem upon the unfitness of such performances on the part of those whose profession it is to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ.

Now, gentlemen, perhaps it is not improper that in this connection I state in very few words my own convictions in this matter, so you can see that I am not under the influence of any prejudice or bias. Jesus Christ lived in this world at a time when there were about as many bad laws and as few good laws as at any time in the world's history. It does not appear that he ever asked for the repeal of any existing law, or for the enactment of any new law. Certainly, if he made any proposition clear and distinct, it was that his kingdom was not of this world. I have sometimes thought that in these modern times some of his followers, some even of his ministers, have practically committed themselves to the proposition that it will be impossible to evangelize this world without an act of the legislature. I do not believe it. I believe exactly what was said by the Saviour of the world himself, that the devil is the prince of this world. I believe that Christianity is the exhibition in this world of the power of the love of God Almighty through Jesus Christ his Son; and it is my opinion that whenever one of his ministers appeals from the Bible to a statute book, or from the Almighty to the governor of a State, or the mayor of a city, or the judge of a court, he makes a mistake and lowers his standard. I don't think the Almighty takes much stock in that sort of thing.

History teaches us that the most wonderful, nay, miraculous progress of Christianity was achieved in the first centuries after Christ, when the power and the wealth and the learning of the world were opposed to it, and the strong arm of its governments was applied to persecute its disciples even to torture and to death. On the other hand, the time when Christianity fell into an almost fatal embrace was when later it accepted an alliance with the State and undertook to advance and strengthen itself by human legislation and human power.

Now, gentlemen, these are my views; so that I have not any prejudices in favor of clerical efforts, excepting those that are in reliance upon spiritual power. But let me refer you to an incident in the life of Jesus Christ himself that indicates that a minister may properly take a hand sometimes in the affairs of this world. The occasion to which I refer was when Jesus Christ found men in the temple selling oxen, sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting. And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep and oxen, and poured out the changers' money, and overthrew the tables.

I recognize also, gentlemen, that because a man is a clergyman he does not cease to be a citizen; and while I do not believe in any attempt to promote Christianity by statute, wholly or in part, I do believe that if there is a crying evil, whether intemperance, or sabbath-breaking, or lotteries, or any other species of crime, the clergy have as good right as other good citizens to intervene.

The incongruity presented in the course of the clergyman detective was apparent to the judge, although the latter's attention may be supposed to be but little given to other than secular affairs. Of course, the clergyman had a right to act as a detective; he has the same right that other citizens have. But this fact does not settle the question whether it was right for him to do as he did. "Rights," or "a right," have a narrower meaning than "right." The former refers only to a man's relation to his fellows; the latter embraces also his relation to God. It is often right, from a Christian standpoint, for an individual to surrender rights.

But we cannot agree with the judge, in finding in Christ's cleansing of the temple, a parallel to the preacher's participation in the "affairs of this world." The cleansing of the temple was not a secular affair in any sense. The judge also trips over "sabbath-breaking," as is natural for one who regards Sabbath observance as a secular thing.
