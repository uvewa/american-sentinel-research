# "Powerful" sermons and "Sound Money."

It is announced that the Rev. Dr. John P. Newman, Methodist Episcopal Bishop of San Francisco, has entered the political campaign with a "plan to have every one of the thousand ministers in the conferences committed to his charge use their influence in the pulpit and out of it against the success of "free silver."

The Detroit Free Press, of August 4, makes mention of a "powerful sermon" recently preached by Bishop Newman at Asbury Park. No sinners were converted by it however, as we are told that the sermon was not against sin, but "against the white metal." It is not so important now, it seems, to turn sinners from sin to righteousness, as to turn men from what is deemed political heresy. Bishop Newman declares, says the same journal, "that in the present campaign clergymen of all denominations, Protestant as well as Catholic, have a duty to perform that is little less sacred and important than that which confronted them during the anti-slavery agitation. He holds that Christian ministers should preach the doctrine of sound money from the pulpits."

Of course, every person can "preach the doctrine of sound money," according to his own view of the same; and in these days, when "preaching" is in general so little related to the statements of Scripture, this may not be a difficult thing to do. What the Bible doctrine of "sound money" is, we believe no one has attempted to say. The Bible does speak about money and treasures in many texts, but what it says is for the most part ignored in the financial transactions of this day. It speaks about not putting out money to usury, about giving money to the poor, and about the "tithe" which belongs to the Lord. It counsels men to lay up treasure in heaven. It speaks also of the treasure which the rich have "heaped together" for the last days, by defrauding the poor, and of the "rust" of their heaped up gold and silver, which will be a witness against them before God. But we imagine a sermon preached from these texts would not be considered as of any great value for campaign purposes.

The Free Press does not see very easy sailing ahead for the bishop's project. "When the good bishop gets back to California," it says, "and seeks to hold 1,000 pulpits in line for a defense of the present monetary standard, there is likely to be trouble. In many, if not a majority of the parishes, the free silver sentiment just now predominates, and with the general ticklishness that prevails on the question of politics in the pulpit, the campaigning of Bishop Newman's ministers for sound money would stir up a Methodist excitement outrivaling any camp meeting fervor ever heard of."

Yes; there is nothing like a mixture of religion and politics to stir up excitement, and that of a kind which does not promote the cause of Christianity. Bishop Newman seems to be aware of this, but is not swerved thereby from his purpose. He says: "If such a stand on the part of the clergy causes dissension in the churches, let the dissension come. Better dissension in the churches for the sake of the right, than peace and quiet while dishonor triumphs and the sappers and miners of the national credit are enthroned in high places."

"Dissension in the churches" is bad enough when the opposing forces divide over some principle of religious truth; but when the churches divide over politics, the situation is indefensible. It is a baleful sign of the times that eminent clergymen are more willing to welcome additional dissension in the churches than to give up politics. Why can they not see that the momentous and eternal interests committed to their hands as animasadors of Christ seeking the salvation of souls, demand that they should keep out of politics altogether.
