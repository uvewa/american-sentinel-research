# SLAVERY UNDER THE BRITISH FLAG.

[The Christian Work, Aug. 13, 1896.]

If it seems incredible that slavery should still exist under the protection of the British, it is none the less a fact, for the system exists in the British protectorate of Zanzibar, East Africa. The most authentic information on the subject is supplied by an agent of the British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society, who was recently sent to Zanzibar on a mission of inquiry. From his report it is ascertained that the slaves number a million and a quarter, that the slave trade is active, and that fresh supplies of slaves are brought to the mainland every year.

Professor Nicholson, of Edinburgh, who visited the protectorate a short time ago, has published a book setting forth the facts in the case. He was amazed to learn when at Zanzibar that nineteen-twentieths of the black people whom he saw were slaves; and here it was that he first discovered to what an extent negro slavery yet exists under the British flag and under the protection of the British Crown. He also mentions the circumstance that Mr. Stanley, speaking in the British Parliament, has opposed emancipation, taking the ground that it would be unadvisable, and arguing that the slavery question of Zanzibar ought to be left in the hands of the British authorities there.

Professor Nicholson found reason to believe, upon investigation, that the yoke of the slave there was not always heavy, and that he may even be comfortable. But he refuses, and rightly so, to accept this as any justification for the system. Most of the slave traders and slave holders are Arabs; but these Arabs are subject to British law, which is the guardian of slavery. He calls for the total and immediate abolition of the slave system in Zanzibar, which flourishes under the British flag, and under the rule of the British military administrator.

And now we have from London, and naturally so, the information that the British Government is stirred up by the statements made in the report of the agent of the British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society, and has within a month past instructed the protectorate authorities at Zanzibar to take means for the speedy abolishment of the legal status of slavery.
