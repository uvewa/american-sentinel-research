# GROWTH OF SPIRITUALISM.

[A St. Louis clergyman, who wishes his name withheld, speaks as follows concerning the rapid growth of Spiritualism:—]

Don't put my name in the paper, but you may say that a clergyman who has been twenty years in the pulpit is greatly astonished at the growth of modern Spiritualism, not only in this country, but throughout the world, at the present time. It is spreading in the churches as well as outside of them. Its converts used to be entirely from the infidel and atheist classes—so much so that Spiritualism itself was ranked, and rightly so—as a species of infidelity. But now vast numbers of people who commune with Catholic and Protestant churches are believers in spiritual manifestations, and would rather give up their Christianity than abandon their Spiritualism.

The Catholic Church made a strong fight against Spiritualism, but it is unable to beat it down. Some of the more intelligent Catholics here and elsewhere are among the most ardent Spiritualists. I cannot say how they reconcile the one belief with the other, but they manage to do it—at least they hold to their Catholic faith openly and to their Spiritualistic faith secretly. And so with Methodists, Presbyterians, Baptists and Episcopalians. There is no Christian denomination to-day a part of whose membership is not tinged with Spiritualism.
