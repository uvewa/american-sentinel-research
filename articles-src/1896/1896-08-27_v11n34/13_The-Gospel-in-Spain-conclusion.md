washed away what the drought had not killed.

But while the papers are telling of this miracle wrought by San Isidro in Madrid, and by other bones or images in other places, how many really believe it? Probably a few, a very few, and those among the most ignorant. And yet the farce goes on; for no one among them all dares to be the first to voice the belief—the unbelief—in almost all their hearts.

One of the leading Roman Catholic papers laments in bitter terms the widespread national impiety mixed up in these demonstrations of loyal catholicity. It says:—

The horrible, the fearful, that which hurts and disheartens, is to see a people that is suffering the calamities that to day weigh upon Spain, forming part in a procession of penitence and of prayer in the same spirit as they would assist at a bull fight; to amuse themselves with the show, to laugh at the interruptions and the occurrences, not in the spirit of simple indifference and lack of religious interest, but with ostentatious impiety, the men with their hate on and making coarse fun of everything—one's soul revolts at the shameless speeches and the blasphemies that are heard on every hand and at every step.

The word of God is first ruled out of the church and home, so that the benighted conscience shall become the slave of the priest; then upon this ignorance and docility is reared an immense fabric of man-made rites and ceremonies, confessions and penitences, that starve the mind and dwarf the soul. Superstition is heaped upon fable until the soul reacts from the very absurdity and impossibility of the old wives' tales and the ridiculous claims of a worldly priesthood; and then naturally and inevitably follows the baldest irreligion while "following the procession" because "our fathers did so," and because the weakened soul dares not face the sneers of a churchly infidelity that finds it easier "to take things as they are" than to commence a struggle that will not end until death.

And does one wish yet to ask, "What need is there for sending evangelical missionaries to Spain?" If the picture that I have drawn is painful it is because that is the character of the facts. I have "not set down aught in malice;" I have reited the facts only for the purpose of making clear to the reader the conditions of the country from the religious point of view. No one more quickly than myself would deprecate a consecous or polemical spirit in such a matter. It is not ours to sit in judgment on our fellows; but it is our mission, in all charity and gentleness of spirit, to give to this people the gospel of Christ; if they do not want it, to press it upon them; if they revile us and persecute us, to revile not again.

Rev. W. H. Gellick.
San Sebastian, Spain.
