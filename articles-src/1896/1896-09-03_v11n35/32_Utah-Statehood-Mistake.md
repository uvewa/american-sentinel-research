A CINCINNATI daily expresses the opinion that the country will soon become aware that a serious mistake was made in the admission of Utah to Statehood. The same belief is expressed by other journals. That the Mormon Church is the predominating power in Utah, and that neither constitutionally nor historically is it opposed to the union of Church and State, are facts of sinister import in the present situation of things, beyond a doubt. But the great and overshadowing menace to American interests is that the orthodox churches of the land have a scheme under full headway to combine and do on a national scale what it is feared the Mormon Church will try to do in Utah on a small scale.
