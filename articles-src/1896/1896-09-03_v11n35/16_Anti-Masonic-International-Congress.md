AN Anti-Masonic International Congress is soon to be held in Europe, under the special auspices of the Vatican, none being allowed to participate in it except those who "profess the most absolute obedience to the Roman Catholic Church and to the pope." The papacy will in this try to impress the people with a sense of the sinfulness of allegiance to anything except itself.
