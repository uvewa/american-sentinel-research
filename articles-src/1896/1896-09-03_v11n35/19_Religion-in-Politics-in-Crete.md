"RELIGIOS in politics" is intensifying the desperate conflict between "Christian" and Turk in Crete. The evidence of this is the following statement made recently in Parliament by the English Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs:—

"The second difficulty with which we are confronted is one which it is almost impossible to escape, and that is the outbreak of religious and political animosity which unhappily prevails in the island. One day one party is the aggressor, and the next day the other party is the aggressor. It is not fair to say that in every case the Christians have been the victims. If the House could at all realize the intensity of the religious feeling which prevails, it would try and avoid taking sides."
