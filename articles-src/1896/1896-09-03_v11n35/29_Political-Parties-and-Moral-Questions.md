"What a pity it is," exclaims the Christian Statesman, of August 15, "that neither of the great political parties is willing to take a high position on great moral questions." In view of the very limited acquaintance of the great political parties with "great moral questions," we think they can hardly be blamed for not taking a high position on the same, in view of their liability to a fall.

Since both political parties cannot succeed, one or the other must fall, and in such a case it would seem a sad misfortune if it had taken a lofty position on some great moral question, since the fall would certainly reflect on the latter. Does not the reader see that great moral battles cannot be fought by any party which is liable to defeat? The battles of the Lord are not fought by the losing side; for God cannot be defeated. Such battles must be fought by faith; and faith can never know defeat.
