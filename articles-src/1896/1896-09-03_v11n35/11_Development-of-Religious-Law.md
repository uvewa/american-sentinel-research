DEVELOPMENT OF RELIGIOUS LAW.

[Present Truth (London, Eng.), Aug. 20, 1896.]

WHAT is the origin of the present development of human law for the enforcement of religion? Paul asked the Thessalonians if they did not remember that when he was with them he had told them of these things; and that they should let no man deceive them, for there should be a falling away and the man of sin be revealed, by whom the mystery of iniquity was already, even at that time, working.

The Thessalonians were to remember—and are we to forget that this was said to them?—that God was to be opposed, and there should be one who would exalt himself above God, and should, from the very temple of God itself, attempt to show that he was himself God. They were told not to forget—and are we to fail to remember?—that the iniquitous workings, then begun in secret, should at length be revealed, and that which was planned in secrecy should finally be proclaimed on the housetops.

Here was the origin of human laws for the enforcement of religion, and this subtle deceivableness of unrighteousness, which is now working with power and signs and lying wonders, is the mystery of the deeds of sin of that wicked one who will be consumed and destroyed by fire out of heaven in that last great and terrible day of the Lord.

This wicked one still works in secret and his deeds are yet a mystery to most—but not to all. That mysterious antichristian influence which has permeated the world—has invaded and corrupted churches—has, with consummate tact and diplomacy, insinuated itself into civil councils and dominated governments—is not now utterly unknown and unrecognized.

Prophecy has pointed out the progress of the mystery of iniquity, and history has recorded the fulfillment and realization of prophecy step by step, and emphasized each prophetic milestone by such unmistakable inscriptions that the most ignorant may read and comprehend. The line of march of the mysterious commander of the forces of antichrist is marked by ever increasing inroads into the confines of true religion and civil justice; while pagan observances are added to, or mingled with, methods of worship, and practiced, until they become accepted forms. Those who have resisted the encroachments of evil, and remained true to the teachings of Christ and the apostles, acknowledging no rival authority, and submitting their lives to no rule but that of God and his word, have, at the behest of this commander, filled the cells of the Inquisition, suffered under its instruments of torture, fed the flames with their flesh, and soaked the earth with their blood.

The same spirit of fraud, and violence, and force, and cruelty, and injustice, is still at work. Its field of operations is not circumscribed. It is not confined to the battle-grounds of former campaigns. Fresh fields of conquest have been opened in new worlds. The same tactics which have been so successful in former ages are still in vogue, in forms modified to suit changed social and political conditions. Religious observances, pagan and idolatrous in character, have been ingrafted into the accepted religious formality. These observances have grown and developed until they overshadow the real purpose of religion, and take the place, in the minds of their devotees, of true religion itself. The test of a profession of religion has, oftentimes, become the acceptance of the popular and accepted forms of superficial and fashionable devotion.

Not infrequently they who occupy the highest seat in the synagogue ignore Christ and his teachings, and, although they profess to accept the Word of God, deny the authority of its precepts, and affirm the authority of the traditions of men.

The pulpit has been set in the open doorway of the temple of Janus. While it remains there those doors can never be shut. From such a pulpit the gospel of force must be preached. From such a pulpit the soldier and the police constable will be accredited emissaries. Such a gospel does not persuade or convert, it subjugates; it does not convict of sin, it establishes the sinner in an hypocrisy which covers evil with an affectation of good, and imputes evil where good is.
