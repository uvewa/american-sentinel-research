INFORMATION reached us just before closing up this paper, of the arrest at Wartrace, Bedford County, Tenn., of a Seventh-day Adventist named Philpot for working on Sunday. We have not learned the particulars further than that his trial was set for the 8th of October, and he was released on his recognizance.
