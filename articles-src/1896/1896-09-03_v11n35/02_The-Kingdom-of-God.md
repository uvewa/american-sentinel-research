## THE KINGDOM OF GOD.

In these days when it is prophesied that "the kingdom of God is to enter the realm of law through the gateway of politics," and so many influential men and women are earnestly working to fulfill the prophecy, it is more than ever important that we understand the nature of that kingdom, as set forth by Him from whom all knowledge upon the subject must be derived.

The Scriptures clearly teach that under the regime of sin and evil which has prevailed in the earth since man's fall, and will prevail while this world remains, the kingdom of God cannot be a visible kingdom. This is contrary to the idea which has in all ages been cherished by many professed followers of Christ; but it is the truth, notwithstanding. The idea that the kingdom of God was to be forcibly set up as a visible, glorious kingdom among the other kingdoms of earth, was cherished by the apostles themselves, and was the very last of their false notions to be given up. It was only after a most bitter and trying experience that they did so.

At one time, we read, as Christ was on his way to Jerusalem, accompanied by his disciples, "he added and spake a parable, . . . because they thought that the kingdom of God should immediately appear." Luke 19:11. The parable was that of the nobleman who went into a far country to receive a kingdom, and to return; and by it he taught that the kingdom is not to appear until the return of the nobleman; that is, until the return of Christ, which will be at his second coming in the clouds of heaven.

At another time the Pharisees came to him and asked him when the kingdom of God should come? The Pharisees and all the Jews were looking eagerly for the restoration of the kingdom of David and deliverance from the yoke of Rome. In reply the Saviour said, "The kingdom of God cometh not with observation; neither shall they say, Lo, here! or, lo there! for behold, the kingdom of God is within you." Luke 17:20, 21. It is directly against this plain declaration that men and women are zealously working to-day in Christ's name. They are striving to make the kingdom of God come with observation. They are trying to give it a triumphal entry "through the gateway of politics." There is nothing more conspicuous to-day than events which come as the result of political agitation. The political arena is the cynosure of all eyes. Nothing can issue out of that place without attracting world-wide notice.

Such efforts must result in utter failure; for the word of God cannot fail. "The kingdom of heaven cometh not with observation." The nature of that kingdom has not changed since the days of the apostles. The kingdom of God is within the hearts of those who, in spirit and in truth, worship God. The kingdom is now the kingdom of grace, and men enter into it through faith. When faith comes into the heart, the kingdom of God comes with it. The individual's allegiance is transferred from the author of sin to the Author of righteousness. The heart becomes the temple of God, the habitation of his throne.

When the grace of God has done its work,—when all have received it who will, and the "mystery of God" is finished—Jesus Christ will leave the Sanctuary in heaven, where he is now High Priest before the heavenly mercy seat (Heb. 8:1, 2), and will "appear the second time," in the clouds of heaven, unto the salvation of those that look for him. Heb. 9:28. And when he shall appear in his glory then will his saints also appear in glory, both those who have died in faith and also "we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord." 1 Thess. 4:15. Then will the kingdom of God become a visible kingdom of glory.

But how insignificant will then appear the schemes of misguided men to usher in that awful and sublime condition, through politics. Let Christians and all men turn from earthly vanities unto the living God, and by the power of God unto salvation, manifested in their lives, hasten the answer to the prayer, "Thy kingdom come."
