REPRESENTATIVES of the Greek, Anglican, Old Catholic, and Protestant churches recently held a meeting in Vienna, at which a resolution was passed unanimously protesting against the claim of the Pope to be the source of healing for Christendom, and against other assumptions of the papal church. The convention was designed as an offset to the Pope's late encyclical to Hungary.
