## THE EASTERN FERMENT.

[New York Journal, August 22, 1896.]

ZANZIBAR and Constantinople are some distance apart, but fighting in both places on the same day helps to show how comprehensive the Eastern question is, and how full of sinister possibilities. Indeed, it is no longer the Eastern question, but the world question—at least the question of the Old World. It cannot be localized now at one end of the Mediterranean, as it could forty years ago. While there are riots in Constantinople, revolutions in Macedonia, Crete, and the Lebanon, and massacres in Armenia, there is a war of diplomacy in Egypt which shades into a war of troupe in the Soudan. This carries us to the regions of the Abyssinian armed truce and the rival expeditions of the French and the Congo State. Then we find ourselves at the scene of the Uganda dispute, which is closely connected with the disturbed politics of Zanzibar. This takes us by insensible degrees to the theater of the Matabele war and the Transvaal crisis.

Again, starting eastward from the storm center on the Bosphorus, through Persia, Afghanistan, Turkestan, and China, we find one diplomatic entanglement linked with another until the rising power of Japan comes into view, and the Eastern question is merged into the question of the Far East.

Yesterday's affair in Constantinople was like some of the "race wars" that used to flourish in the South. "July 1. A horde of infuriated negroes is advancing upon the town, with the supposed intention of massacring all the white inhabitants. The whites are arming in self-defense." "July 2. The riotous negroes were attacked in their cabins yesterday and routed. Fifteen of them were killed. No white men were injured." The Armenian riots were supposed to have been begun by Armenian revolutionists. The result was that several hundred of these dangerous Armenians were killed. Later accounts may make the number some thousands.

It is a pity that it took some bloodshed to convince the natives of Zanzibar that they were really British subjects. Ever since the partition of 1890, by which England and Germany agreed to help each other to the territories of the Sultan of Zanzibar, it has been generally understood that England would take the island whenever she got ready. Its government has been administered by British officials for the past five years. There is a little coy hesitation in London about proclaiming a formal annexation, but this modesty will doubtless be overcome, and it is well that it should be. The Sultanate of Zanzibar has been a nest of slave trading whose suppression would end more human misery than anything else except the destruction of the Turkish Empire. And that may not be long delayed either.
