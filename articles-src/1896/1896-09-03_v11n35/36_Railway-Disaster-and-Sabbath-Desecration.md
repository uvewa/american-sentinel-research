A WRITER in the Christian Statesman, of August 22, speaking of the railway disaster at Logan, Iowa, July 12, reverts to the overthrow of Pharaoh's host in the Red Sea, and says: "Both of these sad providences were simply the voice of an angry God, speaking in thunder against Sabbath desecration." This goes a step further than anything we have seen before in the nature of an appeal to credulity.
