## CHRISTIANS AND CIVIL GOVERNMENT.

We have been asked the question, Does not the fact that the Christian is an ambassador for Christ debar him from any rightful participation in civil affairs?

An affirmative view of this question is held by some individuals, and sought to be supported by a parallel drawn with respect to the position of an ambassador from one earthly government to another. At first glance the position seems to be well taken; but a moment's candid reflection shows that the parallel does not hold good.

In the first place, the Christian is not an ambassador for Christ to any government on earth, but only to individuals. He is sent to beseech individuals, not governments, to become reconciled to God. 2 Cor. 5:20. His mission is not to induce men to transfer their allegiance from civil government to God, who has himself ordained it, but to renounce the service of Satan, the god of this world, and to give their allegiance to the God of heaven.

Secondly, the parallel destroys itself. For it is the whole business of the Christian as such to persuade those whom he meets to become subjects of another government, that is, the kingdom of Christ. What would be thought of the conduct of an ambassador to this country who would devote his time to the work of persuading Americans to become subjects of the government which he represented? It would certainly be deemed a most outrageous interference in our civil affairs. The Christian, from the standpoint of those who make use of this parallel, is required to violate in the most flagrant manner the principle which debars the ambassador of one government from meddling in the internal affairs of another.

All Christians know that Christianity is not against the interests of any good government, but for those interests. The conversion of an individual to Christianity does not in the least interfere with his performance of those duties which spring from the relationships of civil society. The more real Christians any country has in it the better for that country. The stigma of working against the interests of civil government does not rest upon the Christian ambassador. The sphere of civil government is entirely distinct from that of Christianity; action in one of these does not in the least interfere with action in the other. Hence renunciation of the duties and principles which relate to one is not demanded by participation in the affairs of the other.
