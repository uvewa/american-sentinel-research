THE Western Watchman says:—

The Holy Father has written to Cardinal Vaughan to the effect that the church cannot look with indifference upon the present agitation in England for the abolition of the canonical impediment of affinity in the first degree, involved in the proposed repeal of the Deceased Wife's Sister Bill. We would much prefer that Tory Catholics would settle their own political squabbles without dragging the Holy Father into them.

This criticism leveled professedly at "Tory Catholics," belongs in reality to the Pope, who, while professing non-interference in political affairs, is a most inveterate meddler everywhere.
