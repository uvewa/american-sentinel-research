MRS. ISABELLA BISHOP, a well-known missionary traveller, who has recently spent some time in Western China, reports that the hostility to missionaries has greatly increased since the forced payment by the Western provinces of heavy damages to the Christian missions for the destruction of their property in the riots two years ago. The kingdom of Christ is not advanced by physical force.
