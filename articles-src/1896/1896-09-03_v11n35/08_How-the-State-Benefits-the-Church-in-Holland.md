## HOW THE STATE BENEFITS:? THE CHURCH IN HOLLAND.

"It is a sad picture," says the New York Observer, of the 20th ult., "which the Rev. Herman Vanderwart gives in the Christian Intelligencer, of the State Church of Holland. He says:—

The State Church of Holland is just about the same as of old. There is very little life to it. The majority of her pulpits still preach a sort of refined rationalism, placing great stress on ethics and forms. The real religious life finds stronger expression in the Christian Reformed Church of the kingdom, which grows year by year in strength and composes the backbone of the people. It grew out of a reaction against the rationalistic teachings of the State Church, and is to day the church of Holland's future. It has just completed some three years ago, a union with another small body which revolted against the teachings of the old church, and presents a united front against the inroads of dead orthodoxy and pernicious rationalism. Its synod meets triennially at different places. This year it convenes, August 11, at Middelburgh, in Zeeland, where I hope to go and convey the fraternal greetings of our church, in company with Dr. Bishop, of Orange, and the Rev. B. Van Ess, of Roseland. The masses which have been baptized and trained in the old State Church are more and more drifting away from all church influences. They care very little for religion, the Bible is no longer of any authority, and God's Sabbath is turned into a full holiday. That's the plain truth. It only shows the old saying that when once you begin to unravel the smallest stitches, you won't have any seams left at all.

"A solemn warning, surely," says the Observer, "is to be found in the story here told. Alas that it is all true as others besides Mr. Vanderwart can and do testify." But will the Observer based the warning? If we mistake not our contemporary is among those who insist upon State support of the Church in the matter of Sunday laws, State-paid chaplains, exemption of church property from taxation, etc. They simply carry the matter a little farther in Holland.
