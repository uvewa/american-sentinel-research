"The Anglican papers are indignant," remarks a Catholic paper, "because the pope in his encyclical on the reunion of Christendom did not abate one jot or tittle of Rome's traditional pretensions. They are willing to meet the pope half-way; but they will not consent to a plan which contemplates all sacrifice on one side and none on the other." But Rome can make no sacrifice without abandoning everything. She is either the Church to the exclusion of all other bodies called churches, or she is and has long been a base pretender.
