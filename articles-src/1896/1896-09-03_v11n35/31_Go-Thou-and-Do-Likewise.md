Go Thou and Do Likewise.

WHAT could not be done by the lovers of religious freedom if only a little effort were put forth by each one with the means which this paper affords them? As a pertinent suggestion upon this point, we print the following letter received last week from a subscriber whose attention was attracted by our special offer of Bibles as given on our advertising page:—

Battle Creek, Mich., Aug. 23, 1896.

PUBLISHERS OF SENTINEL:—Seeing in the SENTINEL your offer of a Bible as a premium "for seven new names," etc., and being in want of a Bible, I concluded to make an effort. I succeeded pretty well; when, learning of a worthy unfortunate who had no Bible, I concluded to make a still further attempt, and the result was the enclosed list of (with very few exceptions) new names.

Following was a list of twenty-one names for one year, four more for six months, and one for three months. Is there not in this a suggestion worth heeding by many of our readers? Could not many of them do as much with a little effort? Is not the reason so little is being done in presenting the great issues of the day before the people, the widespread individual neglect of the little that each one might do as well as not? Why not put forth a little effort in the line of that so successfully made by our correspondent? Think of it, readers. TRY IT.
