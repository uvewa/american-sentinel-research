THE Armenian Revolutionary Society are to the front again with serious disturbances in Constantinople and Galata. On August 26, an armed body of these revolutionists entered and took possession of the Ottoman Bank, where they remained during the day, shooting at the police and firing bombs into the streets, killing and wounding passers by. The next morning they surrendered, and stated that the purpose of the riot was to secure reforms. The immediate result, as reported, was extensive damage to property and the loss of several hundred lives, mostly those of Armenians.
