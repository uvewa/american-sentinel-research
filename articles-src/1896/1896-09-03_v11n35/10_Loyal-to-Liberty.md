## LOYAL TO LIBERTY.

A TOURING story is told of General Marion, "the Swamp Fox," of revolutionary fame. As the story runs, a British officer was sent to the rude camp of General Marion, located in the swamps of North Carolina, for the purpose of negotiating an exchange of prisoners. When the officer came to dine with General Marion and his staff, all they sat down to was a peck of sweet potatoes, baked in the ashes and served on a log. The English officer commented on the poverty of the fare, but was told that it was better than usual.

"But your pay is good?" inquired the English officer.

"I have never received a dollar for my services, nor my people," replied the General.

"What motive, what stimulus, have you for fighting then?" inquired the astonished Englishman.

"We fight for love of liberty," responded Marion.

The story adds that the officer was so impressed by this devotion to the cause of American liberty that he returned to Charleston and resigned his commission.

Such examples of devotion to the cause of political liberty have been numerous and have not been confined to one nation nor to one age. But in the cause of religious freedom there have appeared the most striking examples of devotion to truth. Neither privation, Sendish torture, nor death have been able to quench the spirit of loyalty to divine truth in the breasts of men. The early Christians were true to their convictions in the presence of the flame, and the fury of the hungry beasts. Albigenses, Waldenses, Lollards, Hussites, Huguenots, German Princes, Baptists and Quakers, each in turn suffered and fought the battle for liberty of conscience. To-day the Stundists of Russia and the anti-revolutionary portion of the Armenians, are choosing exile and death rather than surrender their religious convictions.

There is another class of patient, loyal sufferers whom the world does not generally recognize as yet, who are making a heroic struggle for religious liberty. These are the Seventh-day Adventists who have been called to suffer in prison and chain-gangs for their faith. First they sacrifice the most valuable business day of the week to their convictions, and then for a failure to sacrifice another day to the opinions of their neighbors, they are fined, their property sold by the sheriff to pay costs, and imprisoned or worked with criminals in the chain-gang. Their fortitude, the joyfulness with which they take the spoiling of their goods, separation from family and friends, the disgrace of the cell or the chain-gang and the associations with the vile, is a spectacle to inspire one amidst this compromising, trimming, time-serving age of ours.

For the purpose of aiding these oppressed people, and promulgating the Christian principles of liberty of conscience, the International Religious Liberty Association was organized. It is supported by members who pay one dollar a year as a membership fee; and by donations from sympathizing friends of religious liberty, some of whom, while they do not endorse the religious practices of these persecuted people, yet desire to aid them in the struggle for freedom, realizing that if religious liberty may be abridged in the case of this humble minority, it may be in any case.

Many of the members of the organization are poor, and the self-denial manifested in many cases to secure funds to donate to its work, is hardly second to the devotion of those called upon to suffer for their faith in prisons and chain-gangs. One in the position of secretary of the Association can but be impressed, much as was General Marion's English visitor, with this self-sacrificing devotion to the cause of liberty, and with the fruitlessness of any attempt to quench it by persecution.

A man of sixty cuts cord-wood in the summer's sun to obtain money to send to the Association; a man of seventy in his poverty cultivates a row of tomatoes and realises three dollars and a half which he donates; a widow sends a dollar earned by washing for her neighbors; one sends two dollars, and writes: "I am sixty-six years old and very feeble and have only thirty-one cents. left. . . . But I know He will put more means in my hands if I use what I have to his glory."

How utterly useless it is for mortal men to attempt to stamp from the breasts of their fellow-men this immortal God-breathed principle,—love of liberty.
