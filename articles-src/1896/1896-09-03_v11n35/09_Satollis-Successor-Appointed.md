## SAVOLLI'S SUCCESSOR APPOINTED.

A DISPATCH from Rome, under date of August 22, says:—

The diplomatic career of Father Sebastiano Martinelli, second Delegate Apostolic in the United States, will begin here to morrow under unusually brilliant auspices. In the Bistina Chapel of the Vatican, the scene of so many famous and historic ceremonies, the erstwhile humble prior of the Augustinians will be placed to the archiepiscopal dignity. At the conclusion of this impressive rite Cardinal Rampolla, the Papal Secretary of State, will bestow on the newly consecrated prince of the church his commission as Leo's representative in America.

The text of this commission cannot fail to be interesting to all your American readers, particularly since it departs from the usual formula to bestow warm praise on the retiring delegate, Cardinal Satolli. It reads as follows:—

"Venerable Brother: The post of Delegate Apostolic in the United States of North America having become vacant by the promotion to the sacred purple of His Eminence Cardinal Satolli, who, by his great work has merited this mark of our esteem, we, holding you in our very especial affection and seeing in you the qualities to carry on and perfect the work begun by our beloved son, His Eminence Cardinal Satolli, do benignly nominate you to that vacant post.

"By virtue of our apostolic authority and by virtue of these present letters, we do further elect, make and declare you to be the second Delegate Apostolic to the United States of America at the good will of ourselves and this Holy See. We grant you all and singular the powers necessary for the carrying on of such delegation.

"We command all whom it concerns to recognize in you as Apostolic Delegate the supreme power of the delegating pontiff.

"We command that they give you aid, concurrence and obedience in all things, that they receive with reverence your salutary admonitions and orders. Whatever sentence or penalty you shall declare or inflict against those who oppose your authority we will ratify, and with the authority invested in us by the Lord, will cause the same to be observed inviolably until condign satisfaction be made, notwithstanding constitutions and apostolic ordinances or any other thing to the contrary.

"Leo XIII.

"Given at Rome, on the twenty-third day of August, eighteen hundred and nine six, in the nineteenth year of our pontificate."

It does not appear upon the face of this commission that the appointment of Martinelli has any reference to the desire of Rome to establish diplomatic relations with this Government, but doubtless that long-cherished scheme is still dear to the heart of Leo XIII. and will be cherished in the Vatican until such time as public sentiment shall make it possible of accomplishment. Let not Americans relax their vigilance.
