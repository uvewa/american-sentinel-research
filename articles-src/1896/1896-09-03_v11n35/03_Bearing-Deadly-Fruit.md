## BEARING DEADLY FRUIT.

THAT "religion in politics," as illustrated in the present campaign, leads directly to the position of the party who are clamoring for religious legislation by State and nation, is evident to a prominent representative of that party, the pastor of St. Paul's M. E. Church, Philadelphia. In the Christian Statesman of Aug. 22, he says:—

Especially will the prominence the money discussions on both sides give to moral considerations open the way for Christian ethics. If only in private conversation with friends be sure to follow up a moral appeal with the value of the Christian amendment. No circumstances can be more favorable than the present conflict. Already the rhetorical figures are of sacred subjects and the fiery appeals to God's higher laws of Christian equity and brotherhood. If all who believe in the Christian amendment will earnestly agitate, the convictions on the subject will most rapidly grow and bear fruit.

It is "National Reform" fruit that will surely be borne upon the Upas tree of religion in politics.
