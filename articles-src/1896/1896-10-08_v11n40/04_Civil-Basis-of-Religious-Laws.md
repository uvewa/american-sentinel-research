## CIVIL BASIS OF RELIGIOUS LAWS.

As is so forcibly shown by the accompanying illustrations, modern dissenters from the prevailing religious faith and practice of the people, whether in Russia, or in our own country, are not punished ostensibly for their faith, but as violators of civil law and enemies of stable government.

Nor is this peculiar to modern times. "Heretics" have ever been stigmatized as enemies of the State, subverters of social order, and disturbers of the public peace.

Ahab's wicked accusation, contained in the question to Elijah: "Art thou he that troubleth Israel?" has been repeated in various forms in every country and in every age from that time until the present.

When Daniel was accused to the king because he prayed three times a day contrary to a royal mandate, the accusation was in these words: "Daniel, which is of the children of the captivity of Judah, regardeth not thee, O king, nor the decree that thou hast signed." His violation of the law of the realm was held to be subversive of social order, and his example to be pernicious in the extreme.

The Son of God was accused "as one that perverteth the people," and the prevailing argument with Pilate for his condemnation was, 'If thou let this man go, thou art not Caesar's friend: whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar.' Religious bigotry simply invoked against Christ the penalties of the civil law. He suffered ostensibly, not as a heretic, not as a defamer of religion, but as an enemy of the State.

The apostles were also accused of being disturbers of the peace. At Thessalonica the cry was, "These that have turned the world upside down are come hither also; whom Jason hath received; and these all do contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, one Jesus." And at Ephesus, the silversmiths raised a tumult because their craft was endangered by the preaching of the apostles. Nor were their fears groundless. The danger which they saw threatening their business really existed; so close was the relation between the prevailing faith and the social and commercial customs of the people. Thus they plausibly argued that there existed a substantial civil basis for the legal prohibition of the preaching of the doctrine of Christ.

In our own day similar arguments are urged in justification of intolerance. As shown by one of our illustrations and the accompanying quotation from Mr. Botkine, Russia affords an excellent example of practical application of the logic of intolerance; and even in our own country the attempt has been made to justify various measures of religious legislation and the enforcement of religious laws, on the ground that the stability of our institutions and even of the Government itself depends upon the maintenance of our religion. This is especially true of Sunday laws. In a tract, "The American Sabbath," published by the Presbyterian Board of Publication, Rev. Robert Patterson, D. D., says of Sunday:—

It is the right of the State to protect by law such a fundamental support of government. This attack on the sabbath is treason against the very foundation of government. As such, let it be resisted by every American citizen. The American sabbath is essential to American liberty, to our Republic, and to God's religion.

To the same import is the quotation from Dr. Crafts under one of our illustrations. But such "argument," however plausible it may seem, would justify all the persecutions of the past, as well as the intolerance of Russia, and revive the bloody scenes of the Dark Ages.

It is in harmony with this theory that in several of the States of this Union, God-fearing Sabbatarians have been arrested, tried, convicted, and punished by fines, imprisonment, and chain-gangs, for no other reason than because they could not conscientiously observe as the Sabbath the day regarded by their neighbors as sacred.

One of our illustrations shows a gang of Seventh-day Adventist "convicts" at work on one of the abutments of a bridge near Spring City, Rhea County, Tenn., July, 1895. In passing sentence upon these men, some of whom had just been convicted for the second time within six months, Judge Parks, before whom they were tried, said:—

I will take occasion to express again my sincere personal regret that the necessity exists for inflicting punishment upon these people, for it must be patent to even the most casual observer that they are good citizens, who are thoroughly conscientious in the course they have taken.

Members of this same communion have been prosecuted—persecuted we might say—by means of the Sunday statutes of several different States, though most of these cases have arisen in Tennessee and Maryland. And at the present time, B. A. Philpot, a Seventh-day Adventist, of Rutherford County, Tenn., is under indictment at Murfreesborough, and will be tried on the 19th inst., for quiet Sunday work which in no way interfered with his neighbors, except it may have been by offending against their ideas of religious propriety respecting proper Sunday observance.

We are sure that our readers will agree with us that these things ought not so to be and that any system of reasoning which justifies such things is misleading, and therefore wrong.
