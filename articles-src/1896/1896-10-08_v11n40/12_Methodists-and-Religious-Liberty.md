## METHODISTS AND RELIGIOUS LIBERTY.

No people ought to be more tolerant than the Methodists, for few people have, in modern times, suffered more for conscience' sake than they.

John Wesley himself was repeatedly mobbed and arrested, and was even indicted in due form, ostensibly for violation of civil law, but really because of his religious faith and practice.

In the early days of Methodism it was customary in England to seize men, and compel them to serve either in the army or navy. On one occasion "Meriton [a Methodist preacher] himself was impressed, and his companion escaped only by running from street to street, and finally taking refuge at a private house, where he was compassionately locked up in a closet till midnight, when, disguised in female dress, he made his way out of the town, passing sentinels who were appointed to watch for him on the bridge. John Bennet, another itinerant, was 'impressed' with three of his lay brethren in Cheshire."

The same author tells that "a humble Cornish preacher was pulled down by a constable while preaching at Corlam and borne off to the House of Correction at Bodmin. A warrant was gotten out for John Wesley himself in Cornwall." Mr. Wesley was not held, however, on this occasion. The officers finding him a well-bred gentleman and a clergyman instead of a rowdy, permitted him to go.

Thomas Welsh, another Methodist preacher, was mobbed and imprisoned in Ireland as a "turbulent person," but really for preaching the gospel. He was arrested at one of his own meetings and conducted to the magistrate, "who demanded a promise that he would preach no more. He refused and was sent away to prison."

Charles Wesley was, on one occasion, indicted as a vagabond. This remarkable presentment still stands on the city records and declares that "we find and present Charles Wesley to be a person of ill-fame, a vagabond, and a common disturber of his majesty's peace, and pray that he may be transported." Nine of his associates were denounced in the same terms. The indictment was not sustained.

John Wesley was indicted in Savannah, Georgia, in 1737, one of the counts in the indictment being that he had "broken the laws of the realm, contrary to the peace of our sovereign lord the king, his crown and dignity by speaking and writing to Mrs. Williamson against her husband's consent." This case was never brought to trial, but Mr. Wesley was kept as a kind of "prisoner-at-large," until finally, tiring of the delay, he returned to England.

On another occasion in England Mr. Wesley was imprisoned for three months for debt, his enemies taking advantage of temporary financial embarrassment to persecute him.

This recital of persecution of Methodists might be continued almost indefinitely, for the chapter of the wrongs they suffered is a long one; but space forbids a continuation of it at present. We are only sorry that too many Methodists have forgotten their early experience and to the extent of their ability, and so far as the more liberal laws under which we now live permit, stand ready to harass and persecute those whose faith and practice now differ from theirs, as theirs formerly differed from that of the majority. Nevertheless, we do not believe that history has been written in vain, and we have confidence that there are not wanting many honest hearts who are still loyal to the principles of civil- and religious liberty for which the early Methodists contended so earnestly.
