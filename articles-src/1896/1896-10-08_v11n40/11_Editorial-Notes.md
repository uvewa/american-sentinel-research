## Editorial Notes

ANY ONE RECEIVING THE AMERICAN SENTINEL without having ordered it may know that it is sent to him by some friend. Therefore, those who have not ordered the SENTINEL need have no fears that they will be asked to pay for it.

THAT which contravenes natural rights instead of guaranteeing them is usurpation and not legitimate, God-ordained authority; "for rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil."

CIVIL government is ordained of God, but so are its limitations. "We hold these truths to be self-evident; that all men . . . are endowed by THEIR CREATOR with certain unalienable rights; that to secure these rights governments are instituted among men."

THE POPE has been chosen by Hayti and San Domingo to arbitrate a dispute between them respecting boundary lines. In view of this the Catholic Review, of October 3, exclaims, "Would that all disagreements among peoples were peacefully submitted to the impartial and enlightened adjudication of the Common Father of Christendom." Such is one of the Papacy's cherished hopes.

THE NEW "apostolic" delegate from Rome to the United States, Monsignor Martinelli, arrived in New York, October 3. The Catholic press of the country seems to be divided in opinion respecting the position the papal delegate will hold in this country, the Freeman's Journal asserting that his authority will be even greater than that exercised by his predecessor, Satolli.

"EXCEPT in the nation of Israel, it is not, and never has been, personal sovereigns in themselves that have been referred to in the statement that 'the powers that be are ordained of God.' It is not the persons that be in power, but the powers that be in the person, that are ordained of God. The inquiry of Rom. 13:3 is not, Wilt thou then not be afraid of the person? but it is, 'Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power?' It is not the person, therefore, but the power that is represented in the person, that is under consideration."

"FULL religious liberty," remarks the New York Sun, in its "Spanish-American News," "exists in Mexico, and it is foolish to attach any significance to the deeds of the brawlers who smashed the windows of a Protestant church and college in the city of Aguas Calientes. The riot was a small one, and its leaders were arrested. It was just such an outbreak as may occur anywhere at a moment of excitement. There are over a hundred Protestant churches in Mexico which hold services and engage in mission work without any disturbance, and the government of President Diaz has always manifested its determination to maintain the rights of all denominations."

It is indeed true that a large measure of religious liberty is enjoyed in Mexico, and whatever restrictions there are, owe their existence to the aggressions of Rome.

AN ADDRESS "To the Christian Citizens of the United States," has been sent out through the country as the result of a mass meeting of Christian people, held recently in Chicago, and presided over by Evangelist D. L. Moody, for the purpose of considering the present unsettled condition of affairs in the nation politically and socially. The address earnestly invites Christians of all denominations to unite in observing October 8, as a day of fasting, confession, and prayer to God, for divine assistance in dealing with the issues which demand settlement at this time.
