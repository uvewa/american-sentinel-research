## A CHAPTER FROM VIRGINIA HISTORY.

### BY ALLEN MOON.

The historian informs us that "finding that argument availed them little, the friends of the Episcopacy [in Virginia] drew the sword of persecution. It is believed that at this period (1768) no express statute of Virginia authorized the imprisonment of any man for preaching without being ordained or being licensed according to the Act of Toleration; but pretexts have never been wanting for religious cruelty.

"In June, 1768, John Waller, Lewis Craig, and James Childs, all zealous Baptists, were seized by the sheriff in the county of Spott-sylvania and carried before three magistrates who stood ready in the yard of the meetinghouse. The victims were bound over to appear at court two days afterwards, and when they appeared accordingly they were told they should be released if they would promise to preach no more in the county for a year and a day. This they positively refused to do, and they were immediately ordered to jail." A well-supported tradition has told us that when these three Baptists were brought to trial at Fredericksburg, the prosecuting attorney had drawn up an indictment against them 'for preaching the gospel contrary to law.'

"Patrick Henry had heard of the case, and he rode fifty miles to hear more.

"He kept his seat while the indictment was being read, and while the prosecutor opened the case, then rising, he solemnly addressed the court: 'May it please your worships, What did I hear read? Did I hear it distinctly, or was it a mistake of my own? Did I hear an expression that these men whom your worships are about to try for misdemeanor, are charged with preaching the gospel of the Son of God?'

"The tone, the manner, the subject, sent an indescribable thrill to every heart. Then, continuing, the orator carried home the appeal with such power that the prosecuting attorney turned pale with agitation and the court was hardly restrained from directing the sheriff at once to discharge the prisoners. Yet even Patrick Henry was not strong enough to arrest the tyranny caused by an established church.

"In Middlesex and Caroline counties many Baptist ministers were arrested and confined. They were lodged in jails swarming with vermin, and were treated like criminals; yet their spirits were buoyant, and persecution did nothing but increase the zeal and numbers of the sect. Insult was then offered to their ministers during service, and frequently mounted men would ride into the water while they were administering immersion, and attempt to turn the ceremony into a farce. In 1772 a letter appeared in the Virginia Gazette, addressed to Anataptists imprisoned in Caroline County. The writer justifies their imprisonment on the basis, not of any statute, but of English common law. He charges them with teaching heresy and hateful doctrines, and with disturbing the peace of religion. He admits that the English Act of Toleration applies to the colony, but denies that the Baptists are entitled to its benefits."*

The above reads so like a chapter of the recent history of Tennessee, Georgia and other States, in their treatment of Adventists, that the latter seems almost like a continuation of the same revolting details.

The excuse for prosecuting these people is as transparent, and the act as unjustifiable, as were those of the Episcopal Church toward the Baptists of a hundred years ago. And though a people may be misguided, the principle remains the same. It will not answer to say the Baptists were right and the Adventists are wrong.

He is no friend of religious liberty who is satisfied with liberty only for himself, but he is the true friend of liberty who is anxious that every other man shall enjoy equal liberty with himself no matter how greatly the other man may differ from him religiously.

Patrick Henry was an Episcopalian, and his church enjoyed the favor of the State in 1768 when he went to defend the Baptists who were being persecuted by his own people for preaching contrary to the established faith. Where are the descendants of these Baptists now? Are they satisfied that liberty has been accorded them to preach baptism by immersion and all other doctrines of the gospel as they understand them? Baptists believe that the men who persecuted them were fighting against God.

Suppose it should finally appear that Adventists too were reformers and that God had called them to preach the restoration of the Sabbath of the Bible, will they be any more excusable for the part that some have enacted toward these people because the States have retained upon their statute books some of the religious laws enacted during the period of religious establishment, or even that have been since enacted? Oh, for more Patrick Henrys to defend the principles of religious liberty, and to stand for justice for all mankind.

How the religion of Jesus Christ would appeal to the better judgment of men if only those professing faith in it would live out its teaching before the world.
