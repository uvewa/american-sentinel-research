## SOME FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES.

It is a fundamental principle recognized by all Christians that "we ought to obey God rather than men,"¹ and that civil government cannot of right have any jurisdiction over the conscience.

In a memorial to the General Assembly of Virginia in 1776, the Presbytery of Hanover together with the Baptists and Quakers of the colony, said:—

The duty which we owe to our Creator, and the manner of discharging it, can only be directed by reason and conviction, and is nowhere cognizable but at the tribunal of the Universal Judge.

Statesmen too have recognized this principle. Said that noble Kentuckian, Hon. Richard M. Johnson:—

The framers of the Constitution recognized the eternal principle that man's relation with his God is above human legislation, and his rights of Conscience inalienable.²

Even unbelievers in the Christian religion recognize the same great truth. Said Paine:—

Who art thou, by whatever name thou art called, whether a king, a bishop, a State, a parliament, or anything else, vain dust and ashes, that obtruded thine insignificance between the soul of man and his Maker? Mind thine own concerns. If he believed not as thou believed, it is a proof that thou believed not as he believed, and there is no earthly power can determine between you.³

Almost every American constitution, both State and national, recognizes this right, not only conceded but insisted upon by both believer and skeptic. The constitution of Tennessee provides that "no human authority can, in any case whatever, control or interfere with the rights of conscience; and that no preference shall be given by law to any religious establishment or mode of worship."

The Georgia Declaration of Fundamental Rights says: "Perfect freedom of religious sentiment shall be, and the same is hereby, secured."

The Maryland Declaration of Rights provides that, "No person ought, by any law, to be molested in his person or estate on account of his religious persuasion or profession, or for his religious practice."

Other similar provisions might be quoted, for, as before remarked, almost every American constitution contains similar guarantees of freedom of conscience.

But how much do these provisions mean? Do they guarantee freedom of belief merely? or are they designed also to insure freedom of action? If only the former they are meaningless. Protestants, Catholics and Liberals, with one voice declare that liberty of conscience implies liberty of action. Says the A. P. A. Magazine for October:—

Freedom of worship is not enjoyed while those who come out from Rome are bounded, persecuted, and mobbed. . . Freedom of worship is not enjoyed when men and women are coerced into believing and doing certain things which they otherwise would not.

In like manner Priest Lambert, in his "Notes on Ingersoll, says:—

The right to give an honest thought implies the right to realize that thought in action and habit. If it means less than this, it means simply the right to gabble like an idiot.

To the same purpose is the testimony of Mill, who, in discussing this subject, says that from liberty of thought it is impossible to separate liberty of action.⁴

## The Principle Violated.

But though so generally recognized in theory, the principle of religious liberty is frequently violated in practice. This is particularly true of laws requiring the observance of Sunday. In Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Maryland, Tennessee, Georgia, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Florida, honest, God-fearing men, good neighbors, and worthy citizens, have been haled before courts, and in several of the States named have been fined, imprisoned, and worked in chain-gangs for refusing to do a thing not in accordance with their faith, namely, for refusing to keep Sunday after having rested on the previous day, according to the letter and spirit of the fourth commandment, as they sincerely believed. (See pages 316, 317.)

It is of course claimed by some that these men were imprisoned only for violating the civil law; they were not victims of religious persecution, but of their own temerity in deliberately transgressing the laws of the land. In deciding one of these cases carried to the United States Circuit Court on writ of habeas corpus, Judge Hammond said, in Memphis, August, 1891:—

Sectarian freedom of religious belief is guaranteed by the constitution [of Tennessee], not in the sense argued here, that King as a Seventh-day Adventist, or some other as a Jew, or yet another as a Seventh-day Baptist, might set at defiance the prejudices, if you please, of other sects having control of legislation in the matter of Sunday observance, but only in the sense that he should not himself be disturbed in the practices of his creed.

But is it not evident that this comes far short of the guarantee contained in the Tennessee Bill of Rights, and of even the popular conception of religious liberty? As we have already seen, the A. P. A. Magazine says freedom of worship is not enjoyed when men and women are "coerced into" doing certain things "which they would not otherwise." In his opinion, Judge Hammond assumes that the constitution of Tennessee does not contain any guarantee against such compulsion, but only assures the citizen against interference with the practices of his own creed. He may be required to conform in some measure to the creeds of others, but this is held to be no interference with his religious liberty so long as he is permitted to practice his own creed!

## How They Regard the Sabbath.

But as a matter of fact it is a part of the creed of the Seventh-day Adventists not only to observe the seventh day as the Sabbath, but not to so observe any other day. Seventh-day Adventists do not hold that the fourth commandment requires that a man shall actually work six days of each week whether he has anything to do or not; but they do believe that the fourth commandment establishes a difference between days, that it separates the seventh day from all other days of the week—just as the stamp of the Government upon a piece of gold or silver, or other metal, separates and distinguishes that piece of metal from all other pieces of metal, not similarly stamped by the same authority—and that a Christian is required to respect that distinction; and that just as it would be a crime for anyone to place a similar stamp to that of the Government upon another piece of metal, making it resemble a United States' coin, or to use such a piece of metal after it has been stamped by another, so it is sin to make another day resemble the Sabbath, or to use such a counterfeit after it has been made by another.

But it may be said that the line must be drawn somewhere, that it is evident that a man cannot be permitted to do whatever his conscience tells him is right for him to do. What rule, then, can be adopted which will preserve the authority of the State and yet not trench upon the rights of conscience?

The question thus raised is well answered by the words of Christ: "Render unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's." It is also answered by a clause in the constitution of the State of Maryland: "No person ought, by any law, to be molested in his person or estate on account of his religious persuasion or profession, or for his religious practice, unless under color of religion, he shall disturb the good order, peace or safety of the State, . . . or injure others in their natural, civil, or religious rights." In this the line is drawn just where it should be, namely, at the equal rights of others. Under this provision the courts are not called upon to judge any man's conscience, but only to judge whether or not his conscience leads him to infringe the equal rights of his fellowmen. That a man's conscience is just what he says it is, no man has either right or occasion to deny. A man's statement of his conscience is an end of controversy; but it does not follow that one has a right to do whatever his conscience tells him is right for him to do. There is a difference between conscience and the rights of conscience. No man, however conscientious, has any right to infringe the equal rights of another; and at this point civil government has a right to take cognizance, not of any man's conscience, but of the relation of his acts to the rights of others.

The principle, briefly stated, is this: No man should be either required or forbidden to do any act contrary to conscience, however erroneous that conscience may be, unless the doing or forbearing to do that act trenches on the equal rights of others. This rule would (1) abrogate all civil laws requiring the observance of Sunday or of any other day; and (2) it would leave the courts free, not to judge men's consciences, but to protect all men against wrong in the name of conscience. But this is only saying in other words that which we have said many times before, namely, that civil governments are instituted not to create or to "grant" rights, but to guarantee the free and untrammeled exercise of equal, natural, God-given, inalienable rights, and that of these the highest and most sacred is perfect freedom in matters of religious belief and practice.
