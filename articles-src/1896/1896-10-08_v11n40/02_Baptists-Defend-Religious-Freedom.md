## BAPTISTS DEFEND RELIGIOUS FREEDOM.*

If [the State] has no right to forbid any one pursuing, on a Sunday, any vocation which shall not disturb his fellowmen, nor interfere with their rights. If a man, on a Sunday, chooses to hoe in his garden, or to engage in any other peaceful occupation which disturbs no one, he is within his right.

Religious liberty is violated if he is molested by the law. This holds good, whatever faith he professes, or if he professes no faith at all. But the case is still stronger when the man is a conscientious follower of a faith which holds sacred the seventh day, and when he attests his conscientiousness by abstaining from labor on that day, and by engaging in public worship.

These, the principles of religious liberty, were held dear by our Baptist fathers, who suffered for their maintenance. The Baptists of Georgia are a great host, numbering 161,000 white and 206,000 colored people, probably exceeding in number any other denomination. The principles of religious liberty have been firmly and intelligently held by leading Baptists of the State, eminently by Hon. J. L. M. Curry, LL.D., a native of Georgia, now secretary of the Peabody Fund, a distinguished Baptist, than whom no one in the Southern States has a more potent voice.

We respectfully and earnestly urge upon Dr. Curry and upon ex-Governor Northen, of Georgia, and other Georgia Baptists, laymen and ministers, to protest against these violations of religious liberty, and to plead with their fellow-citizens to do away with laws which belong to the Dark Ages. To the men who are suffering for conscience' sake we extend our most sincere sympathy, as we extend it to the Stundists and to all others of the noble army of men who are enduring hardship for following out their religious convictions.
