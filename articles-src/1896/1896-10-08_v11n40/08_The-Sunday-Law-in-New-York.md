## THE SUNDAY LAW IN NEW YORK.

The Sunday law of this State is about to be again tested in the courts. The facts are thus stated by the Rochester Herald, of the 24th ult:—

"The defendant members of the Rochester Baseball Club, accused of violating the Sunday law by playing ball at Riverside Park on Sunday, appeared before Justice of the Peace Frank, in Irondequoit yesterday, and gave bail to appear before the Grand Jury. The defendants were represented by H. J. Tuttle, of the firm of Tuttle & Hallock. The people were represented by Henry W. Conklin.

"If the ball players are indicted, the trial will be an interesting one from a legal standpoint. In the case of the people against Moses, reported in the New York Court of Appeal cases, the defendant was accused of violating the Sunday law by fishing on Sunday. In that case Judge Earl held that fishing on private grounds even is a violation of the law. Judges Finch, Peckham and Gray dissented from the view taken by Judge Earl. Judge Maynard concurred with Judge Earl's opinion on the ground that the act constituted a serious interruption of the religious repose and peace of the community in which the fishing was done; so that Judge Maynard's construction of the law forms the basis of the interpretation of the law laid down by the Court of Appeals.

"It will be claimed in the case of the Rochester baseball players that there was no disturbance of the religious peace of the persons making the complaint. During the entire summer at the Sunday games, where the crowds ranged from 4,000 to 7,000 persons, there was not a single disturbance of any kind. No intoxicating liquors were sold on the grounds; in fact, before the Raines law went into effect, the association in charge of the team permitted no liquor to be sold on the grounds on Sunday. During the entire summer there was not a single fight on the grounds. For this reason it will be claimed there is no just cause for claiming that the religious repose of the neighborhood was disturbed by the Sunday games. It will be claimed that the man making the complaint against the Sunday games lives nearly three miles from the grounds, and therefore had no reason for being exercised on the ground of disturbance, against the playing of Sunday games."
