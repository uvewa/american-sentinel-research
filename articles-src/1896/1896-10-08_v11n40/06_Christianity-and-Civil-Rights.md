## CHRISTIANITY AND CIVIL RIGHTS.

It is the purpose of the civil government to preserve inviolate to the people under it those inalienable rights with which all men have been endowed by their Creator. This being so, it is the right of every individual to demand the protection of the civil government whenever his rights are threatened with invasion. This is right from a civil standpoint; but the Christian standpoint commands a higher and wider view of truth, and from this standpoint what is right within the sphere of civil things may be found contrary to right within the higher sphere of Christian duty. There are higher rights than the rights of man. Civil government conserves the latter, but Christianity conserves the rights of God.

The Creator has given to his human creatures the right to "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness;" but he has also given to certain of them the commission, "Go ye . . . into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature;" and in the execution of this it has often been necessary to surrender earthly comforts, liberty, and even life itself. It was right under such circumstances that the surrender should be made. Jesus Christ himself set the example in this respect. He surrendered all that was his by right for the sake of that cause which embodied right in the form of righteousness; and his followers must not turn back in their devotion to the same cause because the pathway may lead to the loss of property, liberty, or life here. Their natural, inalienable right to these things cannot afford them justification in refusing under all circumstances to give them up.

The rights of God are as much higher and more sacred than those of the human individual, as the Creator is higher and greater than his human creature, or as the interests and welfare of the universe surpass in importance the temporal interests and welfare of one soul. God has a right to the love and worship of the beings he has created. And this is not for his own benefit, but for that of the universe which he upholds; for God needs nothing from his creatures, but maintains and provides for them all. "God is love," and there is in him no taint of selfishness. It is not right that any person should place his own temporal interests—even his inalienable rights—before interests which are infinitely higher and more sacred. The Christian will make it his first object in all things to advance the interests of the cause of Christ. When these interests come in conflict with those pertaining to his worldly prosperity, the latter are always made to yield the ground. Thus it is sometimes right that an individual should surrender rights.

But let each one take care what and whose rights he surrenders. When he sees that he can advance the cause of righteousness by yielding his right to some temporal interest or possession, it is right that he should do so. But not every right can be surrendered. Religious despotism demands that men should surrender the right to think for themselves. But the surrender of this means the surrender of the right to exercise faith in Jesus Christ, and therefore of the right to eternal life which that faith secures.

The same despotism demands that men should surrender God's right to their worship and obedience. No such demand can be honored by one who would maintain his Christian allegiance. The dividing line is to be drawn between temporal and eternal interests—between the civil rights of man and the rights of God. The Christian should ever be careful not to be tenacious of a civil right at the expense of the prosperity of that cause which stands for the rights of God.
