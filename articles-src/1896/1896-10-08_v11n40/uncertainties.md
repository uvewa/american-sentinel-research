## General Notes

This issue was transcribed from OCR text file. The source OCR was generally clear and readable. Notable uncertainties documented below.

## Specific Uncertainties

### Page 1, Article "Persecution and 'The Law'"

**Line reference:** Bunyan dialogue section
- **Uncertainty:** "RUB" appears as speaker abbreviation instead of "BUNYAN" in most of the dialogue
- **Transcribed as:** "RUB" (as it appears in the OCR)
- **Confidence:** HIGH
- **Reason:** This appears to be a consistent abbreviation throughout the Bunyan interview dialogue, likely standing for "Bunyan" or possibly a typographical convention in the original

### Page 4, "Civil Basis of Religious Laws"

**Line reference:** Illustration caption
- **Uncertainty:** Reference to "Mr. Botkine" in the article text
- **Transcribed as:** "Botkine"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM
- **Reason:** The OCR text mentions an illustration with a quotation from "Mr. Botkine" about Russia, but the actual illustration and quotation are not visible in the text-only OCR. The illustration caption appears to have been omitted from the OCR extraction.

### Page 7, "News and Notes"

**Line reference:** Final paragraph about Portland, Maine
- **Uncertainty:** "27th inst." - unclear whether this refers to September or October
- **Transcribed as:** "27th inst."
- **Confidence:** HIGH
- **Reason:** Based on context of issue date (October 8) and reference to "24th ult." earlier in the section (meaning September 24), this likely refers to September 27, but left as written in original

### Page 8, Back page subscription information

**Line reference:** Organization officers table
- **Uncertainty:** "ALLEN MOOS" vs "ALLEN MOON"
- **Transcribed as:** "ALLEN MOOS" (as appears in OCR)
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM
- **Reason:** Earlier in the issue, an article is bylined "Allen Moon" (article #7), suggesting the subscription page may contain a typographical error, but transcribed exactly as OCR shows
