## NEWS AND NOTES.

HOTEL keepers at South Beach, Staten Island, are awaiting the outcome of a case in the courts which will test the legality of Sunday dancing in such establishments. If the result is as they hope, they will give dances every Sunday evening during the winter.

THE legal committee of the public school Charter Association of San Francisco, Cal., has decided that a clause in the new charter barring from the ranks of primary or grammar school teachers all persons who have not been educated in the public school system of California, is unconstitutional and void.

AT Freeport, Ill., October 1, Rev. John G. Wooley addressed the ministers of the Rock River conference in language which reflected severely upon the national Republican party nominee, Mr. McKinley, for failure to declare against monopolies and trusts, and declared that all the latter were behind him to secure his election. A majority of the conference promptly drew up and signed a resolution of censure upon Mr. Wooley for such expression of his sentiments.

THE "Business Men's National Campaign Committee" have sent out a letter to the Catholic clergy of the country, attacking the Democratic platform, making allusion to "the patriotism and eminent public services of the late Most Reverend Archbishop Hughes and many others of the Roman Catholic clergy, when the integrity of our government was threatened on a former occasion," and calling upon the clergy to throw their influence against the political movement which aims at securing a decision in the presidential contest which "would be thoroughly immoral and would precipitate an ethical and material calamity of incalculable magnitude." Similar letters, it is said, have been sent to the clergy of all denominations.

POLICE Commissioner Roosevelt, of New York City, has been asked by Mayor Strong to set up a standard of sacredness by which to test Chinese Sunday concerts. This is the result of a plea made by Chinese merchants for exemption from police interference with their Sunday concerts, which they said would cause them a loss during the year of $10,000. They affirmed that the concerts were in every way sacred, and had a tendency to educate the audiences in the principles of Confucius.

IN a sermon delivered in the First Presbyterian Church, Washington, September 27, Rev. T. De Witt Talmage touched upon the subject of pulpit politics in these words: "Every minister must do as he feels called on to do, and I will not criticize him for doing what he considers his duty; but all the political harangues from pulpits from now until the 3rd of November will not in all the United States change one vote, but will leave many ears stopped against anything that such clerymen may utter the rest of their lives."

A CRUSADE against Sunday golf playing has been inaugurated by some citizens of Staatsburg, Duchess County, N. Y., the offenders being representatives of New York's "four hundred," who have residences in or near the village. A sermon delivered by the Rev. Mr. Miles in Staatsburg on a recent Sunday gave the signal for the battle. "If there are any Christians in this place," he said, "they will see that these people stop their sports on Sunday." Quite a number seem to have availed themselves of this opportunity to demonstrate their Christianity.

THAT political sentiment is with the clergy, as with other people, a matter of personal opinion, was evidenced by a sermon delivered by Rev. Herbert N. Casson, in the "Labor Church" at Lynn, Mass., September 27, in which the speaker was as outspoken in his praise of candidate W. J. Bryan and that for which he stands as the pulpit politicians have generally been during this campaign in denunciation of the same. Mr. Casson stated at the outset that his sermon would be a political one, on which account he would omit the reading of the usual Scripture lesson.

THE legality of Sunday work by Hebrews is to be tested in the city of Portland, Maine. The "law" in that place forbids keeping open places of business on the "sabbath," and is a statute handed down from Puritan times, but not regarded as worthy of enforcement in more recent years. But the Sunday observance movement having reached Portland, there has been observable of late a tendency to make use of this "blue law," which resulted in the arrest on the 27th inst. of two Hebrews, Messrs. Press and Berman, who were keeping "open shop." The former pleaded not guilty, but the latter admitted the charge against him, and in court stated that his store was kept closed on Saturdays, and that for seven years past he had been doing business on Sundays without molestation; also that "a lot of others" kept open on Sunday the same as he did. He gave notice that he would appeal from any sentence that might be imposed in the lower court, and was released on $100 bail. Press based his plea of "not guilty" upon the fact that bakery carts and milk wagons were run on Sundays as on other days; but the court explained that these were not parallel cases, since neither a milk wagon nor a bakery cart is an "open shop." In the light of this revelation Mr. Press decided that he would comply with the statute, upon promise to do which the judge suspended sentence. Meanwhile explicit orders were issued to the police of the city to arrest all Hebrews found hereafter keeping open shop on Sunday.
