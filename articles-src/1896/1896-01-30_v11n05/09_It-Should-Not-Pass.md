## IT SHOULD NOT PASS!

[The Sun, New York, January 17.]

SENATOR PAVEY of this town, introduced in the Senate on Monday, a bill to extend the powers of the Parkhurst Society for the "Prevention of Crime." It allows the employment of a superintendent (who may be a director of the society) to conduct all the society's cases before the various tribunals. He is to receive a salary, shall be a peace officer, and shall be empowered to hire any of the other directors of the society as counsel.

The object sought by this measure is as plain as it is indefensible. The society for the Prevention of Crime has now in its employ counsels who are reimbursed for their professional outlays, and compensated for their professional services out of the money furnished by private contributors to the funds of the society. There is no law which precludes an individual who is in sympathy with the purposes of a duly incorporated society from contributing to its support; and the directors of such society can expend so much of it as they think necessary for legal proceedings.

Senator Pavey's bill is a proposition to shift the burden of these expenses from the members of the Parkhurst Society to the people of this city, so that the taxpayers will be called upon to meet the professional charges of the Parkhurst superintendent and such other directors of the Parkhurst Society as may have been admitted to the practice of law in the courts of this State, but are without clients.

The adoption of such a measure would open a new field of activity for the Board of Directors of the Parkhurst Society, who would be empowered to vote each other sums of money for professional services whether such services were warranted or not. The people of this city are taxed $177,000 this year for the maintenance of the district attorney's office, and there is a further allowance of $20,000 for contingencies arising from the prosecution of cases against delinquents who violate the penal statutes of the State. There is no propriety or justification for the payment of an additional sum for outside counsel, not employed by the city or its official representatives, but by an independent and irresponsible society.

The provision of the Pavey bill which seeks to make the superintendent of the Parkhurst Society "a peace officer" is open to similar and equally serious objection. Official duties and functions should be performed, under the limitations established by law, by individuals who take the prescribed oath and are always amenable to public authority. The bestowal of the power of arresting citizens on other citizens who are wholly irresponsible to public control and derive their powers from private societies or corporations, is an abuse for which the Legislature is primarily responsible, and it is time that a halt should be called. In several cases, recently brought to public notice, these powers have been scandalously abused by agents of the Gory or Parkhurst Society, and their further extention, as proposed in the bill offered by Mr. Pavey, would be an incitement, no doubt, to other acts of an oppressive if not corrupt character. There is a police department in New York costing $6,000,000 a year for enforcing the laws, and a district attorney's office for prosecuting offenders.
