## AMERICANISM OR ROMANISM, WHICH?

A book has come to our table with the above title. It contains 280 pages, is substantially bound in buckram, is published by the Baptist Book concern at Louisville, Ky., and is from the pen of John T. Christian, A. M., D. D., one of the Baptist pastors of that city, and author of several Baptist publications. It sells for one dollar per copy.

The subjects treated in this book are:—Was Peter a Pope? Rome and Morals; Rome and Civil Liberty; Rome and Religious Liberty; Rome and Marriage; Rome and the Bible; Rome and the Public Schools and General Learning; Rome and the Press; Rome and Secret Societies.

On the whole it is a valuable work, containing, as it does, many valuable quotations and references, and presenting the various subjects treated in a lucid and systematic manner. It is to be regretted, however, that some quotations are given without any definite information as to where they can be found. For instance we read of things that have appeared in the Catholic Mirror "recently," and of what somebody said in the Weekly Register of London, and in the Catholic World of this city. Such references without dates are of little value. However, most of the quotations have satisfactory references that would enable one who had access, to the original works to verify them. Altogether we know of no work which gives in the same compass nearly so much thoroughly reliable information as does the one under review.

The author make one serious mistake, however, and that is in treating the errors of Romanism and its influence upon the people as though it were something that ought to be prohibited by law. One proposition which he lays down is this: "The man who steadfastly holds the principles of Rome is a traitor to our country." This is a very serious mistake. A man may be untrue to the principles upon which our Government is founded and yet not be a traitor by any means. The Constitution of the United States provides that: "Treason against the United States, shall consist only in levying war against them, or in adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort. No person shall be convicted of treason unless in the testimony of two witnesses to some overt act, or on confession in open court." A citizen of the United States might live here all his life and all that time think and say and try to persuade other men to believe that the form of government ought to be changed, that a monarchy ought to be established, or even that the pope should be made supreme ruler of the land, and yet never be guilty of treason. A man cannot in this country make himself an offender for a word or for his faith. It is only when his words or faith are crystallized into open acts of rebellion that he becomes a traitor.

Writers against Romanism should beware

lest they out-Herod Herod in their zeal for what they imagine is Americanism. Americanism, Protestantism, civil and religious liberty must survive, if at all, in the hearts of the people. They cannot be preserved by outlawing Romanism.
