## COMMON LAW IN ENGLISH DECISIONS.

[By Addison Blakely, Ph. D., Lecturer in Political Science and History, University of Chicago.]

From time immemorial, English law—both British and American—has been governed by certain rules of construction, or rules of reason, which apply to and control each and every statute that forms a part of our code of law. These rules are part of the common law and are held to be prior to and over all other law of whatever description or kind.

By means of this common law-theory of construction, statutes are in fact abrogated, even where the legal power to abrogate is denied positively and in toto by the legislative power. "It appears in our books," says Lord Coke, "that in many cases the common law will control acts of Parliament, and sometimes adjudge them to be utterly void. For when an act of Parliament is against common right and reason, or repugnant, or impossible to be performed, the common law will control it and adjudge such act to be void."

Perhaps a better idea of the common law can be got by quoting from the decisions contrasting it with statute and custom-law,—the remainder of the law of the land. The common law is that part of natural right having the sanction of the State or receiving the recognition of sovereignty. Custom law is that body of customs of the people not contrary to the expressed will or welfare of the State. Statute law is that body of law declared by the legislative agent of the State—usually by the executive heed or by some representative body, as a legislature.

In all of these decisions the common law is set forth as practical justice, or natural right, as understood and sanctioned by the State. "Bills of Rights," "Declarations of Rights," and similar titles, are merely variations of declarations of the common law or the old "Folic-right"—the fundamental rights of the people. We see, therefore, why persecution has never had a legitimate place in the common law of the English peoples, and the ground for the declaration of the Supreme Court of New York that "all prohibitions of ordinary business on Sunday, with us, come from the statute"

Fortescue, therefore, makes the following decisions of law:—

All human laws are either
The law of nature,¹
Customs, or
Statutes, which are also called constitutions.

But the two former, when they are reduced into writing, and made public by a sufficient authority of the prince, and commanded to be observed, they then pass into the nature of, and are accepted as constitutions or statutes, and in virtue of such promulgation and command, oldige the subject to the observance of them under a greater penalty than they otherwise could do. . . . If, therefore, under these three distinctions of the law of nature, customs, and statutes, I shall prove the law of England eminent to excel, then I shall have evinced it to be good and effectual for the government of that kingdom. . . . The laws of England, as far as they agree with, and are deduced from, the law of nature, are neither better nor worse, in their decisions, than the laws of all other States or kingdoms in similar cases. For, as the philosopher (Aristotle) says in the fifth of his Æthica, "The law of nature is the same, and has the same force all the world over."²

"Ley temporal," says Coke, "consisteth of three parts, viz.:—

First, on the common law, expressed in our bookes of law, and judicial records;
Secondly, on statutes contained in acts and records of Parliament; and,
Thirdly, on customs grounded on reason, and used time out of minds;
And the construction and determination of these doe belong to the judges of the realms."

In the preface to Hughe's edition of Horne's "Mirror of Justices," we find a like distinction made. "The temporal laws of this kingdom," says the writer, "may be divided into three parts:—

First, the general or common law;
Secondly, the customary law;
Thirdly, statute or parliament laws.
The common law is nothing else but pure and tried reason (response production).
The customary laws are certain ancient customs grounded upon reason, which abridge the course of the common law.

In Sir Thomas Harde's reports of cases adjudged in the Court of Exchequer (1658), the same characterization of the law is given. On page 140 we read:—

The words per legem terrae (the law of the land) signify:
Common law,
Customary law, and
Statute law.

Whatever positive laws are contrary to this law of nature and reason, they are void in themselves.³

In fact, Brownlow's reports make the sweeping assertion that all of the common-law judges and writers, without exception, regarded the law as being of this threefold character. In reporting the case of Rowles vs. Mason,⁴ Brownlow says:—

Coke, chief justice, agreed, and he said that Fortescue and Littleton and all others agreed, that the law consists of three parts,
First, common law;
Secondly, statute law, which corrects, abridges, and explains the common law;
The third, custom, which takes away the common law (i. e., the change of custom modifies the law; for ex facto jus oritur,—Out of the fact the law arises: so, when the facts are different, the law itself is different; Crescute rations legis, cesuit ipsa lex.—When the reason for the law ceases, the law itself ceases).

But the common law corrects, allows and disallows such statute law and custom: for it force he repugnancy in statute or unreasonableness in custom, the common law disallows it or rejoice it, as it appears by Dr. Bonham's case, and in S Coke VI, Henry VI, annuity.

And elsewhere Coke says: "Customes et usagea. Consustude (custom) is one of the main triangles of the lawes of England; those lawes being divided into common law, statute law, and custom."⁵

¹ It (the term "law of nature") is not used among them that he learned in the lawes of England to reason what thing is commanded or prohibited by the law of nature and what not; but at ye reasoning in that bebaife is vnder this manner:

"As when anything is grounded upon the law of nature, they say that reason all that such a things bee done: and if it be prohibited by the law of nature, they say it is against reason, or that reason will not suffer it to be done." St. Germain's 'Doctor and Student.' (1.) (London, 'merdie corrected and imprinted with news additions,' 1890).

Coke makes this same division of the law, as does Fortescue, but it is not a proper law for law of nature, and cites Fortescue as authority, above: a that he regards common law, as he says, "properly so-called," the same as what Braxton, Fortescue, and the other earlier writers of both England and Rome regarded as the law of nature, insofar as such law is recognized and sanctioned by the State.

⁵ Per Chief-Justice Widdington. See also Bawlett vs the Attorney-General same report, page 408, where it is maintained "that no act of Parliament, that should take it (natural justice) away would be void in itself; as is said in 'Doctor and Student.'

⁶ Brownlow and Goldesborough reports, 197, 198.

⁷ Coke's Institutes, 197 b. These quotations might be extended indefinitely, but I have given enough here to establish beyond the possibility of a successful contradiction the threefold character and source of law. I might quote Boleard, whose expedient work is recently from the press (North edii n. Oxford, 1898), to show that this conception of the ratification of law still obtains among political scientists as well as among the lawyers. In his chapter on the sources of law, he speaks of "the mutual relations of (1) customary, (2) judgments, and (3) statute law;"—the very same divisions given by the older lawyers' substitution "judge-made" law, for Fortescue's term "law of nature." St. Germain's "law of reason," and Coke's "common law." Whatever the term, it is the bench's conception of legal justice arising out of the related facts.
