The Chicago Inter-Ocean, in its issue of Dec. 5, 1895, in an editorial entitled, "Trades Unions and Sunday Laws," after stating that several influences have been combined to oppose the enforcement of the Barbers' Sunday Rest bill, says:—

The labor unions are strong enough to win in this contest for a weekly holiday, and they will win if they stand united. For even if the Cody law be held unconstitutional, it is within the power of the unions to induce the next legislature to enact a measure of like purpose, but of far wider scope. And thus it may be that those who now conspire to prevent a hard-worked and not too well paid class of men from enjoying a Sunday rest may succeed in forcing the enactment of a law that will make Sunday a holiday of universal obligation.

It is not difficult to see what the plan of these advocates of Sunday laws is in regard to those who oppose their wishes in any degree. If these fellows, say they, do not quit opposing our law relative to Sunday, we will make a law that will compel everybody to keep Sunday.
