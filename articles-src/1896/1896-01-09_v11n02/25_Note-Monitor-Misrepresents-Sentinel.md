The Monitor (Roman Catholic) of San Francisco, feeling aggrieved that we apply Rev. 13:18 to the Papacy, attempted to break the force of the application some weeks since by a display of cheap wit with which the editor seems to have been highly pleased, for he thus refers to the matter again in the Monitor of the 7th ult.:—

The AMERICAN SENTINEL which is edited by anti-christ or what is the same thing Kalbinos P. Bolman, whose name is the number of the beast has published the programme which Providence is to follow during the years to come. First Dan. 11:45 makes it certain that the Turk is to be driven from Europe. The date is fixed by the following simple process: Multiply the digits in the number of the verse, 45 and you have the result 20. Multiply 20 by the number of the chapter 11 and you have 220. As there are two figures namely 11 and 45 add 2 to the total and you have 222. Subtract 222 from the number of the beast 666 and the remainder is 444. This is the number of years the Turk is to rule in Constantinople; but as he began to reign there in 1453 he must cease to reign in 1897. So according to Calvin P. Bolman the Turk will be driven out of Europe the year after next. Thanks.

This is a deliberate misrepresentation for the purpose of making us appear ridiculous. Neither the SENTINEL nor any of its editors ever made any such calculation or arrived at any such conclusion. We believe however that Dan. 11:45 applies to the Turkish government, which when driven from Europe will establish itself temporarily at Jerusalem; and this will be one of the closing scenes of earth's history, but we have never made any attempt to fix the year in which this is to occur. Has the Monitor a special dispensation or an indulgence from the pope to violate with impunity the eighth (according to Rome's enumeration) commandment?
