## AN ENGLISH VIEW OF IT.

[The Star, London, Dec. 3, 1895.]

The Present Truth is the organ of the International Tract Society, Limited, which is one of the publishing branches of the Seventh-day Adventist denomination, which holds that the true Sabbath is Saturday, the seventh day of the week, and not Sunday, the first. The Present Truth people, therefore, rest on Saturday and work on Sunday. Now the Factory Act forbids the employment of women and young persons on Sunday, and the only exemption which it dispenses is in the case of Jews, who are passed over if they sign a special exemption form. The Present Truth conscientiously objected to sign this Jewish exemption form because it is Christian and not Jewish, and for six years the factory inspectors let it print in peace, recognizing the patent fact that it kept the law in spirit if not in letter. The other day, however, some new broom came along, and swept the Present Truth before a magistrate, who fined it. It having refused to pay the fines, the bailiffs descended on it, confiscated all they could lay their hands on, including the engine; wherefore the Present Truth is like soon to be the Past Truth. This is about the savagest instance we ever saw of the injustice of justice, and we hope that Sir Matthew White Ridley will make restitution as swiftly as may be.
