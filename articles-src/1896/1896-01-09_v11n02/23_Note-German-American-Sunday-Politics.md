The "German-American Citizens' Union" of New York, "is," says the World, of June 5, "about to precipitate the Sunday-opening question into politics in a way that is bound to hurt some one." It will shortly submit a bill to the Albany legislature, accompanied by "a carload of petitions," asking that at an election to be held in the spring there shall be submitted to the people of cities of the first class a measure permitting the sale of food, milk and beverages on Sunday during certain hours. The hours described are from 7 to 9 A. M. for food and milk, and after 4 P. M. for beverages. Failing to get what they demand from the legislature, they will form themselves into a political body, and organize similar bodies throughout the State, with the avowed purpose of placing New York State in the Democratic ranks at the presidential election next fall.
