What is the meaning of the warlike spirit which, in the guise of patriotism, is giving rise to the formation of "Boys' Brigades" and the like? Is this one of the evidences that we are a "Christian nation"? Is Christ the prince of war, as well as of peace? He cannot be both, for the terms are contradictory; and we know that he is the "prince of peace." The prince of war is a very different being.
