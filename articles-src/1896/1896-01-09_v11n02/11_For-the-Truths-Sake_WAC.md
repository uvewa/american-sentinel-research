## FOR THE TRUTH'S SAKE.

BY W. A. COLCORD.

To be loyal to the truth under all circumstances has ever cost a sacrifice. It cost Abel his life. It made Noah a very unpopular man. It cast Jeremiah in the dungeon; Shadrach, Mediach and Abed-cego in the fiery furnace, and Daniel into the lion's den. It crucified the Lord of glory, stoned Stephen, and in the ages that followed led a mighty host to a martyr's death.

"Yes, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution," says Paul. And Paul's career, after he became a follower of Christ, testified to the truthfulness of his statement. His godly life in Christ Jesus caused him to be stoned, beaten with many stripes, placed in the stocks, imprisoned, and finally to be beheaded. For some time before his death, he was a prisoner in Rome. In this condition he wrote some of his epicles.

To lead a godly life through faith in Jesus, which, by the way, is the only way in which a godly life can be led, means to be loyal to the truth; to have the moral courage to stand by the truth at whatever cost; to be faithful unto death. And what is the truth? Said Christ: "Sanctify them through thy truth; thy sword is truth." Then to be loyal to the truth means to be loyal to the word of God. This is what costs. This is what demands integrity, self-denial, and thorough consecration to God. This is what brings persecution for righteousness' (right doings's) sake.

And here is where so many fail. They are not true to the word. Describing the stony-ground hearer, Christ said: "He that received the seed into stony places, the same is he that heareth the word, and soon with joy received it; yet hath he not root in himself, but dureth for a while: for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, by and by he is offended." The tribulation and persecution arise because of the word. Satan is the enemy of the word: for it is God's word, and he is the enemy of God. He therefore persecutes all who strictly adhere to it.

It was because of Paul's faith in the word that the Jews persecuted him. To Felix he said: "But this I confess unto thee, that after the way which they call heresy, so worship I the God of my Lathers, believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets." The unbelieving Jews professed to believe the law and the prophets, but they did not; for had they done so, they would have believed in Jesus.

It was because of their fidelity to the word of God that so many suffered death at the hands of papal Rome during the days of her power and supremacy. Like the Jews, this church has professed to be the guardian of, and believer in the word; but it has not been, else it would not have destroyed those, like the Waldenses and Albigenses, who believed in it, and persecuted those who sought to give it to the people in a tongue in which they could understand it.

If any would know why there is so little persecution among the many millions of professed Christians of to-day, the answer is at hand. It is because there is so little strict adherence to the plain teaching of the Word of God. Another has well said: "Let there be a revival of the faith and power of the early church, and the spirit of persecution will be revived, and the fires of persecution will be rekindled." Let men do what God has said, and they will soon feel the hand of persecution, for the devil is not dead.
