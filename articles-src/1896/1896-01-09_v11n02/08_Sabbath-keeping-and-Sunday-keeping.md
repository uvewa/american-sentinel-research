**SABBATH-KEEPING AND SUNDAY-KEEPING.**

There is a wide difference between Sabbath-keeping and Sunday-keeping. Sunday-keeping can be enforced by human law. Sabbath-keeping cannot be so enforced, but must be wholly a voluntary act.

Among believers in Sunday observance, we find no harmony of conception as to what that observance should be, or what is the foundation upon which it rests. The Methodists, the Catholics, the Disciples, the Lutherans, all differ from one another in their observance of the day, and in their theories of the proper basis of its observance. Nor does unity of belief and practice exist throughout each separate denomination; but clergymen of the same church give expression to widely differing views upon the subject. All this is in itself conclusive evidence that Sunday sanctity and Sunday observance have their origin in the conceptions of the human mind.

The Sunday rest day being a creation of man, it must be enforced, if at all, by human legislation. But this ignoble origin is fatal to any conception of it as a sacred day; for man, being fallen and sinful himself, cannot make anything sacred. Being dependent himself for holiness, as all creatures are, upon the Lord, he cannot impart holiness to anything. "Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? Not one."

"There is none good but one, that is, God." All goodness, all holiness, is from God,—a manifestation of the one. Being who, in and of himself, is good and holy. Whatever is good and holy upon earth, is made so by the presence of God's Spirit. Only that is sacred or holy which God thus makes holy; and God has never made holy the first day of the week. Hence, however men may speak of it, it is not and cannot be a sacred day.

Sunday observance being dependent upon human precept and legislation, cannot be a moral act; for morality is a condition of the heart, and the heart is not reached by human legislation. Only God's precepts and law can so affect the heart as to produce moral action; and no precept or command of God enjoins Sunday observance. The saloon is made to keep Sunday, yet it continues to be a saloon. Sunday observance does not affect its character; it is the same evil thing, the same curse to humanity that it was when it was open seven days in the week. And just so with animate things. The worst sinner on earth may rest on Sunday and even attend public worship, because the "law" commands him to do so, and be a sinner still. The worst hypocrite on earth can be in outward acts a pious man. The Scriptures tell us of "false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ. And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light." He can put on a pious exterior, but he is the devil still.

But not so with the Sabbath and law of God. Nothing evil can keep that law; for that cannot be kept by a mere outward conformity with its demands. That law reaches the thoughts and motives of the heart. It forbids all evil thoughts, calling some of them murder, others adultery, and others covetousness. It commands the Sabbath to be kept not only by outward forms, but by making it a delight, "not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine own words." Isc. 58:14, 14. It commands the worship of God, not only in the letter of outward forms, but "in spirit and in truth." John 4:24. No sinner can keep the Sabbath until he is first made free from sin and thus changed into a righteous person.

Such is the difference between Sunday-keeping and Sabbath-keeping; between compliance with the legislation of man, and with the law of God. It is Sabbath-keeping and not Sunday-keeping that separates us from the company of all that is evil. No human precept, custom, or legislation, can affect this separation, but only that Word which is the basis of faith.
