That the prosecution of seventh-day observers for Sunday work is not prompted by zeal for "the law," but by personal animosity, is shown by the display of this spirit on the part of the prosecutors in nearly every case. Either there is some feeling of personal spite, or a marked opposition of religious views, behind the proceedings in almost every instance. Wise legislation will cut off, rather than provide, opportunities for the exercise of the baser instincts of human nature to the harm of good and honest citizens.
