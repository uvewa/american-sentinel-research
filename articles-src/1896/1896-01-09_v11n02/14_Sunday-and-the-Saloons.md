## SUNDAY AND THE SALOONS.

The German-Americans of this city, have, it is said, "hit upon a solution of the Sunday excise question that meets the approval of the special committee of the Chamber of Commerce, Dr. Parkhurst, Carl Schurz, Oswald Ottendorfer, and Rev. Dr. Rainsford. The plan, according to the World of the 2nd inst., is to amend the present Sunday excise law, by adding:—

In cities of the first and second class the proprietor of a restaurant who has been duly licensed to sell strong or spirituous liquors, wines, ale or beer may sell on Sunday to his guests such beverages to be drunk by the purchasers on the licensed premises with their meals, but not at or in front of the bar, and he may also sell beer, ale and mineral waters to be drunk off the licensed premises on Sunday from 12 to 2 o'clock in the afternoon and from 6 to 8 o'clock in the evening.

This gives every saloon-keeper who is willing to serve his customers with something to eat, the right to sell upon Sunday, and allows beer to be sold within certain hours to be taken away and consumed elsewhere. It remains to be seen how well this will satisfy friends of Sunday sacredness.

Restricting the sale of liquor to certain hours upon Sunday does indeed make a legal distinction between that and other days of the week, but is it such a distinction as will fully satisfy those who are determined to exalt Sunday as the Sabbath. It will perhaps be remembered by our readers that in a sermon preached in Grace Church, this city, by Wm. E. Huntington, D. D., and published in the Pulpit for October, that gentleman said:—

Some are under the impression, naturally enough, but most erroneously, that it is the so-called "temperance question" with which we are called to deal. Others are persuaded that the principle at stake is the all-important one of the supremacy of law, the duty of the sworn officers of the State to enforce the State's decree. But this latter question has for the moment, at any rate, thank God, been set at rest. We are no longer pestered by the vicious proposition that laws are enacted rather with a view to silencing the murmurs of the good, than for the purpose of restraining the passions of the bad.

Equally evident is it, when we look facts in the face, that it is not the temperance question which is now at stake, for no one can preside that even the complete suppression of the sale of intoxicants, if confined to a single day of the week, could settle that. Temperance legislation, if it would be properly so-called, must aim at covering all days.

No, the question really at the fore is the Sunday question. An attack is making upon the immunities of the weekly rest, as those immunities have been defined by usage and by public law. It so happens that in this particular case the hostile movement has sprung up in the quarter known as "the liquor interest," and that is what is confusing people's minds; but there are other points of the compass from which the assault might just as naturally have come. The simple truth of the matter is that Sunday is all the while in the position of a beleaguered fortress.

This is a plain statement of the plain truth. Doubtless in the minds of some the question is one of excise, but the rallying cry of the so-called reformers in the last campaign was the preservation of the "Christian sabbath." This was made one of the planks in the platform of one of the great political parties, and upon that platform it went to the people and was victorious; not indeed in the city but in the State as a whole. The issue is therefore clearly the maintenance of Sunday as a religious institution; and inasmuch as its friends claim that it should be enforced by civil law, it is difficult to see how they can consistently consent to the proposed amendment to the excise law. Those who do not believe that Sunday is a proper subject of legislation and hold that the liquor traffic should be prohibited on all days simply because it is a menace to life and property, and because it burdens the State with the support of criminals and insane people, will watch with interest the fight which is now sure to ensue between the advocates of Sunday selling and those who demand prohibition on Sunday only.
