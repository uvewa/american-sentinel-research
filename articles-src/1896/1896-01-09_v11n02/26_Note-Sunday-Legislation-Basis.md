In a recent article in the *Sawanee Review*, Mr. B. J. Ramage sums up a discussion of Sunday legislation in these words:—

The more one examines the ground on which American Sunday legislation is based the more irresistible becomes the conclusion that it is a physical and moral rather than a religious ground.

It would be difficult to imagine how Mr. Ramage comes to such a conclusion were it not that he gives a clue to the mental process by which it is reached, thus: "With our theory of government such statutes could have no other basis." His reasoning amounts to this: Sunday statutes exist and are upheld; they cannot be sustained under our form of government on religious grounds, therefore they rest upon civil grounds. But such reasoning proves nothing. It is true that he asserts that the "laws" "simply create a holiday." But this is not the fact. The "laws" of the various States recognize Sunday not as a holiday but as a holy day. Laws setting apart certain days as holidays simply suspend public business but never forbid the carrying on of industrial or mercantile pursuits. Sunday "laws" invariably prohibit labor and business, and generally with such exceptions only as make it certain that the intent of the legislators is to recognize the supposed sacred character of the day. Whenever Sunday is placed upon an equality and only upon an equality with holidays, can it be consistently claimed that the statutes requiring its observance simply create a holiday?
