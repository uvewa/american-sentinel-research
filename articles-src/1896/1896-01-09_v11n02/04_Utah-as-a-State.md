## UTAH AS A STATE.

In view of the admission of Utah into the union of States, the following from a Newton, Kansas, correspondent of the New York Sun, printed in its issue of Dec. 29, is worth the attention of the American people:—

Bishop Richard W. Hart, of the Mormon Church, who has relatives in this city, has been visiting among them for a few days. He was a member of the last Territorial Legislature. He belongs to the "Order of M-Scheseduc," from which all bishops of the Church of the Latter Day Saints must graduate, and therefore knows something of the plans of his church for the future.

Bishop Hart is on his way to the missionary field of Georgia, where his church has been at work for some time, and where the efforts at recruiting for the Mormon faith have met with better success than in any other field in this country. To the correspondent of the Sun Bishop Hart talked very freely about the situation in Utah. The population of Utah contains five Mormons to one Gentile, while in thirteen of the twenty one counties there is not an official not of the Mormon faith. He declared that the belief that the church had abandoned all efforts to control the politics of the new State was a great mistake.

"Whether Democrat or Republican," said the bishop, "there will not be a State officer of other than our faith, either elective or appointive, unless the church so will it. There is not a district judge who can escape his responsibility to the Latter Day Saints, and with two exceptions there will not be a sheriff in Utah who is not of our selection."

After reference to the manner in which the church will secure control of all the industries, such as water supplies and irrigation systems, which would be given back to "the people for whom God intended them," he touched on the subject of plural marriages. He said that through divine command President Woodruff had suspended the ordinance, but it had not been repealed. He said:—

"This subject of plural marriages is very much misunderstood. Not more than fifteen per cent. of our people have more than one wife. As a man prospers the church admonishes him to take additional wives according to his prosperity; and he obeys as a religious duty, always with the advice and full consent of his first wife. In Stakehood, when we are free from Federal interference, the Temple will witness the solemnization of the marriage rites that have been suspected, as the penitentiary will no longer be filled with men for obeying God's law."

At the close of the interview the bishop said:—

"Yes, this ceremonial will be resumed; in fact, it has never been entirely suspended. I have three wives, all of whom love me. And they have persuaded me to seal another on my return next August, which I shall do."

Now that Utah has become a State, the only way Congress can deal with polygamy within its borders is by an amendment to the national Constitution. Thus the possibility of an amendment to the Constitution of the United States, touching a question claimed to be one of religious belief and practice, is by no means remote. While polygamy should be dealt with solely as a practice subversive of human rights, it has in the past been treated as a thing to be suppressed on account of its immorality; and if again made a subject of legislation, in the form of a constitutional amendment, will doubtless be considered on moral grounds. Hence should such an amendment come, it is likely to involve other issues besides the suppression of polygamy.
