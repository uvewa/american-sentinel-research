**"FOR THE SALOON'S SAKE."**

At a large mass-meeting held in Carnegie Music Hall, New York, Dec. 16, at which Bishop Potter presided, in support of the law closing the saloons on Sunday, the Rev. A. P. Doyle, Catholic, made (as reported) this remarkable utterance: "If there were no other argument, I would ask to have the saloon closed on Sunday for the saloon's sake. If it should be permitted to go on for ten years corrupting and debauching seven days in the week, the citizens would rise up in their might and crush it."

We could ask for no more pointed corroboration than this of the SENTINEL'S oft-made declaration, that the Sunday (saloon) law tends to the perpetuity of the saloon, by investing it with a degree of respectability. If in ten years the saloon could be crushed by public indignation, through allowing it to remain open seven days in the week, that fact would constitute the strongest argument in favor of an open saloon on the first as well as on the remaining days of the week. But the Rev. Mr. Doyle, who is secretary of the Catholic Total Abstinence Union, wants Sunday closing of the saloon "for the saloon's sake."

Lest it should be thought that no speaker making such an utterance could have any considerable influence at such a meeting, it should be mentioned that the Rev. W. H. P. Fannos, a prominent Baptist clergyman of this city, was introduced after "Father" Doyle, and in opening his speech said: "I am proud to follow a Catholic priest, even at a distance, in this cause so dear to us both."

It is evident that Sunday keeping is fast coming to be the popularly recognized badge of respectability; and when the saloon dutifully keeps Sunday, it too will become, in a measure at least, "respectable." But any Christian may well doubt the respectability of any plane upon which he and the saloon can stand together. A saloon can keep Sunday; but no saloon ever did or can keep God's Sabbath.
