The article, "Utah as a State," printed on another page, shows how completely the civil power in Utah is now in the hands of the Mormon Church. The union of Church and State in Utah is, according to the words of the Mormon bishop there quoted, about as complete as was ever any such union of which history speaks; and it will be strange if a striking object lesson on the evil of Church and State union is not soon given the people of this Republic.
