**RELIGIO-ATHLETIC RECIPROCITY.**

**BY J. O. LAMSON.**

The extent to which ministers of the gospel will go to fill their pews, and the part they will take in order to get rid of any rival or competition against their attendance, is well illustrated by a dispatch in the New York World under date of Nov. 25. It seems that the University of Rochester football eleven were to play the Hamilton College team Thanksgiving day. It was the idea of the ministers to have services on that day in accordance with the President's proclamation. That was all right. But the football game was of so much more interest to the people than some sermon at the same hour that the ministers were afraid of losing their congregations entirely. They protested against the game at that hour, asking that it be postponed until the afternoon. Finally terms were affected "by sending out letters to all the prominent city ministers asking that if the game were deferred until after the services, the ministers next Sunday and Thanksgiving day would announce the game from the pulpits and urge attendance as a matter of reciprocity for the action of the students." We are informed that the ministers complied and gave their indorsements to the change, and thus the pulpit is made the bulletin board of the football games.
