## THE CATHOLIC CHURCH AND THE SALOON.

We are indebted to the Rev. A. P. Doyle, Secretary of the Catholic Total Abstinence Union, for the latest presentation of the attitude of the Catholic Church towards the saloon. "Father" Doyle was one of the chief speakers at a large mass meeting held in Carnegie Music Hall, New York, Dec. 16, to create sentiment in favor of New York's Sunday "law;" and on that occasion, as reported in the New York Christian Advocate, he "made an address clear in statement and stirring in manner, declaring that he was there with the approval of Archbishop Corrigan, and in harmony with the legislation of the Catholic Church, enacted some years ago, and reaffirmed but a month ago—emphasizing the statement that it was since the election, at a recent synod held in this city." He then translated from the Latin the legislation referred to, as follows:—

Since such very great scandals arise from the abuse of intoxicating drink, we exhort yesters, for the love of God, to use every zeal to extirpate this view of intemperance. In order to accomplish this and let them frequently warn liquor-sellers never to give any drink to minors or to drunkards, and let them frequently warn them also to keep their stores closed on Sunday.

—De Zelo Animarum.

Again:—

Let the observance of the Lord's day be frequently commended. . . . And especially with fervent zeal, let them prevent the opening of saloons on Sunday, and also the frequentation of the same on that day, because from this very custom so many evils arise.

De Zelo Animarum.

It is thus perfectly clear that the attitude of the papal church is not one of hostility to the saloon itself, but toward the intemperance which the saloon creates. She would have liquor-dealers take care to refrain from selling intoxicants to minors or to drunkards; but the liquor-seller might comply with this requirement, and still do a flourishing business.

And it is much worse to ruin young men who are not drunkards, than to sell to those who have become confirmed topers.

Such legislation does not interfere at all with the revenue which that church derives from her communicants who are dealers in intoxicating drinks. It tends not to suppress the saloon, but rather to make it "respectable."

It allows the saloon to create the terrible thirst and craving for intoxicating drink, and then when the hapless devotee has fallen until its power over him is stronger than life itself, it forbids him any further indulgence, and leaves him to a torture of unsatisfied desire to which death would be far preferable. Such is its intent; but the wretched toper generally finds some means to satisfy his fierce craving in spite of the law's restriction. It is very much in this way that the Sunday-closing law serves the cause of temperance. It makes Sunday to the drinker either a day of unsatisfied craving, or a day on which he draws his supply of drink from his own home, instead of from the saloon.

When it is remembered that on this occasion "Father" Doyle stood on common ground with Bishop Potter, Warner Miller, and other leading Protestant speakers by whom this meeting was called, it is easy to see that such mass meetings tend really to the exaltation of Sunday rather than to the suppression of the saloon.
