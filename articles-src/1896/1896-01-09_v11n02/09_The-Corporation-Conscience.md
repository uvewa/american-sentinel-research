**THE "CORPORATION CONSCIENCE."**

In the Christian Statesman of Dec. 14, Mr. Charles Roads, chairman of the Philadelphia "good citizenship committee," makes some true observations concerning the "corporation conscience." Sir Edward Coke's remark, "Corporations have no souls, has," he says, "served as soporific to many moral convictions. But neither the human law nor God will stop to deal with that abstraction, the corporation. They will arrest and punish the men who compose it. What transparent folly to imagine that God will be confused by the intricacies of constitution and by-laws of business associations in getting at guilty souls!"

It is strange that this same writer, and those for whom he speaks through the above named journal, cannot see that what is true of corporations with their constitutions and by-laws, in this respect, is true also of civil government, with its constitution and by-laws. In the Day of Judgment God will not deal with civil government, but with individuals. Mr. Roads and the Christian Statesman party are zealous advocates of a scheme which is to "put God in the Constitution," by so amending the preamble to that venerable document as to place within it a "suitable acknowledgment" of Jesus Christ as the nation's king, and of his revealed will as the source of all rightful authority in civil affairs. In this he and they proceed upon the theory—exactly contrary to the languaged above quoted—that some virtue can attach to a national profession of religion through the Constitution. But if an individual cannot shirk responsibility for a wrong act because done by a corporation, neither can he derive any moral advantage from an acknowledgment of God which pertains to the constitution of civil government.

The propriety of such a governmental profession of Christianity rests upon the assumption that civil government is an entity possessing moral accountability. But that which can have a moral character must possess a conscience; and if civil government has a conscience, it must be true (which Mr. Roads denies) that a corporation has one also.

In civil government it is proper to use compulsion. The national Constitution is the fundamental law of the land, in which all acquiesces, either willingly or by compulsion. What is done in its name is done in their name and by their voice. A constitutional acknowledgment of God and profession of acquiescence in his revealed will would be no less the act volunteered or forced, of every citizen. But a forced acknowledgment and profession of Christ is hypocrisy and sin. And as but few people in this nation, comparatively, are Christians, such an acknowledgment as is proposed would but constitute a colossal monument of hypocrisy and sin. Yet these men are determined that the Constitution shall "acknowledge" God, even if it has to tell a colossal falsehood to do it.
