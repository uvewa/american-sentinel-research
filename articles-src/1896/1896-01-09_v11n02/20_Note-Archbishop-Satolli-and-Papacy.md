The bestowal of the cardinal's beretta upon Archbishop Satolli, comes just in good time to place him among the number of promising candidates for the successorship of Pope Leo. Satolli has made a close study of American ideas and institutions, to discover how they may be best made to serve the interests of the papal church. In the "chair of St. Peter" he would all but constitute an American pope.
