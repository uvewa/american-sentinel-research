The spirit of religious intolerance is at work in South Carolina, as witnessed by the following from a letter by a minister in that State:—

Mr. Robert Miller, of Chick's Springs, who became a Seventh day Adventist last summer, and is a prominent farmer of that place, has been watched by several of his neighbors while he was picking cotton back in his field on Sunday. The watchers stole around in the woods where they could see him, but supposed he could not see them. But they were noticed nevertheless, and when spoken to, ran away. They said they would take the law, and if that did not stop Miller's working, they would take the law in their own hands and stop him that way.

The letter further states that Mr. Miller was in the back field where no one could possibly be disturbed by his work unless he went back there on purpose to be disturbed.

Another man, Mr. Guinn, a shoemaker, has also been threatened with arrest for continuing his work on Sunday. Is it not strange that individuals who profess to be Christians—and some of these watchers were church members—should think that they were manifesting or exercising the Spirit of Christ in such work?
