*[Present Truth, London, Eng., Jan. 23.]*

By replacing the engine, seized by the Government for violation of the Sunday clause of the Factory Act, we are able to run our presses, which remained after the seizure. Thus we are printing our paper again, getting the folding and other lines of work formerly performed by female employés done outside of our works. It was a wicked thing to shut these persons away from their work, to say in effect that from henceforth in this United Kingdom women cannot engage in manufacturing industries, so far as factories are concerned, unless they keep the Sunday. It was because the International Tract Society could not join in this exaltation of a papal institution that they could be no party to enforcing Sunday rest in their printing works on any portion of their employés. The Government having chosen to assume the sinful responsibility of shutting the factory in the process of exalting the Sunday, we leave the responsibility with them, having done all we can to keep them from it.

As this Sunday act is but a half-way measure, affecting females and persons under eighteen, we are able to resume a portion of our work without interference. To reinstate our full working outfit would, of course, be merely to buy in furnishings and machinery for the officers of the law to seize and thus indirectly to pay fines as long as money lasted. Therefore we shall work our factory as we are able until the influence now working to secure the total prohibition of all Sunday work in factories closes our printing works entirely. Now, be it remembered, the Government of this United Kingdom has fully settled it that women cannot be factory operatives unless they regard the Sunday. When the logical end is attained it must apply to men as well as women. When that end is reached it will be impossible for us to operate a printing factory. In that case we would conform to no Sunday law in doing but a portion of our work ourselves. Such laws are wicked and only wicked, as they exalt the human against the divine law. We may add that we have always had our heaviest work—the printing and binding of our larger books, sold by agents in the Kingdom and the colonies—done by the larger printing houses in London. The work done in our own works is the printing of this paper, tracts, pamphlets, etc.
