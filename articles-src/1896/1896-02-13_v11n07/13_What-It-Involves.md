The reonacting of God's law by men, and the punishing by the civil authorities for the infraction of it, involves several inconsistencies that should bid us pause before doing it. First, it involves the supposition that we can help God to enforce his laws, and strengthen his power, which may be insufficient to accomplish his purposes without our help. It involves a right to judge what is his law, and the punishment that should be meted out to those who violate it, and all this is to be decided by a majority that is very likely to be wrong, and is sure to be uncertain and fluctuating in its decisions. It is forestalling the action of God, by adding to, or changing the penalties he has seen fit to affix to such offenses; and finally, it involves the supposition that God will fail to do his duty in the matter of punishing his enemies, and that therefore we must do it for him, and see that they do not escape the proper punishment according to our notion.—J. P. Richardson.
