"CHRIST OF ANTERNS" is the title of a new song and chorus which has recently come to our desk. The song was suggested by the illustration of Christ or Diana (Artemis), which appeared in our issue of July 18, 1895. The poetic composition is strong yet tender, and the music is well adopted to the sentiment of the song. Words by Mrs. Dora A. Grant, music by Adolph Lechner. The song is in sheet music form and is for sale by Oliver Ditson Co., Boston, Mass. Price, 40 cents.
