[From St. Louis Presbyterian.]

Burning Bibles on the American continent is not often heard of, and it is only among intolerant and bigoted people that such an outrage could be perpetuated. Rev. J. B. Kolb, of Bahia, Brazil, writes to the Church at Home and Abroad of the Roman Catholic Church in that region, in which this incident is related: "In the latter part of June [1895] a colporteur and an assistant reached the interior town of Giboya, in the state of Bahia. They began to sell Bibles and Testaments, but was soon met by a man, accompanied by four policemen, who demanded the books, and said that he had orders from the vicar to take them and burn them in the market place. The colporteur inquired who had authority in the place, and was told that all power was in the hands of the vicar, as he was the mayor of the town and district. He went at once to the vicar's house and claimed protection, which was denied him. The vicar reminded him that he was offering false books for sale, and that it was necessary for himself, as the vicar, to protect the rights of his people, and thereupon ordered the colporteur to leave the house. The vicar also remarked that the man who had taken the books had authority to do with them as he saw fit. Just as the colporteur was leaving the house the same man came up, and in a threatening manner ordered him to go with him and deliver up all his books, saying at the same time that if he did not he would take them by force and burn both him and the books together. Under the pressure of this threat the colporteur was obliged to submit to the confiscation of his books, and subsequently forty-seven Bibles, fifty Testaments, and one hundred gospels were saturated with coal-oil and set on fire in the market place." (For same facts see also Missionary Review of the World for February, 1896, page 3.)
