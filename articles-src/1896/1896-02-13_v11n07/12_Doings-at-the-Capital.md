*[Special correspondence from Washington.]*

The devotion and zeal shown by the advocates of Sunday legislation is certainly worthy of a better cause. If the labor and energy expended in the effort to arouse the masses of the people in the interest of this movement, were directed toward the elevation of the true Christian standard among the churches, backed by the Spirit of the Lord, it would certainly result in a great awakening. Washington is to have another Sunday organization, and this time it is to be a women's organization, to be known as the Women's Sabbath Alliance of the District of Columbia. The preliminary work of organization has already been done. The daughter of Secretary Morton was elected President, and among the many Vice-Presidents are the following ladies: Mrs. Wm. L. Wilson, wife of the attorney-general; Mrs. Hoke Smith, wife of Secretary of the Interior; Mrs. Justice Harlan; Mrs. Senator Frye; Mrs. Senator Cullom, and many other women of note.

It is the plan of this Society to appoint a committee of two in each separate church organization in the District, whose duty will be "to obtain members, and work up meetings in the interest of Sunday observance, and use every means possible to create a sentiment in its favor." The declaration of principles contains the following language: "The women of America, recognizing the American Christian Sabbath as our rightful inheritance, bequeathed to us by our forefathers as the foundation of our national prosperity, as the safeguard of our social, civil and religious blessings, etc." Then follows a solemn pledge that every member is required to subscribe to, that they will promote by every means in their power the observance of Sunday as a day of rest and worship, will seek the cessation of all traffic, entertainments, and amusements, and will confine themselves and households to such literature as will conserve the highest spiritual good on that day. This is to be the centre of a national organization, and it was decided to coöperate with the Epworth League, Christian Edeavor, and other like organizations "for patriotic reasons." And I may add that the time seems near when every society for so-called reform must have Sunday attached to it "for patriotic reasons" to meet with popular favor. The question of a Sunday "law" for the District of Columbia is still kept before the people, and the commissioners have been urged to return the bill to Congress with a favorable report, but they have not yet done so. To-day (February 5) they heard argument in opposition to such action. The Religious Liberty Association was represented in the general protest entered by other organizations and individuals. Conspicuous among the speakers was General Birney, of Washington. It is a question of uncertainty as to what the action of the Commission will be.
