*[Chicago Tribune, Sept. 25, 1895.]*

The Tribune prints elsewhere some remarks made at New York this week by Archbishop Corrigan and by Bishop Messmer of Green Bay, Wis., in defense of the alleged right of the pope to be the political king of Rome against the wish of the Romans themselves and of the Italian people.

There cannot be many Catholics, if they are true Americans, who will indorse sentiments so contrary to the rights of man—the principles of the Declaration of Independence and the fundamental institutions of this country—as those enunciated by these two ecclesiastics. One of them, says the pope, "must be the ruler of temporal territory. He must be pope-king."

Listen to these citizens of America preaching the doctrine of absolute monarchy.

"What of it," says Bishop Messmer, "even if the people of Rome did vote not to have the pope for their ruler?" It means a great deal from the American point of view. It means that he ought not to be their ruler. The people of Italy have decreed that they want Rome as their political capital, and the Romans as their fellow-citizens. The Romans have said they wanted to form part of the constitutional monarchy of Italy and their city to be its political capital.

That disposes of the matter as far as all true Americans are concerned. They are not in favor of forcing a ruler or an unwilling people. The American Declaration of Independence says:—

Governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed; that when any form of government becomes destructive of these ends [the securing of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness] it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute a new government.

The citizens of Rome and of Italy have only done what this immortal doctrine, uttered 120 years ago, authorized them to do—viz: adopted home rule.

The Romans are more averse to Papal political domination now than they were twenty-five years ago. A new generation has grown up which has tasted some of the sweets of human political liberty. If the Italian native were to say to the Romans of the capital: "Take another vote, elect another ruler, and we will not interfere, no matter if you choose the pope," he would get only a fraction of their votes. For the Romans do not want him as their king. If he were put over them by France or Austria or Spain as king he would have to get an army to fight for him to keep them from casting him out. Withdraw that hired army and his throne would be overturned immediately. "My kingdom is not of this world," declared Christ.

Archbishop Corrigan says "no lapse of time will ever make that right which is against the principles of justice and charity." That is, it is against justice and charity for the Romans to have a voice in the choice of the man who rules and taxes them!

The archbishop, who is an Irishman, believes in home rule for Ireland, but not for Rome. The people of Rome do not stand as high in his estimation as those of Dublin. He is inconsistent and he is un-American in the position he takes.

It is pitiful to see the highest religious dignitary in the greatest city of the mightiest free nation preaching the doctrines of the dark, despotic ages when the common people had no rights which kings and bishops felt bound to respect, and who taught that the people are the subjects of divinely appointed rulers.
