[New York Tribune, Dec. 30.]

Dr. Paul Pollock, a former Catholic missionary to China, preached at Father O'Connor's Christ's Mission for reformed Catholics last evening. In introducing Dr. Pollock, Father O'Connor read from a newspaper the account of the wedding of Count Zichy and Miss Mabel Wright by a Catholic Priest. The Roman Church, said Father O'Connor, contended that it never permitted any divorced person to marry into the church. Under the ruling made by the archbishop in the case, according to the speaker, any woman who tired of her husband, could easily get rid of him by joining the Roman church. All she had to do then was to contend that he had never been baptized, and the Roman church would declare that she had never been married. It was under such a ruling, Father O'Connor declared emphatically, that the dispensation for the Count's marriage was granted.
