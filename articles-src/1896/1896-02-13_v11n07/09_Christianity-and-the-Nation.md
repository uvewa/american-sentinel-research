[Christian Work, Jan. 30, 1896.]

Our valued friend, Rev. Dr. W. W. Atterbury, President of the New York Sabbath Committee, obliges us with a letter, in which he takes issue with a recent editorial utterance of this journal, that we are a Christian people but not a Christian nation. Dr. Atterbury is careful to recognize "the distinction between the people and nation," and then says that "if the people be Christian and the laws under which they are formed into a nation be also Christian, the nation is Christian," as indeed it is, provided the government of the nation, embracing its legislative and executive departments, have power to establish the Christian religion, and exercise that power. The fact that some laws are favorable to Christianity does not govern in the case at all unless Christianity is part of the common law or is established by statute.

Dr. Atterbury says that the constitutional prohibition of an establishment of religion "does not apply to the States, but to the General Government alone." Exactly; and because it does apply to the General Government, whose functions alone differentiate us as a nation, from a mere aggregation of individual States, therefore we may have a Christian State, but we cannot under our Constitution be a Christian nation. And here let us recall the fact that Massachusetts and Connecticut in the early days made Congregationalism, and Virginia made Episcopacy, the established religion of those States respectively.

But all these statutes have since been repealed, so that not only are we not now a Christian nation, but not one of the forty-five States of the Union is a distinctively Christian State. As to this let us cite the testimony of the courts. Thus the Supreme Court of Ohio has expressly declared that "neither Christianity nor any other system of religion is a part of the law of the State." This decision was reaffirmed afterward; and still later the same court said: "If Christianity is a law of the State, like every law it must have a sanction; adequate penalties must be provided. . . . No one seriously contends for any such doctrine in this country, or I might almost say in this age of the world." [23 Ohio State Reports.]

Again, Judge Welch, of the Ohio Supreme Court, said that the teaching of the Christian religion in the public schools "violates the spirit of our constitutional guarantees;" that "if we have no right to tax the citizen to support worship, we have no right to tax him to support religious instruction." [Granger O. S. R. 250, Board of Education ex. Minor et al.] And Chief Justice Cooley, of Michigan, declares "all support of religious instruction must be entirely voluntary." This not only settles the matter as to statutory law, but as to common law as well; for obviously there is no such thing as common law which can only be enforced by voluntary agreement and not at all by process of law. Further decisions to the same effect could be cited, but they do not seem necessary.

To the proposition that we are a Christian nation, the first obvious reply is the prohibition of the Constitution itself in the First Amendment, denying to Congress the right to make any law respecting the establishment of religion. Really this is the whole of it. We may still be a Christian people, but they surely cannot rightly be designated a Christian nation, although a Christian people, whose fundamental law not only supplies neither sanction nor penalties, but expressly prohibits the establishment of any religion whatever. Neither is Christianity the common law of the nation. Think of Congress being prohibited from enforcing the common law of the land! Yet such would be the absurd situation were Christianity part of the common law. Furthermore, if the nation were distinctively Christian, the Jewish and other religions would owe their existence here to toleration; but they do not owe it to toleration, but to that perfect equality of right under which all religions occupy the same footing. Again, the negative evidence points to the same conclusion; for we find no mention of God in the Constitution—not even in the oath required of the President.

Our valued correspondent, we think, makes too little of the Trip-ii Treaty with its declaration: "As the Government of the United States is not in any sense founded on the Christian religion. . . . it has no enmity against Mussulmans," etc. This affirmation was made by Washington, then President, and his Cabinet—in which were Jefferson and Hamilton—and by the United States Senate, many of whose members assisted in founding the Government and participated in formulating its Constitution. And is it conceivable that such a declaration if false would have passed that illustrious body, our first United States Senate, unchallenged, if it asserted what was not true?—or are we to suppose that Washington and Jefferson and Hamilton and Madison and Adams and Lee and Morris and Ellsworth and the other illustrious men of those days did not know whether or not the Government they were instrumental in establishing was founded on the Christian religion?

That the declaration was not repeated in a subsequent treaty is not remarkable, but it would be matter of surprise had it been: one statement of this character was surely sufficient. And one word right here: Dr. Atterbury quotes the declaration of a Supreme Court justice that "this is a Christian nation," touching which we may say the justice who delivered it—we believe Justice Brewer—upon being written to on the subject by the writer of this, replied that it was "a casual obiter dictum carrying no judicial force whatever."

* For editorial comment upon this point, see the article "Casual Obiter Dictum," on page 50.

It seems clear, then, that the history of the formation of the States; the decisions of the Supreme Courts of Ohio and Michigan, the testimony of the Constitution itself, and the President and Senate in ratifying the treaty with Tripoli, and the absolute equality of right enjoyed by all religions,—all establish the fact that the Christian religion, though a great moral force widely recognized, is neither the statute nor common law of the nation; that we are a Christian people, not a Christian nation, just as we are a Protestant people, but not a Protestant nation. And surely so long as Christianity is inwrought in the hearts and consciences of our people, it is of no concern whether it be in our statutory or common law or not. Putting it there would make us no better; because it is not there we are none the worse, for still it holds true that error may well be given full liberty where truth is left free to combat it.
