SUNDAY evening, February 2, the City Vigilance League for the enforcement of Sunday observance, outdid itself by arresting a woman and her two little girls in a restaurant at No. 132 West Twenty-sixth street, and taking them, bewildered and terrified, to a police station, where, after a short detention, they were set at liberty. Speaking of the occurrence, one of the little victims said: "We were so frightened we did not know what to do. We tried to hide behind mamma, but a big man seized us by the arms and took us to the police station. They would not even let us be with mamma on the way. We don't know what it was all about, for we cried all the time from fear, and finally, the big policeman in the station-house told us we could go. There were some men in tall hats who were dressed like gentlemen, and they told two big men to take us along. They held us by the arm all the way and hurt us because they squeezed so tight."

It is true, the arrest was made by Mr. Theodore Dwight, and was discountenanced by the league officials when they heard of it; but Mr. Dwight is an agent of the league, and there is no evidence to show that he exceeded the limits of his instructions in making the arrest.

Public feeling has been considerably stirred by the incident, and some prominent officials of the city have expressed emphatic condemnation of the proceeding. Some of the expressions as quoted are as follows:—

Police Commissioner Grant: "I am glad at all times to have reputable citizens aid the police in the work of suppressing crime; but I do not approve of permitting the officers of any society to use our policemen in carrying on their alleged work in the interest of morality. I do not want to be understood as saying that the excise law shall not be enforced, but it should be done in a proper way, with no mean tricks resorted to by officers to make cases against inoffensive people."

John B. Pannes, President of the German-American Reform Union: "This is an outrage on the personal liberties of the people, and similar occurrences will continue just so long as we are compelled to live under the present tyrannical system. Think of the liberty of many persons depending on a cracker, —for if the waiter had served a crust of bread or a cracker with the drinks ordered by these reformers, no raid could have been made, and these innocent persons would not have been molested. The affair was fanatical, outrageous, and unjust."

Ex-Judge Alfred Steckler: "It was a most outrageous action that should be condemned by every one, and some means should be taken to put a stop to any further impositions on the people by such misguided individuals as Dwight. Words fail to express the indecency of such an outrage as dragging innocent little children to a police-station simply because they were with their mother in a restaurant where the liquor law may have been violated. The statutes give no one authority for such a proceeding."

Excise Commissioner Julius Harburger: "It is one of the most outrageous attempts to hamper the personal liberties of the people that I have ever known. The continuation of such violations of individual rights endangers our republican form of government."

This is probably the worst exhibition of "reform" fanaticism yet seen in New York under the present Sunday "law" of the city; but it is only a step beyond the proceedings taken in some other Sunday arrests which the SENTINEL has noticed.

We call attention to these things to point out the fact that the trouble is in the "law" itself. No good law operates in such a way. Misguided zealots do not overstep the bounds of justice, common sense, individual rights, and humanity, in seeking to enforce a proper statute, as do these "reformers" in their eagerness to stop Sunday business by the saisons, bake-shops, etc. And why this fanatical zeal on the part of the latter? Is it not because the "law" does honor to a religious institution—the Sunday sabbath—and thus appeals to the religious sentiment and arouses the religious zeal of a certain class of the people? Are not those who are foremost in securing the enforcement of the excise (Sunday) statute foremost also in their zeal for religion and for Sunday as the weekly sabbath? It must be admitted that they are. An excise law which applies merely to Sunday is a Sunday "law," and a Sunday "law" is a religious "law," as surely as Sunday is a religious institution. If temperance is the object sought, then let the saloon business be prohibited on all days alike.

The truth is, that a religious "law" is not law at all, and having no foundation in reason and justice, it is not strange that no proper way can be found of enforcing it, or that fanatical zeal is displayed under cover of its sanction.

Let legislation be enacted and enforced solely in the interests of the rights of the people, and such incidents as that to which we have referred will speedily become things of the past.
