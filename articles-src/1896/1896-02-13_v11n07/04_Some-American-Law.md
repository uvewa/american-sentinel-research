A GENTLEMAN in this city obtained a verdict of six cents, recently, from a jury in the Supreme Court of this State against the Third Avenue Railroad Company, for the death of his two-year-old daughter. The attorney for the defendants, in speaking of the verdict, said:—

There have been several such cases in other States. Six cents seems a small sum for the life of a child, but it must be remembered that there are many chances against a two-year-old child, especially a female, being of any value, commercially speaking. She may die or be deformed or be rendered helpless in a thousand ways. All those things must be taken into consideration, and they evidently were considered by the jury.

The lawyer stated correctly the principles governing such cases. The pain and shock to the parents cannot be legally considered.

Damages must be assessed only on the proved probable money value of the life. If however a man is subject to intense physical suffering he can recover damages for it. But the law provides for nothing of the kind in such cases as the one in question. As before stated, the only thing to be considered is the value of the life in dollars and cents. The law does not undertake to guard the feelings in such cases, or to compensate anybody for sustaining such a mental shock as is incident to the death of a loved one under such circumstances.

But the "law" is not always thus unkind. Corporations cannot be made to pay for the rude shocks to which fond parents are subjected by the careless killing or maiming of their children; but in some States, at least, we find an attempt to guard by "law" the religious sensibilities of the people. In Tennessee, anything which is likely to shock the "moral sense of the community" is punishable as a nuisance, and it is not even necessary to prove that anybody's feelings were really thus shocked.

Even in the State of New York observers of the seventh day are only permitted to work on Sunday provided the labor is "done in such a manner as not to interrupt or disturb other persons." Just how much or how little this means remains for the courts to say. But in view of the interpretation put upon similar laws in other States, it would seem only reasonable to suppose that this provision refers not only to physical disturbance, but to mental annoyance, in which case the "law" certainly guards religious sensibility more carefully in some respects than it does parental affection, or even child life.
