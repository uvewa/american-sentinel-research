FROM a legal standpoint the argument of the Christian Work, on page 53, is conclusive. Upon no sound principle of law can it be asserted that this nation has any religious character whatever. But as a matter of fact, not only the several States but the nation is influenced very decidedly by popular Christianity.

It was doubtless the purpose of the founders of this Government to make it purely secular; wholly separate, not only from any church but from religion as well; not opposed to religion, but simply having nothing to do with it, just as a business concern, while not hostile to religion, has no religious character.

According to the Declaration of Independence the sanctions of civil government are found in the existence of God-given, natural rights. But while this is true, there has been a disposition on the part of our courts to find the sanctions of our civil codes, not so much in the inherent rights of man, as in the religion of the people. Forgetting that other peoples knowing nothing of Christianity have had codes of manners fully equal to our own, learned judges have sought in the Christian religion that justification for the laws of justice which our forefathers declared to be self-evident.

Justice Brewer probably meant by his "casual obiter dictum" no more than be now professes; but it is, nevertheless, a step, and a long one, in the return journey to the judicial maxims of that period of the world when the State was the obedient servant of the Church.

Justice Brewer cannot recall his words; and if he could that would not greatly alter the facts, for as the decision shows, his conception of the sanction of government is wrong. Not the will of the people, or the intent of the law makers, but the eternal principles of justice is the touchstone to which such questions as that involved in the Trinity Church case should be brought.

Justice Brewer ought to have pursued a line of argument as broad, far-reaching, and comprehensive as the constitutional inhibition of any law prohibiting the free exercise of religion; one that would have covered the case of a Jewish rabbi, a pagan priest, or an infidel lecturer equally as well as that of a Christian minister. The alarming feature of the decision is that the reason beyond all others by which the learned justice "sustains" it, followed to its logical conclusion, would justify legislation friendly to Christianity and hostile to paganism, Judaism, or skepticism.

The court argued that such an interpretation as was sought to be put upon the Contract Labor Law was not admissible because of the Christian sentiments of the people. He ought to have argued that such an interpretation was not admissible because of the fact that the Constitution, recognizing the inalienable right of every man to freely practice whatever religion his mind accepted, forbade Congress to make any "law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof."

The Constitution of the United States if adopted by China ought to safeguard in that land every right which it defines and guarantees in this country. To forbid a church or churches to secure pastors wherever they saw fit would be to prohibit "the free exercise of religion," and would be just as violative of the Constitution, just as much beyond the legitimate power of Congress, in the case of a pagan priest as of a Christian minister. But to say the very least, Justice Brewer's line of argument necessarily suggests the thought that had the prevailing religion of the country been pagan, or Jewish, instead of Christian, that interpretation by which it was sought to exclude a Christian minister might have been sustained!

It matters not that Justice Brewer differentiates between the people and the nation, and meant only, that owing to the Christian sentiment of the people the court could not suppose that Congress intended to enact legislation hostile to Christianity. The Constitution was designed as a check upon the very sentiment which Justice Brewer thus in effect assumes is supreme. Under the Constitution as our fathers made it, religious sentiment can never be crystallized into law in this country; but that is the very thing that Justice Brewer's line of argument would invite and justify; for it necessarily follows, if his reasoning be correct, that the religious sentiment of the people, and not the Constitution is the supreme law of the land; or, in other words, that that instrument must be interpreted not by natural, inalienable rights, not by the principles of the Declaration of Independence, but by religious sentiment; and that that sentiment being Christian the supreme law must be Christian! The further conclusion is unavoidable, that if that sentiment were to change, if the people were to become pagans, the supreme law would become pagan, and Christian ministers might then be excluded without an iota of change in the written Constitution!

The truth is that the whole thought underlying Justice Brewer's Christian-nation argument is wrong, and is not made one whit better by the fact that the particular words in question are "obiter dictum, having no judicial force whatever."
