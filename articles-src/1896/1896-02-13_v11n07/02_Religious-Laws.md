THERE is nothing more unchristian than a man-made religious "law."

Religious legislation is solely a prerogative of the Creator. When man presumes to enact such legislation he assumes to put himself in the place of God. His religious legislation, so far from being Christian, becomes from its very assumption to be such, actual blasphemy.

"Every word of God is pure; he is a shield unto them that put their trust in him. Add thou not unto his words, lest he reprove thee, and thou be found a liar." Prov. 30: 5, 6. Religious legislation presumes to add to the words of God.

Every word of God is law. It is law because it is right, because it is truth, because it is just, and because it will certainly be carried into effect. And therefore any religious legislation by man becomes but a man-made addition to the word of God, and subjects its authors to the reproof of the Almighty, which will demonstrate them to be liars, and appoint their portion with the lovers of untruth.
