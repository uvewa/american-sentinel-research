### BEHIND PRISON BARS FOR CONSCIENCE' SAKE.

MARCH 13, Tennessee imprisoned another man for conscience' sake.

This victim of an unjust "law" is J. W. Lewis, a Seventh-day Adventist, of Lake County, Tenn. The place of his imprisonment is Tiptonville.

He was indicted on the technical charge of "nuisance," the gist of his offense being "secular labor on Sunday."

The trial was before His Honor, Judge Swiggert, who has had quite a large experience in such cases.

That the judge did not regard the offense as a serious one is evident from the fact that he imposed only a nominal fine—one dollar; but the costs were heavy, amounting to $60.46, making a total, fine and costs, of $61.46.

Under the law of Tennessee, fifteen dollars of this cannot be satisfied by imprisonment; so that in this case the imprisonment, at twenty-five cents per day, will be for one hundred and eighty-six days.

As usual in such cases, the work for which Mr. Lewis is thus imprisoned, was ordinary private work, of such a nature as not to attract undue attention; and the evidence showed plainly that nobody was disturbed or annoyed by it, except as some may have suffered that sort of mental annoyance due to an unwillingness that others should enjoy equal rights and privileges with themselves.

The animus of the prosecution was plainly shown in the speech of the prosecuting attorney to the jury. The attorney who, by the way, bears the same name as the defendant in this case, addressed the jury substantially as follows:—

Our sabbath is the very foundation of our moral government. One man's conscience may lead him to keep one day, another man's conscience may lead him to keep another day, and so on until we have no sabbath. Gentlemen of the jury, we cannot let things go on in this way.

These Adventists are like the Mormons. One man's conscience may require him to have twenty wives, another man's conscience may require him to take every good woman in the community. Gentlemen of the jury, this work must be stopped.

Every civilized nation regards our sabbath. If these Adventists are permitted to go on in this way, everybody may take his gun and go hunting on Sunday. The saloon keeper may open his saloon and sell whiskey on Sunday. Our sabbath was kept by God Almighty himself, and shall these Adventists be permitted to override this sacred institution?

All civilized nations keep this day. The most wicked man among us, the man who gambles and gets his neighbor's money until Saturday night, feels a holy awe as the holy day is approaching, and he now lays aside his work to keep his reputation.

An Adventist's conscience leads him to build houses on the sabbath, another's conscience leads him to open a saloon and sell whiskey on the sabbath, another's conscience may lead him to open his store and sell goods on that day, if there is the biggest rush then. Gentlemen, this work must be stopped to save our country from going to ruin.

The constitution of the State of Tennessee provides "that no human authority can in any case whatever control or interfere with the rights of conscience; and that no preference shall ever be given by law to any religious establishment or mode of worship." But it is as plain as anything can be that if Attorney-General J. W. Lewis, who prosecuted this case, understands the purpose of this "law" under which Adventist J. W. Lewis is at present undergoing imprisonment, it is for the purpose of compelling the observance of a religious institution. The plea is too plainly religious to be mistaken; but it is no more religious in its terms than the "law" is in its intent. The truth is that the constitutional guarantee of freedom of conscience in Tennessee is overridden in the interests of Sunday sacredness, and J. W. Lewis is to-day undergoing imprisonment in Lake County, Tenn., simply and only because he has offended against a statute-entrenched religious institution. It is a matter of evidence in the case that he injured no one; that he interfered with no one; that he trenched upon the rights of no one; that the nuisance of which he was convicted was simply a legal fiction.

There were four other cases before the court on this occasion, but they were continued until the July term, at the request of the defendants.
