THE GOSEL OF CHRIST IS "THE POWER OF GOD UNTO SALVATION TO EVERY ONE THAT BELLEVETH." ROM. 1:16. THE DEVIL'S GOSEL—FOR HE CAN TRANSFORM HIMSELF INTO AN ANGEL OF LIGHT (2 Cor. 11:14)—IS, SALVATION(?) THROUGH OUTWARD RELIGIOUS FORMS BY THE POWER OF COMPULSION TO ALL WHO CAN BE SUBJECTED THERETO, WITHOUT REGARD TO BELIEF OR CONSCIENCE.
