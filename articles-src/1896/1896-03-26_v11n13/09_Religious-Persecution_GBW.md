# RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION.

[George B. Wheeler in Boston Standard.]

The cause of all the religious persecution that ever existed has been the attempts to compel religious conformity by law, and it is the rise of this spirit that is causing the revival of persecution in different parts of the world. In this country, and by Protestants, it is enforcing conformity by law to the observance of Sunday as a sacred day by abstaining from both labor and amusements on that day. This has already resulted in outrageous persecution for conscience' sake in several States, instigated by Protestants and approved by many leading Protestant religious papers and clergymen. The history of the past shows abundantly that another feature of this persecuting spirit is that civil reasons are always ascribed as the motive, and never religious reasons. It is so even now.

In New England the rise of this spirit enforcing religious conformity by law in the observance of Sunday as a sacred day finds expression in the New England Sabbath Protective League, formed for the purpose of defending the "sabbath" against encroachments upon its sacredness by business and pleasure, and to maintain a proper observance of the Lord's day by legislation.

The principle involved in this is a direct blow at the liberties of the people. It takes away the individual's right of private judgment in a matter that pertains to his own good, which right lies at the basis of his liberties; and says to him, you must keep Sunday sacred by abstaining from both work and amusements for your own good. If you differ from us in your belief as to the sacredness of the day and its necessity for your good, that makes no difference, we shall compel you to lay aside your judgment and put ours in the place of it.

In this movement the State at the behest of the church practically confiscates one-seventh of every individual's natural right to his time, to do whatever may in his judgment contribute most to his happiness, so far as he does not infringe on the equal rights of his neighbor. And if it has the right to do that, it has the right to take two-sevenths, or to take the whole of his time and reduce him to slavery, because that principle is recognized.

To illustrate, suppose the Roman Catholic hierarchy should get control of this commonwealth, as many fear, and should pass a law that no one shall deacetate any of their holy days (over 200 in number) by engaging in either labor or amusement on them: would Protestants acquiesce and acknowledge the principle to be just? No; they would look upon it as an outrageous assault upon their

liberties. If that is so in one case it certainly is in the other.

When the New England Sabbath Protective League seeks for legislation providing that employers shall give their workmen a release from labor one day in seven, without designating the day, or infringing on their natural right to engage in anything that may contribute to their happiness, so long as they are civil, then, and then only, will the public be convinced that they are seeking the welfare of the workman only, as they claimed in Music Hall at the annual meeting recently; and not that they are seeking enforced conformity in the observance of a religious institution by law.

The Roman Catholic hierarchy and these Protestant Sabbath leagues claim to be intensely patriotic, but the fact is that there is nothing more unpatriotic or un-American than the upholding of the principle of religious conformity by law, which is as a dagger aimed at the very vitals of our liberties.
