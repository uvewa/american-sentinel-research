THE so-called Lord's day Act of the Province of Ontario, like Constantine's famous Sunday edict of A. D. 321, does not apply to agricultural laborers. A bill has been introduced into the Provincial Legislature at Toronto to extend the "law" so as to prohibit all secular labor, except works of necessity or mercy, on Sunday. The demand for the change in the "law" comes from the County of Essex, where there are quite a number of Adventists.
