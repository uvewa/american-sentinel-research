### PROHIBITION A PROPER POLICY.

Under this heading, Rev. Thomas L. Poulson contributes an able article in the New York Christian Advocate, of Dec. 12, 1895, showing conclusively the propriety of prohibition, both from the standpoint of political economy and from that of justice. We present some extracts from the article, in justification of a policy which the SENTINEL has always advocated, and upon which it would lay special emphasis to-day, in view of the compromise which is being made by the friends of prohibition with the forces of evil. Let the reader bear in mind, as he peruses Mr. Poulson's statements, that the prohibition cause is now, to all human appearance, about to suffer shipwreck upon the rock of Sunday legalization. Let the friends of prohibition who may read this, consider with whom the compromise is being made which establishes the saloon upon a legal basis, so that it may lawfully engage in its terrible business during six days in every week. It is with the devil; and in a compromise with him, he never loses. The loss is all on the other side; and it is a total loss, while the devil gains all he asks. Right can never compromise with wrong, either legally or otherwise. Mr. Poulson says:—

A consensus of experience has taught that the liquor traffic not only propagates disorder and destroys peace, but that it also imposes an enormous amount of needless expense both upon government and individual citizens. This it does in many ways.

1. A small revenue is raised from license to those who pocket the profits, which necessitates the levying of a heavy tax on the balance of the community for the support of paupers, and the arrest, trial, conviction, and punishment of criminals, created by the authorized sale of liquor. An annual income of about thirty millions from licenses and taxes is offset by an enforced expenditure of about ten hundred millions to repair the actual damage wrought by the licensed traffic. This "penny wles and pound foolish" policy is too trivial to engage the serious attention of full-grown men.

2. The licensed traffic is the occasion of the annual consumption by working people in this country of about two hundred millions of their hard-earned wages for intoxicants, to the infinite material detriment of themselves and their families, to say nothing of the large amount foolishly and wickedly squandered in other directions while these sotish victims are under the witchery of drink.

3. The traffic is the indirect cause of thousands of bad debts, whereby hundreds of thousands of dollars are annually lost to many who do not themselves indulge in drink.

4. The traffic is the source of idleness, and thus causes an immense waste of time and labor, which are money.

5. It impoverishes the people, hinders the improvement of property, and lessens its taxable value.

6. It compels the exoneration of the drink victims from taxation, by which thousands are annually lost to the State and nation, or advanced by sober taxpayers.

7. By careful computation and close observation it

is discovered that each dollar spent for intoxicating drinks coerces the disbursement of another similar sum. That is, if eight hundred millions are spent for drink, another eight hundred millions must be expended to meet the exigencies occasioned by the outlay of the first amount.

This financial holocaust is not only unnecessary, but it is outrageous and ruinous. It is just so much invested to generate brutish intemperance and crime, to manufacture and multiply paupers, and to render the people wretched. It is a price paid for broken hearts; it is making chattels of beggared and orphaned children and widowed and abused women, and a pestiferous moral junk shop of society. It is putting a premium on vice and discounting virtue. All this is the legitimate fruit of that incomparable anomaly yeloped the license system, in the name of good government.

It is impossible to make a minute or exact estimate of the amounts or methods by which the liquor traffic imposes useless and cruel pecuniary burdens on the people.

The facts to which we have diverted constitute, in our judgment, an overwhelming argument in favor of prohibition on the single score of political economy.

Suppose such a law would only prevent one half the drinking, would it not thus save one half the outlay for drink, or many millions each year? Is not this one consideration a sufficient economic reason for prohibition?

License implies and requires the protection of the authorized vendor, and the consequent oppression of society for his benefit. Nearly all legislation on this subject for the five hundred years of thus dealing with the traffic has been against the people and for the protection of the wicked business. Government cannot license without protection. License relieves the seller of all lawful responsibility for the paupers made, the crimes committed, the property destroyed, and the lives lost by his otherwise lawless acts. It is manifest injustice and heartless despotism for the State to hold the licensed seller in any way amenable for the direct and inevitable results of his business, well known in advance, and for which it has deliberately sold him legal immunity. Society is utterly defenseless, so far as civil law is concerned, against the flagrant wrongs inflicted upon it by the licensed sale of intoxicating liquors, and must continue to suffer the manifold evils of the system while it abides.

Prohibition reverses the unnatural order of the license system by protecting society in advance, by the proverbial ounce of prevention, which is declared to be better than the pound of cure. We believe this to be the only effective method by which we can successfully cannonade error and cancels truth.

No person can be constitutionally licensed to do anything that is prejudicial to the public welfare. The very genius and intention of government are invaded and inverted by such a monstrous proposition. We therefore declare it to be our solemn conviction that no greater outrage was ever perpetrated, and no more fearful tragedy enacted under any form of government known in this world, than that of the licensed sale of intoxicating beverages.

Prohibition is not a new proposition among human institutions. It originated in this country almost with our national birth. The Continental Congress passed a resolution on Feb. 27, 1777, six months and twenty-three days after the Declaration of Independence was issued, recommending "the several States to prohibit the pernicious practice of distilling."

Direct prohibition of the liquor traffic has been in vogue in many of the States, from time to time, from that day to this, and successfully enforced.

Prohibition of the liquor traffic proposes no new principle of law. Ninety-nine out of every one hundred are prohibited under the present license system. The right of search is recognized under all forms of criminal law. The destruction of property illegally or harmfully held is demanded by laws in almost universal existence—such as impure food, vicious beasts, burglars' tools, etc.

Prohibition of the liquor traffic invades no vested rights. All rights under good government come from one or more of three sources, namely, natural, common, or statute laws.

Natural law, says Blackstone, requires "a man to live honestly, hurt nobody, and render to every man his due." A liquor seller necessarily violates these three fundamental limitations of government, and in the nature of the case is an outlaw, even though he sells under a license. Common law, says the same author, requires a man not to use his own property to the injury of another, the consent of the second party being no mitigation of the offense. A review of his house for a saloon, as well as the seller of strong drink, directly transgresses this common compact of government, consent of the victims not lessening the degree of guilt. So we see the modern saloon could not exist under natural or common laws. Statutory

law, in direct contravention of both natural and common laws, gives the legal right to sell. But such a privilege is, of course, held by the decree of the legislature, and can be revoked at its option. When such revocation occurs, no legal right to sell liquors remains, and therefore no right could possibly be invaded or withheld by abolishing all license laws.

Let it be remembered that prohibition and the Sunday excise law are incompatible. Acceptance of one means the surrender of the other. Shall we by "law" exalt a religious institution at such a sacrifice as the surrender of prohibition? Shall we gain in the contest with the saloon by investing it with respectability as a Sunday-keeping and law-abiding institution? The saloon has shown its willingness to keep Sunday; but it is the same death-dealing institution still. Let us have prohibition; and let Sunday and all other religious institutions be left to stand on their own merits.
