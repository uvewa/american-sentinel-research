OUR CANADIAN SPECIAL.

THE next number of the SENTINEL will be a Special treating on religious persecution in Canada. Extra copies will be furnished at the usual rates, $1 per hundred. Here are offers which will enable you to send this issue of the SENTINEL to scores, yes, hundreds of your friends for the first cost of the paper, without the additional postage:

OFFER NO. 1.

Send a list of the names and addresses of your friends, plainly written, and we will send copies of this issue of the SENTINEL to any number of names for one and a quarter cents each.

OFFER NO. 2.

Send us wrappers, shaped and addressed similarly to the following cut, and we will send the SENTINEL you desire to one hundred names for one dollar.

Wrappers of thin manilla paper are the best. Be careful to write the names and addresses plainly, and write them about an inch or an inch and a half from the edge. The wrappers should be about eight by eleven inches; with the corners clipped, as in cut. In mailing the wrappers to us, don't fold them but roll them.
