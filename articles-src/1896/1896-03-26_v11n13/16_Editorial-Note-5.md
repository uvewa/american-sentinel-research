FOR MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS THERE HAS BEEN A GROWING DEMAND IN LONDON FOR THE OPENING OF THE NATIONAL BUREAU OF REFORMERS AND THE CHURCHMAN'S LEAGUE ARE URGING A FAVORABLE REPORT ON THE SUBSTITUTE BILL INTRODUCED ON THE 5TH INST., AT THE INSTIGATION OF W. F. CRAFTS, WHO HAS TWICE APPEARED BEFORE THE COMMISSIONERS, ONCE ON THE 6TH INST., AND AGAIN ON THE 18TH, TO URGE A FAVORABLE REPORT UPON THE MEASURE. IT IS SAID THAT HIS IDEA IS THAT IF A PRECEDENT CAN ONCE BE ESTABLISHED FOR SUNDAY LEGISLATION OF THAT CHARACTER BY CONGRESS, IT WILL OBVIATE THE NECESSITY FOR ANY RELIGIOUS AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION.
