## THAT HEARING AGAIN.

As reported in these columns last week, the hearing on the 11th inst., before the Judiciary Committee of the House on the so-called "Christian" amendment to the Constitution, was an occasion of unusual interest. The impression received by those present was that the advocates of the measure succeeded in convincing the committee that the proposed amendment was not only unnecessary, but that it was mischievous and wrong. The Christian Statesman, however, takes a more hopeful view of the situation, more hopeful from its standpoint, and while admitting that "a possible and even a probable result of the work done may be the holding back of the report of the committee until next year," finds even in this delay "an opportunity for a wider circulation of petitions, and a more emphatic expression of the 'Christian' sentiment of the country."

The Statesman makes a great deal of the fact that the Christian ministers who opposed the amendment were compelled to do so side by side with prominent infidels and freethinkers. "It is seen now more clearly than ever before," remarks the Statesman, "that the enemies of Christ and his religion are consistent opponents of this amendment. Infidelity and atheism are simply revealing their true inwardness when they utter their characteristic denunciations of the amendment." "Let the lines be more and more clearly drawn," says the Statesman. "This campaign has done much to clear the atmosphere.

Another campaign will show the followers of Christ, very generally throughout the nation, that if they oppose the 'Christian' amendment they must do so in company of the hosts of infidelity, spiritualism, atheism, and all the other forces of evil that are cursing our country."

It is to such "arguments" that the Statesman resorts in this its hour of humiliating and crushing defeat. According to this we are left to infer that a Christian has no right to claim liberty of conscience if an infidel does the same thing! It is simply a repetition of the old cry: "This man receiveth sinners and eateth with them;" and, "Behold a gluttonous man and a winebibber, and friend of publicans and sinners."

It is in vain, however, that the Statesman and its partisans assume to be the Christian people. The amendment which they are urging is the very opposite of Christian. It would destroy and take away from men the very liberty which Christianity gives.
