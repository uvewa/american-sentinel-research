BY ANY ONE RECEIVING THE AMERICAN SENTINEL without having ordered it may know that it is sent to him by some friend. Therefore, those who have not ordered the SENTINEL need have no fears that they will be asked to pay for it.

THE next number of the SENTINEL will be devoted to the discussion of religious liberty in Canada. For terms for extra copies, see preceding page.

THE National Reformers never met a more crushing defeat than in the hearing on the proposed "Christian" amendment before the Judiciary Committee of the House on the 11th inst.

THE members of the committee are readers of the AMERICAN SENTINEL, and could not be deceived by the sophistry of the National Reformers. They wanted explicit and clear-cut statements of the purpose and scope of the proposed amendment.

PERSISTENT questioning drew out from Professor Coleman, of Allegheny, Pa., the declaration that he did not support the Constitution; had not taken the oath of allegiance to this Government; had not voted and never would vote or hold office under the present Constitution; that he was not in fact an American citizen, but an imported Scotch Covenanter.

PROFESSOR COLEMAN soon retired discomfited, and Dr. McAllister, editor of the *Christian Statesman*, undertook to repair the National Reform fences. But it was a hopeless case. The questions from the committee continued. The following are samples:—

Ques. If the Bible is placed in the Constitution, does it not become a part of the law of the land?

Ans. Yes.

Q. If, then, the Bible is the law of the land, must not the Supreme Court give its construction to the Bible as law?

A. Yes.

Q. If, then, the Supreme Court decides that the Bible Sabbath is Saturday and not Sunday, will not all citizens be compelled by law to keep Saturday instead of Sunday?

No answer.

"The doctor was caught in his own trap," writes a spectator; "he was putting a boomerang into the Constitution; he was enthroning the Bible there—not the Bible as he understood it, but *the Bible as construed by the Supreme Court*. That construction, for the time being, would be the law of the land, and the State could enforce Saturday as the Sabbath, immersion as baptism, etc. Where would the Scotch Covenanters be then?"

THE effect of the hearing upon the committee is indicated most unmistakably by the fact that at a meeting of the whole committee on the 17th inst., it was decided unanimously not to report the proposed amendment. Exit National Reform for 1896!
