MR. CRAFTS, he of the "National Bureau of Reforms," visited Baltimore recently, according to the Herald, of that city, and preached in the Second Presbyterian Church on the 15th inst., on his favorite theme, "The American Sabbath." Among other things he said: "We are told that 'the complicated civilization of the 19th century' requires that sabbath observance and sabbath laws should be relaxed.' 'But,' said he, 'more than ever before we should see to it that neither ourselves nor others cause any Sunday work except of necessity or charity.'"
