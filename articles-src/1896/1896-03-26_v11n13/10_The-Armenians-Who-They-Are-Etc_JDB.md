## THE ARMENIANS—WHO THEY ARE, ETC.

[By James D. Barton, D. D., Secretary of the American Board, in the Independent, March 5.]

According to Armenian histories, the chief of the Armenians was Haik, the son of Togarmah, the son of Gomer, the son Japheth, the son of Noah. It is an interesting fact that the Armenians to this day call themselves Haik, their language "Haiaren," and their country "Haiasdan." "Armenia" and "Armenian" are words which cannot be spelled with Armenian characters or easily pronounced by that people. That name was given them and their country by outside nations because of the prowess of one of their kings, Aram, the seventh from Haik.

Probably this people is composed of the resultant of strong Aryan tribes overrunning and conquering the country now occupied by the Armenians, and which was then possessed by primitive Turanian populations. Subject to the vicissitudes of conquest and invasion the borders of Armenia have fluctuated. Lake Van has always been within the kingdom, and the capital has usually remained during their highest prosperity at the city of Van. They have had a long line of

### Kings of Valor and Renown.

They were an independent nation but with varying degrees of power until A. D. 1375, when they became completely a subject people. Since that time their country has been under the governments of Russia, Persia, and Turkey, far the larger portion being in Turkey. During the years of their greatest prosperity, from 600 B. C. to about 400 A. D., this nation played a prominent part in the wars of the Assyrians, Medes, Persians, Greeks and Romans.

There are, perhaps, from two and a half to three millions of Armenians in Turkey, Russia, and Persia. In the absence of accurate records we must be content with a mere estimate, based upon observations and inadequate government returns. In no extended district do they comprise a majority of the inhabitants. They are everywhere mingled with and surrounded by Kurds and Turks. The Armenians are forbidden to carry or possess arms under severe penalties, while the other races are armed, many of them by the government.

Armenian histories relate that, soon after the resurrection of Christ, Abgar, the King of Armenia, with his court accepted Christianity. This was short-lived however; but in the third century, A. D., under the leadership of Gregory the Illuminator, the Armenian people, as a nation, became Christian. This was

### The First Nation to Adopt Christianity as a National Religion.

The church was called "Gregorian" by those outside, but "Loosavochagan" by the Armenians, the word meaning "Illuminator," the name given to Gregory. The Gregorians and Greeks worked in harmony in the great councils of the church until 451. At the fourth Ecumenical Council, which met at Chalcedon that year, the Gregorian Church separated from the Greek upon the so-called Monophysite doctrine, the former accepting and the latter rejecting it. Since then the Gregorian Church has been distinctly and exclusively an Armenian national Church.

The organization and control of the church is essentially episcopal.

### The Spiritual Head is a Catholicos;

but in addition to him there is a Patriarch, whose office bears largely upon the political side of the national life as related to the Ottoman Government. There are three of the former residing in the order of their importance at Echmiadzin, in Russia, Aghtamar, on an island in Lake Van, and at Sis in Cilicia, each with his own diocese. There are two of the latter residing at Constantinople and Jerusalem. There are nine grades of Armenian clergy.

The Bible was translated into their language in the middle of the fifth century. Owing to a change in the spoken tongue the Bible became a dead book to the people, although it was constantly read at their church services. As the priests scarcely ever understood the Scripture which they read, Christian doctrines were kept alive by oral teachings; but the restraint upon life which pure Christianity exercises was largely removed. They blindly accept the Bible as the Word of God. They have many large, fine churches, some of which are several hundred years old.

This nation has suffered great persecutions for its faith during the last eleven centuries, but with wonderful patience and endurance has clung to the old beliefs and forms of worship. Mission work was begun among them for the purpose of introducing into the church the Bible in the spoken language of the people, in order that its teachings might reform the church and the nation.

### The Armenian Nature is Essentially Religious.

Born into the Church, its customs, traditions and teachings have large influence over the life. Although much of their teachings and many of their customs are based upon mere traditions and are not in accord with the enlightened, educated Christianity of the West, nevertheless the fact that during the last few months thousands among them have deliberately chosen death, with terrible torture, to life and Islam, shows that among them exists much essential Christian faith. It must not be overlooked that the old church has been greatly enlightened and elevated by the mission schools and colleges planted in their country, and the evangelistic work carried on among them. They, too, in imitation of the evangelical branch of their nation, have organized schools, accepted the Bible in the spoken language, and introduced into their church worship many of the methods of Christian instruction used by the Christian Church all over the world.

The Armenians' greatest enemy outside of Islam is

### Their Incompatibility of Character.

They cannot agree among themselves. "Haik voch miapan" ("Armenians cannot agree") is one of their many proverbs. This is their national weakness. Owing to this fact, which led to internal jealousies and bickerings and strife, during the period of their most successful national life, they were weakened, then disrupted, and finally completely subjugated. This characteristic has constantly appeared in the management of their ecclesiastical affairs; and the Turks in order to control them have made great use of this weakness, playing one party off against another. The source of this national weakness lies in their jealousy of imagined or actual rivals. Suspicious of each other and jealous of competition, the race has been broken up into factions which has rendered impossible anything like a national growth or unity, and has made it easy for the ruling Turk to keep them in complete subjection. Many times the Armenians themselves have been the most effective instruments in the hands of their diplomatic rulers in checking national progress.

Owing to this fact, if for no other reason, a plan for a general revolution upon the part of the Armenians could lead only to exposure and failure. The most intelligent have from the first fully understood this, and have deprecated any agitation which must necessarily end in disaster. The advocates of revolution have almost invariably been men of narrow views and no leadership in the nation at large, who have, outside of Turkey, organized rival societies to collect money from credulous Armenians to the credit of their own personal bank account and for the injury of their protesting people in Turkey. This same characteristic would make it impossible to-day for the Armenians to be self-governing.

The Armenians are the most intelligent of all the peoples of Eastern Turkey.

The Armenians are the farmers, artisans, tradesmen and bankers of Eastern Turkey.

### They Have Strong Commercial Instincts

and mature ability, and, being industrious withal, have made much progress in all these lines. In spite of the heavy restrictions placed upon them by the Turkish government, in the form of general regulations and excessive taxes, in some parts of Turkey the leading business operations are largely in their hands. In some sections of the vilayets of Harpût and Diarbekir, twenty-five years ago, the land was owned almost entirely by Moslems, but rented and farmed by Armenians. At that time the Armenians were not permitted to possess, to any extent, the soil. Lack of industry upon the part of the Mohammedans and the acquirement of property upon the part of the Armenians, largely by emigration to the United States, have led the Turks to sell their ancient estates to Armenians who are supplied with funds from their friends who are working in this country. The careful management of the property thus acquired led to the advancement of the proprietor farmer, while the one from whom the land was purchased was left without an income.

While the Turks in many of the principal cities where Armenians dwell, own most of the shops, the renters are largely Armenians. An intelligent Turkish Governor once told the writer that if the Armenians should suddenly emigrate or be expelled from Eastern Turkey, the Moslem would necessarily follow soon, as there were not enough commercial enterprise and ability coupled with industry

in the Turkish population to meet the absolute needs of the people.

The Armenian is domestic in his habits and aspirations and not military. In the early history of the race we do not find much written of their conquests. They did not go outside of their borders, as a general thing, to conquer their neighbors. While not lacking in physical courage and prowess in war when called to defend their country against invasion, they did not seek to conquer. Sometimes in driving back an aggressive foe they carried the war into his territory and levied upon it for injuries received; yet it never seems to have been their ambition to be a great nation ruling over conquered races.

Their Chief Ambition

appears to have been to possess in quiet their beloved fatherland, "hairenik," where they might worship God according to the demands of their own national church. To-day they have no desire of conquest or ambition to rule. Their greatest wish is to be permitted to enjoy without fear the blessing of their simple domestic life, together with the privileges of worship and education and the opportunity to possess in peace the fruits of their frugal industry. The Armenian loves his children and is most closely attached to his home. When he emigrates it is only for the purpose of trade and gain. His heart's affection centers in the old rude home to which he, if unprevented, will return to rejoin his loved ones. In all his native land the city or village of his birth is the dearest spot on earth.

The Armenians are most simple and frugal in their manner of life. Uncomplaining and generally cheerful, they continue their occupations, following in the footsteps of their fathers without desire for change. The son of the carpenter is a carpenter content with the adz and saw, and the shoemaker sticks to his last without a thought of being anything else so long as that trade serves him. The home life is patriarchal, the father ruling the household, and the sons bringing their wives to the paternal roof. In the event of the death of the father the oldest son takes his place at the head of the family. The aged are held in high esteem, and their counsel sought and honored. The women occupy inferior positions, the nation copying many customs in regard to them from the Turks among whom they live. They are not an immoral race, but are inclined to drink wine, which is a cheap product of their country.
