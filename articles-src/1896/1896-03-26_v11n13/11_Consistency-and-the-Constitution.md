CONSISTENCY AND THE CONSTITUTION.

[Jewish Spectator, March 13, 1896.]

THE Rev. C. J. Oehlschlaeger, a Lutheran clergyman of Richmond, Va., being invited to open the Virginia Legislature with prayer, declined, saying in explanation: "I don't believe in opening a promiscuous political body with prayer. The promiscuous character of the body makes it an unnatural union of Church and State. I, as a Christian, and any member of the body, as a Christian, can privately pray for the session, but the State which that body represents has nothing to do with prayer." Whether "promiscuous" or not, any secular or legislative body, but more especially the House and the Senate of the United States, should not employ a chaplain, no matter what denomination he represents. The Constitution explicitly and emphatically declares the complete separation of Church and State, and any religious function or ceremony is entirely out of place in the public councils of state or nation. The salaries paid to chaplains are evidently a misappropriation of public funds, and the language those reverend gentlemen use to please political partisans frequently shocks the feelings of truly religious and highly cultured men and women.
