# JESUS CHRIST AND THE KINGDOMS OF THIS WORLD.

THE National Reform theory of "Christian" civil government sets forth Jesus Christ as the present civil ruler over the nations. Says the Christian Statesman of June 20:—

God rules over men in the person of his son, Jesus Christ. This is the testimony of the Word. "And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, all power is given unto me in heaven and in earth." "Jesus Christ, he is Lord of all." "Our Lord Jesus Christ . . . who is the blessed and only Potentate, King of kings and Lord of Lords." "Jesus Christ . . . the prince of the kings of the earth." "He is Lord of Jords and King of kings."

The "clear testimony of the Word," however, comes very far from justifying any man-made theocracy, which is what is demanded by the theory that Jesus Christ should rule the nations to-day through human agents. In ancient times God established a theocracy, and he could do the same again if he so chose to-day. But the people had nothing to do with it, except to acquiesce in his arrangements. A true theocracy cannot be set up by fallible, erring mortals.

But it is not God's plan that another theocracy should be established while the earth remains in its present state. The "clear testimony of the Word" is explicit upon this point. Those who appeal to Scripture should not ignore plain Scripture declarations.

It is true that the Lord sits upon the throne of universal dominion, and "his kingdom ruleth over all." But it is true that in this present world his authority is almost universally ignored and his laws trampled under foot. We cannot looked around us anywhere without seeing this. Must we conclude then that God is unable to enforce his laws? No; certainly not. If he chose to compel men to keep them,—to use force, as is done in civil government—he could terrify men into submission, or could annihilate in a moment every transgressor of his precepts. And by the rule of civil government something like this would be necessary; for in civil government the penalty of the law must be executed, and the penalty for transgression of God's law is death.

But now, we are living under the merciful regime established by God himself, for the salvation of transgressors from sin and death. God is dealing with men through the provisions of the gospel, and will continue thus to do until the period of human probation is ended. And therefore, while he is the supreme ruler over all, and while Jesus Christ is exalted to a position of power and authority far above that of any earthly ruler, his power is manifested in his divine providences which overrule the purposes of man, rather than by the direct agency of earthly potentates.

God has ordained civil government upon the earth. "The powers that be are ordained of God." Rom. 13:1. No sensible person could suppose that God would have the world in confusion and anarchy. But because he has ordained that there should be civil rulers, it does not follow that we are bound by every decree or "law" which they may enact. King Nebuchadnezzar was a civil ruler ordained of God, but the three Hebrews were justified in disobeying his "law" concerning worship of his golden image. The divine rule was given by Peter and John: "We ought to obey God rather than men." Civil government was not ordained to take the place of conscience or be its guide. The ordinances of men sometimes come in conflict with the requirements of God; and we are never justified in disobeying God.

As before stated, it is very clear from the testimony of the inspired Word that the purpose of God does not contemplate any reestablishment in this age of his ancient theocratic government. To arrive at a different conclusion it is necessary to ignore some very prominent and important Scriptural truths.

1. Christ's kingdom is not of this world. This the Saviour plainly stated when he stood before Pilate, and the meaning of his words is not doubtful. "If my kingdom were of this world," he added, "then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews." John 18:36. His kingdom therefore does not pertain to the domain of civil authority; for the exercise of such authority is inseparable from force of arms. If Christ were a civil ruler over men, force would be everywhere exercised for the suppression of wrong, and there would be no such thing as persecution of Christians. But he permitted the Jews to seize him, rebuking Peter for drawing the sword in his defense, and suffered himself to be put to death upon the cross. And he has never instructed his followers to use force against those who would deprive them of life or property.

2. The "prince of this world" who "worketh in the children of disobedience," is Satan. John 14:30; Eph. 2:2. The devil is now permitted to work out his evil purposes among men, not because God has not the power to stop him, but because the exercise of preventive force does not pertain to his present method of dealing with sinners. He will manifest his power as sovereign ruler over all things the moment that mercy ceases to be held out to sinners through the provisions of the gospel.

3. Christ refused to be made a king by the people. John 6:15.

4. He refused to receive the kingdoms of this world as a gift from the devil. Matt. 4:8-10. The Saviour knew that the possession which Adam had lost by becoming the servant of Satan, must be purchased back by the blood of the cross. The kingship of this world can no more be put in the hands of Christ by the act of sinful man than by the gift of Satan.

5. This present world is not reserved to be the abode of righteousness and the visible kingdom of Christ, but is reserved unto fire, which shall consume it at the great day of destruction and perdition of ungodly men. 2 Pet. 3:7.

6. The "kingdom, and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven," is finally to be given to "the people of the saints of the Most High." Dan. 7:27. This necessitates the destruction of the wicked, by whom the world is now filled.

7. In this world the many go in the broad road that leads to destruction, and but few walk in the path that leads to life. Under such a condition of things no Christian civil government on earth could be possible.

8. When God sets up his kingdom on the earth, all earthly kingdoms will be swept away like chaff before it; they will be visited with eternal destruction. Dan. 2:34, 35, 44, 45.

9. The kingdoms of this world are not given into the hands of Christ until the time comes when God will judge the dead and bestow the rewards upon his servants. Rev. 11:15, 18. This takes place in connection with the second coming of Christ in the clouds of heaven. Matt. 16:27.

10. When Christ takes the kingdoms of this earth, it is only to "dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel." Ps. 2:8, 9. This is the only thing that can be done with unrighteous kingdoms.

11. The actual scene which this earth will present when Christ comes will be that of "the beast [Papacy], and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against Him [Christ] that sat on the horse, and against his army." Rev. 19:19. And the outcome is that the former are utterly destroyed before him. Verses 20, 21.

All these are truths of great scriptural prominence and of the utmost consequence, which the party who are trying to reform this present world by religious legislation entirely ignore. Yet they talk to us about the "plain teaching of the Scriptures," and the "clear testimony of the word," as being in harmony with their unchristian and impossible undertaking.

The only purpose of the gospel of Christ in our world to-day is to save individuals. For this purpose let the gospel be preached in all the world, as "the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth." Salvation can come only through faith, which is individual belief. As for the earth and the kingdoms and governments upon it, they are reserved unto the day of destruction and perdition of ungodly men, when they will utterly pass away, just as the word of God has said. s.
