# SUNDAY IN GERMANY—THE OLD STORY.

BY F. W. SPIES.

A close observer cannot fail to discover the similarity of procedure on the part of many religious leaders of the nineteenth century, as compared with the procedure of the so-called leaders in religious thought of the fourth and fifth centuries. We see in either case, an endeavor, to bolster up institutions, the reason for whose existence cannot be found in the Word of God. But, as these religious leaders profess to minister in the things of God, it is not at all strange that we should see them claiming divine origin for these institutions, if not by attempting to bring biblical proof of such origin, at least by attaching such names to them, as would lead the less well-informed persons to think they are really such.

But while the gospel is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth (Rom. 1:16), and hence all divinely-ordained institutions possess this power in themselves, it is just as evident that the power of God does not sanction and lend its aid to promulgate these man-made institutions. Of this important truth, these religious leaders are painfully conscious; but as they do not see the need of coming back to the Lord's way, and are determined to make the whole world recognize and bow to their way; and as they cannot, of course, have the cooperation of the Lord's power to help them in their way, they seek for the only power available, the power of the State, to supply this lack.

Glancing back to the beginning of the fourth century, we see the bishops working for laws to secure the better observance of Sunday. About the first law enacted along this line, dates as is supposed from A. D. 314, and it requires that on Friday and on Sunday "there should be a suspension of business at the courts and civil offices, so that the day might be devoted with less interruption to purposes of devotion." This was something gained, but not enough; and in A. D. 321 Constantine enacted his famous Sunday-law, which was broad enough to compel all "magistrates and people residing in the cities," as also "all workshops," to cease work on Sundays.

But as there were some who still observed the Bible Sabbath, this could not satisfy the bishops, and so accordingly we find in A. D. 363 the Council of Laodices enacting a canon to the effect that "Christians shall not Judaize, and be idle on Saturday, but work on that day, but the Lord's day [Sunday] they shall especially honor, and if possible, do so work on that day. If, however, they are found Judaizing, they shall be shut out from Christ." But this did not suffice, and in the year A. D. 386 the older laws were more rigidly enforced, and, "in general, civil transactions of every kind on Sunday were strictly forbidden."

But Sunday laws having from the beginning been enacted with the idea that the people might spend the day "with less interruption to the purposes of devotion," the promoters of such legislation must have been considerably disappointed to see that the "faithful" were not disposed to go to church on that day; but being free, they chose rather to visit the public shows and the circus. So next came the complaint that the circus "proved a great hindrance to the devotion of the Christians," and so the most natural step now was for the church-leaders to enact a canon, which they did at the council held at Carthage in A. D. 401, that "on Sundays and feast-days no plays may be performed;" the reason assigned being that "the people congregate more to the circus than to the church."

But as the "faithful" did not have love enough for that which they professed to believe was right to do it, another step logically followed those already taken, and this was the doctrine that "it is indeed better that men should be brought to serve God by instruction rather than by fear of punishment or pain. But because the former means are better, the latter must not therefore be neglected." And thus the Inquisition was the logical outgrowth of such a system of church government and doctrine. This is an illustration of how the church worked in the fourth and fifth centuries. But we ask, How is it to-day?

As early as 1850, the subject of a better observance of Sunday began to be agitated in Germany, and since then, different organizations have here been working to this end. In 1891 the first Sunday closing bill passed the Reichstag and became a law. This law closed nearly all the business places on Sunday, stopping also all agricultural pursuits on that day. The milk stores, bakeries, groceries and butcher shops were permitted to open on certain hours, and hotels and beer saloons could be open all day. In April, 1895, another measure went into effect, closing all workshops on Sunday and permitting no work whatever in them. So if enforced idleness on Sunday can make a "Christian nation," Germany ought certainly to be one. But although they have now come a good ways along the line of compulsory Sunday observance in Germany, what do they discover?

In a tract published in the beginning of the present year by the "Sonntageschutzverein," of Stuttgart, entitled, "Sunday Greeting for the New Year," the author laments that they are compelled to hear the bitter word, "the greatest profit of the recent Sunday legislation comes to the hotels and beer saloons." But this is not all they have observed. The better continues: "It is well known that the greatest damage to persons and property occur between Saturday and Monday. This fact is only the plainest evidence of the incalculable evil, which has its origin in the beer shops, and especially on Sunday."

It would almost seem, that after realizing such results, these men would cease working on this line, for such a confession as to the results of Sunday legislation is surely anything but a flattering promise of raising the moral standing of a nation. But what do we hear? Do these men who profess to know the Scriptures realize that the carnal mind is enmity to the law of God? Do they realize that to compel such men to be idle on Sundays, or any other days for that matter, is only to place them in the way of temptation and bring them into just such a condition? Will they view it thus and abandon their evil scheme? No! that will never do. Listen to what is now proposed: "It is a difficult matter to successfully combat this evil, but a truly discerning legislation and administration will find it necessary to work with all earnestness against the aberration of soul and body which results from this unbounded saloon life on Sunday."

Here we have it. It is the old story, of forgetting God's way, and trying to convert men by the power of the State. From the first Sunday law until the Inquisition was a number of centuries annently, but at the progress things are taking in this nineteenth century, how long will it be until we will see the same results? May the Lord help those who do these things to see whither they are drifting.
