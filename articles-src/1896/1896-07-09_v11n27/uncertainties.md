## Specific Uncertainties

### Page 1, Article "Is Sunday a Civil Institution?"
- **Location:** First paragraph, citation reference
- **Transcribed as:** "Heunington vs. the State of Georgia"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM
- **Reason:** The spelling "Heunington" appears unusual; may be "Hennington" but transcribed as printed

- **Location:** First quote from Georgia court
- **Transcribed as:** "...h respect to the selection"
- **Confidence:** LOW
- **Reason:** Text appears to begin mid-word, likely should be "With respect" but fragment "...h" is what appears in OCR output

### Page 2, Article "Is Sunday a Civil Institution?" (continued)
- **Location:** Footnote 3
- **Transcribed as:** "Limitations of Police Power," pp. 175-6, see 76
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM
- **Reason:** "see 76" may be a page reference or citation format, transcribed as appears

### Page 4, Article "Sunday in Germany—The Old Story"
- **Location:** Near end of article
- **Transcribed as:** "From the first Sunday law until the Inquisition was a number of centuries annently"
- **Confidence:** LOW
- **Reason:** "annently" appears to be an OCR error or archaic word, may be "apparently" but transcribed as printed

### Page 7, Advertisements
- **Location:** "Success" Nasal Syringe advertisement
- **Transcribed as:** "A search can be CURED"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM
- **Reason:** Likely should be "catarrh" but "search" is what appears; also "Don't postpail on except of Drs. Address, A. MALLATY" is garbled OCR

- **Location:** "Cyclone" advertisement
- **Transcribed as:** "THE 'CYCLONE' STILL WRIRLS"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM
- **Reason:** Likely "WHIRLS" but transcribed as printed

- **Location:** "Cyclone" advertisement body
- **Transcribed as:** "Tefts Cols, Fla., Jan. 29 1896"
- **Confidence:** LOW
- **Reason:** Location name unclear, possibly "Tafts" or another location

Note: Advertisements were noted but generally contain poor OCR quality and were not the focus of transcription accuracy.
