# PLANS TO UNITE CHRISTENDOM.

Two plans for the "reunion of Christendom" are now before the religious world for consideration.

One is the old familiar plan of Rome, elucidated by the popes and set forth again in the recent encyclical of Leo XIII., which amounts simply to an invitation to the Protestant and Greek churches to surrender to the church of Rome. The question of the validity of anglican orders has brought the papal plan of reunion into much prominence of late as a theme of discussion by leading minds in the opposing churches, but no definite action seems likely to result in the direction of the end sought. The pope is willing to receive all dissenting bodies graciously back into the fold of Rome as soon as they will come to him in humble submission. But they must come all the way to him; he will make no material advance toward them.

The other plan is not altogether new, having been foreshadowed at times in the proceedings of certain Protestant bodies; but not until the recent session of the General Assembly of the Southern Presbyterian Church at Memphis, Tenn., has it assumed a definite shape. At that gathering, during the consideration of the report of the Committee on Sabbath Observance, the following was proposed as a part of the report, and "heartily adopted:"

The permanent committee on the sabbath is authorized and directed to take such steps as may be necessary to arrange preliminaries for securing a united and simultaneous effort on the part of the different denominations of Christians in the United States to get up a mammoth petition to the civil authorities for the enactment and enforcement of laws to stop all unnecessary State and inter-State travel and traffic on the sabbath day.

Under the inspiration of this thought, the Christian Statesman turns its vision upon the near future and exclaims: "What a magnificent illustration would this be of the real unity of churches of Christ. In such practical work as this for the kingdom of our Lord will be reached the complete fulfillment of his prayer that all his people may be one."

The Presbyterian Assembly has struck the key-note of union for the clashing religious sects; not, indeed, such union as that for which Christ prayed in his memorable petition for unity among his followers, but a union which will admit of a united expenditure of effort for a common purpose, that purpose being the exaltation of Sunday. Whatever else the churches cannot agree on, there is general unity upon the idea that Sunday is the Christian sabbath, and ought to be observed as such by all individuals. The plan proposed at the Presbyterian Assembly aims to set the churches into a grand concert of action upon this basis. We look for definite results in the line of "Christian unity"—man-made—from this beginning. s.
