# PROGRESS IN ENGLAND.

[Special Cable Despatch to the Sun, June 23.]

The prelates of the Church of England are having a pretty bad time. The abandonment of the Government Education Bill, which was drafted directly in the interests of the church denominational schools, was a stinging blow; but this week witnessed the humiliation of the whole Bench of Bishops in the passing by the Lords of the Deceased Wife's Sister Bill. It is known that nearly the whole royal family is personally interested in the bill, and it is a fact that those members who as Peers of the Realm are entitled to sit in Parliament have frequently voted for it. The Prince of Wales once travelled several hundred miles in order to record his vote. This year he went further and actively canvassed the Peers for votes to the horror and indignation of the Bishops, who, although vigorous canvassers themselves, strongly object to a prince of the blood royal doing such things. Their indignation is by no means lessened by the knowledge that the date for the second reading was fixed this week so that his Royal Highness should not miss the Ascot races. The bill has not yet got out of the House of Lords, but Lord Dunraven, who has charge of it, is sanguine of getting it through, and hopes that the government will facilitate its passage in the Commons, where there is an assured majority in its favor.

It is difficult to see how this can be managed in view of the tangle into which the government has got business; but the Prince of Wales' influence with his friend Mr. Balfour ought to stand the bill in good stead.
