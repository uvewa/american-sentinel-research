# PERTINENT QUESTIONS FOR SUNDAY-LAW ADVOCATES.

[A writer who signs himself "Sunday-keeper," propounds in the St. Paul Pioneer Press, of May 29, the following very pertinent questions for those Sunday-keepers who are calling for civil enactments to make Sunday observance compulsory and universal.]

St. Paul, May 28.

To the Editor: At the recent Baptist Ministers' Conference, as published in the Pioneer Press, Rev. J. J. Crosby read a paper in which he took the position that a "Sunday law was necessary for the preservation of the sabbath." Now as this subject of Sunday laws, change of the Constitution, a closer relation between the Church and the Government, is prominently before the country, a few questions along this line, suggested by Rev. Mr. Crosby's paper, will not be out of place at this time.

If, as is stated in Holy Writ, God appointed the Sabbath and said it would be a sign between him and his people forever, did he mean that a condition of the perpetuity of this institution of divine appointment depended on the enactment of laws by legislatures and city councils?

The Sabbath being a religious institution, known only through revelation, and intended for those who believe in God and willingly worship and serve him, the same as baptism, prayer and the Lord's supper, would it not be just as reasonable to say that laws were necessary for the preservation of baptism, the Lord's supper, etc., as to say that human law was necessary for the preservation of the Sabbath?

Would it not be as reasonable to say that human law was necessary for the preservation of the law of gravitation, or the laws controlling the planets and stars, as to urge that God's divine laws and institutions exist subject to the pleasure of politicians and lawmakers of all shades of belief and of no belief?

It is said that about 100,000 people in the United States believe from the fourth commandment that the seventh day, or Saturday, is the true Sabbath. These people are growing steadily, and among them are some of the brightest minds in the Church. Now if the Sabbath is to be preserved by civil law, may not the time come when the courts will be called upon to decide from the wording of the fourth commandment which day is the Sabbath?

If Sunday-keepers have a right to appeal to civil law, and enact laws compelling Saturday-keepers and men of no religious belief to cease labor and close their places of business on Sunday, have not Saturday-keepers, when they are in the majority in any community, State or county, the same right to compel Sunday-keepers in like manner to observe Saturday?

In all the New Testament where is the least inference or intimation, or anything which could even be construed into an appeal by the Saviour or the apostles to the civil authorities for assistance or laws to enable them to carry on the work of the early Church, or to preserve any of the Christian institutions?

If religious institutions are to be preserved by human laws, and people are forced to obey Bible commands, such as relating to the Sabbath, then what mean the words, "Whosoever will," "Come unto me," "He that believeth," "I stand at the door and knock," "We persuade men," etc., etc.?

If Christians must appeal to the law to compel each other to preserve and obey the institutions of the Church, is it not a sad commentary on the massive granite structures and high-salaried shepherds?

When the Church allies itself to the State, and uses civil law to carry on its work, does not history show that spirituality departs from the Church, and religious bigotry, intolerance and persecution become manifest? Is this not now being illustrated in different Southern States, where pious men, and even ministers, have been sentenced to serve in chain-gangs with criminals because they quietly plowed or hoed in their gardens on Sunday, their persecutors always being so-called Christians?

If those who keep the Saturday Sabbath require and ask for no laws to preserve their Sabbath, and never complain of being disturbed in their worship on that day, the busiest and most noisy of the week, why is it that those who keep the Sunday sabbath require a law to preserve their sabbath and demand special laws to protect them from being disturbed in their worship on that day, other than the ordinary protection afforded all citizens by the police, sheriff, militia, and, if need be, by the army of the United States?

If, because a man is a Christian merchant and wishes to observe the Sabbath by closing his store on that day, must all other merchants who are not Christians, and don't believe in, and don't wish to observe the Sabbath, be compelled to close their stores in honor to the Christian merchant, so that his religion will not cost him anything in the loss of sales he would suffer if his store was closed and others were allowed to be open?

Is not the fact that laws are asked for by Christians, to make it easy, of little self-denial, loss, cost, and privation to be a Christian, a sure indication of the lack of that faith, zeal, honesty, self-sacrifice, unselfishness and loyalty among Christians of to-day that characterized the early Church and the martyrs of the Reformation?

Would the forced or involuntary observance of the sabbath by a man who did not believe in Christianity and the Bible be any more acceptable than the observance of baptism or the encharist by a man who had no faith in them?

If, as is urged, Sunday laws conduce to morality, would it not be just as reasonable to enact laws compelling people to become converted and attend religious services for the same purpose?

Could not our Christian Endeavor societies and W. C. T. Unions better enhance good citizenship, temperance and social purity by studying and teaching the relation between tea, coffee, tobacco, and other narcotics, and the saloon; the relation between the "german," "cotillion" and other dances as led by our fashionable church members, fine apparel, etc., and the brothel; the relation between progressive euchre in the churches and the gambling evil; and would it not be better if our high-salaried preachers would add to their faith courage enough to teach the young people some of the great truths of God and of life regarding their bodies, and regarding present social customs, and thus purify the fountain-head of government, thus doing the legitimate work of the Church, rather than to appeal to the civil law to do what they have not the courage to do for fear of offending the large society and social-amusement-loving element in their churches and thus lose their financial support?

Is not the weakness of our churches to-day principally the result of this semi-political, semi-social and worldly amusement-loving tendency?

Are not all civil laws compelling people to observe the sabbath or any other religious institution or ordinance un-American, unconstitutional and unchristian?

Is not all this religious-law agitation a step backward, and is not the wisdom and almost divinity of the Constitution of the United States apparent when it says: "Congress shall make no laws respecting the establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof?"
