# A PROTEST ON PRINCIPLE.

[The Present Truth, London, Eng., June 11.]

At a large meeting, held at the City Temple last week, for the purpose of voicing organized opposition to the Education Bill, Dr. Joseph Parker expressed some sound principles in most unmistakable terms. He said:

The Bill must be so got rid of that it will never come back again, and so must be fought with the central, vital, unchangeable principle that it is no business of the State to provide religious teaching for old or young. If they did not believe that fundamental doctrine, they were by so much Non-conformists. I can understand a man being a moderate drinker; I can understand a man being a total abstainer; but I defy him to be both. If I read my New Testament aright, I cannot believe that Jesus Christ would ever say, "Support my religion by taxation, and make my kingdom a branch of the civil service," and turn over his Cross to be a suppliant in the court of Cesar.

In the expression of these and similar sentiments the doctor did not shrink, as far as he went, from the logical principles to be deduced from these expressions. He seemed to carry with him the entire audience; yet when others followed who were ready to palter and compromise in fact, though dealing in brave words, and whose opposition was mainly selfish bluster, the applause was equally as great. It would seem that Dr. Parker has a great educational task on his hands to bring his confreres to a comprehension of the principles which he enunciates.
