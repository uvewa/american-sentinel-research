# RELIGIOUS PERSECUTIONS.

[Red Wing (Minn.) Argus, June 18, 1896.]

Let it still be kept in mind that "eternal vigilance is the price of liberty," and that in Tennessee, Mr. Lewis is still in distance vile, in Tiptonville jail, for doing quiet work on Sunday after resting on the seventh day of the week.

He writes that he is now kindly treated by the sheriff, but that when first arrested last November he was locked in an iron cage, in a room without fire and without sufficient clothing, and was nearly frozen to death, and may never recover from the effects. He makes no complaint. But all this will not make amends for the injustice and barbarity which may be laid at the door of the Sunday laws. While the Sunday laws are rigidly enforced, no person seems to be interested in the enforcement of the law for the proper care of prisoners, which is very explicit, providing for being comfortably housed and given good and sufficient food.

In Alabama a Mr. W. J. Hasty was condemned to the mines, recently, where he was to work out the fine and costs, amounting to $51.70, at 30 cents per day. This became his son, under age, plowed on Sunday, and testified that he did this work voluntarily. Mr. Hasty was found guilty by the jury, contrary to all evidence, contrary to the charge of the judge, and contrary to public sentiment. Yet they tell us that Sunday laws are just!

One of the ministers in Ontario, who was prosecuted for quiet work on Sunday, is now confined in Chatham jail, and fed on bread and water. In addition to this prisoners are allowed a dish of skilly—old-fashioned oatmeal gruel. But Mr. Simpson can't bear even the smell of this dish. Yet he complains not, but is thankful for bread and water, and rejoices that he is accounted worthy to suffer for truth and right.

But where are we in this world's history? Are we just entering the Dark Ages? Is this in "free" America?
