# MISREPRESENTING THE GOSPEL.

The colored supplement of the Sunday World, of June 28, devotes a page to illustrations, picturing "the busy life of a great preacher," under the "reform" regime of the present day. The illustrations present the well-known face and figure of a prominent New York City clergyman, and cover the principal events of one day's work. He appears at 9:30 o'clock, A. M., seated at his desk, "giving out his views to the press." At 10:30 he is shown inspecting the street-cleaners. At 11:30 he appears as prosecutor of a female delinquent in a police court. At 12:30 he interviews a prominent politician of the city. At 1:30 he takes tea and discusses matters of city government with the mayor in the latter's office. At 2:30 he is in the criminal court to witness the proceedings in a prominent murder trial. At 4:30 he inspects a police parade, and at 8:30 appears in the final scene of the day as umpire at a prize fight.

There would be nothing about this worth mentioning were it not for the amount of truth which the illustrations represent. For the most part, they have been suggested by actual occurrences in the experience of the prominent clergyman before mentioned. And the worst of it is that the general public know that such illustrations do not fall far short of the truth. They get the idea that such exercises constitute a legitimate part of the work of a minister of the gospel; and thus the divine calling is lowered to a level where it is shorn of its beauty and power, and forfeits not only the reverence but even the respect of very many whom it should reach and save. s.
