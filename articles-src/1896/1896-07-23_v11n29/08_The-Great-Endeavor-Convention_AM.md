**THE GREAT "ENDEAVOR" CONVENTION.**

**BY ALLEN MOON.**

There is no denying the fact that a great deal of enthusiasm is displayed at these conventions, which, with the majority of people, would pass for true Christian zeal. Nor can the fact be concealed that the Endeavor Society consists of the very best element of the church of to-day.

It is evident that many are seeking a higher spiritual life and character, and that this great movement is the result of the arousing of the nobler impulses of the soul by the touch of the Spirit of God.

The Author of our divine religion and the Founder of the Church on earth, does not forsake his people, although the Church through the errors brought into it from the heathen world, has lost its power in large measure, and is living on traditions rather than the living word of God.

The Young People's Society of Christian Endeavor movement in its inception was an effort of the soul to break the chains of creed and ritual in which it had been bound, and soar into the free atmosphere of God's word and love. But alas, the work was not thorough, and those whose business has ever been to make merchandise of the church, seeing in the Endeavor movement an element of power, were filled with a desire to possess it.

During the progress of the convention just closed, as well as those that have preceded it, the leaders of the Church-and-State party of this country have seized the reins and attempted to drive the entire procession into their own line. But their success has not yet been complete, and no doubt they would have had less of success if the earnest people of the society had fully known the logical result of the carrying out of the plans presented to them.

Early in the program for the last convention, provision was made for holding what were called Good Citizenship Meetings, and the time fixed was Thursday evening, July 9. Meetings were held at a number of places in addition to the three tents, and were addressed by the following speakers: Miss Anna Ackerman, of Chicago—Subject, "The Christian Citizen's Responsibility;" Rev. Franklin Hamilton, Newtonville, Mass.—Subject, "The New Patriotism;" Rev. D. F. McGill—Subject, "A Christian Citizenship Platform;" S. E. Nicholson, Kokomo, Ind.—Subject, "Christian Citizenship in Politics;" Rev. H. H. Russell, Columbus, Ohio—Subject, "Christian Politics and the Saloon;" and many others, including Rev. C. H. Mead, of New York; Rev. R. S. McArthur, of New York; and P. S. Henson, of Chicago. The effort of each of the orators was to impress the young people with the idea that the numbers of the Endeavor Society ought to make politics the leading branch of their religious work.

One speaker counselled that they leave the prayer-meeting in the hands of the women and children and go to the Primaries, the Convention and the Polls, turn the bad politician out, and put the good citizen in his place. Rev. Howard Russell regaled his hearers with a recital of how the power of the "Good Citizen's League," a factor of the Christian Endeavor, had been exerted in the State of Ohio to dethrone certain officials distasteful to them, and fill the places with those in every way satisfactory. He urged the members of the society everywhere to go and do likewise. The evident purpose of these religio-political leaders is to wheel the vast body of would-be followers of the meek and lowly Jesus into line to work for the political elevation of some lovers of worldly honor.

Another feature of the convention was the effort to secure the cooperation of the entire body in support of Sunday legislation. The Sabbath Observance Committee held meetings in various parts of the city at the headquarters of the different State and National delegations in the interest of their scheme.

On Sunday, July 12, a general meeting was held at Central Hall in the interest of Sunday observance. The meeting was addressed by Rev. J. E. Gilbert, of Washington, D. C., Mrs. Henry T. McEwin, of New York, Rev. J. B. Davidson, of Milwaukee, Wis., Rev. Alexander Alison, of New York City, and Wilbur F. Crafts, of Washington.

It may be said to the credit of the Endeavors that comparatively few of the thirty thousand in the city gave their endorsement to the Sunday-law movement by their presence. The small attendance of the delegates seemed to dampen the ardor of the projectors, and they contented themselves with making some strong addresses.

The resolutions and petitions that were expected were omitted. One of the speakers declared that the Jew should be compelled to observe the Christian sabbath, according to his own law, for he is now the stranger within our gates. "The law for the individual must be the law for every man."

Dr. Crafts urged the organization of the Endeavors for local work in enforcing Sunday observance, and to secure the closing of post-offices on Sunday, by petition to the postmaster-general, by boycott, or any other means that could be made effectual. The tone of the oration from the public desk was a clear indication of an overwhelming desire to transform this great Christian Endeavor Society into a political party.

Oh, that this mighty host might devote all its God-given energy to the proclamation of the gospel of the Son of God, and to saving men and women from the world and sin to become the followers of Him who said, "My kingdom is not of this world."
