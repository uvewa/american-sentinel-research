**A VOICE FROM TENNESSEE.**

*[Nashville (Tenn.) Banner, July 13.]*

"RELIGIOUS LIBERTY" was the subject of Dr. J. B. Hawthorne's sermon at the First Baptist Church yesterday morning. He took as his text the passage from Matthew which concludes, "Render unto Cesar the things that are Cesar's, and unto God the things that are God's."

The preacher said it was never Christ's purpose to have any conflict with civil government. His kingdom was not of this world. Jesus did not claim exemption from taxation either for himself or his followers. He never undertook to force people to adopt Christianity, and when Constantine established Christianity as the religion of Rome by imperial edict he was more an enemy to the kingdom of Christ than was Nero, who burned the bodies of Christian believers.

The people of this country believe that it is the duty of the State to protect every human within its bounds in the exercise of his religious faith. If they were consistent in their principles the nation would be free from the discords and religious contentions which now disturb its peace. Believing in the absolute non-interference of the State in all matters pertaining to religious faith and practice, there are millions of Americans who yet seek the help of the State to propagate their religious doctrines.

With this form of introduction Dr. Hawthorne stated the following propositions:—

1. There is a great organization in this country composed of men professing to be Christians and lovers of religious freedom, whose purpose is to secure an amendment to the Federal Constitution recognizing the divinity and Massiahship of Jesus Christ. While I would not charge the members of this organization with intentional disloyalty to Christianity and to our system of government, I will say that their movement is radically incompatible with the spirit of Christ and with the system of government which the fathers of our Republic sought to establish.

2. That secret, oath-bound political organization known as the American Protective Association, in proposing to establish a religious qualification for citizenship and office, is at war with the true doctrine of religious liberty. I do not regard these disguised and dark-lanterned crusaders as willful enemies of the religion of Christ, and willful conspirators against individual freedom; but as the friends of Christ and the unflinching advocates of the rights of conscience, they want the American people to declare all Roman Catholics ineligible to citizenship and office.

3. The appointment of chaplains to Congress, to the Army and Navy, and to State legislatures, is a violation of the rights of conscience, and indicates very clearly that even in this "land of the free and home of the brave," religion is not divorced from the State.

4. Conscience is violated, and the principles of religious liberty ignored, when our Federal Government makes appropriations for denominational schools.

5. The exemption of houses of religious worship, parsonages and the property of denominational schools from taxation, is incompatible with true religious liberty.
