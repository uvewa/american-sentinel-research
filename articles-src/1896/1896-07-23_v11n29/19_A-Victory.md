## A VICTORY!

The International Religious Liberty Association won a notable victory for the cause of religious liberty at the Christian Endeavor convention held at Washington, D. C., last week. Previous to the assembling of the convention, an officer of the National Reform Association publicly announced that his association would control the convention in the interest of "National Reform." The International Religious Liberty Association, perceiving that this convention of 60,000 delegates and visitors would furnish an excellent opportunity to disseminate the truth regarding the present "good citizenship" movement, and the crusade for national Sunday legislation, laid plans to circulate religious liberty literature among the assembled thousands. Accordingly, a four-page leaflet, especially adapted to the occasion, entitled, "How Shall We Reform Society," was prepared. The tract, "Congress and Sunday Laws," was revised, and nearly 240,000 pages of these tracts were circulated at the convention. The leaders of the convention early realized the influence of this literature, and dared not introduce their resolutions, fearing the result of a discussion. And besides all this the meeting, engineered by Dr. Crafts, which was to have been the climax of the convention and a great demonstration for a national Sunday law, was attended by only 1,500 delegates.

Allen Moon, President of the International Religious Liberty Association, had charge of the distribution of the literature, and all the members of this Association and the friends of liberty of conscience should rejoice at this victory. Reader, are you a member of this Association? Are you aiding it to accomplish these victories? If not, why not?
