**WHERE "REFORM" SHOULD BEGIN.**

In a denunciation of the Sunday newspaper, by Hon. John Charlton, member of the Canadian Parliament (published in the *Christian Work*, of June 18, 1896), the following reference is made to the responsibility of church members for the Sunday paper's inroads upon the religious interests of the day:—

It is a question of deep importance as to the extent of the complicity of professing Christians in this great and growing evil. How large a proportion of church members in the United States in good and regular standing, habitually buy and read Sunday newspapers? How large a proportion of them put aside the Bible and all religious reading matter in order to wade through interminable columns of gossip, slander, descriptions of crimes, sporting news, police court news, and the prurient and filthy incidents that are served up to meet the demands of prurient and filthy tastes on the Lord's day? How large a proportion of the professing Christians in the United States gradually fall from the standard that the Bible prescribes down to the moral standard of the Sunday newspaper, and while they have a name to live in the churches, are morally and spiritually dead.

No church member who is a reader of a Sunday newspaper is free from the great crime of being a supporter and abettor of the most pernicious and unchristian influence that exists in the United States, and sad as the case may seem, it is unquestionably a truth that the Sunday newspaper depends for its existence upon the support of professing Christians. If every church member in the United States would refuse to buy or read Sunday newspapers; if every Christian man in the United States would refuse to advertise in the Sunday newspapers, the Sunday newspaper evil would speedily die an inglorious death.

Then is it not perfectly evident that the reform movement which seeks to eliminate "the Sunday newspaper evil" should begin with the members of the church? The Hon. Mr. Charlton is not the only Sunday advocate who has broached this (to the churches) disagreeable topic. We have been told that but for the Sunday patronage of street railways by church members, this form of Sunday desecration would soon cease; and the patronage by the same class of Sunday-deseczering enterprises at camp-meetings and other religious gatherings, is a fact which is not infrequently brought to public notice. Why then do not the churches begin at home the work for reform in Sunday observance?

What kind of Christian reform work can it be which instead of seeking to work a change of heart, passes by the heart and endeavors to eliminate wrong-doing by legislating temptation out of the world? That is not the means by which Christ sought to make men righteous. If our "reformers" of to-day would preach reform to the Church as much as they do to the State, if they would first seek to heal their own households before administering their medicines to those outside, their course would be much more reasonable and commendable than it is.
