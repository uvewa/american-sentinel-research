TO perceive a clear dividing line between the spheres of Christianity and of civil government, it is only necessary to remember that the official of civil government necessarily acts in a representative capacity, while in the sphere of Christian activity he can have no representative capacity whatever. Keeping this distinction in mind, it will be clear that force, that is, coercion, can have no proper place in Christian work. Any religion which involves action by any human being as the representative of his fellows, is a false religion, and naturally has dictation and coercion as outgrowing features of it. The one true and proper representative of humanity in religion is the "one Mediator between God and man, the man Christ Jesus." And it is to the Christian a glorious thought that the Almighty Father sees him, not in his human weakness and unworthiness, but in the person of that risen and glorified Man—the Son whom he sent to earth—who stands before him as our Advocate.
