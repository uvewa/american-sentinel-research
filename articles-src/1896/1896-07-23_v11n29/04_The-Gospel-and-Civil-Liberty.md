## THE GOSPEL AND CIVIL LIBERTY.

The gospel is not against civil liberty. On the contrary it promotes civil liberty, and reveals by its light what perfect civil liberty is.

Civil liberty has been often denied in the name of Christianity. But this is not an indictment of Christianity any more than is a counterfeit dollar an indictment of the money system which it is made is represent. For the real teachings of Christianity on this as on every other point we turn to the words of Christ. We find that he said to his disciples: "Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them, and they that are great exercise authority upon them. But it shall not be so among you: but whosoever will be great among you, let him be your minister; and whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant." Matt. 20:25-27.

This is the spirit of Christianity; and though the Saviour was not here speaking with reference to the conduct of civil government, his words are a condemnation of that dominion of man over his fellows which is so naturally sought by those who have been raised to positions of eminence. The Christian will not seek, under any circumstances, to make any of his fellows his subjects. He will seek to be the servant of his fellowmen, but not their master.

And this will be the spirit of that government under which the citizen enjoys perfect civil liberty. It would be the spirit of this Government if it were in fact what it is in theory; for it is the theory that in this Republic, public office is a public trust, and that those in office, from the President down, are the servants of the people and not their rulers. We find, as a matter of fact, that the arbitrary exercise of power by those in governmental positions, is almost as common here as elsewhere; but in principle this Government proceeds upon the Golden Rule,—"Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them." Matt. 12:7. In no other way could it be, what it is in theory, a "government of the people, by the people, and for the people."

God himself, in his government of all his creatures, does not exercise arbitrary dominion. Whatsoever his creatures have, they possess by their own free choice. The very principles upon which his government is established are principles of their own choosing. The very decrees of heaven are their own decrees. God might decide the destiny of every case by his own omniscience, and pronounce judgment upon every transgressor who rejects his mercy; but he will not do so, but on the contrary has committed the judgment of wicked men and even of angels, to his saints. The books of record will be examined,—not by the Lord, for he knows all that they contain—but by saints and angels, in order that the sentence pronounced in every case may be their sentence.

God will not proceed to the final settlement with sin without the concurrence of every righteous being in every step that is taken. Thus the very government of heaven itself is, in a sense, a government of the people, by the people, and for the people.

Would that this generous spirit might animate every move in the conduct of civil affairs? Then every one in office would remember that he is a servant and not a ruler of the people, and would strive to do to others that which he would wish done to himself. We should then have a government for better than anything which assumes shape in the dreams of "national reform."
