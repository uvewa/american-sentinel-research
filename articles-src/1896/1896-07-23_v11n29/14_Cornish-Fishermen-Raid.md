IN England, on a recent Monday, some Cornish fishermen made a raid on the fishing boats of some Suffolk men, and threw all their fish into the sea, because they had been caught on the previous day; and this was but the inauguration of a course of molestation and intimidation on the part of the Cornish men, which shortly necessitated the sending of troops, with two gunboats, to protect the Suffolk men, the power of the police having proved inadequate. The incident illustrates the disturbing and lawless nature of zeal for compulsory Sunday observance. The Sunday statutes of England do not forbid fishermen from pursuing their avocation on the first day of the week.
