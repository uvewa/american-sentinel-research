## LEO'S REPLY TO GLADSTONE.

The Roman pound, 4.0. XIII., is again before Christendom with an encyclical on Christian unity, which it is understood, is intended as a reply to the appeal, from Mr. Gladstone on that subject.

In this encyclical the pontiff flatly denies not only the validity of Anglican orders, but every ground upon which a recognition of the same might be sought from him, by declaring that Mr. Gladstone and the party for whom he speaks, and all others outside the papal fold, are schismatics having no connection with Christ; and that there can be no Christian unity without assent to "an authoritative magisterium," which, he says, was lodged in Peter and transmitted through him to his successors, the popes. There must be, he declares, a recognition of papal primacy,—of the pope's authority as superior to every other man or to any council of men.

In the "light" of this encyclical the papal system stands clearly forth as a religious despotism. Its "Christian unity" is the unity of submission to man. It is a unity which excludes reason and liberty. It is the unity of mental and spiritual slavery.

Christianity, on the other hand, means perfect liberty. It stands for individualism; it means that the individual shall be complete in Christ,—that through the Spirit of Christ which is to dwell in him and animate him, he will enjoy that perfect freedom which means the liberty to fulfill every desire, with the approving judgment of a perfect mind. It means independence for each one, yet perfect harmony for all, because all are animated by that one Spirit which proceeds from the Father and the Son.

Who that loves the freedom which God has given to him, as to every man, would wish for "unity" by incorporation with a religious despotism? Who that values those mental powers with which the Creator has endowed him, can be willing to surrender to a man the right to use them,—in other words, the right to think for himself, when the Almighty himself demands no such surrender? The fact that the Creator has endowed man with reasoning faculties, is *prima facie* evidence that it is not in his purpose to forbid the exercise of the same in all that which concerns man's highest interests. He himself says to man, "Come now, and let us reason together." Isa. 1:18. He came down and reasoned with Job. The Christian faith is not unreasonable.

He who surrenders his right to think, surrenders his very soul; for without the liberty to think and believe God's word for himself, no individual can have faith, and without faith he cannot be saved. The papacy invites all men to be joined to a human god, in the bondage of a spiritual slavery which involves the surrender of the soul. Christianity, on the other hand, invites every man to think, to believe, and to come into that Christian unity which is the unity of love for God, and for our fellowmen.
