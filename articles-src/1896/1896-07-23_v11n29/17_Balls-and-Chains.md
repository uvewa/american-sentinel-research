## BALLS AND CHAINS.

The following telegram was received just before going to press:—

"Tiptonville, Tenn., July 19, 1896.

"AMERICAN SENTINEL: Conviction in three cases. Penalty $1 and costs, which are heavy. Numerous unnecessary witnesses. All jailed. County provided balls and chains."

"C. P. Bollman."

This announces the result of the trials of four Seventh-day Adventists for the crime(?) of doing honest labor on the first day of the week, which injured no one in person or property, and which disturbed no one's public or private devotions on that day. Others before have been condemned to the chain-gang, but while they have been compelled to march and work with those who were chained, they have not been compelled to wear chains themselves; but it would appear from the above that these honest, harmless, industrious Christian men are to actually carry balls and chains for the offense of keeping the commandments of God, one of which commands men to rest on the seventh day, or Saturday, and gives them the privilege to work the other six. What next?
