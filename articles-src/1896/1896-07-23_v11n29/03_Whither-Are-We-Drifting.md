## "WHITHER ARE WE DRIFTING?"

This question is propounded and considered in a very serious tone by the N. Y. Mail and Express, of July 5. It contemplates the situation as revealed by the action of the Democratic National convention at Chicago, and declares that the strength of the forces which that action represents has been underestimated. It concludes that the nation is drifting towards anarchy, and will speedily reach it unless the people unite upon certain lines of action which it defines.

Making due allowance for the influence of political partisanship upon newspaper utterances, it is evident that a feeling of real concern for the safety of the nation is beginning to take possession of thoughtful men who have the interests of the country at heart. Statesmen look out upon the prospect with feelings of fear and perplexity. There is a war of words about the relative merits of gold and silver as currency; but the real contest is not between metals, but between men. Nor is it so much a contest between political parties, as a contest between those parties, or classes, who from time immemorial have stood facing each other in hostile attitude,—namely, the laboring men and the men of wealth.

This is what gives the situation its serious aspect. Under the impetus of a great political demonstration, the forces have been swung into line for a renewal of the old struggle between wealth and want,—a struggle which it is well known will not be confined in its conduct to political methods. The workingmen feel that they have just grievances which must be settled by a readjustment of the relations between capital and labor. And whether they are right or wrong, wise or foolish, in their choice of methods for a solution of the difficulty, without doubt the party of wealth are largely responsible for the danger which now threatens the nation's prosperity and peace. The workingmen have been oppressed, and if their proposed methods for relief and redress seem to savor of madness, it is only an indication of the climax which is being reached in the controversy.

Truthfully has the prophet spoken in the words, "Go to now, ye rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon you. Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are moth-eaten. Your gold and silver is cankered; and the rust of them shall be a witness against you, and shall eat your flesh as it were fire. Ye have heaped treasure together for the last days." James 5:1-3. The source from which these words come is a source of truth to which the statesmen of this day would do well to turn for light.
