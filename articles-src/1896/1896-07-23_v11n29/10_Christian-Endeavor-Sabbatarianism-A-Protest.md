### CHRISTIAN ENDEAVOR SABBATARIANISM;* A PROTEST.

[The Washington (D. C.) Post, July 12.]

Many persons interested in the anti-Sunday law movement came together yesterday afternoon at McCanley's Hall, 209 Pennsylvania Avenue, Southeast, to hear addresses by men prominent among them. F. B. Woodbury presided and made the opening address, after the audience had sung "My Country, 'Tis of Thee.'" Mr. Woodbury said:

"We have gathered here once more to protest against the endeavor of a minority to control the majority, to take from them their constitutional rights, and enforce Sabbatarianism." Mr. Woodbury referred to the Christian Endeavor convention, and said that one half or more of the young Christian soldiers were not Sunday extremists or "God-in-the-Constitution" people. "We ought to rejoice," he said, "in the extremists being squelched, even in the great Methodist conventions and the Christian Endeavor meetings. More and more men realize that few saints are made by and through law. The Christian Endeavor movement has come to the place where it must choose one of two roads—that of endeavoring to compel men by law to do the things they choose to believe right, or of preaching and praying under the same banner. 'We mind our own business.' If extremists are not allowed to dictate the policy of the society, it has a grand future. We now implore the managers of the Christian Endeavor Societies to turn a deaf ear to the National Reform Association and all the societies of Protestant Jesuits. The majority of people will not criticize the Christian Endeavor movement if the society keep its hands off the liberties of the masses."

Rev. Allen Moon, of the International Religious Liberty Association, and a Seventh-day Adventist, next addressed the assemblage. "As Christians," he said, "my association believes in religious liberty for all." He said he had been in Toronto, "the Utopia of the National Reform Association," where the principles of the movement it advocated were applied in all their rigidity. Not only were the places of amusement and public conveyances empty because they were not allowed to operate, but the churches were comparatively so, and, in the homes of the people there was general discontent because of the stringent laws. The Sunday-law movement was anti-christian. Human hypocrites, not Christians, were made by such movements. Mr. Moon said the Catholic Church and the National Reform League, which both declared themselves in favor of religious liberty, really proposed to do as they pleased and usurp all the power they could.

Gen. William Birney made a brief address to the effect that if the Christian Endeavors proposed to indorse the movement to put God in the Constitution they must define what God is, and there were many conflicting views on that subject among the denominations of which the Christian Endeavors were members. If they wished to aid the National Reform Association in making the Bible the law of the land, they would do well to bear in mind that it would take all the judicial wisdom in the land to determine what was the law laid down in the Bible, inasmuch as there were all sorts to choose from. General Birney reviewed the histories of certain countries which had endeavored to enforce religious laws, only to result in making the people superstitious, hypocritical, and unchristian.

Mr. Maurice Pechin and Mr. D. W. Groh also spoke.

Resolutions were adopted by the meeting protesting against Sabbatarianism, and declaring that "democracy—government of the people, by the people, and for the people—diametrically conflicts with theocracy—government of, by and for self-appointed, spurious agents of God; and that theocratic tampering with our laws and Constitution, with intent to overthrow our Republic and supplant it by a theocracy, is a highly treasonable conspiracy, and should be dealt with accordingly."

*By "Sabbatarianism" is here meant, not regard for the Sabbath institution, but the doctrine of Sabbath enforcement by human law.
