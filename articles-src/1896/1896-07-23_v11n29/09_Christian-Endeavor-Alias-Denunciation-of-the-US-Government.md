### "CHRISTIAN ENDEAVOR." ALIAS DENUNCIATION OF THE U. S. GOVERNMENT.

No stranger scene, perhaps, was presented at the Christian Endeavor convention at Washington, than that in tent "Washington," on the closing day of the session, when Evangelist B. Fay Mills addressed a vast audience on the subject of American responsibility for the atrocities in Armenia. The Endeavors had been prepared for the occasion by the work of the Armenian Relief Committee, which had worked busily from the first to stir up the enthusiasm of the delegates. Three Armenian missionaries were present, also, two of them being ladies just returned from the scene of the barbarities. As one of these ladies was presented to the audience, her companion missionary wrapped her in the folds of the American flag, which incident drew repeated cheers from the assembly. Then followed the impassioned address of B. Fay Mills. We quote from the N. Y. Sun, of July 14:

"Had our noble President on one of his fishing excursions," he said, "wandered into the Turkish domain, and had so much as a tiny little bullet from a Turk's play pistol passed through his sail, Americans would have found that it was some of our business to interfere in Turkish affairs. [Great applause and laughter.] I charge the Government of the United States with misrepresentation of the enlightened sentiment of the American people in this matter. The President of the United States, the Secretary of State, and the American Minister, have disregarded our broken treaties; they have permitted American lives to be endangered; they have permitted American property to be destroyed without reparation, and American citizens to be imprisoned.

"Our Government has stirred the passions of the American people to anger against England on the one-thousandth part of the pretext that would have sufficed for a destructive war with Turkey. The administration officers have turned a deaf and almost scornful ear to the entreaties and representations of some of our best citizens, missionaries, churches, and moral societies, and I denounce their conduct as unpatriotic, uncivil, undemocratic, unrepublican, un-American, unchristian, selfish, weak, wicked, barbaric, and criminal in the eyes of the American people and of God and all men."

Of the reception given these utterances by the vast audience of Endeavors, it is said:

Every word, almost, of these last sentences of Mr. Mills was greeted by a loud cheer. Men and women on the platform behind him and in the benches before him rose and shouted their hearty approval of the denunciation of President Cleveland. In the midst of the solemn charge of cowardice and disloyalty levelled at the Chief Executive, the Secretary of State, and the Turkish Minister, the whole audience arose spontaneously, waving flags and banners and crying aloud their approval. As Mr. Mills proceeded they kept on their foot repeating the cheer of indorsement at every adjective. Finally, when his voice and manner indicated that he had reached the end of his period, six rousing cheers of approval were given. Dr. Wayland Hoyt, who presided, arose in his seat beside the speaker and called upon the audience to reaffirm the charge. Again came the six cheers, with hearty enthusiasm.

And this is Christian endeavor!

To denounce a government and hurl at its chief executive and his associates in office all manner of opproprious epithets for failing to make armed intervention in the affairs of another nation to protect American property and the lives of the missionaries, is truly an eminently Christian(?) proceeding!

We read that Jesus Christ rebuked the Scribes and Pharisees for their hypocrisy, but we find no instance where he denounced any government or State official for not being sufficiently belligerent. We find no precept coming from his lips which sanctions any such thing. The Saviour could read the hearts of his bearers, and he could denounce the sin which was there without ever in the least exceeding the bounds of truth and justice; but short-sighted, sinful man is ever ready to denounce his fellowmen without any exact knowledge of either the facts or motives concerned, and without any reference to the effect of his denunciations as regards the cause of divine truth. "The wrath of man," we read, "worketh not the righteousness of God." James 1:20.

Indeed, there is nothing more clear from the testimony of Scripture, than that any denunciation of man by his fellowman is an unchristian act. The Christian is to denounce sin, but not the sinner. And in his denunciation of sin, he must be guided strictly by the word of God which points out sin; he must not assume to define sin from his own conceptions of right. His attitude, as a Christian, toward his fellows, without respect of persons, must be that of seeking to induce them to become reconciled to God.

As Jesus Christ came not to save governments, so neither did he denounce them, nor authorize his followers to do so. The denunciatory address of Evangelist Mills at the Washington convention was no part of Christian work. And the demonstration which greeted his words in the name of Christian endeavor, betokens a misguided zeal which augurs ill for the success of Endeavor work, from a Christian standpoint.
