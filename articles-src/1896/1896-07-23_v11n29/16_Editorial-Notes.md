Any one receiving the AMERICAN SENTINEL without having ordered it may know that it is sent to him by some friend. Therefore, those who have not ordered the SENTINEL need have no fears that they will be asked to pay for it.

No combination of civil force with religion,—let this be the motto of every liberty-loving American.

There is no theme more important, and scarcely any more prominent, before the American public than that of "Christian citizenship." The SENTINEL will thoroughly discuss this subject in coming numbers.

It seems to be thought nowadays, even by religious people, that there is not power enough in the simple word of God to accomplish any great reform. But the truth is that there is no power outside of that word to accomplish any genuine reform from evil to righteousness.

In the time of the Cæsars, Jesus said, "If my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight." John 18:36. In this day of republics, he would say, If my kingdoms were of this world, then would my servants vote,—for the same object, of course; namely, his enthronement as this world's king.

Christian reform always attacks evil in the individual heart,—at its very citadel. But there is a spurious sort of "Christian reform" which does its work outside the heart, by legislation and other human means which cannot affect the heart. The avenue of true Christian reform is faith; its weapon is the word of the living God.

The Christian Endeavor Society announces that it will engage in politics, but will avoid any "entangling political alliances." We can assure the society that when it steps into the jungle of American politics, it will soon find itself in a very "entangling" situation. This country is in no more need of a new political sect than of a new religious sect; and especially has it no use whatever for a politico-religious party.

The N. Y. Christian Advocate, of July 16, speaking of the increasing tendency to worldly practices among the masses on the "sabbath" day, well says:—

How may these tendencies be arrested? Physical force will not avail. Arguments drawn from mere expediency or physical health or present advantage are insufficient. The arm of civil law will utterly fail. Truth lodged in the soul—truth moving the conscience—will be effectual, and only this. Christians who have fallen into wrong habits can be recovered only by divinely-wrought convictions in respect to sabbath observance. To produce such convictions is the important work of the home, the school, and the church.

And yet "the church" of to-day is diligently seeking, as if it were her most important work, for the help of that very "arm of civil law" which "will utterly fail," in promoting "sabbath" observance among the people. Does the church expect to secure "divinely-wrought convictions" on this point by the means of civil enactments?

If the noble, God-fearing and Christ-loving army of young men and young women who represent "Christian endeavor" in this land, shall be fully led aside from the path of Christian usefulness upon which they have so enthusiastically entered, into the antichristian course of favoring and working for religious legislation, by the designing spirits which are seeking with might and main to influence them to this course, it will be the colossal sin of the century.
