The Roman pontiff has aroused the resentment of English Protestants, by an attempt to defeat the deceased wife's sister bill, which is now in the hands of Parliament. The English canonical law which forbids a man to marry his deceased wife's sister, is an anomaly which finds support only among the party which cling blindly to the church traditions, and as such it not unfittingly finds an ally in the pope.

The latter's position in the controversy was disclosed by Lord Dunraven's production of a "whip" sent to the Catholic peers, in which Cardinal Vaughan declared that he had the authority of the pope to call upon all Catholics to oppose the bill. Referring to this, the Daily News said: "The impudent attempt of an Italian priest to interfere in the decisions of the British Parliament has no parallel since Pope Pius IX. procured the defeat of Mr. Gladstone's Irish University bill, in 1873."

The pope seems to find less opposition in this country when he dictates the course of American Catholics in political affairs.
