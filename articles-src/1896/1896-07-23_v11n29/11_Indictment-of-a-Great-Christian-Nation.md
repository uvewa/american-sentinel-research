**INDICTMENT OF A GREAT "CHRISTIAN NATION."**

*[The Christian Work, July 9.]*

UNDER the title "Our Responsibilities for Turkey: Facts and Memories of Forty years," the Duke of Argyle breaks a long silence and makes a confession to the world unequaled in the annals of public life. Yet the Duke's publication, astonishing as it is, is a real service to humanity, although a more biting indictment against England's foreign policy is not to be met with anywhere. What the Duke makes clear is that England's shield has been thrown over the Turk's butcheries from the meanest and most sordid motive that can animate the human breast, a desire for the money profit of the Turk's trade. This motive is frankly confessed by the Duke now writing, as he says, "as an historian, as a witness and to some extent as a penitent." It is but justice to the Duke of Argyle to say that of late years he has done what he could to atone for the iniquity of the Crimean War. He has done this by condemning both the Syrian massacres in 1860 and the Cretan massacres in 1867, when the late Lord Derby refused to let the captains of her Majesty's navy take women and children on board to save them from the pursuing Turks, and some captains to their honor defied their instructions, and in having joined Mr. Gladstone's earnest but resultless championship of humanity on that occasion; and he exposes the pusillanimity and hypocrisy of two successive British administrations. Furthermore, Rosebery's suppression of the Consular reports, his sanction of the Turkish Commission even after the Sultan's declaration that its object was to inquire "into the crimes of Armenian brigands," the transparent pretenses of his schemes of reform and his failure in not having started by coming to an understanding with Russia after Prince Lobanoff had invited coöperation, are all laid bare in their nakedness. But it is when we come to England's recent course of passivity towards the suffering Armenians that the Duke brings up the course of the British Government to scorn and reprobation. Speaking as if England's own hand had drawn the scimitar across a hundred thousand human throats, the Duke declares that England "must at least give up at once and forever, a close personal alliance with perhaps the best existing representative of the Kingdom of Evil upon earth. We must seek every means of hastening its fall, always with due regard to the avoiding of bloody catastrophes, but not always recoiling, as a matter of course, from the alternative of war, as if it were the worst of all evils—which it certainly is not."
