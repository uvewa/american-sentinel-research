PROBABLY the chief, if not the only quarrel the clergy have with the Sunday newspaper is that it makes people forget that "it was time to go to church half an hour ago" on Sunday morning. The remedy is evidently not to suppress the Sunday newspaper, which is a vain hope, but to make the Sunday sermon so attractive that church time will be looked forward to with eagerness.—New York Journal.
