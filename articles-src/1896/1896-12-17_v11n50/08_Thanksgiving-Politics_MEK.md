# THANKSGIVING POLITICS.

## BY M. E. KELLOGG.

The elections are over, but the political fever has not yet abated; it continues to show itself, and in curious ways. The most ridiculous piece of political folly to be seen since the election is the way certain persons to whom is given the prerogative of issuing Thanksgiving day proclamations have taken advantage of their position to inject their politics into their proclamations. This was begun by no less exalted a personage than the President of the United States, who, in his Thanksgiving proclamation, expressed himself in a way that left no doubt that he thought that the success of a certain party in the elections had saved the nation from "dire disaster."

Of course if the President could make his annual Thanksgiving proclamation a means to get even with his party which had repudiated him, others to whom is given the authority to issue such proclamations could also take the same means to express their political sentiments. Hence several governors of States have issued proclamations in a similar vein. On the one hand, it is suggested in pious and covert phrases that God should be thanked because of the result of the election; and, on the other hand, that he should be thanked in spite of it!

The right of the President, and of the governors of States, to issue Thanksgiving day proclamations is a very questionable right, to say the least; and when we see it so prostituted that it becomes only a means of issuing a political and partisan manifesto, it deepens the impression that it is about time that it be dispensed with. This is not saying that we should not give thanks. But why confine it to one day, or wait for a President or governors to express their political views under cover of the Thanksgiving proclamation? God's blessings are new every morning and fresh every evening. Then let every day of mercies be to us a day of true thanksgiving unto the Giver of every good and perfect gift.
