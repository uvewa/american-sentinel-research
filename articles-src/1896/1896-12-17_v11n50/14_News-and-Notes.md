NEWS AND NOTES.

The "American Sabbath Union" is conducting meetings in various towns and cities in the United States, at which the subject discussed is, "The American Sabbath: Its Relation to Good Citizenship and Christian Progress." Addresses, limited to ten minutes each, are made by representatives of the various young people's societies, as the Epworth League, Christian Endeavor Society, etc. Thus the subject of "Sabbath reform" by law is being kept before the minds of the Christian young people of the country.

Recently in the course of his revival effort in New York City, Mr. Moody, the well-known Evangelist, devoted an afternoon meeting to the subject of Sabbath observance. Mr. Moody's meetings have been almost sensational in their apparent results thus far, but the week spot in his work appeared when he came in touch with the very practical question of keeping the Sabbath. He did not tell his audience which day is the Sabbath, although he must have known that very many of them were unsettled in their minds upon this important point. The Author of the Sabbath is perfectly specific in his statements concerning which day is the one to be observed. He says, "The seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God; in it thou shalt not do any work." Is the Creator too definite upon this point? Is his way of presenting the subject inferior to that discovered by Mr. Moody? Or was Mr. Moody silent on this point because he knew that he was addressing those who observe the first day instead of the seventh, without any scriptural warrant for so doing?

The Tulare (Cal.) Daily Register, of November 27, reports that a regularly issued order to the California national guard requires them to attend church on Sunday evenings, the men being left free to select the church of their preference. The Register suggests that "this is probably an atonement for sending the men out to camp in the frost without tents, overcoats or blankets."

If the men can rightfully be obliged to prefer some church, why not oblige them to prefer some one church, and thus secure uniformity and avoid confusion, as should be done in military matters? The same principle would be followed in the latter course as in the former.

The Alabama Legislature passed a bill December 5, "To prohibit the sale, giving away, or otherwise disposing of spirituous liquors within five miles of the Saginaw M. E. Church, Shelby County." Why should the Legislature of Alabama single out this church for such special "protection"? Have the members of this church more confidence in the civil law to purify the community in which they live than in the power of Christianity which Christ's followers are to possess? Or are they conscience that that power is absent from their own lives?

Christianity rejoices in entering the darkest spots of earth to illumine them with the light of life. She comes to the most sinful and degraded of human beings just as they are, and does not ask some other power to make them presentable to stand in her presence.

As mentioned in our last issue, the organ of the "Christian nation" party recently announced a remarkable discovery in connection with the President's "Christian" Thanksgiving proclamation. It was that the "settlement of the Venezuelan controversy" announced in the papers a few days later, came as a direct testimonial of divine approval of the President's course. Looking upon this happy occurrence it was moved to exclaim, "Was there ever a more complete or fuller illustration of that golden promise of God's word: 'Them that honor me I will honor!'"

Probably, from the "Christian nation" standpoint, there never was! But behold! it now transpires that the Venezuelan controversy is not settled after all. Venezuela is not represented on the commission of arbitration, the country has risen in indignant protest, negotiations are stopped, and the controversy is seemingly as far from an end as ever! We advise the aforesaid exponent of "National Reform" to wait next time until it can be sure that its discoveries will have the support of facts.

A "REFORM" which is based on tradition in place of the Word of God, is always a reform backwards. Such is the reform which now seeks to enforce the observance of Sunday.
