IN his efforts in behalf of temperance and also prohibition nobody can bid John G. Wooley more hearty God-speed than we do. But to his effort and hope to have the Church dominate and "run" the Government, nobody can be more opposed than are we. These views of religion are as political as those of the veriest National Reformer that has yet appeared. In Our Day, for November, 1896, he declares that—

This country will never be saved but by the entornement of Jesus in the politics of the republic, and his coronation by the Christian voters as the "King of kings and Lord of lords," and Platform of platforms.

Whether the country is ever saved or not, this thing will never be. There will never be any enthronement of Jesus in the politics of the republic; nor will he ever be crowned by the Christian voters as King of kings, nor as anything else. There were some folks once before who proposed "the enthronement of Jesus in the politics of the country," but he departed from them. In that day he said, "I receive not honor from men." And he says it yet.
