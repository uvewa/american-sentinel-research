surely the object of this organization of building trades is nothing else than "to secure the monopoly of some particular branch of trade, industry, or commerce, and to stifle wholesome competition."

It is true that this building-trades trust suggests "benefits" that can come from their monopoly; and so does the coal trust, the sugar trust, and all the others. The President's answer to the claim of "benefits" to others made by the capital trusts is also an answer to this suggestion of "benefits" to others made by this latest, or any other, labor trust. Admitting that such a thing may incidentally and occasionally appear, it is only incidental and occasional, and "such occasional results fall far short of compensating the palpable evil charged to the account of trusts and monopolies."

And the greatest of these evils is that which the President points out, which we have before pointed out, and which only last week we dwelt upon—the destruction of individuality. As the President expresses it: "This tendency is to crush out individual independence and to hinder or prevent the free use of human faculties and the full development of human character;" the relegation of the individual "to the level of a mere appurtenance to a great machine, with little free will, with no duty but that of passive obedience, and with little hope or opportunity of rising in the scale of responsible and helpful citizenship."

The President recommends legislation that shall check the operations of trusts and monopolies of capital. But how can a law be made that will have the desired effect upon the trusts and monopolies of capital, without affecting trusts and monopolies of labor as well? Any legislation proposed which should bear upon the labor trusts, however, would be instantly and vigorously resented as an attack upon labor and an invasion of the rights of labor; and certainly would not be suffered to become law. Yet any law bearing only upon trusts and monopolies of capital, would certainly be rejected by the courts as special or class legislation. Indeed, the President says that the legislation that has been enacted already, has failed, "simply because the laws themselves, as interpreted by the courts, do not reach the difficulty."

There is danger then, indeed there is a probability, that in the attempts to remedy the evil by legislation, it will be done in such a way that a governmental trust and monopoly will be erected which will be more destructive to individuality than all the other trusts and monopolies of all sorts together. The danger is that laws may be enacted and enforced, even by decrees of the highest courts, overstepping the boundaries of strict impartiality and general justice, and the assent of all be exacted simply because it is the law; and when any one presumes to question the law as to whether it is right, or strictly impartial or generally just, and refuses his assent to it because it is not such a law, he will be denounced as an enemy of the government and a revolutionist.

There is too much of this doctrine spread abroad in the United States already, that every law must be accepted and obeyed simply "because it is the law." Benjamin Harrison, while he was president, as he was "swingin' round the circle," made this his particular theme. In the late campaign he made a specialty of the same thing, and denounced as "revolutionists" all who should refuse assent to a decision of the United States Supreme Court on a constitutional question. The principles upon which the Government of the United States is founded, admit no such doctrine. Abraham Lincoln's whole political context was waged against it.

Yet this doctrine is the stronghold of the religious combination that proposes by Sunday laws and religious legislation generally, to dominate the country, and which is already dominating it to vastly too large an extent. They never ask, nor do they care, whether a thing is constitutional, or whether it is right. They only want to know whether it is the law, or whether by any means it can be made the law. Then whoever opposes it or refuses to obey it—no matter how flatly unconstitutional and wrong it may be—he is denounced as an "enemy of the government," "revolutionist," "anarchist," "Adventist," etc., etc. And having the governmental power in their hands, and public opinion on their side, they can, and they do, make it very uncomfortable for the man who chooses to think for himself and to maintain the constitutional provisions and fundamental principles upon which the nation rests. The effect of this religious trust and monopoly, precisely as is that of every other trust and monopoly, is to crush out individual independence and to hinder or prevent the free use of human faculties and the full development of human character;" to relegate the individual "to the level of a mere appurtenance to a great machine, with little free will, and with no duty but that of passive obedience."

It was not by any means a small club to be used to this end that President Cleveland put into the hands of this religious monopoly, when in his last Thanksgiving proclamation he committed the national government specifically to the patronage of the Christian religion—or rather, to that form of the Christian religion which is dealt in by this religious "Trust."
