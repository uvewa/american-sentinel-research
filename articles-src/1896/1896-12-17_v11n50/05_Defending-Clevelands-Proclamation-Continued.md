say anything at all on the subject, it follows as also certainly true that what he does say on this subject "is not a legal act." That is true. We only wish all the people would tell him so; and instruct him to quit committing acts that are "not legal."

The Independent further says that when the President says anything further than the law provides, it is not a legal act, "but an expression of personal opinion or advice;" and that—

no Jew or pagan can rightly take exception to some recognition of Jesus Christ, as an expression of the President's personal faith. . . . Although addressed to all the people his little sermon is no more official than his address at the Presbyterian Home Missionary meeting in Carnegie Hall last winter.

Mr. Cleveland did not address that missionary meeting in his official capacity of President of the United States. He did not say to them, "I, Grover Cleveland, President of the United States, do hereby," etc. He did not write it out and say, "Witness my hand and the seal of the United States, which I have caused to be hereunto affixed." He did not close that address with "Done at the city of Washington, . . . in the year of our Lord, one thousand eight hundred and ninety-six, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and twenty-first.

"By the President,

"GROVER CLEVELAND.

"RICHARD OLNEY, Secretary of State."

Yet all this was done to his Thanksgiving proclamation. In fact it would be impossible for any document to have more of an official character.

For any one to say, in view of all this, that what he said in the proclamation "is no more official" than was his address at the missionary meeting, is, if possible, more fraudulent than the statement that he is "authorized by law" to make such proclamations. Though of course it should only be expected that all the statements on the subject would be of the same piece.

As the whole document, however, because of its being "not a legal act," was in itself only an expression of opinion, it may in that sense be admitted that the particular sentence was also "but an expression of personal opinion," "an expression of the President's personal faith." But even then, it is pertinent to inquire, What right has any man to attach the Great Seal of the United States to his personal opinions, and thus to pass them out to the country as official business of national importance? What right has any man thus to make his personal opinions the official opinions of the nation? What right has any man to put the national seal upon his personal faith and officially send it forth to the people of the country as a governmental thing to which they are expected to conform? What right has any man thus to make his personal faith the official faith of the nation?

But the climax of the Independent's ghastly defense is reached in the following:

Suppose the President had been a Roman Catholic and referred to the invocation of Mary as a mediatrix, he would have made a mistake, because the prevailing sentiment of the land would be against him.

And is the Independent absolutely sure that there will never be so much of a prevailing sentiment in that direction that it will not be a mistake for a Roman Catholic in the presidential chair to refer to the invocation of Mary as a mediatrix, in a Thanksgiving proclamation? The Independent positively justifies such a thing whenever the prevailing sentiment may permit it. This is what the fathers saw when they made the National Government separate from religion, when they said: "Who does not see that the same authority that can set up the Christian religion in exclusion of all other religions, can with the same ease set up some particular sect of Christians in exclusion of all other sects?" Other presidents gave national recognition to religion in general. President Cleveland has given national recognition to the Christian religion in exclusion of all other religions. It is only a question of time when the next step will be taken, and a President will give national recognition to some particular sect, and that the Catholic sect, in exclusion of all other sects.

Rome sees this too. And therefore Cardinal Gibbons's organ, the Catholic Mirror, also comes to the defense of this latest proclamation and this latest phase of the development of National religion. The Mirror of November 28, says:

The Cleveland and Cincinnati rabbis and congregations who have made all this disturbance about a trifle are placing themselves in the same boat with those cranks and bigots who would "leave God out of the Constitution," or indeed, refuse to recognize any overruling Providence whatever—who would practically make our government agnostic or infidel.

And finally there comes the Reform Bureau of Washington, D. C., in the Ram's Horn, of Dec. 5, 1896, declaring it to be "unusual if not unprecedented," and that "Thus at last we have a proclamation in accord with the Supreme Court dictum, 'This is a Christian nation.'" And in a communication to the Washington, D. C., Evening Star, of November 30, the same body says further: "The Thanksgiving proclamation is in this respect the first one that might not have been as appropriately issued in China or among the Choctaws, or wherever a Supreme Being is recognized. This is the first proclamation in accord with the long list of historic facts on the basis of which the Supreme Court said, on February 20, 1892, in a unanimous opinion (Trinity Church case): 'This is a Christian nation.' This proclamation, with the burial of the spoils system and the arbitration treaty, will make this administration distinguished in history above any other since the war."
