## ORTHODOX CHRISTIANS SAY IT IS ALL WRONG.

Mrs. S. G. Wood, in Cleveland Evening Post, Nov. 30.

EDITOR PLAIN DEALER—Sir: In your editorial on Thanksgiving amendment referring to the seeming objectionable points in the Thanksgiving proclamation of Grover Cleveland, you say that from an orthodox Christian point of view they were all right.

A reader begs leave to say that if orthodox Christians thoroughly understood the principles upon which our Government was founded, while they might not regard any part of the proclamation as offensive to their religious views, they could in no respect consider the proclamation right, as the issuance of Thanksgiving proclamations is all wrong. It is a violation of those principles which are dear to the heart of every American, for an officer of civil government, as an official, to prescribe or proclaim acts of religious worship.

You excuse Grover Cleveland, and, no doubt, justly so, on the theory that perhaps some man accustomed to devout phraseology wrote said proclamation, and it was indorsed by the President without due care and deliberation.

Allowing the excuse that it was written by a devout man, this is of itself evidence that such a document should never be issued by those in official capacity, in civil government. The writer being a devout man prescribes for the people of the United States an act of worship, according to the dictates of his manuscript writer's conscience, while the American people believe in worshiping God according to the dictates of their own conscience.

There are a great number of citizens of the United States that are not yet willing to receive religious dictation from the head of the Government.

Your suggestion of an amendment relative to an established rule for the Thanksgiving proclamation (said rule drawn up by experts) contains deadly germs of a union of Church and State, which are dangerous to the principles of civil and religious liberty. If a government can appoint or elect experts to draft a Thanksgiving proclamation, the Government may also establish a form of worship or religious ceremonies to be observed on Thanksgiving day.

An expert or experts to dictate a form of proclamation which would carry out the intention of the originators of the day, would of a necessity have to believe in prayer and thanksgiving, hence a religious test would be required which would be in violation of the last clause of the sixth article of the Constitution of the United States, which says that no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States.

Again, for such a form to be adopted and made compulsory by legislative enactment would be in violation of the First Amendment to the Constitution, which says that Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, therefore, to establish a form of proclamation requiring an act of worship or religious services on a certain day, is to that extent an establishment of religion. It is "the little foxes that spoil the vines."

The United States being composed of all religionists and no religionists, it would certainly be an expert that could draft a form of proclamation that would not offend in any point.

Until I am corrected I shall believe that the Plain Dealer did not make the suggestion in good faith; but for the purpose of showing the absurdity of Thanksgiving proclamations. I remain yours for America and American principles.
