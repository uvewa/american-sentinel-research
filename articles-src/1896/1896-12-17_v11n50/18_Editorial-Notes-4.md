PROFESSOR GOULD, of Philadelphia, in an address before a church congress at Norfolk, Va., a short time ago, said that "One of the most gigantic trusts, whose fraudulent operations astonished and shocked the country, has on its board of directors two Sunday-school superintendents and other men high in the councils of the Church." There is no comment needed on this.
