would not be welcome if he did. So on Sunday morning of a pleasant day with his family he boards a sable car and starts for the park. A rich man who has just made sure that his clerks are busy at work adding up long columns of figures and seeing that no orders are missed or mistakes made, passes him while on his way to church. In class-meeting this pious fraud gets up and thanks God that he is not like that poor Dutchman he had just seen, and immediately declares that there ought to be something done to arrest the encroachments of the Continental Sunday which these foreigners have brought to our shores.

Then in an impassioned manner he appealed to the Association to go about the work in hand as did the Master of old—mingle with the people, share their sorrows and griefs, and in tenderness lift up the fallen and downcast, not coerce them—and if this were done then the twentieth century would witness a wonderful sight, not merely an American sabbath but a Christian Sabbath, dedicated as it should be to the service of God and the uplifting of humanity.

Of course the effect of such counter speeches can be easily imagined, and the feeling was plainly manifest.

"Phases of the Work That Need Emphasizing."

was the title of an address by Rev. A. L. Frisbie, pastor of the First Congregational Church of Des Moines, and who, by the way, has been a reader of the AMERICAN SENTINEL for some time past. He showed very clearly that he had correct ideas of religious liberty, and what compulsory Sabbath laws are liable to lead to. Like Mr. Dudley he believed that the only phase of the question that could be considered from a legal standpoint was the civil one, and yet after all, a man could not have goodness legislated into him; and never would Sunday be observed as it should be unless men did it because they felt that it was a duty they owed to God, for any other than heart worship was hypocrisy; that while there were phases of the work that could possibly be better effected by legislative measures than otherwise, yet it was the duty of the Church to win the people to a religious observance of the day rather than coerce them.

There were numerous other papers and addresses on various phases of the question, but they partook so much of the nature of what the readers of the SENTINEL are familiar with that it would hardly be profitable to give them. Resolutions were adopted deprecating the desecration of the day; protesting against Sunday trains, moving of United States mails, Sunday newspapers, etc.; asking for the closing of all places of business and the discouragement of all social and recreative diversions on Sunday; exalting the first day of the week as a holy day in the hearts of the people as set apart by God for divine worship; and demanding that one day in seven should be secured to all the people as a day of rest under the protection of the civil law.

Noticeable Features of the Convention.

One noticeable feature of the convention was their lack of unanimity of thought. One man, "led by the Spirit," would make certain statements concerning the sabbath and its preservation as a holy day, and he would be followed by another speaker who would squarely contradict him on many points. It reminded one of the accusers of Christ, of whom it is said, "Their witnesses agreed not together."

Another interesting feature was the stress laid upon the distinction between the civil and religious phases of the Sabbath question. One of the speakers was asked privately if the logical result of Sunday laws was not persecution, no matter if only the civil sabbath was sought to be protected. He replied "No." When asked how he explained the fact that the same Sabbath laws in substance that were on the Iowa statute books existed in many of the Southern States, and yet under the latter, honest, conscientious men were sent to jail and made to work in chain-gangs because they refused to rest on Sunday after having observed the previous day as the Sabbath, replied: "The people down there are not yet out the woods; they need educating; we would never do that in the North." And it might be remarked that right here a fatal error, lies so close to a vital truth, that only those who understand what constitutes true religious liberty can detect it.

Still another noticeable feature was the apparent consciousness of the inability of the plan they propose, ever really to succeed in bringing about the desired result. One speaker said that after all, the place to begin the rescue of the Sabbath was in the homes and with the children—that unless they were taught to reverence the day as God's day, and regard it as unto the Lord, and not unto man, they could not be made to observe it as they should in later years.

At no previous convention attended by the writer was there so little said as to why the first day was observed instead of the Sabbath. Sunday was the recognized Sabbath of the nation, and that was enough. Yet whenever appeal was made to the Bible as authority for the observance of Sunday, no Sabbaturian could ask for stronger arguments for his position—to a certain point at least. One speaker said, "The fourth commandment is as eternal as God himself; the very nature of the Sabbath indicates that it can never be abrogated; and unless the young people of to-day are early taught that the observance of Sunday, rests upon this Sabbath commandment, there is no hope for the future."
