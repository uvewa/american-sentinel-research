"WHAT AN IMPROVEMENT!"

SURELY this is what the readers of the AMERICAN SENTINEL will say when they shall see the first issue of the new year. Beginning with 1897, the SENTINEL will wear an entirely new dress, and will have sixteen pages. The pages will be of different form and somewhat reduced in size; but altogether the SENTINEL will be larger than it is now. Look out for it.
