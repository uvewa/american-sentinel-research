THE old directions to petitioners to Congress for religious legislation are still being repeated. The Reform Bureau says: "While individual signatures are good, especially if occupation and address are given, indorsements of churches, societies and public meetings, by vote are better." In this way not only can the same petitions be repeated indefinitely, but thousands of people who are opposed to it can be counted for it. Yes, for their purposes a vote is better than individual petitions; and a crooked vote better than a straight petition.
