THROUGH a misunderstanding we missed stating at the proper time that the excellent first-page cut of Napoleon, which appeared in our issue of December 3, was printed by permission of McClure's Magazine. This enterprising magazine reproduced it from an unpublished water color in the collection of Monsieur Christophle, ex-minister of Public Works, France.
