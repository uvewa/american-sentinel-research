THE following appeared in the November issue of Our Day, from the pen of Rev. W. F. Crafts:—

Another ill omen is the resurrection of Breckenridge, of Kentucky, by the gold Demigrate, as a speaker at their national convention, where his welcome was not unmixed with wholesome hisses, and his renewed candidacy for Congress under the auspices of that party, endorsed by Republicans of the district also.

Mr. Crafts and those for whom he speaks evidently do not consider the debt of gratitude they owe Mr. Breckenridge as their congressional ally in the effort made in 1890 to get Congress to pass a Sunday law for the District of Columbia. It must be hard for Mr. Breckenridge to be thus disowned by the party whom he led only six years ago in the crusade for "moral reform" by congressional enactment.
