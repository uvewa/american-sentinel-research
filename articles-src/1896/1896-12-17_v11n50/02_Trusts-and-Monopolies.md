Or "trusts and monopolies," President Cleveland, in his late message, said: "Another topic in which our people rightfully take a deep interest may be here briefly considered.

I refer to the existence of trusts and other huge aggregations of capital, the object of which is to secure the monopoly of some particular branch of trade, industry or commerce, and to stifle wholesome competition.

"Their tendency is to crush out individual independence and to hinder or prevent the free use of human faculties and the full development of human character.

There met here yesterday representatives of building trades from many cities at the call of the local building trades council. H.W. Steinbiss, secretary of the St. Louis Building Trades Council, is authority for the statement that 2,500,000 persons are interested in the movement.

It is not proposed to antagonize the employers of skilled labor, but to show them the benefits of co-operation with the laborers who create wealth.

This latter organization comes within the President's description of trusts, as certainly as does any organization of capital. For as-
