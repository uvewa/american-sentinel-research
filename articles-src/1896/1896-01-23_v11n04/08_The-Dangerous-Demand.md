# THE "DANGEROUS DEMAND."

[The Midland (Mich.) Republican, Jan. 10.]

The effort is being made, a joint resolution having already been introduced during this session of Congress, to secure an amendment to the Constitution of the United States, or to the preamble thereof, so as to make it read as follows, the words in parenthesis being the new feature which it is proposed to add:—

PREAMBLE:

We, the people of the United States (acknowledging Alonighly God as the source of all power and authority in civil government, the Lord Jesus Christ as the ruler of nations, and his revealed will as of supreme authority in civil affairs), in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, ensure domestic tranquillity, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.

If the resolution is passed by Congress—two-thirds of each house—which we hope is impossible, the proposed amendment will then be submitted to the several States for ratification—or rather, it is to be hoped, for condemnation.

What good can such an interpolation do? Will it make any man or woman any better in heart or life? Will it make believers of unbelievers, or increase the faith of any? Will it feed or clothe or comfort any who are suffering? No!

But the harm it may do is limitless. Is this nation ready to turn its back on the wisdom of its founders and on its traditions and deliberately adopt a national religion and a national creed and pave the way for a complete "union of Church and State"?

The preamble to the Constitution is, and should remain, a clear cut statement of definite purpose. The words it is proposed to introduce, mean something with reference to the future of this nation, or they mean nothing. If they mean nothing in particular, they have no right in the Constitution.

If they mean something, and they do—more than some of those who are clamoring for their interpolation suppose—they mean a national religion. The statement concerning "His revealed will as of supreme authority" means that that will, or what is thought to be His will, is to be interpreted and applied to all the affairs of the nation and of government in its various branches and subdivisions.

But, as no one will claim that His will in relation to all these modern details is to be found in the Bible, it means that there must be some earthly authority, one person, or several, whose announcement (revelation) of the supreme will as applied to government in general, and all cases that may arise in particular, shall be final—supreme! That is what it means—the hand of man, assuming to act for Christ upon all things. Do we want it? Do we want to turn the hands on the dial of progress back to the time when Bruno was put to death for his opinions, or when Michael Servetus was foully and cruelly murdered, slowly burned to death, according to law, by authority of John Calvin?

We've had within a few months men sentenced to prison and to the chain-gang in the United States because their religious opinions and observances do not agree with those of others. We've had a Joseph Cook telegraphing the President to "send troops"—courting the chances of bloodshed—because his idea of a religious observance was in danger of being disturbed. Do we want to amend the Constitution so that more and worse may follow?

But some may say these things do not concern us here in this corner, and should not be agitated. They do concern us; the question is before the country. The joint resolution has been introduced in Congress. Congress should know what the people think about it. If the people want it, then they must have it and try it. But they should look at it on both sides and all through. They should realize what it means. If this resolution passes Congress, it will have to be acted on by the people of Michigan.

The Republican believes that every one should consider this subject carefully. It is of just as much interest to us all as the Venezuelan boundary and the possibility of a war with England—even more, for it pertains to what we propose to do with ourselves. . . . England may say whether she will go to war with us, but this question she cannot settle for us. And we're glad of it. She might make a wrong decision. We must not.

It is an established law that every man has a right to do as he pleases so long as he doesn't interfere with other people's rights. A law that violates this principle is not right, and this Blue Law does.—South Pittsburg (Tenn.) Republican.
