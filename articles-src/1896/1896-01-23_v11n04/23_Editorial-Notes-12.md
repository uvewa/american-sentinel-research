THE National Reform movement would not be half as dangerous to the rights and liberties of the people as it is, were the people themselves not so prone to regard it as an insignificant bit of fanaticism not at all likely to accomplish any serious results. Already Congress has shown a willingness to take part in a religious controversy—that of which day is the Sabbath—as it did in 1892 in the matter of closing the World's Fair on Sunday; and in many instances of late the inherent rights of the people have been denied and ruthlessly invaded by religious legislation. Eternal vigilance is still the price of liberty. Indeed, vigilance and earnest efforts are now needed to recover what has been lost, as well as to guard that which is left.
