THE Indianapolis Journal calls attention to the fact that Sunday is a busy day with the President. The Venezuela message was written on Sunday, the alleged popular loan announcement was prepared on Sunday, as was also the letter to Senator Caffery. But Sunday is the "Christian sabbath" just the same, enforced by the fourth commandment according to the legislative interpretation of the divine law; while according to the Supreme Court "we are a religious people," "a Christian nation." We find no fault with Mr. Cleveland's use of Sunday, and call attention to these facts merely to illustrate the utter futility of paper professions of religion. The case would be no different if Sunday were really the Sabbath by divine appointment.
