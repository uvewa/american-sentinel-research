THE Christian Statesman, of January 4, announces the accession of Senator John Sherman, of Ohio, and Representative Nelson Dingley, of Maine, to the ranks of the advocates of compulsory Sunday observance, these well-known congressmen having recently made speeches in Washington "strongly favoring" a "stricter observance of the sabbath."
