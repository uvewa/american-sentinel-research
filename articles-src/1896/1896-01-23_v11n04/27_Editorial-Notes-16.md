It is rumored that the pope has offered to be arbitrator in the dispute between Venezuela and Great Britain. The Roman pontiff has on several occasions within recent years shown his readiness to add the office of general arbitrator to the dignities pertaining to the papal chair. The "vicar of Christ" seems to have forgotten that the Saviour himself pointedly refused on one occasion to be arbitrator between two disputing parties, saying, "Man, who made me a judge or a divider over you?" Luke 12:14.
