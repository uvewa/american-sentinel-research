A Toronto paper says that a very important decision has been handed down by Judge Rose, of that city, fully sustaining the running of street cars on Sunday. The facts are stated thus: "Some time since, the Ministerial Association of Hamilton took action against the street-car company for running cars on Sunday. Justice Rose's judgment was in all points in favor of the street-car company. He held that the running of cars was in no sense a violation of the Lord's day act."
