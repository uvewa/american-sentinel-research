A lady has been refused admission to the circle of the "Colonial Dames" on the ground that Benjamin Franklin was not a really "worthy ancestor"! This need occasion no surprise when we remember that discredit is being cast upon pretty nearly everything connected with the era in which Franklin lived, even the Declaration of Independence being denounced as infidel and the Constitution of the United States as atheistic.
