# THE REAL OBJECT OF SUNDAY LEGISLATION.

BY W. S. CHAPMAN.

WHENEVER religious legislation referring to Sunday is a subject of argument, the friends of such "laws" almost invariably assert that the tenor of them is purely "civil," and their character restrictive only as "police regulations."

Judge Arnold, judge of the Quarter Sessions Court No. 1, of Philadelphia, a short time since had before him for trial, several prisoners, alleged proprietors of "speak-easys," who were arrested on Sunday. The judge discharged them all on the ground that "arrests on Sunday on charges of misdemeanor," simply, "were illegal." Only "for treason, felony or breach of the peace," can individuals be taken on a warrant upon Sunday. Judge Arnold was governed by the Colonial law of 1705, which distinctly states that no service of any writ or warrant charging a misdemeanor shall be made on the first day of the week. To a reporter the judge said: "The idea of the makers of the 'law' was that Sunday was a sanctified day, and that even though a warrant for misdemeanor had been sworn out against a person during the week, if it had not been served before that day he should be free to worship and rest on the Lord's day."

While the statements of Judge Arnold were not intended as a decision, Director of Public Safety, Butler, after perusing the act of 1705, remarked that everything the judge had stated was true. And these statements are a fair presentment of the actual truth in reference to the position Sunday, in law, sustains to the other days of the week. In the minds of legislators it is a "sanctified" day, and Sunday legislation has but one aim—let their utterances be what they may—to uphold the supposed sanctity of the day.

It is strange that some, who are so zealous for the maintenance of the "rest" of that day, could be abettors and instigators of arrests on Sunday, as are members of the "Law and Order" societies, generally, who thus become breakers of the very "law" (in its intent) for the enforcement of which they clamor.
