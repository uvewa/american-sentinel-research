# PERSECUTION FOR CONSCIENCE' SAKE.

[Weekly Messenger, St. Albans, Vt., Dec. 26, 1895.]

In the town of Darrel, Ontario, a few weeks ago three ministers were arrested for alleged violation of the statutes of that province of the English nation, relating to the observance of the sabbath day or Sunday. They were tried, convicted, and fined, in default of which they were sent to the county jail for periods of from forty to sixty days.

These clergymen, regularly ordained and recognized by the believers in their particular form of religious faith, were Seventh-day Adventists, that is to say, they interpret the Mosaic command regarding the observance of one day in the week as a day of rest and worship literally, and observe the seventh day as the Sabbath.

So far as any divine warrant exists or ever has existed for the observance of any one day of the week, these men and their associate believers are clearly and unmistakably in the right. The charge from the seventh to the first day of the week was purely and entirely of human origin and was made by purely human authority. No claim ever has been or can now be made in support of a divine warrant for the change. These clergymen hold it a matter of religious obligation to observe the seventh day and no claim was made by their prosecutors, or rather persecutors, that they have not scrupulously kept the tablets of their faith in this regard.

One of the congregations or societies over which these ministers were called as religious guides and teachers determined upon the erection of a new church edifice. The society was poor and was in a measure dependent upon the personal and manual labor of its members for the successful prosecution of the effort. Having obeyed what to them was an explicit command of the Alonighty and kept Saturday as the Sabbath, these clergymen saw no reason why they should not devote a portion of the following day in the furtherance of their plans for building a new church structure. The place where the building was being erected was removed from all other houses of worship and consequently the work upon it did not disturb the worshipers at other religious shrines. The three clergymen gave their services without money and without price and were engaged at the time of their arrest in slacking time to assist in laying the foundation of the new church.

The Lord's day act of Ontario does not mention any of the profession in its provisions, nor farmers nor gardeners, but does inhibit mechanics, artificers, etc., from the pursuit of their callings on the first day of the week. It was alleged these men, besides being ministers, were also carpenters, and the arrests were made and conviction secured upon this ground.

Admitting they were in technical violation of the statutes of Ontario in slacking time on the so called sabbath day, they were not working for hire, were engaged in religious work as truly as the janitors, sextons, organists, even ministers of any and every other church in the community or the entire province of Ontario. It is just as clearly a religious work to slack time for building the foundations of a house of religious worship as to toll the bell, to blow or play the organ, build, light and replenish the fires, light the gas or turn the electric button, raise or lower the windows or window curtains, or robe or disrobe the minister of a completed house of worship. As a matter

of fact, the enforcement of the only command regarding the observance of the Sabbath day bearing any semblance of divine authority would compel the punishment of nine out of every ten inhabitants in any given community in this republic. And it is hardly less true that a strict administration of the laws of the province of Ontario, or of a dozen or more States in this Union, would touch the pocket books or curtail the liberty of the great majority of church members and attendants upon church services, to say nothing of the much greater army of non-attendants. It is no more a work of charity or necessity to indulge in riding or walking for pleasure, in preparing a hot dinner, visiting friends, or the thousand and one occupations carried on by nearly every man and woman in every community, than to slack lime for preparing the foundations of a church edifice.

The arrest and punishment of these three clergymen of Darrel, Ontario, was not instigated or prosecuted by the slightest spirit of true religion. It finds no warrant in any word spoken by the founder of the Christian faith. It was born and nurtured in that spirit of intolerance which has lighted the fires of persecution in the past, has blotted the records of the Christian church with the blood and tears of good men, pure and noble women, and innocent children. It is persecution pure and simple, cowardly, unmanly, unchristian.
