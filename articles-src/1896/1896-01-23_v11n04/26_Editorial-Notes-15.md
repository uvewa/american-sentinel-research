DR. TALMAGE says in the Christian Herald, of December 4: "We talk a great deal about putting God into the Constitution of the United States. Ah! it is not God in the Constitution that we want; it is God in the hearts of the people." This is true, but not because Dr. Talmage says it. "God in the Constitution in any other sense than that in which he is now in it, as explained on page 26, would be only a false profession by a part of the people of something which in the very nature of the case could not be true.
