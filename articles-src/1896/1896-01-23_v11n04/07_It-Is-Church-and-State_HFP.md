# IT IS CHURCH AND STATE.

BY H. F. PHELPS.

This city, St. Paul, Minn., seems to be rather conservative on the Sunday-enforcement question; yet the leaven is working even here. A league has been formed, called the "Christian Citizenship League." Whether this is the same as that of which so much was said during the baseball season, the Sunday Law Observance League, or not, is not known to the writer. But the Christian Citizenship League is organized as an auxiliary to the National League of the same name. Article 2 of the constitution says:—

The objects of the league shall be the enforcement of the laws of the city and of the State; to combat existing evils, especially such as result from the violation of the liquor laws, unlawful Sunday labor, gambling, and the keeping of disreputable places; to arouse a healthy and intelligent interest on all questions concerning the welfare of our city and State, and to shape public opinion toward securing the nomination and election of competent and trustworthy men for public offices without respect to party lines.

A series of meetings called mass-meetings has been entered upon in the interests of the league. The writer recently attended one of these meetings, and it could hardly be called a mass-meeting. It is quite evident that the masses are not interested in the work or objects of the league. If they were interested and understood the real purpose of the league and what is meant by the suppression of "unlawful Sunday labor," there would, no doubt, be an enthusiasm created and manifested that might result in the defeat of that part of the work. But being in ignorance of

this, the people are sleeping while they are being bound, and their liberties slowly but surely being stolen from them by well-meaning but terribly mistakened men.

At the meeting in question one of the speakers, a prominent clergyman, said that there was a sort of a feeling that this was Church and State; but he declared it was "as free from Church and State as the laws against murder." But in almost the same breath he made two statements that proved this denial to be without a foundation. A good deal was said concerning the Sunday saloon, giving the crusade the air of a temperance movement. And as one reason why the saloons should be closed on Sunday, he said: "The great body of the American people keep Sunday." And again: "We are simply saying, You can't buy it [liquor] on Sunday." These statements analyzed prove conclusively that this is a union of Church and State. Let us see.

Why do people keep Sunday? And why this demand for the enforcement of statutes in order that those who desire "can't buy it on Sunday"? There is one answer, and only one that can be given: It is because the Sunday is regarded by the Church as a sacred day. Were it not for this, we should never have heard of these leagues. More than this: the Sunday "laws" were secured through the influence and power of the Church. Were it not so, we should never have heard of a Sunday "law." It stands like this: The Church holds that Sunday should be observed as a day of rest. The Church secured the Sunday "laws." The Church demands their enforcement. But they cannot be enforced except by civil authority. If, therefore, the State, through its officers, should accede to these demands, it will be nothing less, it can be nothing less than a union of the two—a union of Church and State. This is just as plain and just as true as that two and two make four. Remember, that we impugn the motives of no one; but we do know that these men are terribly mistaken and only wish that they would depend, not upon the power of the State, but upon the power of the gospel to work out reformation.
