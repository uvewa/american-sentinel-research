JANUARY 13, Senator Pavey, of this city, introduced a bill at Albany "to extend the powers of the Parkhurst Society for the Prevention of crime." This bill provides for the employment of a superintendent (who may be a director of the society) to conduct all cases for the society before the various tribunals. Said superintendent to receive a salary himself and to have authority to employ any of the other directors as counsel. This is nothing less than a proposition to support out of the public treasury a church-detective agency. The bill is far-reaching in its possible consequences and ought to be defeated.
