THE following is from the Western Watchman, of January 9:

A Protestant preacher in Kansas City last Sunday said from his pulpit that the only churches the world had any need of were the Catholic churches. The Episcopalians should be given a certain time to become Catholics; and after that all non-Catholic churches should be taxed out of existence. Catholic churches should be maintained and exempted from taxation, because they were the refuges of the poor and the friendly inns of the weak, the suffering and the destitute of the whole world.

The Watchman is a Roman Catholic paper and seems to approve the remarkable opinion expressed by this "Protestant" preacher of Kansas City. Nevertheless Cardinal Gibbons has assured the American people that Rome is not in favor of a union of Church and State, and indeed if we mistake not the Watchman has many times confessed the same. No, Roman Catholics do not want a union of Church and State; like the National Reformers they want only a union of religion and the State. But in their eyes everything worthy the name of religion is bound up in the Roman Catholic Church.
