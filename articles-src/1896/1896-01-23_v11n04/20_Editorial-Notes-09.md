We trust that none of our readers have omitted the excellent articles which have been appearing from time to time in our columns, from the pen of Addison Blakely, Ph. D., of the University of Chicago. Professor Blakely treats the subject of civil government and the basis of civil law from the standpoint not of the scholastic but from that of the eternal principles of justice. The article in this number, as also the one to follow upon the same subject next week, contains information and suggestions of inestimable value to those who would be prepared to cope successfully with the modern theories of the nature and origin of Sunday legislation. These articles will bear not only reading but study.
