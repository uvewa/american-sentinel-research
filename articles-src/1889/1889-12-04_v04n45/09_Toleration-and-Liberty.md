# Toleration and Liberty.

An edict or act of toleration is a grant of the civil government, which authorizes religious societies dissenting from the State religion to worship according to the dictates of conscience without liability to persecution. Such an edict always presupposes a religion established by law and supported by the State, and the right of the State to control public worship. Toleration may proceed from necessity, or from prudence, or from indifference, or from liberality and an enlarged view of truth and right. It may be extended or withdrawn by the government; but it is usually the entering wedge for religious liberty and legal equality.

There is a wide difference between toleration and liberty. The one is a concession, the other a right; the one is a matter of expediency, the other a principle; the one is a gift of man, the other, a gift of God.

Toleration implies more or less censure or disapproval. We tolerate or endure what we dislike but cannot prevent. The most despotic governments are tolerant towards subjects who are too numerous or too useful to be killed or exiled. Russia tolerates Romanists, Protestants, Jews, and Mohammedans; Turkey tolerates “Christian dogs,” and likes them to prey upon each other; but woe to him in either country who apostatizes from the State religion, or attempts to induce any member of the same to apostasy. Toleration is first sought and granted as a favor, then demanded and conceded as a right, and at last spurned as an insult. In a free country nobody wants to be tolerated for his religious opinions or sacred convictions.

Religious liberty is a natural, fundamental, and inalienable right of every man. It is founded in the sacredness of conscience, which is the voice of God in man, and above the reach and control of human authority. There is a law above all human laws. It is written not on parchment and tables of stone, but on the heart of man by the finger of God. It is that law which commands with the categorical imperative, and which filled the philosopher Kant with ever-growing reverence and awe. “We must obey God more than man.” He and he alone is the author and lord of conscience, and no power on earth has a right to interpose itself between them. “Every man stands or falls to his own lord.” Liberty of conscience requires liberty of worship as its manifestation. To grant the former and to deny the latter is to imprison conscience and to promote hypocrisy or infidelity. Religion is in its nature voluntary, and ceases to be religion in proportion as it is forced. God wants free worshipers, and no others.

Toleration is an intermediate state between religious persecution and religious liberty. Persecution results from the union of Church and State; toleration, from a relaxation of that union; full religious liberty and legal equality require a peaceful separation of the spiritual and secular powers.

The theory of medieval Europe was intolerance and persecution; the theory of modern Europe is toleration; the theory of North America is religious liberty and equality. The Papal Church is constitutionally exclusive and intolerant, and treats every departure from it as damnable heresy and schism. On the Continent a distinction is made between official churches and tolerated sects; in England, between the established churches and societies of dissenters. In [374] the United States all forms of Christianity are equal before the law, and there is no distinction between churchmen and sectaries, or dissenters. All enjoy the full right of self-government, and the protection of the laws of the land.—*Dr. Schaff, in Religious Freedom.*
