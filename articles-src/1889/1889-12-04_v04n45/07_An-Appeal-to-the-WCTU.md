# An Appeal to the W. C. T. U.

The W. C. T. U. have a column in the Healdsburg *Enterprise.* In the issue of that journal of July 3 they have an article entitled, "Sabbath Observance." They speak of the efforts put forth for the Blair Sunday-Rest bill; and all the results thus far, they say, are God's answers to their prayers. That is, they would have us believe that the Lord answered prayer in behalf of an unscriptural method to obtain an arbitrary law to compel observance to an institution which not only has no divine authority, but which is a rival to the sacred rest-day of God's own appointment!

Sisters, just think of that, will you? Is it not possible that you may be wrong in ascribing the result to your prayers? God heareth those who ask according to his will (1 John 5:14) ; but did you ask according to God's will? Where is it contained in God's will that Sunday should be observed? Where is it revealed that any religious institution of any character should be forced upon the conscience of anyone, whatever his belief or unbelief? Paul said, "Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we *persuade* men." 2 Cor. 5:11. You think, sisters, that the judgments of God will fall upon this people because of their violation of God's law; your brothers of National Reform so talk. Believing, therefore, in the terror of the Lord, why do you not take the scriptural way, and *persuade* men? Is it because you lack the other means, which gives power to persuasion,—the word of God with its precepts and promises? Be honest, sisters, with your own souls; why support unscriptural institutions and in such unscriptural ways? They continue:—

> "Opposition to this Sunday-Rest bill comes mainly from two sources: The liquor dealers and the Seventh-day Baptists and Adventists, the first class opposing it as an infringement of personal liberty, the second as an infringement of conscience. We shall now spend no time on the first class, both because their opposition is nothing like as pronounced as that of the seventh-day people, and because the personal liberty plea has been so often and so ably answered in another connection.

> "The second class of opponents are entitled to most respectful consideration, both because we always respect conscientious scruples, and because of the persistent, concentrated efforts they are making to defeat the bill. It seems as if those two churches which believe that Saturday is the true Sunday are bending all the energies which other churches expend in home and foreign missions, in Christian philanthropy of every kind, upon the one effort of defeating the Sunday-Rest bill. The country is flooded with their literature, on which they expended twenty thousand dollars last year, and their strongest men and women are instant in season and out of season, defending their cause. It is a significant fact that in this opposition of our seventh-day friends the Jews take no part."

On the above we wish to offer a few observations which we hope may prove a benefit to our W. C. T. U. sisters.

1. They acknowledge that the great opposer to the present fight of this woman's *temperance* organization is not the rum power, but two bodies of temperate and temperance Christians—and these must submit or be crushed. Is it for this purpose the Union was organized? How sadly fallen!

2. Seventh-day people do *not believe* that "Saturday is the true Sunday." But Saturday *is* the true Sabbath. They have no more claims for Sunday than any other day. Its name indicates its origin as a day for religious observance.

3. The Seventh-day Adventist Church (and we doubt not the Seventh-day Baptist Church— we speak for the former) put more energy and more money in foreign missions last year than ever before. It can safely be said that they did more work in this direction in proportion to their wealth and numbers than any denomination that espoused the cause of the Blair Sunday-Rest bill. All their efforts against it were extra above their regular work.

4. Yes; they probably expended more than twenty thousand dollars. Why not? Was not their cause a worthy one? We praise God that they did so much. We wish they could have done more.

5. "Their strongest men and women are instant in season and out of season, defending their cause." Then they are doing just what God commanded that the minister of the word should do. But they advised no arbitrary methods; they demanded nothing from the State themselves; they only asked that equality before the law which the Federal Government grants. They contended not for *privileges,* but rights,— rights for all equally with themselves. Was this the principle upon which our sisters strove?

6. The Jews *did* take part in this opposition. Both the *Jewish Exponent* and the *Jewish Times and Observer* had forcible articles against the proposed bill.

7. Our sisters belong to a "Christian" organization. They profess to be Christians, that is, followers of Christ, obedient to his precepts. Did they ever read the following precept?

> "Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them; for this is the law and the prophets." Matt. 7:12.

This does not mean Methodist men, nor Baptist men, nor Prohibitionists; it means all men— Jews and Gentiles, believers and unbelievers, Christians and pagans, Sabbath-keepers and Sunday-keepers. Would you have the pagan compel you to adore his gods and keep his sacred days? —Then force upon him yours. Would you have the infidel compel you to forego all worship, all service to God?—Then compel him to honor your religious observances. Would you be compelled to observe the seventh-day Sabbath, the true Lord's day? (Would God that your consciences, enlightened by the word and Spirit, would so compel.) Then force upon the seventh-day-keeper your high day, contrary to his conscience and welfare.

Are the *Christian* women of your organization prepared to interpret the "golden rule" in this way? Are you prepared to be active agents in the oppressive measures which are being pushed forward under the name Christian, by professedly Christian men? The tyranny of the Dark Ages began with milder and more plausible claims than are now made by those clamoring for a religio-civil sabbath. The sure effect of such legislation will be to make hypocrites of many who prize temporal advantage and convenience above conscience, and oppress others who regard conscience and the word of God above all earthly advantages. Christians, indeed, do not look here for results or rewards. Are the W. C. T. U. prepared to meet their present work in the light of the judgment?—*Signs of the Times.*
