# Georgia's Sunday Law.

Sunday-observance laws are most often heard of in connection with the retailing of liquors and other merchandise. While they have some influential support upon theological grounds, it seems probable that with the mass of citizens the chief idea is to guard against practices tending to generalize Sunday labor. It will be well then that the operation of these laws should be scrutinized with reference to the different principles indicated. A case has been reported from Georgia where a laboring man was convicted of digging a ditch on Sunday to carry off the foul water from his cellar. A preacher was the complaining witness or instigator of the prosecution, and the culprit was sentenced to a year's imprisonment and to serve in the chain-gang. If the facts are anywhere near correctly reported there is no question what the verdict of public opinion must be upon such a case. It strongly illustrates what may be called unchristian Christianity, and becomes a proper subject of remark for the secular press, because the civil law is the force brought into action.

So far as special religious beliefs are interwoven in the texture of society, they receive such recognition as appertains to civil order, the prevention of offense, and shock to the feelings of persons, and the avoidance of commotions and marked ill feelings which produce social and public discord. If not at this line where shall the limit of State authority in religious matters be fixed, assuming that the American people are well determined to respect the principle of religious liberty where they perceive it? From an evangelical standpoint a large toleration of Sabbath freedom should be the sincere desire of every Christian. The Pharisees made much of Sabbath observances, but the founder of Christianity reproved them by example and question, asking which of them would not take his ox out of the ditch on the Sabbath. It would seem that the Christian spirit would always seek to recognize a right motive where such might exist.

No matter if the preacher would not make a drain on Sunday, he should be able to concede that his neighbor might have a good conscience in doing so. To prosecute one who does a good work and does it with a good conscience is to outrage humanity, disgrace religion, and bring into disrepute the creed of the prosecutor. The inspiration for such prosecution is bigotry. But if the law lends itself to bigotry the law is wrong. It cannot undertake to protect every feeling which alleges itself to be religious. If a Puritan is hurt to think that another enjoys a good dinner on Sunday, that form of asceticism cannot be protected from sentimental shock, for the State will utterly refuse to go back to ascetic theology as a substitute for religious liberty in its polity, and Puritanism has rarely been that of Christian States.

When such prosecutions and laws capable of such applications cannot be defended on Christian principles, and for the honor of the Christian churches and people, what shall be said of them in the light simply of the American constitutions, which are not distinctively Christian in any theological or ecclesiastical sense? This must be said—because it is surely felt by many citizens —that if such laws are to be applied with the senseless bigotry characterizing the Georgia case referred to, it will be necessary to dismiss the hope that ecclesiastics and justices can be relied upon to exhibit sound discretion, and the Sunday laws must be overhauled and amended so as to render outrages of the character alluded to impossible occurrences for the future.—*Galveston Weekly News, November 14.*
