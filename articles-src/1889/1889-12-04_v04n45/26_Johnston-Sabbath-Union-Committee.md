We learn from the Oakland *Times* that Rev. N. R. Johnston, of this city, together with Rev. Dr. Briggs, of Pacific Grove, and Rev. A. Calhoun, of San Jose, have been appointed a committee of the American Sabbath Union to organize local and auxiliary unions for the revival and enforcement of Sunday legislation. Mr. Johnston announces that he will "answer calls for service in public Sabbath-law meetings, or to preach on the Sabbath question."

A personal acquaintance with one of these gentlemen, Mr. Johnston, justifies us in expressing the opinion that no better man could have been selected as a member of this committee. Though socially a very estimable man, this gentleman is a thorough National Reformer, with all that the term implies. Though exceedingly mild and gentle in private conversation, he is so biased by his religion, inherited from the Covenanters, that he can see no reason why if a theocracy was good for the Jews it would not be equally good for us; nor why if it was right anciently to put men to death for Sabbath-breaking, it would not be the proper thing to do now. In short, Mr. Johnston cannot see the difference between a divinely established theocracy, administered by inspired men, and a man-made theocracy, so called, administered by uninspired, and too often narrow and bigoted, or even evil and designing, men. It is certainly fit that he should be a member of this committee.
