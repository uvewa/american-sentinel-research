Some time since the Los Angeles *Tribune,* in giving some report of a sermon by Rev. S. J. Carroll, said: "In speaking of a national Sunday law he maintained that the mixture of religion and government had resulted in evil from the time of Constantine down to the Puritans." We thought the sentiment good and quoted it, but along comes the *California Christian Advocate* with a protest, and an explanation that Mr. Carroll didn't say it, or didn't mean it if he did. It says:—

> "The truth is that Mr. Carroll incidentally made a remark to the effect that he was opposed to any union of Church and State, but he very urgently plead in the same sermon for the American National Sunday, and he strongly pleaded for the right of every laboring man to one undisturbed Sunday, protected by law both from the greed that would drive him to toil and the desecration and tumult of excursions, picnics, base-ball, etc."

Well, Mr. Carroll has then just what he wants. There is now no law in any State in this Union to compel any man to work on Sunday if he doesn't want to, and as for excursions and baseball, he need not so much as see either of them. If he don't go on the excursions they need not trouble him, and if he don't go to the ballgrounds, and don't read the base-ball news the next morning, he need not so much as know that people are playing ball on Sunday. If Mr. Carroll is really opposed to Church and State he cannot afford to favor Sunday legislation, for in it are the seeds of such union.
