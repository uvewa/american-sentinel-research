# The Blessed Sabbath-Day.

*Resolved,* That we will use our influence by word and example against all railroad travel and excursions on the Sabbath, and against Sunday newspapers, and for legislation that will close all places of business or pleasure, and protect the Sabbath as a day of rest and worship.

The above is the main resolution adopted by the Sabbath Observance Association in Des Moines last week. There can be no doubt but that the resolution will accomplish more harm than good. There is too much of the desire to control all other people in their manners and customs, and compel them to conform to the whims and hobbies of those who resolve but do not perform. The time will never come when railroad travel, Sunday newspapers and parks, will be abolished on Sundays. The person who wrote that resolution probably commits far greater crimes every year of life than are enumerated therein. The resolution indicates too much of "the holy I" and not enough work among the suffering poor and the viciously wicked. It would be far better to pay more attention to the teachings of "Him who doeth all things well" than to attempt to rule everything and everybody, without having sufficient knowledge and power to rule themselves.

Sunday is the poor man's day. Laborers work all the week-days and have no time for rest or recreation except on Sundays. They cannot be deprived of the privilege of reading newspapers or gaining health through inhaling fresh air in the parks on the day of rest. It would be a poor kind of religion that could be injured in reading the *Sunday Register,* or in enjoying the fresh air of the parks. Des Moines now has all the restrictions on Sunday that can ever be enforced. No amount of crankism or of forcing others to do as they do can ever shut out the blessed sunshine and fresh air. All attempts to do so will only make Jordan a harder road to travel to those who might be induced to become better people if there were not so much of the unchristian spirit of painting the bright, happy world as an object to be avoided on the holy Sabbath-day. The long, tedious, and tiresome Sundays demanded by that resolution will never come.

The world is slowly reaching a better standard. The people are progressing in every good direction, but the time will never come to revive the "Blue Laws of Connecticut," or when a Christian people will demand a law or custom which will dictate that the blessed Sabbath-day shall be a cut and dried day of desolation and mourning. The writer has been ruled by a Methodist rod all his life, and yet Sunday has always been the happiest, most enjoyable day in the week in all the homes in which he has been an inmate. "Six days shalt thou labor, and on the seventh shalt thou rest," cannot be interpreted that "thou shalt sit in sackcloth and ashes all the Sundays of thy life," as is demanded by the resolution referred to. The Hebrews and Adventists rest on Saturdays, comply with the divine law, and satisfy their consciences that they are worshiping according to the light given them. They cannot be forced to worship on any other day, and it can be said to their great credit that they do not attempt to make people of other faith observe Saturday as the day of rest.

The modern Christian home is a much happier home than the homes of the Puritans. It is a much more liberal home; it is nearer the throne; it is founded on sacred doctrines promulgated in the Bible; and it is a home that will not be dictated to by cranks who wish to govern all other people, but who are not able to govern themselves. The resolution might equally as well have been framed against the ten commandments. It is not humane, it is not Christian, but it is of the Pharisaical spirit that was so severely condemned when the world was newer and intelligence and happiness did not so frequently draw the hearts of the people toward better life and preparation for rendering an account for having read good newspapers, breathed the fresh air, and enjoyed the blessed sunshine in the parks on Sunday. The *Register* believes in the Christian Sabbath as taught by the Bible, but not as interpreted by one idea cranks, who have never been fully satisfied with the world, and will never be satisfied with heaven because they did not make it themselves.—*Iowa State Register, November 17.*
