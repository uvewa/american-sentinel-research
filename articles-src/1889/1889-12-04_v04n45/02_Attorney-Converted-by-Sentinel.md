An attorney-at-law, in Washington, D. C., writes thus concerning the American Sentinel:

> "Editors American Sentinel: A number of copies of your paper have recently fallen into my hands. Its doctrines are logical and its arguments insuperable. Before seeing it, I had attended some of the meetings held here by the advocates of the so-called Sunday-Rest bill, where I saw miles of petitions, and listened to many fine speeches, and *signed the petition.* Since seeing your paper, I have become converted and signed an *opposing* petition. You are *right* in thinking there is danger in that bill."
