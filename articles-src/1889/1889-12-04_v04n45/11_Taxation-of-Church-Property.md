# Taxation of Church Property.

President Grant in his message (1875) thus treated this subject: “In connection with this important question, I would also call your attention to the importance of correcting an evil that, if permitted to continue, will probably lead to great trouble in our land before the close of the nineteenth century. It is the acquisition of the vast amount of untaxed church property. In 1850, I believe, the church property of the United States which paid no tax, municipal or State, amounted to $87,000,000. In 1860 the amount had doubled. In 1870 it was $354,483,587. By 1900, without a check, it is safe to say this property will reach a sum exceeding $3,000,000,000. So vast a sum, receiving all the protection and benefits of government, without bearing its portion and expenses of the same, will not be looked upon acquiescently by those who have to pay the taxes. In a growing country, where real estate enhances so rapidly with time as in the United States, there is scarcely a limit to the wealth that may be acquired by corporations, religious or otherwise, if allowed to retain real estate without taxation. The contemplation of so vast a property as here alluded to, without taxation, may lead to sequestration without constitutional authority, and through blood. I would suggest the taxation of all property equally.”

President Garfield put on record a similar voice of warning. In Congress, June 22, 1874, he said: “The divorce between Church and State ought to absolute. It ought to be so absolute that no church property anywhere, in any State, or in the nation, should be exempt from equal taxation; for if you exempt the property of any church organization, to that extent you impose a tax upon the whole community.”

The *Christian at Work* says:—

> “The governor of Ceylon, Sir Arthur Gordon, has shocked the sensibilities of many religious—or shall we say sectarian?—people of India by approving a measure which gives government money to Buddhist priests; and it is said the matter is to be brought before Parliament. Buddhism is more an ethical system than a religion, and the overwhelming mass of the Cingalese are adherents of the doctrines of Buddha. The Protestants number some 30,000, and the Roman Catholics, 250,000. Under the circumstances, it would be best that each body of religionists should support its own priest or clergy. If the people of Ceylon are taxed for the support of any one religion, they should in equity be taxed for the support of all.”

Would it not be best under any circumstances that 44 each body of religionists should support its own priest or clergy”? Would not the evils of a State establishment of religion be even greater with three established churches than with only one? And if taxing Roman Catholics and Protestants for the support of Buddhism is an injustice, would it not be equally unjust to tax for church purposes any who stood aloof from all of the established churches?

The trouble is that State establishments of religion are both corrupting and unjust. Be the minority who stand aloof from the established religion or religions ever so small, their rights are just as sacred as are the rights of the majority, and if it is wrong to tax the whole people for the support of a religion held by only four-fifths of them, it is just as wrong to tax them for that purpose, even though the majority constitute nine hundred and ninety-nine ten-thousandths of the whole population. [375-376]

Note.—No papers are sent by the publishers of the American Sentinel to people who have not subscribed for it. If the Sentinel comes to one who has not subscribed for it, he may know that it is sent him by some friend, and that he will not be called upon by the publishers to pay for the same.

In his pastoral letter before the centennial celebration Catholicism in America lately held, Cardinal Gibbons said that the Catholic population of the United States is “about nine millions.” This we refer to the American Sabbath Union; they can enlarge their petition for a national Sunday law by two millions, in less than a minute, if they still continue that business in the same old way.

The New York *Independent* says that Dwight L. Moody believes in prohibition but not in the third-party prohibition, and then adds that “this is another testimony of the large common sense attributed to the great evangelist,” to which we add our hearty assent. We hope that all such persons will remain thus sensible to the last. As great an evil as the liquor traffic is, it is not so great as would be a system in which the principles of the third-party Prohibition party should dominate.

Our good National Reform friend, Rev. N. R. Johnston, does us the kindness to announce to the readers of the *Christian Statesman* that the American Sentinel is to be moved to New York City as the place of publication. When the Sentinel reaches New York City, Jan. 1, 1890, and thenceforward, we shall show our appreciation of Mr. Johnston’s kindness by making the columns of the Sentinel as interesting as possible to the readers of the *Christian Statesman.* And being then so much nearer to the seat of the *Statesman, *we hope to make these things proportionately interesting and profitable both to the *Statesman* and its readers.

The *Christian Nation* says: “This nation can never become a Christian nation in any true sense of the word until the men who carry on the government are honest and trustworthy.” We do not believe that the men who carry on the government are either dishonest or untrustworthy. We believe that the men who carry on the government are as honest and trustworthy as the men who carry on private enterprises. It must be so, because the men who carry on the government are chosen from the people, that is, from among those who carry on private enterprises; and we do not believe that those who are so chosen necessarily become dishonest and untrustworthy by the fact of being called to carry on the government. But even though they were all dishonest and untrustworthy, as the *Christian Nation* argues, it would still remain true that the principles of the *Christian Nation* and its party are utterly false and untrustworthy, because an amendment to the Constitution declaring that this is a Christian nation would not make the men who carry on the government either honest or trustworthy. Men cannot be made honest and virtuous by law. Nothing but the gospel of Christ can accomplish that, and the merits of the gospel are not made available by political methods.

The Woman’s Christian Temperance Union still goes on with its idea of a theocracy in this land. It sets forth now that God is the proprietor of all the land in this country; that he “intended the land for the people;” and indorses “the movement for restoring to the people their divinely intended heritage in the land.” But it is only the Lord’s people who inherit the Lord’s land. Then if the Lord is the proprietor of all the land, all who have a share in it will have to be the Lord’s people. To make this a fact, however, presents no difficulty in the case, for do they not intend to have a constitutional amendment declaring that this is a Christian nation and the kingdom of God?

In the latter part of October the leaders of the Catholic, Methodist, and Lutheran Churches of Jasper, Dubois Co., Ky., banded together and presented a petition to the town authorities to enact a Sunday law for that place. Accordingly, the authorities adopted an ordinance requiring all the saloons, confectioneries, and bakeries in the place to remain closed on Sunday. This was not according to the wish of the majority of the citizens of that place, and they resented the action by staying away from church. As a consequence, for three successive Sundays the congregations were exceedingly slim. In fact, the report says that the preachers were compelled to talk to empty benches. Before the fourth Sunday came around that Sunday law was repealed. Query: Did those leaders of the churches have anything to do with that repeal? Echo answers, *Didn’t* they?

In his speech everywhere for the last six months the secretary of the American Sabbath Union has spent a goodly portion of his time in denouncing Seventh-day Adventists as the chiefest opponents of the national Sunday law for which he is working. Now it is a fact that at the Washington City Convention of the American Sabbath Union last December, and at the hearing before the Senate Committee at the same time, the Seventh-day Adventists were not referred to by a single word in naming the opponents of the Sunday law. So far as any of the statements of the union went on either of the occasions referred to, nobody could suspect even the existence of any such people, and yet within six months from that time they are everywhere denounced as the chiefest opponents of the Sunday bill. Now did these Seventh-day Adventists come up, like Jonah’s gourd, “in a night”? Did they all spring into existence since December 13, 1888? or did the American Sabbath Union intentionally ignore them at the Washington Convention and at the hearing before the Senate Committee? Will the union tell how this is?

The *Union Signal* of October 24 complains because the South American delegates to the congress of American powers- spent four days in Chicago and didn’t visit Evanston, and “the home of Miss Willard,” to “look upon her home, and herself, then carry the story to the women of their home land.” Yes, what a wonderful story it would have been if these delegates could only go back to their home-land and report that they had seen a woman and the house that she lives in. It is altogether likely that every one of them would have been promoted to the very highest honers in the gift of their several States. This no doubt was the supreme moment in the tide of their affairs, which, taken at the flood, would have led on to fortune. But woe worth the day that they should be so lost to all sense of the importance of opportunity as to miss the critical moment and so be left high and dry, stranded, amid the wrecks of time, an awful warning, etc., etc. ! ! It is barely possible, however, that the gentlemen referred to have not yet joined the Mutual Admiration Society to which the *Union Signal* belongs.

A leading Catholic paper notices the fact that the tables have been turned in Boston upon the matter of text-books. It seems that now Protestants are dissatisfied with a school history which they think is unfair. It would certainly be a relief, not only to Boston but to the people at large, if the good folks of that city could only agree among themselves to run their public schools upon a proper basis, that is, to teach the arts and sciences alone, and leave special religious instruction for the private schools, for the church, and for the home. Religion has no business with the public schools, because when once admitted somebody must decide what religion shall be taught. Then there is trouble.

We object to the teaching of religion in the public schools, not because religion is not a good thing, neither because it is not a necessary thing, but because it is not necessary that it should be taught in the public, schools, and because from the very nature of the case it cannot be so taught. In the first place, before any religion can be taught it must be embodied in a creed. That creed will of course reflect the opinions of the majority. But while majority rule (not majority creed) is the correct principle, that which the majority decrees is not always right, it is not always justice. Many examples of this might be cited. Majorities have no right to interfere where God has left man free. Every man has certain inalienable rights; among them are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. To interfere with a man’s religion is to deprive him of these rights. God has set before men light and darkness, life and death, and has left them free to choose. It is not for others to say what they shall choose, and every parent has a right to say in what religion his children shall be instructed. Therefore it is not the province of the State to teach religion, neither indeed can it be. [377]
