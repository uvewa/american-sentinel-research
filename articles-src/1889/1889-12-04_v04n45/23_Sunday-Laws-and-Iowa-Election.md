According to Ex-Governor Sherman, of Iowa, Sunday laws contributed to the result of the late election in that State. Of course the liquor men are fast to claim that the anti-prohibition sentiment did it, but after mentioning other causes, the ex-governor is reported to have said:—

> "Many liberal-minded American-born citizens voted the Democratic ticket in resentment of their liberties by the enactment of stringent Sunday laws."

For the present politicians in Iowa and Ohio will be a little shy of religious legislation, even as they have been in California since 1882, when General Stoneman was elected governor of the State on the anti-Sunday-law issue.
