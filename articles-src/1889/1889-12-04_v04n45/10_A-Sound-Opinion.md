# A Sound Opinion.

The Atlanta *Constitution* of Nov. 22, 1889, gives an account of a divorce case in Texas involving the question of religious liberty. The petitioner for the divorce set forth as the ground of his petition that a band of religionists calling themselves 44 sanctificationists” held, among other things, that it was sinful for a female sanctificationist to live with a husband that did not believe in the doctrine of sanctification; that his wife had become a sanctificationist; and thus a “destroyer had crept into his home and made desolate all that was once happy.” It seems that the case was presented to a jury, and the jury granted a decree of divorce. The wife appealed the case to the Supreme Court. There the decree was promptly set aside. The court gave the following reason for its decision:—

> “In view of the constitutional provision securing to 4 all men the right to worship almighty God according to the dictates of their own conscience,’ and asserting that ‘no human authority ought in any case whatever to control or interfere with the rights of conscience in matters of religion,’ we do not think that the question as to the doctrines or practices of the sanctificationists ought to have been permitted to enter to any extent into the trial.

> “It was defendant’s right to have any religious belief, or none, as best suited her. If her conduct as a wife was such as to furnish her husband grounds for divorce, the acts themselves would be the only proper subjects to investigate, without any regard to the religious connections which led to them. If her conduct was blameless it was useless to allege and prove that her religious connections inculcated evil views and practices.”
That decision is sound. The distinction made between actions and religious profession is clear and distinct. This is the genuine American doctrine. We wish all the courts in the country would see this question in as clear a view as did the Texas Supreme Court in this case.

The editor of the New York *Journal of Commerce,* a professed Protestant, has gone over to the Catholic view of the public-school question. In a recent editorial he says:—

> “If we are asked whether we favor the appropriation of the public money to such sectarian schools, we answer with a decided negative. But we do say that if a Romanist is taxed to support a school which is a stench in his nostrils, and the godless character of which is essential to the fairness of the system, then he is justly entitled to a proportion of the fund thus raised for the school, which, by all that he holds sacred, he is compelled to patronize. The common school outgrew its usefulness, and its right to exist at the public expense, at the moment it ceased to give the young committed to it a training in the fear of God.”

This is strange language. If it does not mean the appropriation of money for sectarian schools it certainly means the destruction of the commonschool system, but it does mean the division of the school fund; it can mean nothing short of it. It has been explained many times why the public schools cannot teach religion, and indeed it would not be necessary for the public schools to teach religion if it were taught in the church, the home, and the Sabbath-school, as it was taught within the memory of men now in the prime of life. The trouble is not in the schools but in the homes and in the churches. Many have the form of godliness but deny the power thereof, and having itching ears they are heaping to themselves religious teachers after their own lusts, and because their pernicious example, and the wishy-washy teachings of the modern pulpit, react on their own children, they want the State to step in and make them Christians by law.

The decline of morals is not confined to our own country, nor is it confined to those governments that exclude religion from the public schools. Germany supports a system of public schools; and in these religious training is made a prominent feature, and yet in that country infidelity is more prevalent than in any other country, with the possible exception of France. Rationalism abounds, and Christianity has degenerated for the most part to the merest form. Even if logic fails to convince the advocates of religious teaching in the public schools that it is not a panacea for infidelity, the strong logic of the naked facts will in time demonstrate so plainly that none can fail to see the point. A knowledge of Christianity cannot be communicated to the student as can the science of mathematics or a knowledge of the languages.

The *Lever* is the leading third-party prohibition paper in the West, and one of the two leading third-party prohibition papers in the United States. It is one of the leading papers of a party which passes as the repository of the morality, purity, and gentleness that are to regenerate and save this nation. From the editorial columns of the *Lever* of October 24, 1889, we have clipped the following, entitled, 44 How Can Ye Escape?” and printed it hereas it was printed there:—

> “A prominent member of a South Side Methodist Church is such an intense Republican that he abhors the word 4 anti-saloon.’ A few days ago he refused to sign a petition for Sabbath observance. Shades of John Wesley! Such hatred for Prohibitionists that he is willing to defend the saloon. Shame on such church members, and what a pity that there are thousands of them. What does the Bible say of such men? Hear Christ:—

> “‘For they [the politicians] bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay them [license laws] on men’s shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers.’
> “‘Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay tithe of mint and anise, and cummin, and have omitted the *weightier* matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith: These ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.’
> “‘Ye blind guides, which strain at a gnat and swallow a camel! ’
> “‘Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees *[Republicans and Democrats’],* hypocrites! for ye are like unto whited sepulchers [*high license saloons*] which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men’s *[drunkards’]* bones, and of all uncleanness.’
> “‘Wherefore ye [Sioux City, Jackson, Miss., and Greenville, O.] be ye witnesses unto yourselves, that ye are the children of them which killed the prophets.’
> “‘Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye escape the damnation of hell?’”
We rest perfectly assured that none of the organs of either of the political parties mentioned by the *Lever* have yet descended so low as this extract shows the *Lever* to be. Whenever any of them do so, it will certainly be time for the rise of a third party; and it will just as certainly be necessary that it shall be a party of better political principles than is the third-partyProhibition party, and its organs will have to show more re- spect for the Scriptures and for man, to be worthy the respect of men.
