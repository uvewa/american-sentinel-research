> "The Sunday-law cranks of Boston," says a New York paper, "have been snubbed by another judicial opinion. In a case brought to test the legality of towing on Sunday, Judge Thompson, in the Superior Court, held 'that vessels coming to the port of Boston have a right to come to docks on Sunday, and that it is a work of necessity to bring the vessel in whether by the sailors on board or by those in another boat towing her.' The prosecution was instituted by religious fanatics of the Elliott Shepard kind."
