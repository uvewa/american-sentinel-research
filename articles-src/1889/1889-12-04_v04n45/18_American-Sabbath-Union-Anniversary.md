The first aniversary of the American Sabbath Union will be held in New York City from December 9 to 11. From its deliberations may be expected to go forth a grand raid on Congress for Sunday legislation, encouraged by the decision of the late Catholic congress at Baltimore to join anti-Catholics in the Sunday crusade.
