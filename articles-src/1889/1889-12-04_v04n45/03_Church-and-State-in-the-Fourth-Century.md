M. A. G. says we are in the fog. We request him to read Luke 6: 41, 42. After these statements it is astonishing to hear him say, "We protest as strongly as anyone against the union of Church and State." But what does he mean by a union of Church and State? It is a union "between the State and some particular organized church or denomination." This *kind* of a union of Church and State we never expect to see. Was the Church united to the State in the days of Constantine?—All will admit that it was. How was it done?—A council was called to decide what were the principles of the Christian religion common to all. These were enforced by law. The very same thing in substance and principle is proposed by Senator Blair and formulated in the joint resolution S. R. 86, proposing an amendment of the Constitution of the United States respecting establishments of religious and free public schools, introduced into Congress May 25, 1888. The National Reformers favor this amendment. Hence they favor a repetition of the same thing done in the fourth century, or the same *kind* of a union of Church and State made at that time. The church is the body of Christ. Col. 1:18. The members of the church are members of his body. 1 Cor. 6:15; Eph. 5:29, 30. Those who have the *religion* of Christ form the church of Christ, and for Senator Blair to propose legislation enforcing the teaching of the "principles of the Christian *religion"* is to propose a union of the Christian *Church* with the State; and for the National Reformers to favor that amendment is to favor a union of Church and State—IF., *in Prohibition Journal.*
