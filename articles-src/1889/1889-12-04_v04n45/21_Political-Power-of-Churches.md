In his annual report Governor Thomas, of Utah, says:—

> "I do not hesitate to say that any temporizing policy which leaves the 'church ' in a position to control the political policy of the Territory is only delaying the final settlement, and that future legislation should be aimed at the political power of the church, which has been the main pillar of its strength in Utah."

And political power will make any church dangerous to a free State. We do not mean by this that Christians can take no part in the affairs of government, or that men should not act conscientiously in political matters, but simply that churches and ministers have no right to meddle with politics as churches and ministers. An intriguing, wire-pulling, scheming, political church of any great numerical strength is a curse to any country.
