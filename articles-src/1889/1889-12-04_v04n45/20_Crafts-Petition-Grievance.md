The field secretary of the so-called American Sabbath Union has a new grievance against the friends of the Sentinel. It is that "they circulate a petition which gives no hint that it is in the interests of the *Saturday Sabbath."* And pray why should it give any such hint when it has no more to do with the "Saturday Sabbath" than it has with any other day? Does the worthy secretary discover something in that petition which is not stated upon its face? How in the world can it be in the interests of the "Saturday Sabbath" if it gives no hint of it? Surely Mr. Crafts is getting a little "rattled" because of opposition to his pet scheme for national religious legislation.
