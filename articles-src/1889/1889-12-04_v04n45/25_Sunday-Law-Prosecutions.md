In an impassioned plea for a Sunday law a correspondent of the Riverside, Cal., *Press* says:

> "No human Sabbath legislation deals with a citizen's private life. Until he does that which interferes with the comfort, peace, happiness, or prosperity of another, no human hand can touch him."

Let us examine this statement a little and see what it is worth. We happen to have before us reports of over twenty cases of Sunday-law prosecutions and convictions in Arkansas, and in almost every case the only offense committed was doing some quiet work, such as plowing in a field, digging a few potatoes for dinner, hoeing in the garden, painting a building, gathering peaches, etc., etc. Possibly these things do not belong to private life, but if they don't we would like to know what does.

Only recently the papers have reported similar cases from Georgia and Tennessee. In the former State one man was fined $25 and costs, amounting in all to $46, for cutting some stove-wood on Sunday; while another man was sent to the chain-gang for a year, for digging a ditch on Sunday to drain the water out of his cellar. In this case a so-called minister of the gospel was the complaining witness. Only a few months ago a man in Massachusetts was arrested and fined for hauling a load of hay on Sunday to save it from a threatened rain.

These are only a few of many cases, not properly of prosecution for violation of law, but of persecution for conscience' sake, for the real offense of most of these men was not in working on Sunday (for others in the same neighborhood who work habitually on that day were not molested), but in not working upon the preceding day. They were, with two or three exceptions, Seventh-day Baptists and Seventh-day Adventists, and their real offense was daring to differ from their neighbors in faith and practice. And yet of a law which makes such things possible, the correspondent of the *Press* before referred to says, "It is not a 'religious ordinance,' but a civil one, inasmuch as it deals alone with the *civil* Sabbath or 'rest-day.'" We are sick and tired of such twaddle. When shall we hear the last of it?
