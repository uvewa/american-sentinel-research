# Will They Be Humbugged?

Barnum used to say that no people in the world so much delighted in being humbugged as the Americans. He was in a position to know whereof he spoke, for he had tried it upon nearly all nations. The prophetic accuracy of the assertion will have been realized when the American people allow themselves to be humbugged by the "American Sabbath" idea of the American Sabbath Union. Those who observe the seventh-day "Sabbath of the Lord" have Scripture proof that it was instituted at the close of creation, as a memorial of that event. Those Protestants who maintain the so-called "Christian Sabbath" on the first day of the week, claim tradition that it was instituted by Christ or his apostles at the resurrection, in commemoration thereof; while the Catholics cite the authority of the church for the institution. But of this American Sabbath we have not even a pretended history, either of its origin or its object. We venture the prediction that if the American people allow such an absurdity to gain a legal foothold in the general government, they will find under the delusive mask nothing but the old papal-Puritan Sunday institution in all its pristine hideousness. And we will add a like prediction regarding that other seductive proposition—"a civil Sabbath"—so innocently urged upon Californians by the same American Sabbath Union. "For ways that are dark, and tricks that are vain," these various Sunday-law dodges have no equal in this day and generation.
