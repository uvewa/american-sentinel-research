Notwithstanding representations to the contrary, the American Sentinel is strictly nonpartisan and non-sectarian. Its object and principles are clearly set forth in the prospectus printed at the foot of this page, and it has never turned aside either to set forth the religious opinions of its editors or to attack the opinions of others, farther than has been necessary in defending the Constitution as it is, so far as regards religion or religious tests, against the attacks of those who are seeking to have it changed in the interests of their sectarian schemes. The editors of the Sentinel have decided opinions upon all religious questions, but that fact does not make the paper a denominational organ, as everybody of intelligence who is acquainted with the paper knows, and every fair- minded man who has read it must admit. Representations to the contrary are falsehoods set afloat for the purpose of exciting prejudice by those who find themselves unable to answer the Sentinel's arguments.
