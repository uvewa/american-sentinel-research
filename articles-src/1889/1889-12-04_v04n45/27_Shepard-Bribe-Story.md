The story has been telegraphed from New York and published in some of the daily papers, that Col. Elliott F. Shepard, of the New York *Mail and Express,* offered some years ago to bribe the sultan of Turkey for $1,000,000 to turn Christian. The story is scarcely credible, and yet the idea is no more absurd than is the National-Reform-American-Sabbath-Union scheme of making men moral and the country Christian by civil law.
