# Is It for the Workingmen?

If anyone doubts that the advocates of Sunday law are actuated primarily, yea, almost solely, by a zeal to secure a day of rest for workingmen, let them read the following preamble and resolutions adopted not long since by a Methodist conference in Wisconsin. It is true that no mention is made of the "civil aspect of the day," and that it is treated as a wholly religious question, but this is easily accounted for by the fact that those who framed the resolutions had not been properly educated in American Sabbath Union tactics. The preamble and resolutions, which were adopted without debate, are as follows:—

> "We are pained to notice that there has been a growing disregard for its observance and sacredness, which we believe is largely occasioned by foreign immigration, the avarice of large corporations, and the insatiable desire of the people for amusement and pleasure.

> "If something is not done immediately, we fear that a continental Sabbath, with all its evils, will be the result. Its sacred observance is demanded by the laws of our land, and no law should be allowed to be broken with impunity, especially one which is so intimately connected with the well-being of our people. Thus the laws of our land, as well as the laws of God, are being violated by the publication of the Sunday newspaper, the running of Sunday trains, Sunday excursions, picnics, base-ball games, opening of saloons and beer-gardens on the Lord's day, with many other things, which are only winked at by many of our city authorities, who are more desirous of reelection than they are to see our laws enforced. Finally, it is a source of alarm to us that our government sets an example in violating the sanctity of the Sabbath by requiring that post-offices be opened for the delivery of mail, thus keeping an army of workmen from enjoying their God-given rights; therefore,
> *Resolved,* That, as ministers of this Conference, we will discountenance any violation of the sacredness of this day, by example as well as by precept, and we will aid to the extent of our ability all those who are striving to have righteous laws enacted for its proper observance, and who are also seeking to have these laws enforced which are already upon the statute- book.
> *Resolved,* That the publication of a Sunday newspaper is becoming a great factor in the destruction of the sacredness of this day, and that we will show our disapproval of this growing evil by neither reading nor advertising in those papers which publish a Sunday edition.
> *Resolved,* That, as a church, we disapprove of the course of our government in requiring the distribution of the mail on the Sabbath-day, and that we will do all in our power to have this evil removed.
> *Resolved,* That the open saloon and theater, picnics, excursions, and base-ball games, are violations of the sanctity of the Sabbath, and as such Christian people should be united in their efforts to have them removed from our midst.
