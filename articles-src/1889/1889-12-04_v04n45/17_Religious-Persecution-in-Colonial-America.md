Daniel Dougherty, in his address at the Baltimore centennial, said that in colonial times "the only religious martyrs in America were Catholics. They were spurned, slandered, villified, and the highest honors of the republic denied them by a prejudice as strong as a constitutional enactment." It is true that the Puritan governors of Massachusetts, Belcher and Endicott, persecuted the Catholics, but the Puritans persecuted the Quakers even to the extent of hanging some of them. Anne Hutchinson and Mary Dyer were persecuted by the Puritans; Roger Williams was driven into exile, and Corey was pressed to death by the Puritans for refusing to testify. There was nothing done to the Catholics in colonial days that was worse than these cruelties. In later times a Catholic religious asylum was burned by a mob in Charleston, Mass.—a foul deed but not worse than the sacking of the home for colored children by the Catholic mob during the draft and riots of 1863. The truth is that the bigotry, ignorance, and brutality in America have not been confined either to Protestant or Catholic circles. Abner Kneeland was mobbed and jailed in Boston for editing a deistical newspaper; Garrison was mobbed for publishing an anti-slavery journal. Both in Europe and America bigotry, brutality, superstition, and ignorance have committed awful crimes, and neither the Protestant nor Catholic Church -can show clean hands in this respect. Where power and opportunity have been present persecution has done its work in both churches.—*Oregonian.*
