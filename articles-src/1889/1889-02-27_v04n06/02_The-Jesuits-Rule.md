The Jesuits rule. In the new Catholic University of Montreal, the Jesuits have two colleges which they wish to have remain independent of university control. The bishops were determined that these colleges should be dependent on the university. Appeal was made to the Pope, and his decision is that the Jesuits' colleges are to retain their independence, but to give no higher degree than Bachelor of Philosophy. In all such contests the society founded by Ignatius Loyola always wins. Few indeed know the influence it is exerting in the politics of nations as well as in the Roman Church.
