# An Analogy.

The *Christian Oracle,* published at Chicago, says:—

> "There is no reason why the Bible itself should be put out of the public schools. It is the word of God, and any church that objects to the reading of God's word in the public school, or anywhere else, by this objection makes a full and free acknowledgement that they have apostatized from the true faith, and are following tradition rather than revelation."

Not quite so fast. There is such a thing as a desire that other men should have the liberty of choice for themselves. Let us illustrate by a parable. My friend and I both like graham bread. We find that quite a number of our neighbors, perhaps a majority, like graham bread too. My friend says: "Now let us get a law passed that everybody shall eat graham bread." I object. I say, "Let every man choose for himself what he will eat." And then my friend says: "There is no reason why graham bread should not be eaten by everybody. It is good food; and anybody who objects to having people compelled by law to eat good, wholesome food, [43] like graham bread, thereby makes an acknowledgment that he eats nothing but worthless trash."

Can you not see the point? Because I am not willing to catch my neighbor and force him to eat graham bread against his will, is that any evidence that I myself do not like such food? Not at all. I think all men ought to eat that which is good, and I may try to show them by precept and example what is the most healthful diet, but I have no right to say that because I know it is good, and I like it, therefore somebody else who does not know that it is good, and who, as a consequence does not like it, shall be forced to eat it.

Now just as my appetite can be no criterion for him, so I may not substitute my conscience for his. The fact that I object to having my neighbor forced to listen to the reading of that which he does not like, is no evidence that I do not like it. The Bible stands for liberty. It calls men to liberty. And the forcing of men to listen to it, will work the very thing that it is designed to prevent; for if men do not like the Bible, the surest way to confirm their dislike is by forcing them to listen to it. The Bible says: "Whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely." When men, in their blind zeal for the gospel, become wise above that which is written, and think that men can be made Christians by law, when the Bible says it is only by the persuasion of love, they do the Bible more injury than do the defamers of that book.
