# What’s the Matter With Milk?

At the Oakland Sunday-Law meeting the usual plea of a “sanitary arrangement” was made. This Sunday law is a thing absolutely necessary for the health of the people. In his speech, Dr. Briggs took occasion to tell how to get the full benefit of this sanitary arrangement. One very essential thing was, not to allow the milkman to deliver any milk on Sunday. Now we have given some study to sanitary matters, and we cannot see how receiving into the house and eating milk on Sunday is of serious detriment to anybody’s health, providing, of course, the milk is not too thin. Why is milk that is good on six days in the week so intensely deleterious on Sunday? This is a problem for scientists.

But hold! we remember that this proposed Sunday law is solely in the interest of temperance. All they want to do is to close the saloons, so that the good people can have a chance to rest and worship “according to the dictates of their own consciences.” Now we have two explanations, either one of which may fit the case. They are afraid that when the saloons have been closed up, the saloon men will bribe the milkmen to mix a little whisky with their milk, or else to deliver whisky and beer to certain houses, under pretense of leaving milk. Very far-sighted, these temperance workers are, to be sure. We congratulate them on their sagacity.

But possibly they have found that milk is a very harmful beverage. You know that some milk *is* bad, and when milk is bad it is like the little girl that Mother Goose tells about, “it is horrid,” and very dangerous to health. Now these clerical guardians of the public health have discovered this, and are determined to allow the people to be exposed no longer. So just as they will close the saloons on Sunday, in the interest of temperance, they will stop the sale of milk on Sunday, in the interest of health. “But if the milk is so bad that it is positively dangerous, why not prohibit the sale of it altogether?” asks one. Simple soul, can’t you see that when the people are idle they are much more susceptible to disease than they are when they are at work? When people are at work they can throw off the evil effects; but on Sunday, when they are idle, the milk can get in its deadly work unhindered. What a wonder that the country has not been depopulated through eating milk on Sunday!

Friends, do you believe a word of the statement, that the proposed Sunday law is to be only a sanitary arrangement? We don’t believe that you do. We don’t believe that anybody does, not even the men who say so. No one can believe such a palpable absurdity. Well, then, stop and ask yourself if there must not be some inherent wickedness in a scheme which compels its promoters to resort to such flimsy excuses?

There are many who do not seem to be sensible that all violence in religion is irreligious, and that, whoever is wrong, the persecutor cannot be right.”—*Thomas Clarke. *[47-48]

It is not toleration which is established in our system, but religious equality.—*Judge Cooley.*

> “Human tribunals for the consciences of men, are impious encroachments upon the prerogatives of God.”

Secular power has proved a Satanic gift to the church, and ecclesiestical power has proved an engine of tyranny in the hands of the State. *—Dr, Schaff, in Church and State in the U, S., p. 11.*

The proper object of government is to protect all persons in the enjoyment of- their religious as well as civil rights, and not to determine for any whether they shall esteem one day above another, or esteem all days alike holy.—*Hon, Richard M. Johnson, 1828.*

The Wellsboro (Penn.) *Republican Advocate, *of January 30, contains a column article which gives a very fair view of the work of the National Reform Association, and the editor says of it: “This subject is well worth discussion, and the columns of the *Republican Advocate* are open to communications for or against the Amendment.” We are glad to see this matter agitated; it is fast becoming the leading question of the day.

The president of the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union of Reading, Pa., has issued an appeal to the pastors and churches of that city, asking them all to co-operate in a Sunday crusade. She says: “Can we pray, Thy kingdom come, and not lift our arm to strike at the wrong?” which shows again that the effort to enact and enforce Sunday laws is simply the outcome of the National Reform idea that men are to act as the vicegerents of Christ in establishing his kingdom.

The Oakland *Herald of Truth* (Baptist) has this to say on the matter of Sunday laws:—

> “So far as the legal Sabbath is concerned, in California or elsewhere, for *purposes of worship, *we are afraid that no restriction of law will ever meet the case. If one law passes in the name of religion, another one may pass. If Protestants and Roman Catholics join hands for protection in one case *religiously, a* bad religious precedent may exist, from which the untrammeled conscience of the Protestant world sometime may wish it was historically free.”

Of all people in the world, the Baptists ought to be opposed to any attempt to legislate on religious subjects.

The Rev. W. F. Crafts is nothing if not a politician. The Baltimore *Sun* of January 16, has the following, which shows his activity:—

> “The Rev. Wilbur F. Crafts, field secretary of the American Sabbath Union, came to Baltimore yesterday, was the guest of Prof. Richard T. Ely, of the Johns Hopkins University, at dinner, called to see Cardinal Gibbons in the afternoon, presided at an informal meeting of Baltimore preachers at the Y. M. C. A. hall, and was the guest of the Rev. Dr. Frank M, Ellis, pastor of the Eutaw Place Baptist Church, and vice-president of the Association for Maryland, in the evening. The Rev. Mr. Crafts is in Baltimore in the interest of the Sunday-Rest bill, now before Congress, and at the meeting of the preachers in the evening urged them to use all the means in their power to have the bill passed and made a law.”

The English Lord Stanhope, in a speech in the House of Lords in 1827, on the Bill for the Repeal of the Test and Corporation Acts, said: “The time was, when toleration was craved by dissenters as a boon; it is now demanded as right; but a time will come when it will be spurned as an insult.”

*What other nations call religious toleration, we call religious rights, They are not exe**rcised in virtue of governmental indulgence, but as rights, of which government cannot deprive any portion of citizens, however small. Despotic power may invade those rights, but justice still confirms them.—Report of Senate Committee on Post-offices and Post-roads, 1828.*

There is a very great difference between toleration and liberty. Toleration is a concession which may be withdrawn; it implies a preference for the ruling form of faith and worship, and a practical disapproval of all other forms. It may be coupled with many restrictions and disabilities. We tolerate what* we dislike, but cannot alter; we tolerate even a nuisance, if we must. Acts of toleration are wrung from a government by the force of circumstances and the power of a minority too strong to be disregarded.—*Dr, Philip Schaff.*

The Leavenworth (Kansas) *Standard* speaks of petitions that are being circulated in that city, asking Congress not to pass any bill in regard to the observance of the Sabbath or any other religious or ecclesiastical institution or rite, etc., and says:—

> “Senator Blair’s Sunday-Law bill, which has passed to a third reading in the Senate, prohibits railway trains, the mails, labor, games, military parades or inspection, and pretty much everything else that people care to do on Sunday, except go to church. The object of the petition is to defeat the passage of this and other similar measures, and to prevent insane fanaticism from destroying the work of Washington, Jefferson, and the other fathers of the Republic.”

The *Standard* has taken the measure of the bill very accurately. We are glad of this, for only those who know what would be the result of its passage can successfully oppose it.
