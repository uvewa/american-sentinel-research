The Oakland *Herald of Truth* (Baptist) has this to say on the matter of Sunday laws:—

> "So far as the legal Sabbath is concerned, in California or elsewhere, for *purposes of worship, *we are afraid that no restriction of law will ever meet the case. If one law passes in the name of religion, another one may pass. If Protestants and Roman Catholics join hands for protection in one case *religiously, a* bad religious precedent may exist, from which the untrammeled conscience of the Protestant world sometime may wish it was historically free."

Of all people in the world, the Baptists ought to be opposed to any attempt to legislate on religious subjects.
