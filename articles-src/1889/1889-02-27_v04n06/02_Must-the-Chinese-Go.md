# Must the Chinese Go?

It is worthy of note and remembrance, that the National Reformers are the ones who profess to be the greatest friends of the Chinese, and who the most loudly denounce all attempts to limit Chinese immigration. Yet Dennis Kearney and his sand-lot party never more surely raised the cry, “the Chinese must go,” than do these same National Reforners. If their movement should succeed, the Chinamen now here would almost all have to leave. It is well known that they are heathen, and that they know of no such thing as a sacred day. Every day in the week they may be found at work; and it is not to be supposed that they would take kindly to the “Meli- can man’s” new way of evangelization. The National Reformers would virtually say to them: “We are Christians, and you are heathens, and consequently you cannot live in the same country with us.” If you think that this is an uncharitable conclusion, read the following from the *Christian Statesman* of May 21, 1885, spoken by E. B. Graham, one of the vice-presidents of the National Reform Association:—

> “If the opponents of the Bible do not like our government and its Christian features, let them go to some wild, desolate land, and in the name of the devil, and for the sake of the devil, subdue it, and set up a government of their own on infidel and atheistic ideas; and then, if they can stand it, stay there till they die.”

That is National Reform gospel. Let Kearney rave as much as he pleases; the National Reformers can give him points on how to drive out the Chinese.
