The Catholic *Monitor* (San Francisco), of January 9, gives a prominent place to an article from the *Irish Catholic World,* written by Bernard O'Reilly, on the restoration of the Papacy, from which we quote the following, which shows how Catholics view the matter:—

> "We speak now not merely to our own countrymen, but to our friends and readers of other lands as well, when we say that, knowing what the authoritative teaching of the pontiff and the church on this point is, it is our bounden duty to manfully resolve to exert ourselves to the utmost limits of our power to secure the speedy and splendid vindication of that teaching. After all, as we said but recently. Catholics are stronger than the Freemasons or Atheists, if we will but join hands in the work before us. What a noble sight it would be to see the Catholics of Germany, of Ireland, of France, of Spain, and of America, demanding the restoration of Papal independence. In this way, truly, Ireland would take her place among the nations, while a great step would be taken towards securing European peace. There is nothing impossible in this. If the Catholic manhood of the Continent, bearing arms as they do, were only in earnest in sustaining such work as this, one week would find missives from every Christian Power, on Signor Cristi's desk, warning him and his master to depart without delay from the eternal city. This is the duty of the hour for Catholic people; Irishmen will be no laggards in discharging their share of it."

When it is remembered that Catholics hold the balance of political influence in nearly every country, such appeals as the above are not to be considered as mere vapor.
