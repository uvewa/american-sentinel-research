The president of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union of Reading, Pa., has issued an appeal to the pastors and churches of that city, asking them all to co-operate in a Sunday crusade. She says: "Can we pray, Thy kingdom come, and not lift our arm to strike at the wrong?" which shows again that the effort to enact and enforce Sunday laws is simply the outcome of the National Reform idea that men are to act as the vicegerents of Christ in establishing his kingdom.
