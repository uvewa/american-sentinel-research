# What's the Matter With Milk?

At the Oakland Sunday-Law meeting the usual plea of a "sanitary arrangement" was made. This Sunday law is a thing absolutely necessary for the health of the people. In his speech, Dr. Briggs took occasion to tell how to get the full benefit of this sanitary arrangement. One very essential thing was, not to allow the milkman to deliver any milk on Sunday. Now we have given some study to sanitary matters, and we cannot see how receiving into the house and eating milk on Sunday is of serious detriment to anybody's health, providing, of course, the milk is not too thin. Why is milk that is good on six days in the week so intensely deleterious on Sunday? This is a problem for scientists.

But hold! we remember that this proposed Sunday law is solely in the interest of temperance. All they want to do is to close the saloons, so that the good people can have a chance to rest and worship "according to the dictates of their own consciences." Now we have two explanations, either one of which may fit the case. They are afraid that when the saloons have been closed up, the saloon men will bribe the milkmen to mix a little whisky with their milk, or else to deliver whisky and beer to certain houses, under pretense of leaving milk. Very far-sighted, these temperance workers are, to be sure. We congratulate them on their sagacity.

But possibly they have found that milk is a very harmful beverage. You know that some milk *is* bad, and when milk is bad it is like the little girl that Mother Goose tells about, "it is horrid," and very dangerous to health. Now these clerical guardians of the public health have discovered this, and are determined to allow the people to be exposed no longer. So just as they will close the saloons on Sunday, in the interest of temperance, they will stop the sale of milk on Sunday, in the interest of health. "But if the milk is so bad that it is positively dangerous, why not prohibit the sale of it altogether?" asks one. Simple soul, can't you see that when the people are idle they are much more susceptible to disease than they are when they are at work? When people are at work they can throw off the evil effects; but on Sunday, when they are idle, the milk can get in its deadly work unhindered. What a wonder that the country has not been depopulated through eating milk on Sunday!

Friends, do you believe a word of the statement, that the proposed Sunday law is to be only a sanitary arrangement? We don't believe that you do. We don't believe that anybody does, not even the men who say so. No one can believe such a palpable absurdity. Well, then, stop and ask yourself if there must not be some inherent wickedness in a scheme which compels its promoters to resort to such flimsy excuses?
