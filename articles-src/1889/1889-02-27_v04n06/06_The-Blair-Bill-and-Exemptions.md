From an otherwise good article in an Eastern paper, in opposition to the so-called National Reform work, we find the following about the Blair Sunday-Rest bill:—

> "This bill makes no exception in favor of the Sabbatarian who religiously and conscientiously observes the seventh day of the week instead of the first day, but provides a penalty that is to be applied if a seventh-day keeper should do any labor on the first day. We think the keeping of a Sabbath is a part of the worship of God, and civil law should go no farther than to grant protection to every soul who labors on any day of the week, provided he does observe *one* day in a religious manner."

We protest. If the keeping of a Sabbath is a part of the worship of God, as it certainly is, then the civil law has no more to do with it than it has to do with the movements of the planets. It is no business of civil government, whether a man observes one day, or two days, or no day at all, in a religious manner. Our objection to the Blair bill is not that it makes no exemptions in favor of seventh-day observers, and we hope that none of them will base their objection on that ground, for if they do they will simply nullify all that they may say against it. He who asks for an exemption clause in a Sunday law, thereby acknowledges the right of the Government to make such laws. He virtually says, "You may oppress the unbeliever all you please, provided you won't disturb me." The American Sentinel believes that the unbeliever has as much claim on Government protection in his unbelief as the believer has for the same protection in his belief. To say that a Sunday law would lead to persecution for conscience sake only if it made no exemption in favor of seventhday people, would be equivalent to saying that the man who observes no Sabbath has no conscience and no rights, which is untrue.
