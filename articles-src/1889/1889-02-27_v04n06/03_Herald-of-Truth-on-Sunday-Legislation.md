Our neighbor, the *Herald of Truth,* speaking of Sunday legislation, says: "We do not look on the restoration of the seventh day as the necessity of the hour, as the *Outlook* and the American Sentinel with great stress plead." Read a little more carefully, Brother Abbott. We cannot speak for the *Outlook,* but we can say that the Sentinel has never pleaded for the restoration of any day. On the contrary, it has from the first been opposed to any attempt to establish any religious custom by law, no matter whether that custom is correct or not. We do this because it is not the province of one man nor any body of men to decide for any other man what is correct in religion. The worst enemies that the Bible and the Christian religion have ever had are those persons who have attempted to force them upon unbelievers. More infidels have been made by those who professed to be Christians than by any other means.
