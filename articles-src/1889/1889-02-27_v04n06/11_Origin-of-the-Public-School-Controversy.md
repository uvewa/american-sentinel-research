# Origin of the Public School Controversy

It is probably not generally known that the Roman Catholics, in asking for a portion of the public school money, are simply following Protestant leading; but such is the case. The following items from the first section of "Romamism versus the Public School System," by Dr. Daniel Dorchester (Methodist), may be of interest to those who have not the book:—

> "Many may be surprised to learn that the first appeal for a division of the public school funds in this country was made by a Protestant denomination, and the first sectarian division actually made was to that body. The other Protestant churches, instead of objecting, attempted to obtain their share of the public funds."

After mentioning the formation of the New York Public School Society, in 1805, the Doctor says:—

> "The first ripple of disturbance in the management of this society, it should be said, came from the Protestant denominations, when the Baptist Bethel Church, in 1823, sought and obtained its share of the public money for its schools. An agitation was awakened, all the steps of which need not now be distinctly traced. ... By the act of the Legislature the question of a division of the funds was to be decided by the Board of the City Corporation. That body appointed a committee to hear the parties to the case. It is remarkable that the Episcopalians, Methodists, Baptists, and Roman Catholics, at that time, sought for a participation in the school fund, just as the Roman Catholics have since done. After the hearing, the committee made a report, which settled the principle for that time, that sectarian schools were not to be sustained or aided from the public money."

Speaking of the controversy that has since been carried on, Dr. Dorchester continues:—

> "It is correctly claimed by intelligent Roman Catholics that this controversy did not begin with them, but with the Baptist Bethel Church, already referred to. They also justly claim that certain influential Protestants, at the opening of this controversy gave them encouragement. Among these the distinguished Rev. Dr. Eliphalet Nott, for a very long period president of Union College, at Schenectady, is cited as one who was open in the advocacy of a denominational school system, by which each denomination would share, in due proportion to its pupils in the schools, in the common school fund."

Whether the Protestants withdrew from their former position because they saw that the Roman Catholic Church would have the lion's share or not, we cannot say. But this we do know, that in a different form they are advocating the same principle to-day. The Blair Educational Amendment Bill will place the public schools of this country, with all the public school money, in the hands, not of any particular sect, but of Protestants and Catholics combined. For that bill is nothing more nor less than an act to promote the union of Church and State.
