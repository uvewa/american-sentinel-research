# Things Not What They Seem.

Speaking of the Sunday-Rest bill, the Leavenworth *Standard* says: “The National Reform Association, representing a million or so of cranks, has a numerous and cunning lobby on the ground, who are using every effort to hurry the bill through.”

There are not so many of them, brother. Don’t you remember General Grant’s story about the wolves in Texas? At the time of the Mexican war, he and a young companion were traveling to join their regiment. Says he, “On the evening of the first day out from Goliad we heard the most unearthly howling of wolves, directly in our front. The prairie grass was tall, and we could not see the beasts, but the sound indicated that they were near. To my ear, it appeared that there must have been enough of them to devour our party, horses and all, at a single meal. The part of Ohio where I hailed from was not thickly settled, but wolves had been driven out long before I left. Benjamin was from Indiana, still less populated, where the wolf yet roamed over the prairies. He understood the nature of the animal, and the capacity of a few to make believe there was an unlimited number of them. He kept on toward the noise unmoved. . . . When he did speak it was to ask: ‘Grant, how many wolves do you think there are in that pack?’ Knowing where he was from, and suspecting that he thought I would overestimate the number, I determined to show my acquaintance with the animal by putting the estimate below what possibly could be correct, and answered, ‘Oh, about twenty,’ very indifferently. He smiled and rode on. In a minute we were close upon them, and before they saw us. There were just *two* of them. Seated upon their haunches, with their mouths close together, they had made all the noise we had been hearing for the past ten minutes.”

That is the way it is with the National Reformers who are pushing the Blair Bills. It seemed as though there were millions of them; but when we got hold of the cold facts about the petitions, in the *Congressional Record,* we found that only a few persons comparatively had been making all the noise. Still this doesn’t warrant the friends of truth and justice in relaxing their efforts. Noise counts for a great deal in this world.
