The Leavenworth (Kansas) *Standard* speaks of petitions that are being circulated in that city, asking Congress not to pass any bill in regard to the observance of the Sabbath or any other religious or ecclesiastical institution or rite, etc., and says:—

> "Senator Blair's Sunday-Law bill, which has passed to a third reading in the Senate, prohibits railway trains, the mails, labor, games, military parades or inspection, and pretty much everything else that people care to do on Sunday, except go to church. The object of the petition is to defeat the passage of this and other similar measures, and to prevent insane fanaticism from destroying the work of Washington, Jefferson, and the other fathers of the Republic."

The *Standard* has taken the measure of the bill very accurately. We are glad of this, for only those who know what would be the result of its passage can successfully oppose it.
