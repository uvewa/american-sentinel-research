The Rev. W. F. Crafts is nothing if not a politician. The Baltimore *Sun* of January 16, has the following, which shows his activity:—

> "The Rev. Wilbur F. Crafts, field secretary of the American Sabbath Union, came to Baltimore yesterday, was the guest of Prof. Richard T. Ely, of the Johns Hopkins University, at dinner, called to see Cardinal Gibbons in the afternoon, presided at an informal meeting of Baltimore preachers at the Y. M. C. A. hall, and was the guest of the Rev. Dr. Frank M, Ellis, pastor of the Eutaw Place Baptist Church, and vice-president of the Association for Maryland, in the evening. The Rev. Mr. Crafts is in Baltimore in the interest of the Sunday-Rest bill, now before Congress, and at the meeting of the preachers in the evening urged them to use all the means in their power to have the bill passed and made a law."
