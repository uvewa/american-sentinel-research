Some of the alleged temperance papers say that the American Sentinel is run in the interest of the saloon. Well, if that is so, there must be something terribly wrong with the ministers of the country, for we are constantly receiving letters from preachers, heartily indorsing our work, and bidding us God speed. But if anybody ever saw anything in the Sentinel that could by any means be construed as favoring saloons, we would pay him well if he would point it out. The trouble is, that the Sentinel has exposed the pretensions of some who are making the temperance cause a cloak for their own political ambition. The Sentinel is run solely in the interest of a government "of the people, by the people, and for the people," and of pure Christianity, unadulterated with worldly scheming.
