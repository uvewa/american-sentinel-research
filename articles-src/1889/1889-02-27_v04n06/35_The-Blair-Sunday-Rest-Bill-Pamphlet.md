# The Blair Sunday Rest Bill.

This is the name of a 56-page pamphlet just issued by the Pacific Press Publishing Company. It is a clear, concise history of the attempts to secure National legislation in regard to Sunday, and especially of the causes which led to the introduction of the Blair bill. The bill is given in full, both in its original form and with the changes desired by the "National Sabbath Association." A brief analysis is also given, and an account of the formation of the "National Sabbath Committee," and Union.

Considerable space is devoted to showing the nature of the bill, and to a consideration of the effect it would have if it should become a law. The means by which the bill has been pushed, and the character of the work, are dwelt on at some length. Altogether the little pamphlet will be found to give a good outline of the rise and progress of the present Sunday agitation, and will afford a good basis from which to study the whole question. Numerous quotations are made, and the exact reference given in every instance, so that every fact stated may be fully verified.

To those who are canvassing for the American Sentinel, or for signatures to petitions in behalf of religious liberty, or are engaged in any branch of anti-National Reform work, this pamphlet will be indispensable.

Everybody who is interested in the matter of Sunday legislation, which is getting to be the great question of the day, should get the book and study it. Friends and enemies of the Blair Sunday-Rest Bill, will alike find it useful in enabling them to understand the exact facts, so that they can argue intelligently upon it.
