We commend to all temperance workers, as well as to those who imagine they are such, but are not, the following words concerning temperance, from a recent letter by Dr. T. L. Cuyler:—

> "After forty years of gratuitous and earnest labor in this blessed cause, I am solemnly convinced that if it was left to the tender mercies of partisan politicians, it would be *assassinated!* God never ordained that conflicts with gigantic sins should be waged with carnal weapons alone, or under the command of Cesar! I am also convinced that if all the time, money, and effort, that have been expended on political movements, had been expended in direct moral efforts to check the drinking usages, and educate the conscience and conduct, and teach to the young lessons of abstinence, and make public sentiment against the diabolical and deadly drink-traffic, then our reform would be a hundredfold stronger to-day."

Now let some National Reformer rise up and accuse Dr. Cuyler of carrying on his work in the interest of the saloons.
