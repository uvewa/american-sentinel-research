The April number of the Chicago Law *Times, *a quarterly journal, will contain an editorial on the Blair Amendment to the Federal Constitution, under the title of "Conspiracy Against the Republic." The editor of the *Law Times* has the thing correctly. The "American Sabbath Union" is a grand conspiracy against religious liberty.
