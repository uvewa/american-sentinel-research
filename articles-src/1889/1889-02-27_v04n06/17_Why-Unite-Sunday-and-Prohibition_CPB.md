# Why Unite Sunday and Prohibition?

A noticeable feature of the present Sunday- Law agitation is the disposition manifested by all its advocates to unite the Sunday and the Temperance questions, or rather to make it appear that they are one and the same question. The following, from a religious paper published in San Francisco, shows how the matter is generally presented:—

> "The demand for the destruction of the Christian sabbath, the poor man's sabbath, his rest day, his lease of life, his hope, is the demand of the saloon and the vile horde born of the saloon. We have put the city and the State in the hands of the worst set that ever cursed the earth; to wit, the conspirators against truth, virtue, and our homes—the remorseless wretches of the saloon business. They are ruining workingmen and destroying their homes. They want no sabbath. Gentlemen, we have a big job on our hands to rescue the people from the thralldom of the saloon! But let us have courage and faith. Pour in petitions for a legal sabbath. Send them to the members of the Legislature whom you may know. We do not wish to interfere with any man's rights, and would not do so under any circumstances; but to protect one day in seven from the accursed greed of corporations and the consuming vices of the saloon, is a patriotic and Christian duty."

The closing words of this quotation are significant, and show plainly that the central thought is not the advancement of temperance reform. It is true that "to protect one day in seven from the accursed greed of corporations and the consuming vices of the saloon, is a patriotic and Christian duty." But why protect only *"one* day in seven from the consuming vices of the saloon"? Is it not "a Christian and patriotic duty to protect" every day from these consuming vices? Why single out Sunday and protect it, while "the remorseless wretches of the saloon business" are allowed to prey upon society "ruining workingmen and destroying their homes" the remaining six days of the week?

Why "pour in petitions for a legal sabbath"? Why not the rather "pour in petitions" for the prohibition of the liquor traffic on all days? And as for "the accursed greed of corporations," if it can be restrained "one day in seven," the same power can restrain it every day in the week. If the movement is simply to secure to workingmen one day in seven from labor, why not ask for a law requiring all employers to allow each employe one full twenty-four-hour holiday each week, and allow the interested parties to arrange between them which day it shall be; or, better still, let each employe choose which of the seven days he will take? This arrangement would meet all physical demands for rest from toil, and is in perfect harmony with the somewhat popular seventh-part-of-time theory.

Such a proposition will however meet with no favor among the advocates of "a legal sabbath," for what they want is not merely that "one day in seven shall be protected," etc., but that Sunday, the first day of the week, the so-called "Christian Sabbath," shall be that day. But why should everybody be required to keep this particular day? Who requires this at our hands? Some people, we suppose, feel it to be a religious duty to observe that day, but many, equally conscientious, think quite differently. Why then should they be compelled to act contrary to their convictions in this matter, any more than in other questions of faith and practice?

Let those who wish to do so keep Sunday, but it is a dangerous thing to give to any church or to any number of churches the power to enforce upon others the practice of any article of their creed.

The law of California—and so far as the writer is aware the same is true in every State— gives ample protection to all religious assemblies, not only on Sunday, but upon every day, and this is right; but what possible difference can it make to A, who chooses to go to meeting on Sunday, if B takes a spade and digs in his garden, or if C hitches up his team and plows in his field? "Oh," you say, "it outrages A's religious sensibilities." But what if it does? Are A's feelings any better than B's or C's feelings? and why protect one man's feelings any more than another's? Is not the very existence of Protestantism a standing outrage on the feelings of every Papist? and are not the feelings of the Pope outraged every day by the knowledge that Protestant worship is conducted almost within the shadow of the Vatican? Certainly; but that is no reason why Protestantism should not exist, or that a Methodist meeting-house should not be tolerated in Rome. The fact is that people have no business to have feelings that would deny to others equal rights with themselves; such feelings are a violation of the golden rule.

Sabbath keeping is purely a matter of religion, and it is no more proper to enforce it by law than it would be to compel men to make a profession of religion, ask a blessing at their tables, or have family prayers. It is a duty that every man owes to God and to his family to do these things; but no one would think of claiming that the State has a right to require him to perform such duties. And so, even were we to grant for a moment that Sunday is the Sabbath, it is clearly not within the province of the State to regulate the keeping of it farther than it does the discharge of other real or supposed religious duties; namely, to protect in the discharge of these duties, all who wish to perform them. Farther than this the Government has no right to go. C. P Bollman
