*What other nations call religious toleration, we call religious rights, They are not exercised in virtue of governmental indulgence, but as rights, of which government cannot deprive any portion of citizens, however small. Despotic power may invade those rights, but justice still confirms them.—Report of Senate Committee on Post-offices and Post-roads, 1828.*
