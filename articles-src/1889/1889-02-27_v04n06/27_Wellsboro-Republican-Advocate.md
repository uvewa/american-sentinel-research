The Wellsboro (Penn.) *Republican Advocate, *of January 30, contains a column article which gives a very fair view of the work of the National Reform Association, and the editor says of it: "This subject is well worth discussion, and the columns of the *Republican Advocate* are open to communications for or against the Amendment." We are glad to see this matter agitated; it is fast becoming the leading question of the day.
