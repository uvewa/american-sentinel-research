# Religious Legislation.

A political convention is to be held. Somebody is to be elected to represent the people in the legislative halls of the State. The convention must decide who shall run in the interest of the party, as a candidate to be voted for at the election. Many men desire the honor and the money that the office would give them. Who shall be the favored man? Much scheming will be necessary to succeed. Opponents must be misrepresented. Several must be bought off. Delegates must be bribed. Cheating in the count, and falsehood in covering it up, must all be resorted to in order to obtain the nomination. After the nominations have been made, then all these sins must be increased ten-fold before the man is elected and legally installed in office.

This manner of procedure is so common all over the country that exceptions rarely occur. In fact, corruption is so nearly universal that honest men dread to enter the race, and for these reasons, the majority of office-holders are political tricksters. But finally the legislative body meets, and after much confusion and ado, they are prepared to begin the responsible work of making, un-making, and re-making laws.

While these men are thus engaged in their work, we will notice what is taking place elsewhere. An ecclesiastical association meet and form a creed. Their neighbors are willing for them to adopt it if they choose to, as it does not interfere with their civil rights. But the makers of the creed are not disposed to brook opposition, and therefore they begin to cast about them to hit upon some scheme by which dissenters may be compelled to conform to the will of the creedmakers. At this juncture a National Reformer proposes to them that as the Legislature is in session, they can have the creed embodied into a bill, and enacted into a law, and thus unanimity of action all over the State will be secured. The creed-makers have the balance of power any way, and why should not their will in the matter become law, and thus confusion be avoided among the people?

Then it flashes upon their minds that these law-makers are God's ministers, ordained of the Lord for this very purpose; and they only wonder why they have been so long in finding this out. Of course these officials have never studied the Scriptures, neither have many of them been converted; but the manner in which they obtained their election has sanctified them for this purpose, and they are therefore eminently qualified to decide upon spiritual matters pertaining to the kingdom of Christ; for have not the National Reformers declared that Christ's kingdom *is* of this world, and that even Israel was a republic, and that the laws were enacted by the seventy who were elected by the people? And if so, do not the princes of this world understand the wisdom of God, even the hidden mystery?

But what says the Apostle Paul about it? He says that it was not God's will that the faith of the church should stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God: "We speak wisdom among them which are perfect, yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world that come to naught: but we speak the* wisdom of God in a mystery. . . which none of the princes of this world knew; for had they known it they would not have crucified the Lord of Glory." See 1 Cor. 2:5-8.

The backslidden church, in the days when the Son of God was on the earth in person, appealed to the princes of this world, who were appointed by Cesar, to have the traditions of the elders enforced upon everyone. These traditions, which made void the commandments of God, were to the elders of more consequence than the life of the Son of God; and, therefore, they caused these Cesar-made officials to believe that unless they crucified Christ, they were not Cesar's friends; and therefore Christ was crucified. Paul, through the Spirit of God, instructs the Church of Christ upon these very points. These Cesar-appointed officials, who crucified the Lord of Glory in person, have often been imitated by earthly rulers in putting Christ to death in the person of his saints.

The very religious Pharisees, by the force of their influence, finally compelled Pilate to give sentence against Jesus. The church, backslidden from God, appealed to Pilate, reminding him that he was not Cesar's friend if he did not condemn Jesus for them. John 19:12. This made Pilate know that these people who were so zealous for their creed would be his political enemies if he did not yield to their demand, and not being scripturally-minded himself he reluctantly gave sentence to the clamor of the multitude. But what faith had he in their religion?

But were not Pilate and his official colleagues to be obeyed civilly? Christ, in his Sermon on the Mount, taught the people to respect these very men. Whenever he was interrogated upon the point of civil obedience, he advised it. But in points of religion, he advised them to "render unto God the things that are God's."

Pilate should have dismissed the assembly, as his wife advised him to do, but the voices of the people and the priests prevailed, and Pilate made the chief mistake of his life by letting himself be influenced to go beyond his jurisdiction—tc interfere in matters purely of a religious character

Whenever the legislative bodies of our country permit themselves to be influenced by the churches to enter the arena of religious legislation, they will be in spirit and kind repeating the history of Pilate in his condemnation of Christ. They should let these things alone, and attend to the kind of matters that relate to Cesar. Wm. Covert.
