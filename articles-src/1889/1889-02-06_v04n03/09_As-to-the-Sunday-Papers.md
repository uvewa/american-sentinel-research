# As to the Sunday Papers.

When the subject of annihilating Sunday papers was under discussion by the preachers day before yesterday, various remedies were proposed. One of them was that the ministers should not print the notices of their services in the Sunday papers—boycott them, in short. That is an old story,—

Said Aaron to Moses, Let’s bite off our noses.

Somehow they always get in. Some deacon or elder, more interested in the business than in the spiritual welfare of the church, and who knows that advertising is the life of all enterprises, [22] comes around, and, explaining that the minister is a little high-strung and old- fashioned in his notions, asks for an insertion of the notice.

Another remedy was that the papers be shown that their financial interests would be promoted by stopping the obnoxious issue. That was tried once in this city. During the early part of 1866 there was a three weeks’ revival meeting in the Methodist Church Block. The evils of Sunday papers were dwelt on. Efforts were made to convert the offenders. It was stated that if any publisher would reform he could be sure of the solid and profitable backing of a great share of the community. One paper tried it. Its sole reward was a large assortment of resolutions, thanks, and prayers. It lost a number of the subscribers it had, and gained no new ones to speak of. It was a victim of what the worldly would call “a confidence game.” After trying it a while it resumed its Sunday issue, and intends to continue its publication indefinitely.—*Chicago Tribune, November 23, 1888.*

The following words of appreciation of the American Sentinel, and of sympathy for its work, are from the bishop of Hayti:—

> “Permit me to say how heartily I agree with you in deploring the movement (characterized, as I believe, with more zeal than knowledge), which seeks to procure Sunday legislation by the Congress of the United States, as the same has begun to take form in the Blair Bill and Amendment to the National Constitution. Such a mixture of political and ecclesiastical functions in society, embodied in this legislation, from my point of view, is nothing less than the Babylonian adultery and spiritual apostasy hinted at by the apostle Paul, and so fully delineated by John, the revelator. Hence, I applaud you with all my soul for having sounded the tocsin and lifted the warning voice to put the people of the United States on their guard against this awful danger, so insidiously being sprung upon them, and I not only wish you hearty success in accomplishing that end, so as to avert the danger, if it still be probable, but I also pray the Giver of all grace to let his blessing rest upon your laudable endeavors in this direction. At any rate you will have the satisfaction of having done your duty under the circumstances to the best of your ability; and your sure reward for having so done will rest with Him who is faithful and true, whether men will hear or whether they will forbear.”

The following estimate of the Blair Sunday Bill is correct. It is taken from a letter written by the editor of the *Daily Democrat, *of Grand Rapids, Mich.:—

> “I do not think there is or can be any question about the un constitutionality of the Blair Sunday Bill. Technically, I think there is no question; and, so far as broad fundamental principles are concerned, the movement is certainly one which violates the most vital of the inherent principles on which our Government was founded, and is one of many modern attempts to crystallize and petrify the shell of a religious system, the true essence of which is rapidly evaporating.

> “Of course, as the essence disappears, the importance increases in the minds of some of strengthening the shell, of preserving intact the outward forms and non-essentials.
> “It is a symptom of religious ossification.”
## The Signs of the Times

For 1889.

A Sixteen-Page Paper, Published Weekly, at Oakland, Cal.,

International Tract Society

WITH the beginning of the year 1889 the Signs of The Times entered upon its fifteenth volume, which the publishers are determined shall be the best ever published. It will consist of fifty numbers of sixteen pages each, making, in the course of the year, 800 pages of the choicest reading matter, classified each week as Editorial, Missionary, Sabbath-school, Temperance, General Matter, and Secular and Religious News besides Editorial Notes.

EDITORIAL DEPARTMENT.

The editorial force upon the Signs OF THE Times has been increased, and for this and other reasons the publishers feel warranted in promising for this year a greater amount and a better variety of matter in the Editorial Department than ever before. In this part of the paper will be discussed in an interesting and readable manner the various phases of practical Christian life and doctrine, embracing the evidence of the divinity of the Scriptures; the fulfillment of prophecy; the signs of the times; the harmony of the law and the gospel; together with everything that pertains to a thorough knowledge of our duties to God and to each other. Educational, social and political questions will also be discussed, the latter, however, only so far as they relate to matters of religion, for with politics as such the Signs has nothing to do.

THE SABBATH-SCHOOL DEPARTMENT.

The Sabbath-school Department will be largely a running commentary, by the editors, upon two series of lessons, one of which is the regular International Series. These lesson notes will be of such a character that they will not only be of great service to students in the preparation of their lessons, but will also be perused with interest and profit by the general reader.

MISSION DEPARTMENT.

In the Missionary Department will be published reports from the various mission fields, both home and foreign, together with brief descriptions of the fields and their wants.

TEMPERANCE DEPARTMENT.

In the past no part of the paper has met with more favor than the Temperance Department. Many temperance societies have used the Signs regularly in their meetings, and the publishers hope to make this feature of it still more interesting in the future than it has been in the past. This Department will contain not only the very best temperance matter obtainable, but also short articles relating to the preservation of health, including the discussion of proper food and dress, and correct habits of working, eating, sleeping, etc.

HOME CIRCLE DEPARTMENT.

This department is fully described by its name. In it will be published short stories of an elevated character, besides short sketches of history, travel, and biography. Altogether, it will be a most interesting and instructive part of the paper, especially for the young folks, though all can read it with profit.

RELIGIOUS AND SECULAR NEWS.

This department will be maintained in perfect keeping with the high moral tone of the paper. The news published will be carefully selected and everything of a low or sensational nature carefully excluded. The design of this department is to enable the reader to keep abreast of the times in the current news of the day without reading a mass of objectionable and offensive matter usually found in the public prints.

ARTICLES ON THE BOOK Of ROMANS.

With the first number of the new volume we began a series of articles upon the book of Romans, which will form a most interesting commentary upon this portion of the word of God. These articles will be distinct, each one being as nearly complete in itself as it is possible to make it. Under the heading of each article will appear the reference to that portion of the epistle covered by the comment, which will enable those who desire to do so to keep the connection of thought; this feature will also be appreciated by those who wish to preserve the articles for future reference, either by clipping and pasting in a scrap book or by filing the papers which contain them. One object of these articles will be to make it impossible for the careful reader to peruse the epistle to the Romans without getting at least a general understanding of its scope and object.

GENERAL ARTICLES.

The general articles published in the Signs are the very best selected and original matter obtainable. The articles are usually short, and always clear and pointed. Much of the matter in this department is written especially for this paper, but selections are also carefully made from the leading religious papers, only the very best being taken. Altogether the publishers feel safe in saying that no other paper published will furnish so great a variety of equally good matter for the year 1889 as will the SIGNS OF THE TIMES. [23-24]

Note.—No papers are sent by the publishers of the American Sentinel to people who have not subscribed for it. If the Sentinel comes to one who has not subscribed for it, he may know that it is sent him by some friend, and that he will not be called upon by the publishers to pay for the same.

Next week we shall publish in full, the letter which Cardinal Gibbons wrote to W. F. Crafts, on the strength of which 7,200,000 names were counted as affixed to the petitions for a National Sunday Law. The letter itself is the most complete refutation of the claim that the Cardinal signed the petition officially in behalf of the Roman Catholics. But our comments upon the letter will accompany it next week.

The Minneapolis *Tribune,* of October 31, says:—

> “The Pope advises peaceful agitation by Catholics in America, looking to the restoration to him of temporal power.”

And in their efforts to restore to the Pope his temporal power in Rome, they will be sure to secure their own political power in this country; and the political religionists of Protestantism are helping them.

The *Union Signal,* the organ of the National Woman’s Christian Temperance Union, gives the American Sentinel a notice, and says of it, among other things, “The paper antagonizes the very things we advocate.” We are sorry to know that. The American Sentinel antagonizes nothing except union of Church and State, or religious legislation by the civil Government, which is the same thing. The *Union Signal* evidently understands this, for it mentions “religious legislation” as the thing to which the Sentinel is opposed, and therefore it declares itself an advocate of such legislation. We have been severely censured for saying this in the past, but we hope we may be absolved now that the organ of the W. C. T. U. has declared for union of Church and State.

Next week the *Sentinel* will contain, among other live matter, a quite full report of the proceedings of the meeting held in Oakland, January 22, for the purpose of influencing legislation in behalf of a State Sunday law, and also a review of the remarks of Senator Blair before the U. S. Senate, December 21, in behalf of his Educational Amendment Bill. These will be articles that nobody will want to miss. When you have read them, lend your paper to your neighbor. Better still, induce him to subscribe between now and then, so that he will have the *Sentinel* for himself, and then you can lend yours to somebody else. But then the same thing would work with him, too, and you ought to keep your papers for future reference. We don’t see any other way for you to do than to induce everybody near you to subscribe. See if you cannot do that.

A gentleman writes to us from a town in Illinois, to state that he has been a lay member of the M. E. Church for seventy years, and has never heard either a minister or a lay member express a desire for a union of Church and State. We don’t doubt his word in the least, but it doesn’t prove anything. Fifty men might swear that they never saw a certain other man commit a theft, and yet that other man might be a highway robber. One man’s ignorance can never be used as an offset to another’s knowledge. We have heard and seen such a wish expressed many times. And what is more to the point, there are thousands who would indignantly repudiate any such desire, who are nevertheless zealously working for the same object under another name.

In our last issue but one we mentioned the great pressure upon the columns of the Sentinel, and said we hoped that a change might soon come in the shape of more frequent publication. The change has come sooner than we dared hope, and with the last number we began the weekly publication of the Sentinel. This volume will consist of forty-eight numbers, of which this is the second. We are sure that our friends will be glad for the change. For twice the money that they have been paying, they will receive nearly four times as much reading matter. This, of course, is not financially to the benefit of the publishers, but we hope that our efforts will meet with so hearty a response in the way of subscriptions, that the loss will be counterbalanced.

The *Catholic Home,* a paper published in Chicago, referring to the movement which is getting under headway in that city, “to abolish the Sunday slavery, and to suppress Sunday crime,” says the Catholic sentiment in that city, which has lain so long dormant under flagitious outrage, is now awakening and is anxious to do battle for home and altar, and declares that new vigor will now be put into the struggle of good citizenship against anarchy. The statement that the movement is for the suppression of “Sunday crime,” shows what their idea of good citizenship is. It is strange that they cannot see that such a movement, instead of being against anarchy, is in reality in favor of disregard to the laws; for by their opposition to “Sunday crime,” they give tacit leave to criminals to break the laws on other days with impunity.

In the recent Illinois Sunday Convention, Dr. Herrick Johnson, in a speech against Sunday newspapers and special Sunday trains, exclaimed: “Oh, for the breath of the Puritan! Oh, for a little of the Puritan Sabbath!” When it is remembered that in the days of the Puritans everybody was compelled to attend church on Sunday, it will be seen that our conclusion that the Blair Sunday Bill is in reality a bill to increase the attendance at church, is fully warranted. The following items from the laws of the Puritans of Connecticut will show what may be expected when the churches, under the leadership of such men as Dr. Johnson and Dr. Crafts, combine to revive Puritan customs and the Puritan Sabbath:—

> “No one shall be a freeman, or give a vote, unless he be converted, and a member in full communion of one of the churches allowed in this dominion.”

> “No man shall hold any office who is not sound in the faith and faithful to this dominion: and whoever shall give a vote to such a person shall pay a fine of one pound. For a second offense he shall be disfranchised.”— *Clarke’s History of Intolerance.*
That is a picture of the final result of the legislation which Senator Blair has introduced; the people who read this will not have to live many years before they see the reality.

Our watchful and vigorous contempory, the *American Sentinel,* of Oakland, is making a val- liant war against the fanatics who are attempting to chain us to a national or Christian Sunday. Although the movement is led by a false Shepard [Col. Elliott F.], and although the whole thing is false, all libertyloving people should remember that falsehoods often prevail when not checked by truth.—*Jewish Times and Observer.*

The business of Sunday legislation, or rather the attempts thereat, is now thriving in this State. A bill has already been introduced into the California Senate, making it a misdemeanor to conduct, maintain, or open, a bull-fight, bear-fight, prize-fight, cock-fight, horse-race, gambling-game, or to conduct or visit a dive or melodeon on a Sunday. No doubt the framer of that bill thinks that he has done a very pious act, and is blissfully unconscious that by that very act he has virtually declared that it is all right to do any of those things on any other day than Sunday. Thus a premium is put upon vice, by the very law which is claimed to be opposed to it. And this will always be found to be the case in religious legislation by the State. It ever has been and ever will be only a cloak for the commission of greater crimes than were committed before.

Following is the Roman Catholic idea of popular education, as set forth by the *Catholic Review* of April, 1871:—

We do not indeed prize as highly as some of our countrymen appear to do, the ability to read, write, and cipher. Some men are born to be leaders, and the rest are born to be led. The best ordered and administered State is that in which the few are well educated, and lead, and the many are trained to obedience. [25]
