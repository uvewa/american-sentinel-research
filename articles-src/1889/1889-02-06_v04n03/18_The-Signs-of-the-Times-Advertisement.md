## The Signs of the Times

For 1889.

A Sixteen-Page Paper, Published Weekly, at Oakland, Cal.,

International Tract Society

WITH the beginning of the year 1889 the Signs of The Times entered upon its fifteenth volume, which the publishers are determined shall be the best ever published. It will consist of fifty numbers of sixteen pages each, making, in the course of the year, 800 pages of the choicest reading matter, classified each week as Editorial, Missionary, Sabbath-school, Temperance, General Matter, and Secular and Religious News besides Editorial Notes.

EDITORIAL DEPARTMENT.

The editorial force upon the Signs OF THE Times has been increased, and for this and other reasons the publishers feel warranted in promising for this year a greater amount and a better variety of matter in the Editorial Department than ever before. In this part of the paper will be discussed in an interesting and readable manner the various phases of practical Christian life and doctrine, embracing the evidence of the divinity of the Scriptures; the fulfillment of prophecy; the signs of the times; the harmony of the law and the gospel; together with everything that pertains to a thorough knowledge of our duties to God and to each other. Educational, social and political questions will also be discussed, the latter, however, only so far as they relate to matters of religion, for with politics as such the Signs has nothing to do.

THE SABBATH-SCHOOL DEPARTMENT.

The Sabbath-school Department will be largely a running commentary, by the editors, upon two series of lessons, one of which is the regular International Series. These lesson notes will be of such a character that they will not only be of great service to students in the preparation of their lessons, but will also be perused with interest and profit by the general reader.

---

MISSION DEPARTMENT.

In the Missionary Department will be published reports from the various mission fields, both home and foreign, together with brief descriptions of the fields and their wants.

---

TEMPERANCE DEPARTMENT.

In the past no part of the paper has met with more favor than the Temperance Department. Many temperance societies have used the Signs regularly in their meetings, and the publishers hope to make this feature of it still more interesting in the future than it has been in the past. This Department will contain not only the very best temperance matter obtainable, but also short articles relating to the preservation of health, including the discussion of proper food and dress, and correct habits of working, eating, sleeping, etc.

---

HOME CIRCLE DEPARTMENT.

This department is fully described by its name. In it will be published short stories of an elevated character, besides short sketches of history, travel, and biography. Altogether, it will be a most interesting and instructive part of the paper, especially for the young folks, though all can read it with profit.

---

RELIGIOUS AND SECULAR NEWS.

This department will be maintained in perfect keeping with the high moral tone of the paper. The news published will be carefully selected and everything of a low or sensational nature carefully excluded. The design of this department is to enable the reader to keep abreast of the times in the current news of the day without reading a mass of objectionable and offensive matter usually found in the public prints.

---

ARTICLES ON THE BOOK Of ROMANS.

With the first number of the new volume we began a series of articles upon the book of Romans, which will form a most interesting commentary upon this portion of the word of God. These articles will be distinct, each one being as nearly complete in itself as it is possible to make it. Under the heading of each article will appear the reference to that portion of the epistle covered by the comment, which will enable those who desire to do so to keep the connection of thought; this feature will also be appreciated by those who wish to preserve the articles for future reference, either by clipping and pasting in a scrap book or by filing the papers which contain them. One object of these articles will be to make it impossible for the careful reader to peruse the epistle to the Romans without getting at least a general understanding of its scope and object.

---

GENERAL ARTICLES.

The general articles published in the Signs are the very best selected and original matter obtainable. The articles are usually short, and always clear and pointed. Much of the matter in this department is written especially for this paper, but selections are also carefully made from the leading religious papers, only the very best being taken. Altogether the publishers feel safe in saying that no other paper published will furnish so great a variety of equally good matter for the year 1889 as will the SIGNS OF THE TIMES. [23-24]
