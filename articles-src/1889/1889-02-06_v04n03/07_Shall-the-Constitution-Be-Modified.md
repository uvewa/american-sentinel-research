# Shall the Constitution Be Modified?

This is the question which the New York *Independent* has been propounding to some of the most prominent men in the country. The *Independent* asked: “Has there been such advance in political science and such development of this Nation during the past hundred years, as to demand any considerable modification in our Constitution? If so, in what lines should it be made?” After asking in particular if there should be a readjustment of the executive and legislative branches of the Government to each other, the *Independent’s* letter closed with these words: “Please treat the question from your own point of view, and follow your own lines of thought,” thus leaving every man free to suggest any change which, in his mind, the Constitution might need.

The *Independent* of January 10 contains several replies to the letter of inquiry, and some of them are so exceedingly pointed that we print them here. We first quote from the short letter of that eminent scholar and historian, Hon. George Bancroft. He says:—

> “I have your letter asking what changes had better be made in the Constitution. I know of none; if any change is needed, it is in ourselves, that we may more and more respect that body of primal law.”

Good! Such an answer does honor to the man who made it. Would that National Reformers might take a few lessons in political economy from George Bancroft. There is more of sound sense and the science of good government in that short answer than in all the volumes of National Reform literature.

We next quote the words of Justice Bradley, of the United States Supreme Court. He says, “I would have no change,” and adds:—

> “I think it is a most happy arrangement that sudden whiffs and gusts of popular feeling are not always able to execute and carry out the rash purposes with which they are inspired.”

Still more pointed is the following from Justice Gray, of the United States Supreme Court:—

> “I am so old-fashioned as to think that the Constitution, administered according to its letter and spirit, is well enough as it is. And I am of the opinion of the late Governor Andrew, that it is not desirable to Mexicanize our Government by proposing constitutional amendments as often as there is supposed to be a disturbance in its practical working.”

Better still is the following answer by Mr. Justice Blatchford, of the Supreme Court of the United States. We quote his letter in full:—

> “I am satisfied with the Constitution as it is. It cannot be bettered. Constitution tinkers are in a poor business. If there are ills, it is better to bear them than fly to others that we know not of.”

Of course this is rank atheism in the eyes of National Reformers, but it is so much the better on that account. That which they call heresy is the real, true religion of the Bible.

One more quotation closes the list. It is the last paragraph of a long letter by Francis Wharton, LL.D., and is as follows:—

> “The Constitution itself requires no amendment, but what is required is the removal from it of the patches impairing its symmetry, its comprehensiveness, its elasticity, its durability, which have been imposed on it by the judiciary.”

These are all good utterances. It is a good thing to know that the sound, thinking men of the Nation are in favor of preserving the Constitution as it is; but, alas! “Israel doth not know; my people doth not consider.”
