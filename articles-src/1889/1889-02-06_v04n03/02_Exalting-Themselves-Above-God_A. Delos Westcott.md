# Exalting Themselves Above God.

Every man is a free moral agent so far as human authority is concerned. God alone has the right to hold him responsible for the exercise of his choice in matters of morality and religion. If it was according to the will of God that a man should give up this right of choice to any individual or nation, then God could no longer hold him responsible; *for no person can be held responsible for the exercise of his choice in a matter wherein his liberty of choice has been removed.* Thus the advocates of national Christianity are working to take away man’s moral responsibility to God.
