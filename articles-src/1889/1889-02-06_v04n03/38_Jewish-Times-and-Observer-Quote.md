Our watchful and vigorous contemporary, the *American Sentinel,* of Oakland, is making a valiant war against the fanatics who are attempting to chain us to a national or Christian Sunday. Although the movement is led by a false Shepard [Col. Elliott F.], and although the whole thing is false, all liberty-loving people should remember that falsehoods often prevail when not checked by truth.—*Jewish Times and Observer.*
