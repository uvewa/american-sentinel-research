# Whose Country Is This.

At the convention of the National Woman's Christian Temperance Union, last fall, Mrs. Mary T. Lathrop made one of the principal speeches, in the course of which she said, addressing the press and politicians of New York:—

> "You have sold out our civilization by the sea-coast, have imported pauper labor, for fear you would have to pay honest wages to workingmen. The manufacturers of this country, who are falling on the necks of laboring men with many tears during this political campaign, have been sending their paid agents over to Europe to bring this kind of people here, until *you have trodden on our Sabbath,* and sold out our civilization in these great Eastern populations to the Philistines."

It seems as though people are getting pretty well advanced, when they can reprove others for treading upon "our Sabbath." God pronounces a blessing upon those who turn away their foot from the Sabbath, from doing their pleasure on his holy day; and when the American people shall enact laws against the violation of *their* Sabbath,—the rival of the Sabbath of the Lord,—we cannot see how much better they will be than the man of sin, "the son of perdition, who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshiped." Then we shall have not only Papal Rome, but Papal America.
