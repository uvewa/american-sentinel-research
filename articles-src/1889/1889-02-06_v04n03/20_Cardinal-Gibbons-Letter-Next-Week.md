Next week we shall publish in full, the letter which Cardinal Gibbons wrote to W. F. Crafts, on the strength of which 7,200,000 names were counted as affixed to the petitions for a National Sunday Law. The letter itself is the most complete refutation of the claim that the Cardinal signed the petition officially in behalf of the Roman Catholics. But our comments upon the letter will accompany it next week.
