The following estimate of the Blair Sunday Bill is correct. It is taken from a letter written by the editor of the *Daily Democrat, *of Grand Rapids, Mich.:—

> "I do not think there is or can be any question about the un constitutionality of the Blair Sunday Bill. Technically, I think there is no question; and, so far as broad fundamental principles are concerned, the movement is certainly one which violates the most vital of the inherent principles on which our Government was founded, and is one of many modern attempts to crystallize and petrify the shell of a religious system, the true essence of which is rapidly evaporating.

> "Of course, as the essence disappears, the importance increases in the minds of some of strengthening the shell, of preserving intact the outward forms and non-essentials.
> "It is a symptom of religious ossification."
