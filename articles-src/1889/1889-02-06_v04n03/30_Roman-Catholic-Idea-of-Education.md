Following is the Roman Catholic idea of popular education, as set forth by the *Catholic Review* of April, 1871:—

We do not indeed prize as highly as some of our countrymen appear to do, the ability to read, write, and cipher. Some men are born to be leaders, and the rest are born to be led. The best ordered and administered State is that in which the few are well educated, and lead, and the many are trained to obedience. [25]
