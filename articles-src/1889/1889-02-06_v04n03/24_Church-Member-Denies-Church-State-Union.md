A gentleman writes to us from a town in Illinois, to state that he has been a lay member of the M. E. Church for seventy years, and has never heard either a minister or a lay member express a desire for a union of Church and State. We don't doubt his word in the least, but it doesn't prove anything. Fifty men might swear that they never saw a certain other man commit a theft, and yet that other man might be a highway robber. One man's ignorance can never be used as an offset to another's knowledge. We have heard and seen such a wish expressed many times. And what is more to the point, there are thousands who would indignantly repudiate any such desire, who are nevertheless zealously working for the same object under another name.
