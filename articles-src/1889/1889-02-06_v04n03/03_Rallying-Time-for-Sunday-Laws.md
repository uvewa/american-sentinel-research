This winter will be a rallying time for those who are zealous for Sunday laws, all over the land. In many States, efforts will be made to this end. We desire to make the *Sentinel* of special use in every part of the country, and so our friends will confer a favor on us by supplying us with all the information possible concerning any movement which may be started in their respective States toward the enactment of Sunday laws. Give us the particulars in such shape that we can substantiate any statements that we may make, and we will make the *Sentinel* of use to you in your local struggle for the rights of all the people as against the wishes of a class.
