In our last issue but one we mentioned the great pressure upon the columns of the Sentinel, and said we hoped that a change might soon come in the shape of more frequent publication. The change has come sooner than we dared hope, and with the last number we began the weekly publication of the Sentinel. This volume will consist of forty-eight numbers, of which this is the second. We are sure that our friends will be glad for the change. For twice the money that they have been paying, they will receive nearly four times as much reading matter. This, of course, is not financially to the benefit of the publishers, but we hope that our efforts will meet with so hearty a response in the way of subscriptions, that the loss will be counterbalanced.
