We devote considerable space this week to the movement for a Sunday law in California. Although this is of more special interest to Californians, we believe it will be read with interest by people everywhere. We are sure that it may be read with profit in any State, for the same arguments that apply here may be used wherever it is proposed to enact such a law.
