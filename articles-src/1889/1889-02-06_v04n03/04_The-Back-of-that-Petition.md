# The Back of that Petition.

On another page we made some comments on the petition for a Sunday law, which is now being circulated in this State, showing up some of its bad features. We now propose literally to examine the other side of the matter. Following is an exact copy of what is on the back of the petition, emphasized words and all:—

## California the Only State in the Union Without a Sunday Law

[EXCEPT THE STATE OF NEVADA.]

We propose to have one; to that end will you kindly see that this is printed in the local papers in your place, and get editorials in favor of it, and distribute the papers with the same largely, and send for Petitions and secure all the signatures possible.

San Francisco, Cal., December 1st, 1888.

**Dear Friends:**

The repeal of the Sunday Law has robbed us in this State of our day of rest—the kindest gift of **God** to the toilers of earth—the sweetest day of the week to the worker, and every virtuous home.

**How** long shall we remain in bondage to Sunday desecrations, open saloons, and all the orgies consequent upon these wicked practices on God’s holy day?

**Let** us have one quiet rest day in seven, when all men shall close up their secular business, or such as is not necessary to be carried on during that day.

**That** each may have a day with their families and worship God in accordance with the dictates of their own consciences, uninterrupted by noisy street parades emanating from open saloons, or where intoxicating drinks may be sold and drank on the sacred Sabbath.

**Unless** the Sabbath is observed, we are on the way to Spanish bull-fights after the Lord’s Supper, and the riot and doom of Gomorrah in the end.

**The** Sabbath was ordained by God at creation, expressly to minister to man, this noblest being, and his immortal interests.

**Let us** keep the window of the Sabbath open between earth and Heaven, lest earth become the vestibule of hell.

**The hand** lifted against it is feeling for one of the central pillars that prop the temple of American liberty.

**Let** the **Sabbath** be overthrown, and all other moral restraints would soon fall with it, and Paris, Babylon, Sodom, would soon finish the story.

**Let** the **American Sabbath,** radiant with more than natural sunshine, brighten onward into earth’s millennial rest and glory.

**If we** want to diminish crime, pauperage, and taxation, to lighten the people’s burdens and to increase their power to bear them, then stand fast by the **American Sabbath.** It is the common law of our land; let it be of our hearts also.

**That** which demoralizes and debauches the people ruins the nation.

**The** Christian Sabbath has done more for America than all her fertile soil, her fine climate, her rivers, lakes, forests, gold-mines, or coal.

**It** has civilized and ennobled her **men**, purified and exalted her **women**, and taught her children to revere the name of their country next to that of their **God.**

**We** appeal to you in behalf of **“God** and Home and **Native Land,”** to petition the Senate and Assembly of the State of California to grant to the people of this golden land a Sunday Law, that shall give to rich and poor alike a day of rest. A day in which we can serve God according to the dictates of conscience.

Respectfully yours,

MRS. M. E. CONGDON, *Supt. Dept, Legislation and Petitions, California Woman’s Christian Temperance Union.*

It will be seen from the very first paragraph that the framers of the petition mean business. “We propose to have one,” say they, in reference to the Sunday law. Well, if printing their document in the local papers will be any help to them, they are welcome to our services.

Pay special attention to the first paragraph of the address. It says: “The repeal of the Sunday law has robbed us in this State of our day of rest.” We wonder if that is the reason why some of the good women of the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union are occasionally found engaged in secular labor at their places of business on Sunday. If what they say means anything, it means that they cannot rest since the Sunday law was repealed. We are not chiding them for their neglect to rest on Sunday. They have a perfect right to work, for in this State there is no law, either human or divine, which forbids them. But what folly to say that the repeal of the Sunday law has robbed them of any rest. It is the veriest cant, designed to arouse the sympathy of the legislators for the poor women of the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union, who find it impossible to take their much-coveted rest on Sunday, because there is no law to compel them to! This resting on Sunday must be a terrible thing, since it requires a law to drive them to it.

But it isn’t for their sakes after all that they want the Sunday law. They can keep Sunday just as well as they ever could, if they want to. It doesn’t make any difference how much somebody else may work or play; that doesn’t hinder them from resting. We know hundreds of people who find no trouble whatever in resting on the seventh day of the week, yet there never was a State law enforcing [20] its observance, and it is with the majority of people the busiest day in the week. No; it isn’t because the good women of the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union cannot rest to their hearts’ content, but because they have not the power to compel somebody else to rest, that they make this petition. We submit that others are as well qualified to judge when they need rest, as these people are to judge for them.

The second paragraph is worse yet. Note it carefully: “How long shall we remain in bondage to Sunday desecrations, open saloons, and all the orgies consequent upon these wicked practices upon God’s holy day?’ Really these good women are worse off than we supposed. They need a crusade started in their behalf. In bondage to Sunday desecration, open saloons, and all the orgies that are consequent thereupon! Something ought to be done to deliver them from this bondage of corruption. We don’t know of anything better than the preaching of the gospel. We don’t like the role of the Pharisee, but we cannot refrain in this connection from saying how thankful we are that we are not in a like condition. We will tell the truth, even though it savor of boasting. We have lived in California since long before the Sunday law was repealed, and we have never been in bondage to any open saloon, nor to any of the consequent orgies. We have been a free man in this respect. Will our friends excuse our light treatment of this matter? It is too absurd for serious consideration.

Next follows an appeal for the suppression of all secular business, in order “that each may have a day with their families, and worship God in accordance with the dictates of their own consciences.” Again we say, too bad! What pitiful straits these people are in, to be sure. Truly they must be in a most galling bondage, when it requires a State law to enable them to act according to the dictates of their own consciences. We imagine that the trouble is with their own consciences. Is it possible that any thinking man cannot see through this pitiful plea? They talk as though there were a law compelling people to do business on Sunday. One would imagine that those who would like to keep Sunday are held back by oppressive laws, instead of being left as free as the wind to do as they please. But this is just the trouble. They are not content to be free to do as they please; they want everybody else to be compelled to do just as *they* please. They cannot enjoy liberty unless they can use their liberty to oppress somebody else. And this shows that they know really nothing of what true liberty is.

We did think that in the first and second paragraphs they made about as humiliating confessions as could be asked of anybody, but the fifth paragraph reveals a much worse condition. They say: “Unless the Sabbath is observed, we are on the way to Spanish bullfights after the Lord’s Supper, and the riot and doom of Gomorrah in the end.” Who would have imagined such a thing of those eminently pious women? *We* certainly never should, although we have been accused of charging them foolishly. But the “we” must refer to the women of the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union, for it is signed by a representative of the Union. Whether or not it includes the “Dear Friends” to whom the petition is sent, we cannot say. If it does, we wish to be counted out, for we are not on the way to a Spanish bull-fight, or any other kind of a fight. And we here state our positive conviction that the man who does not keep Sunday, but who nevertheless minds his own business, is a good deal farther away from Spanish bull-fights and the like, than are the persons who need a State law to make them keep Sunday “in accordance with the dictates of their own consciences.”

From the paragraph which says that Sunday has civilized and ennobled the men of America, and “purified and exalted her women,” we have additional evidence that they fear lest they shall speedily be drawn away to barbarous amusements, unless the State shall interpose a Sunday law. They present themselves before the Legislature in the attitude of supplicants pleading for a law which will preserve them from disgrace.

Actually we don’t believe that these women fear anything of the kind, although that is what they say. If they were not so anxious to cover up the real intent of their movement, they might be kept from involving themselves in so many absurdities.

Just one more point: It is stated that “the Sabbath was ordained by God at creation expressly to minister to man, this noblest being, and his immortal interests.” So it is the “immortal interests” of man that they want to have the State take in hand. Now we submit that if the California Legislature does its duty by the mortal interests of the citizens of California, it will have its hands full for this session, without legislating for the world to come. “The whole boundless universe” isn’t theirs yet.

But notwithstanding the statement that the Sabbath was ordained by God at creation, they go on in subsequent paragraphs to call for the enforcement of “the American Sabbath.” Was it the American Sabbath that God ordained at creation? Our Bible says that it was “the Sabbath of the Lord.” It is curious how things do get mixed in these petitions, but it is due, no doubt, to the bondage in which the framers are held.

Well, we think that we have dissected this affair sufficiently for this time. Put into plain language, it means just this: “We are determined to have Sunday kept, in form at least, because we want it so; and we cannot rest, in spirit, until everybody else shall be compelled to do just as we profess that we ought to do.” We do not believe that the Legislature will pay attention to any such flimsy, self-contradictory, and manifestly selfish plea as that.E.
