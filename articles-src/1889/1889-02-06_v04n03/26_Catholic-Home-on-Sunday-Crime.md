The *Catholic Home,* a paper published in Chicago, referring to the movement which is getting under headway in that city, "to abolish the Sunday slavery, and to suppress Sunday crime," says the Catholic sentiment in that city, which has lain so long dormant under flagitious outrage, is now awakening and is anxious to do battle for home and altar, and declares that new vigor will now be put into the struggle of good citizenship against anarchy. The statement that the movement is for the suppression of "Sunday crime," shows what their idea of good citizenship is. It is strange that they cannot see that such a movement, instead of being against anarchy, is in reality in favor of disregard to the laws; for by their opposition to "Sunday crime," they give tacit leave to criminals to break the laws on other days with impunity.
