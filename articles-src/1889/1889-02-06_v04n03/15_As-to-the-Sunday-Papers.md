# As to the Sunday Papers.

When the subject of annihilating Sunday papers was under discussion by the preachers day before yesterday, various remedies were proposed. One of them was that the ministers should not print the notices of their services in the Sunday papers—boycott them, in short. That is an old story,—

Said Aaron to Moses, Let's bite off our noses.

Somehow they always get in. Some deacon or elder, more interested in the business than in the spiritual welfare of the church, and who knows that advertising is the life of all enterprises, [22] comes around, and, explaining that the minister is a little high-strung and old-fashioned in his notions, asks for an insertion of the notice.

Another remedy was that the papers be shown that their financial interests would be promoted by stopping the obnoxious issue. That was tried once in this city. During the early part of 1866 there was a three weeks' revival meeting in the Methodist Church Block. The evils of Sunday papers were dwelt on. Efforts were made to convert the offenders. It was stated that if any publisher would reform he could be sure of the solid and profitable backing of a great share of the community. One paper tried it. Its sole reward was a large assortment of resolutions, thanks, and prayers. It lost a number of the subscribers it had, and gained no new ones to speak of. It was a victim of what the worldly would call "a confidence game." After trying it a while it resumed its Sunday issue, and intends to continue its publication indefinitely.—*Chicago Tribune, November 23, 1888.*
