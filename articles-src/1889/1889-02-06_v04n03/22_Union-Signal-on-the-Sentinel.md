The *Union Signal,* the organ of the National Woman's Christian Temperance Union, gives the American Sentinel a notice, and says of it, among other things, "The paper antagonizes the very things we advocate." We are sorry to know that. The American Sentinel antagonizes nothing except union of Church and State, or religious legislation by the civil Government, which is the same thing. The *Union Signal* evidently understands this, for it mentions "religious legislation" as the thing to which the Sentinel is opposed, and therefore it declares itself an advocate of such legislation. We have been severely censured for saying this in the past, but we hope we may be absolved now that the organ of the W. C. T. U. has declared for union of Church and State.
