The following words of appreciation of the American Sentinel, and of sympathy for its work, are from the bishop of Hayti:—

"Permit me to say how heartily I agree with you in deploring the movement (characterized, as I believe, with more zeal than knowledge), which seeks to procure Sunday legislation by the Congress of the United States, as the same has begun to take form in the Blair Bill and Amendment to the National Constitution. Such a mixture of political and ecclesiastical functions in society, embodied in this legislation, from my point of view, is nothing less than the Babylonian adultery and spiritual apostasy hinted at by the apostle Paul, and so fully delineated by John, the revelator. Hence, I applaud you with all my soul for having sounded the tocsin and lifted the warning voice to put the people of the United States on their guard against this awful danger, so insidiously being sprung upon them, and I not only wish you hearty success in accomplishing that end, so as to avert the danger, if it still be probable, but I also pray the Giver of all grace to let his blessing rest upon your laudable endeavors in this direction. At any rate you will have the satisfaction of having done your duty under the circumstances to the best of your ability; and your sure reward for having so done will rest with Him who is faithful and true, whether men will hear or whether they will forbear."
