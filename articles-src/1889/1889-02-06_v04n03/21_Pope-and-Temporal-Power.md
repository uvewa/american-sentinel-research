The Minneapolis *Tribune,* of October 31, says:—

> "The Pope advises peaceful agitation by Catholics in America, looking to the restoration to him of temporal power."

And in their efforts to restore to the Pope his temporal power in Rome, they will be sure to secure their own political power in this country; and the political religionists of Protestantism are helping them.
