In the recent Illinois Sunday Convention, Dr. Herrick Johnson, in a speech against Sunday newspapers and special Sunday trains, exclaimed: "Oh, for the breath of the Puritan! Oh, for a little of the Puritan Sabbath!" When it is remembered that in the days of the Puritans everybody was compelled to attend church on Sunday, it will be seen that our conclusion that the Blair Sunday Bill is in reality a bill to increase the attendance at church, is fully warranted. The following items from the laws of the Puritans of Connecticut will show what may be expected when the churches, under the leadership of such men as Dr. Johnson and Dr. Crafts, combine to revive Puritan customs and the Puritan Sabbath:—

"No one shall be a freeman, or give a vote, unless he be converted, and a member in full communion of one of the churches allowed in this dominion."

"No man shall hold any office who is not sound in the faith and faithful to this dominion: and whoever shall give a vote to such a person shall pay a fine of one pound. For a second offense he shall be disfranchised."— *Clarke's History of Intolerance.*

That is a picture of the final result of the legislation which Senator Blair has introduced; the people who read this will not have to live many years before they see the reality.
