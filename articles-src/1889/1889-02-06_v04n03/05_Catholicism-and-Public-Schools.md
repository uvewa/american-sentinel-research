In an article entitled, "Catholicism and the Public Schools," in the November (1888) *North American Review,* Gail Hamilton writes thus:—

> "No system of public schools can survive the narrow intellectual tyranny of forcing both sides of a controverted history to accept, as unquestioned truth, the belief of either side. Let every vestige of sectarianism be not only willingly, but eagerly and thoroughly, removed from the public school; and then let us, if need be, stand for the unsectarian public school with hand to the sword."

It is evident that National Reformers will not find it all clear sailing in their endeavors to make our public schools the instruments of an American hierarchy.
