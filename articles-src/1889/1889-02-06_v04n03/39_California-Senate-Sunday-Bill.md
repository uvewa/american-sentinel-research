The business of Sunday legislation, or rather the attempts thereat, is now thriving in this State. A bill has already been introduced into the California Senate, making it a misdemeanor to conduct, maintain, or open, a bull-fight, bear-fight, prize-fight, cock-fight, horse-race, gambling-game, or to conduct or visit a dive or melodeon on a Sunday. No doubt the framer of that bill thinks that he has done a very pious act, and is blissfully unconscious that by that very act he has virtually declared that it is all right to do any of those things on any other day than Sunday. Thus a premium is put upon vice, by the very law which is claimed to be opposed to it. And this will always be found to be the case in religious legislation by the State. It ever has been and ever will be only a cloak for the commission of greater crimes than were committed before.
