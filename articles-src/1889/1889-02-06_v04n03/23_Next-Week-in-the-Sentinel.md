Next week the *Sentinel* will contain, among other live matter, a quite full report of the proceedings of the meeting held in Oakland, January 22, for the purpose of influencing legislation in behalf of a State Sunday law, and also a review of the remarks of Senator Blair before the U. S. Senate, December 21, in behalf of his Educational Amendment Bill. These will be articles that nobody will want to miss. When you have read them, lend your paper to your neighbor. Better still, induce him to subscribe between now and then, so that he will have the *Sentinel* for himself, and then you can lend yours to somebody else. But then the same thing would work with him, too, and you ought to keep your papers for future reference. We don't see any other way for you to do than to induce everybody near you to subscribe. See if you cannot do that.
