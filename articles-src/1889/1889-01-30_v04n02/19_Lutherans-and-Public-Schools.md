# Lutherans and Public Schools.

The following letter is self-explanatory, and needs no comment other than that we are glad to make the correction, and glad for the evidence which it furnishes that National Reform errors have not perverted everybody:—

> Editor American Sentinel—*Dear Sir:* In your article,"Romanism and Republicanism" (December issue), re-published from the *America,* the words occur: "The Roman Church (and in many instances the Lutheran) opposes the system of public education," etc. This is not treating the Lutheran Church fairly. She neither teaches nor practices opposition to the public-school system. Let me give you the simple facts, and you may then judge for yourself. The Lutheran Church establishes parochial schools wherever she is financially able to do so, principally for the religious training of her children. So far her practice comes under the heading of civil rights, that belong to the infidel and Christian alike.

> The material difference between the Lutheran and Roman views on public education is, that the former church not only accords the State the right of giving secular instruction, but holds the present publicschool system to be the necessary and only mode of public education consistent with a republican community composed of many religious denominations. The Lutheran Church never endeavors to thrust upon public schools her religious views, nor does she countenance any mingling of religion with politics, as that would necessarily entail religious persecution. I am yours respectfully,
Rev. A. W. Meyer, *Pastor First Lutheran Church, Winfield, Kan.*
