Senator Blair is now a full-fledged National Reformer. December 6 he wrote a letter to the Secretary of the National Reform Association, in which he said:—

> "I earnestly trust that your movement may become strong, general, in fact all-pervading, for the time has fully come when action is imperative, and further delay is most dangerous."

How delay can be any more dangerous than would be the success of the National Reform movement, we should like the Senator or somebody else to explain.
