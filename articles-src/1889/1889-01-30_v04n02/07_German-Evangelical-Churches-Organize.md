The pastors and officers of thirty-three German Evangelical Churches in New York and Brooklyn, met, a few days ago, and formed an organization which, it is said, "may lead to important political results." One of the leading ministers stated that its object is "to maintain and defend the civil and religious liberty" of this country, whenever it seems to be in danger. He said that it was proposed to break the power of the Roman Catholic Church in the United States. This latter they will find an impossibility, and the probabilities are that this league will simply try to substitute one ecclesiastical domination for another, or else will think to purify Catholicism by a union with it; and either plan would only make a bad matter worse. There is always danger when ministers and church people organize to effect "important political results," no matter how good their intentions may be.
