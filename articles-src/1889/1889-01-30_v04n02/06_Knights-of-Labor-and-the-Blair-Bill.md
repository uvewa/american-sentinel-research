In a speech before the General Assembly of the Knights of Labor, Rev. W. F. Crafts said:—

> "Last month I spoke to the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, at their International Convention, and secured from them, after a full consideration of the matter, a unanimous and enthusiastic indorsement of a petition to Congress against Sunday work in the Government's mail and military service, and in interstate commerce."

The Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers is one of the most powerful and influential labor organizations in the world, and its support of the Blair Bill will be a material aid in securing its passage. The same may be said of the Knights of Labor. After Mr. Crafts's speech, a hearty vote of thanks was tendered him, and the petition to Congress was then indorsed by unanimous vote of the Assembly. The *Journal of United Labor* adds, on its own account: "It is hoped that every church and every labor organization will, by vote or by individual signature, at once indorse the petition."
