To compel [a Catholic]... to send his children to a school where the Protestant view and the Protestant view alone is taught, is as unjustifiable and absurd as it would be to force Protestants into a similar position, if at some time the Catholics should get the upper hand, and the tables should be turned. And if, under such circumstances, Protestants would not submit, it is simply rank injustice to demand that Catholics shall submit, simply because the power at present happens to be in Protestant hands. Thus we are forced to the conclusion that in our public schools we must give to our instruction no more of theological color than we give to our courts and Legislatures. The responsibility of all religious instruction, if we are to preserve a harmonious support of our institutions, must be left to the churches, to the families, and to voluntary individual effort. And there it may be left with entire safety.—*Charles Kendall Adams.*
