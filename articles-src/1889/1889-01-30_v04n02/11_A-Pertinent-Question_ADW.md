# A Pertinent Question.

What do people keep Sunday for? "Oh," says one, "we keep Sunday to commemorate the resurrection of Christ. In other words, Sunday keeping is a sign which we hang out to show that we believe in Christ." Very well, do you want to compel a man to hang out a sign that he believes in Christ when the fact is he does not believe in him? This is exactly what Senator Blair's Sunday Bill is designed to do, and people who profess Christianity are trying to help the thing along.

What would you think if the civil Government should pass a law to compel a man to hang out on the corner of his house a sign, "Boots and Shoes for Sale," when the fact was he had not a boot nor a shoe for sale in the house? Would not this be compelling the man to be a liar and a hypocrite? "Oh, but that is a different case," you say, "altogether." Yes, it is different, and in just this respect, that it is as much worse to compel a man to lie about Christ and his religion than to lie about boots and shoes, as the religion of Christ is above the manufacture and sale of boots and shoes.

What must be the moral condition of people who will advocate the legal enforcement of such hypocrisy?

A. Delos Westcott.
