# What the Rev. Herrick Would See.

Upon Dr. Herrick Johnson’s cry for a breath of the Puritan, the Chicago *Tribune,* November 23, 1888, remarks, under the above heading, as follows:—

> “The Rev. Herrick Johnson, a man who sees no grace nor hope of salvation outside of the Prohibition faction, of which he is one of the lights, mourns over the people’s Sunday papers, and other ‘evil ’ doings in Chicago, and exclaims: ‘Oh, for the breath of the Puritan!’ Were he favored with some of it he would find it heavily laden with rum and the smell of ‘the creature called tobacco;’ for the Puritan minister scorned neither strong drink nor the Indian weed, but made much of them on all occasions—births, deaths, and ministerial installations. Were the ancient Puritan in power he would make short work [14] of the Rev. Herrick, unless he changed his creed. He would tolerate no Presbyterianism. He would find fault with the Rev. H. J. because his long sermons were not half long enough; because some of his services savored of prelacy; because he had crosses about his church; musical instruments; formal and unspiritual ceremonials. He would even call him a Sabbath-breaker. The old Puritan would cast him out in short order as a corrupter of the people and a disturber of the commonwealth. Oh, that the Lord would answer the Doctor’s prayer and let him meet the Puritan face to face!”

Amen! When, however, this religio-political element, of which the “Rev. H. J.” is a part, shall have gained the supremacy, we are afraid that the Doctor will answer his own cry, and endeavor, so far as in him lies, to give to others the benefit of his idea of what the breath of the Puritan should do. If only the Doctor himself could have the benefit of it, we could not have the heart to object; but we hope it may never be inflicted upon anybody else.
