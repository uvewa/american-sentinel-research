# A Sample of Moral Obtuseness.

The *Christian Statesman* of September 27, 1888, had, as usual, a report from “Secretary” Foster. In it he told about a sermon which he preached in Cincinnati on “Sunday Observance,” and after detailing the compliments which he received for it, he continued thus:—

> “There is a general feeling of anxiety among the people for our sabbath. They feel that something should be done, but there is a nightmare inability to do anything. A good brother said to me: ‘The Sunday paper comes to my house regularly. We began taking it during the war. We wanted the latest news from the battle-fields, and it has been coming ever since. I know it is wrong. There should not be any Sunday paper. It is an injury to society; but when others take it, we might as well have it.’”

And so, of course, he is in favor of a law that will stop Sunday papers and all other work. On the statements in the paragraph just quoted, we have just the following points which we wish to emphasize:—

1. The people do well to be anxious about *their* sabbath, when they themselves have not interest enough in it to keep it without being forced to do so.

2. If Sunday is “our sabbath,” as they call it, what right have they to compel people who have no interest in it to adopt it as theirs? As well might the shop-keeper compel people to buy his goods as to compel them to accept his sabbath.

3. This man is not alone in calling Sunday “our sabbath.” National Reformers, and all Sunday-law advocates, speak of “our sabbath,” “our American sabbath,” etc. This they want enforced upon the people by law. At the same time they insist that there can be no real Sunday rest secured to the people, except on the basis of religious obligation. Then it is a point that admits of no debate, that they are seeking to enforce religion on the people, and that the religion which they wish to enforce is *their* religion. In other words, they want to put themselves in the place of God, and have the people’s consciences regulated by *their* will.

4. When a man has not enough moral stamina to do a thing which he believes in his heart he ought to do, without being forced to do it by civil law, how much better will the law make him? Not a particle. He will be in just the condition of the thief who has been shut up in prison, and who is honest because there is nothing for him to steal. It is such service as this that National Reformers think will bring in the millennium!

5. If they wish to know the cause of this laxness in Sunday observance, on the part of those who profess to keep it, and who even clamor for laws enforcing its observance, we can give it. It is because they do not really believe that Sunday has any claims upon them. They know full well that it has no divine sanction, and they cannot keep themselves up to the point of doing that which in their inmost heart they know is not required of them by divine law. Their appeal for a civil law shows their unbelief in there being any divine law upholding it.

We believe that these points are clear to the comprehension of every reader, and that they cannot be gainsaid.

President Garfield, in his letter of acceptance, July 12, 1880, said: “Next in importance to freedom and justice is popular education, without which neither freedom nor justice can be permanently maintained. . . . It would be unjust to our people, and dangerous to our institutions, to apply any portion of the revenue of the Nation or of the States to the support of sectarian schools. The separation of the Church and the State in everything relating to taxation should be absolute.”

Some of the Chicago ministers, like the Third party Prohibitionists, have set out to regulate things by law, and will make the conversion by gospel means a second-rate matter.—*Inter-Ocean. *[15-16]

Note.—No papers are sent by the publishers of the American Sentinel to people who have not subscribed for it. If the Sentinel comes to one who has not subscribed for it, he may know that it is sent him by some friend, and that he will not be called upon by the publishers to pay for the same.

Dr. Wilbur F. Crafts has resigned his pastorate of the First Union Church, New York City, to become the field Secretary of the American Sunday Union. His work is to be a sort of general organizer and worker up of sympathy and support for National religious legislation.

Senator Blair is now a full-fledged National Reformer. December 6 he wrote a letter to the Secretary of the National Reform Association, in which he said:—

> “I earnestly trust that your movement may become strong, general, in fact all-pervading, for the time has fully come when action is imperative, and further delay is most dangerous.”

How delay can be any more dangerous than would be the success of the National Reform movement, we should like the Senator or somebody else to explain.

If everyone to whom this copy of the Sentinel comes would secure one subscriber, a great work could be done with but little individual effort, and who could not do that? If your neighbors don’t know anything about the National Reform movement, which the Sentinel is opposing, take a few minutes to tell them a few facts as to its principles, and the progress it has made. Get them interested to know more, and you can easily induce them to subscribe for the only paper that discusses every phase of the question. Try it.

In many of the States the Legislatures will have before them this winter the matter of making a Sunday law. Will not our friends help us, and at the same time serve the cause of truth, by telling us all that is being done? We want to make the American Sentinel the guardian of the rights of the people in every quarter; and we shall utter no uncertain sound on all questions that properly come before us. You who know something about the tendency, keep your eyes open and inform us of the doings in your neighborhood, that we may stir up the people.

On Sunday, January 13, a large number of the pastors of the city of Oakland preached upon the Sunday question, and especially Sunday laws. This was in accordance with a previous mutual agreement, in which the Catholic Church joined. The object is to work up a sentiment that will influence legislature this winter. Petitions are being circulated throughout the State of California, asking the Legislature to pass a Sunday law at the present session. The Woman’s Christian Temperance Union has the thing in charge, and expects to roll up so large and influential a list of names that the Legislature will not dare ignore the matter. We shall soon see what we shall see.

The immense number of signers to the petitions for a Sunday law, and the great stir that is being made in all quarters, show that the matter with which the American Sentinel deals is the leading issue of the day. The tariff will soon be entirely lost sight of in the agitation of the question of National Sunday rest. This being the case, it needs no argument to prove that with the liberal terms which are offered to canvassers for the Sentinel, those who give their time to it can do well financially, while they are doing good to the people. Orders are already coming in. Shall we not have an army of men and women who will engage heartily in this work for the next two months?

## American Citizens

We address you on a matter of vital importance to our State and Nation. Among the blessed boons left us as the heritage of our forefathers is that of religious liberty, or the right to worship (or not worship) God according to the dictates of our own conscience. It is the principle of religious liberty which has made our country what it is above all others, “the home of the oppressed,” “the land of the free.” To relinquish that for which our fathers bled and died is to return to the Dark Ages with its religious persecution. Many believe that this Government will ever continue as it is. But even now grave dangers are threatening this foundation-stone of our republic.

There are now pending in the Congress of these United States two Bills, known as the “Blair Educational Amendment Bill,” and the “Blair Sunday Rest Bill.” The effect of these Bills, if they become laws, will be a virtual union of Church and State, and the persecution of those who may not be able to conscientiously submit to these proposed unjust laws.

No less than fifteen millions of names have been presented to Congress as petitioners in favor of the latter Bill by the American Sabbath Union. The names consist of about seven or eight millions gathered by the friends of the Bill, and the counting of seven million two hundred thousand Roman Catholics, because Cardinal Gibbons signed the petition as an individual.

The National Reform Association, numbering among its officers U. S. Senators, Judges of the Supreme Court of the U. S., Presidents of Colleges, and D. D.’s, Bishops and Archbishops by the score, has for its object the placing of “all Christian laws, institutions and usages, on an undeniable legal basis in the fundamental law of the land.” Of course this means official State interpretation and enforcement of Christian duties under penalties; and that is religious persecution. The aim of the National Reformers is the aim of the Blair Bills, and also the aim of the American Sabbath Union.

The principal leaders in the W. C. T. U. and the Prohibition party are in favor of these Bills.

The General Assembly of the Knights of Labor have indorsed these bills by unanimous vote.

The Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers in convention assembled have also indorsed them. Other organizations are swinging into line.

It may be asked why so many give their assent to these measures. For these reasons, namely: One class wish to dominate the religion of all, and so lift themselves into power upon the oppression of others, while hiding their real intent by smoothly-worded propositions. The second, and by far the most numerous, class give their assent because they think that these men at the head of this movement are good and wise men, and therefore cannot be led by wrong principles. They do not understand the nature of the movement or they would oppose it. Many who have once favored it, but who have since studied it, men of eminence, are now strenuous opposers. The third class is those politicians who are willing to become Christians or anything else to get votes. And with these classes, the ambitious religious politicians, those ignorant of the nature of such legislation, and the political time-server, unless prompt measures are taken to enlighten and so avert this legislation, religious thralldom will be the fate of now free American citizens.

Do you wish to become informed? Do you wish to inform your neighbors? Do you wish to preserve intact our religious liberties and free schools?

We present before you the only journal which is fully and intelligently enlisted on this side of the conflict, namely, the American Sentinel, published weekly in Oakland, Cal., now entering upon its fourth year and numbering many thousands of staunch friends in all parts of the Union.

The Sentinel is not owned or controlled by any political party whatever.

It is not run in the interests of any religious denomination.

It advocates and will defend the religious rights of all, whether Catholic or Protestant, Unitarian or Trinitarian, Baptist or Pedobaptist, Jew or Christian, religious or non-religious.

It is set for the defense of our glorious Constitution, which declares, “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.”

It is uncompromisingly opposed to anything tending toward a union of Church and State, either in name or in fact.

American citizens, liberty-loving Christians, the conflict is before us. Will you not aid us?

The principles which the American Sentinel advocates are indorsed by leading men in all parts of the country.

*From Thomas Renison, State Senator, Gonzales, Monterey County, Cal.*

> Publishers American Sentinel,

> Gentlemen: Your favor of the 11th inst., and the April and May numbers of the Sentinel, duly received, and for which I am truly thankful. I heartily indorse the principles advocated by the Sentinel, and wish it Godspeed in its good work, We cannot be too zealous and vigilant in a matter so important as the preservation of our civil and religious liberty. And when any set of men, religious or otherwise, attempt, by tampering with our National Constitution, to destroy that liberty which we have so long enjoyed, it is time that we, as American citizens, should assert, in no uncertain terms, our disapproval of so unholy a work.I am yours respectfully.
*From Wm. P. Folly, State Senator, Lynchburg, Tennessee.*

Publishers American Sentinel, Oakland, Cal.:

Permit me to assure you that I am well pleased with the Sentinel. When I returned home from Nashville I found the Sentinel for last year bound in paper had been sent to my address without charge. If the account was misplaced let me know what it is and I will cheerfully pay it. It is with shame I have to acknowledge the failure of the bill for the extension of religious liberty in this State, so as to allow those who religiously and conscientiously observe the seventh day as the Sabbath to pursue their secular occupations on the first day. I am heartily with the Sentinel for the utmost religious liberty.

*From F. J. Dickman, Judge Supreme Court, Columbus, Ohio.*

Publishers American Sentinel,

My Dear Sirs- I return you my many thanks for your kind and courteous letter of the 11th inst., and for several numbers of the Sentinel which came to hand at the same time with your letter. Several articles in the Sentinel, which I have read have been to me full of interest and instruction, and I am, I trust, excusable for my curiosity in desiring to know who is the “Ohio boy” who has been so kind and considerate as to have my name placed upon your list. The speech of Senator Crockett I will carefully read, as the subject is very suggestive. I am respectfully yours.

*From A. W. Schalck, Attorney, Pottsville, Pennsylvania.*

Publishers American Sentinel,

Gentlemen: Inclosed please find one year’s subscription to your paper, which advocates a doctrine to which I cordially subscribe, to wit, that Church and State must be kept separate and apart, if our republic and her institutions are to be preserved.

The Sentinel is now published WEEKLY at the exceedingly low price of One Dollar per year. In clubs of ten or more copies to one address, 75 cents each. Agents wanted. [17]
