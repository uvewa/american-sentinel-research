If everyone to whom this copy of the Sentinel comes would secure one subscriber, a great work could be done with but little individual effort, and who could not do that? If your neighbors don't know anything about the National Reform movement, which the Sentinel is opposing, take a few minutes to tell them a few facts as to its principles, and the progress it has made. Get them interested to know more, and you can easily induce them to subscribe for the only paper that discusses every phase of the question. Try it.
