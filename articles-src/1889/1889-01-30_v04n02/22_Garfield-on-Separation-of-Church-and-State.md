President Garfield, in his letter of acceptance, July 12, 1880, said: "Next in importance to freedom and justice is popular education, without which neither freedom nor justice can be permanently maintained. . . . It would be unjust to our people, and dangerous to our institutions, to apply any portion of the revenue of the Nation or of the States to the support of sectarian schools. The separation of the Church and the State in everything relating to taxation should be absolute."
