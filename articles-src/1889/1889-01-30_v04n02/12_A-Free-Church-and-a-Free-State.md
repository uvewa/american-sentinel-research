# A Free Church and a Free State.

In this country the church is free and the State is free. It is not a free church in a free State which we wish to be recognized, but a free church and a free State. They stand side by side, independent in government and teaching. Liberty of conscience and of worship is the right of every man, and this the State guarantees. Therefore, the church gives the State its moral support and spiritual influence, and the State opens its doors to the inspection of the church, and is willing to hear its criticism, and listen to its advice, but it cannot and will not, if it be true to its functions, submit to dictation or become the ally of the church in any ecclesiastical work. In other words, it is not the province of the State to teach religion, and it is equally out of the American order for the church to teach politics.

But we are told that if religion be not taught in the schools they will become godless, and the result will be infidelity or indifferentism. Has the church, then, so little faith in its divine origin and its supernatural superintendence that it is afraid it will fail in its mission unless it places a catechism and a creed in the curriculum? It seems to me that the outcry against a godless school is not only a reflection upon the church, but a distrust in God, who is the sum of all knowledge, and who has revealed himself as clearly in measurable geometry as in immeasurable metaphysics, and who is as certainly near to us in the manifestations disclosed by the study of history and geography as in the sublimated mysteries of theologic speculation.

But if it be conceded that religion ought to be taught in the State schools, what religion shall it be? There are at least ten religions which have exercised a beneficent influence upon mankind, and in a community like our own we shall find those who sympathize with the tenets held by each of these. Shall the State sit in judgment upon these and declare what one shall receive its sanction and support? What becomes, then, of the rights of the nine, all of whom will be compelled to contribute to that which they detest?—*Rev. T. P. Saurin, in the Troy Times.*
