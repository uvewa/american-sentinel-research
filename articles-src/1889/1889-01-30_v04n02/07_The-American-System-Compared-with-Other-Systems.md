# The American System Compared with Other Systems.

The American relationship of Church and State differs from all previous relationships in Europe and in the colonial period of our history; and yet it rests upon them and reaps the benefit of them all. For history is an organic unit, and American history has its roots in Europe.

1. The American system differs from the ante-Nicene or pre-Constantinian separation of Church and State, when the church was, indeed, as with us, self-supporting and self- governing, and so far free within, but under persecution from without, being treated as a forbidden religion by the then heathen State. In America the Government protects the church in her property and rights without interfering with her internal affairs. . . .

2. The American system differs from the hierarchical control of the church over the State, or from priest government, which prevailed in the Middle Ages down to the Reformation, and reached its culmination in the Papacy. It confines the church to her proper spiritual vocation, and leaves the State independent in all the temporal affairs of the Nation. ...

3. The American system differs from the Erastian or Cesaro-Papal control of the State over the church, which obtained in the old Byzantine Empire, and prevails in modern Russia, and in the Protestant States of Europe, [13] where the civil Government protects and supports the church, but at the expense of her dignity and independence, and deprives her of the power of self-government. The Erastian system was based on the assumption that all citizens are also Christians of one creed, but is abnormal in the mixed character of Government and people in the modern State. In America, the State has no right whatever to interfere with the affairs of the church, her doctrine, discipline, and worship, and the appointment of ministers. It would be a great calamity if religion were to become subject to our ever-changing politics.

4. The American system differs from the system of toleration, which began in Germany with the Westphalia Treaty, 1648; in England with the Act of Toleration, 1689, and which now prevails over nearly all Europe; of late years, nominally at least, even in Roman Catholic countries, to the very gates of the Vatican, in spite of the protest of the Pope. Toleration exists where the Government supports one or more churches, and permits other religious communities, under the name of sects (as on the continent), or dissenters and nonconformist (as in England), under certain conditions. In America there are no such distinctions, but only churches or denominations on a footing of perfect equality before the law. To talk about any peculiar denomination as *the* church, or *the American* church, has no meaning, and betrays ignorance or conceit. Such exclusiveness is natural and logical in Romanism, but unnatural, illogical, and contemptible in any other church. The American laws know no such institution as “the church,” but only separate and independent organizations.

Toleration is an important step from State- churchism to free-churchism. But it is only a step. There is a very great difference between tolerance and liberty. Toleration is a concession, which may be withdrawn; it implies a preference for the ruling form of faith and worship, and a practical disapproval of all other forms. It may be coupled with many restrictions and disabilities. We tolerate what we dislike, but cannot alter; we tolerate even a nuisance if we must. Acts of toleration are wrung from a Government by the force of circumstances and the power of a minority too influential to be disregarded. In this way even the most despotic Governments, as those of Turkey and of Russia, are tolerant; the one toward Christians and Jews, the other toward Mohammedans and dissenters from the orthodox Greek Church; but both deny the right of self-extension and missionary operations except in favor of the State religion, and both forbid and punish apostasy from it. Prince Gortschakoff, the late chancellor of the Russian Empire, before an international deputation of the Evangelical Alliance, pleading for religious freedom in behalf of the persecuted Lutherans of the Baltic provinces in 1871, boldly declared, within my hearing, that Russia was the most tolerant country in the world, and pointed in proof to half a dozen churches of different denominations in the principal street of St Petersburg, but protested at the same time against what he called propagandism. The great Russian statesman did not, or would not, understand the vast difference between tolerate on and liberty. The English Lord Stanhope, in a speech in the House of Lords in 1827, on the Bill for the Repeal of the Test and Corporation Acts, said: “The time was, when toleration was craved by dissenters as a boon; it is now demanded as a right; but a time will come when it will be spurned as an insult.”

In our country we ask no toleration for religion and its free exercise, but we claim it as an inalienable right. “It is not toleration,” says Judge Cooley, “which is established in our system, but religious equality.” Freedom of religion is one of the greatest gifts of God to man, without distinction of race or color. He is the Author and Lord of conscience, and no power on earth has a right to stand between God and the conscience. A violation of this divine law written in the heart is an assault upon the majesty of God and the image of God in man. Granting the freedom of conscience, we must, by logical necessity, also grant the freedom of its manifestation and exercise in public worship. To concede the first and to deny the second, after the manner of despotic Governments, is to imprison the conscience. To be just, the State must either support all or none of the religions of its citizens. Our Government supports none, but protects all.—*Doctor Schaff.*
