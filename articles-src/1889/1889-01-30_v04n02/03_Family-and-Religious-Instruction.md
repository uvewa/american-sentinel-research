Is the family a failure? We are led to ask the question in view of the fact that several of our contemporaries in their zeal for introducing sectarian instruction in the public schools, declare, "You can't depend upon the family for religious instruction." Well, in the early history of the republic there were no public schools; but religion was taught, and taught in the homes of the country. Are we weaker now than we were a century ago? *—Christian at Work.*
