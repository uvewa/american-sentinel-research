The misery of man is great enough without its being enhanced by tyranny over conscience. Liberty and contentment are two great sources of human happiness. The lark rises at pleasure, and in such notes as nature teaches, warbles its song to heaven; thus absolutely free as to all coercive control and every human tribunal, ought to be the mind of man in the service of God.—*Thomas Clarke.*
