# Our Public-School System.

We are told that public morality is in decadence; that infidelity of one sort and another is on the rampage; that crimes are more numerous than ever before; that the marriage tie is more lightly regarded; that the general conscience is less sensitive to evils which affect the welfare of society, and that therefore the school tax should be divided between Catholics and Protestants, that each may take care of its own constituency. This we believe to be a mistake. . . . We are told that our children ought to be more carefully taught, that their religious education is neglected, and that many wasted lives are the consequence. No one will be likely to deny it. But where shall the child get his moral education unless in the home and in the church? What are homes and churches for? The public-school system is a purely State affair, a secular institution. It can never be anything else. Its sole business is to give the rudiments of education, that the boy may have a brain as well as a pair of hands for the struggle of the future. If the church and the home supplement that training by the infusion of religious doctrine or moral ideas, why then you have a boy well equipped for citizenship. It is not the duty of the State to make Episcopalians or Catholics or Methodists. The State must keep out of the church, and the church must keep out of the State. That idea lies at the foundation of things in this country, and it can never be changed until our institutions are destroyed.—*New York Herald.*
