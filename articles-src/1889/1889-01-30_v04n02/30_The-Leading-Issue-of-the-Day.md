The immense number of signers to the petitions for a Sunday law, and the great stir that is being made in all quarters, show that the matter with which the American Sentinel deals is the leading issue of the day. The tariff will soon be entirely lost sight of in the agitation of the question of National Sunday rest. This being the case, it needs no argument to prove that with the liberal terms which are offered to canvassers for the Sentinel, those who give their time to it can do well financially, while they are doing good to the people. Orders are already coming in. Shall we not have an army of men and women who will engage heartily in this work for the next two months?
