On Sunday, January 13, a large number of the pastors of the city of Oakland preached upon the Sunday question, and especially Sunday laws. This was in accordance with a previous mutual agreement, in which the Catholic Church joined. The object is to work up a sentiment that will influence legislature this winter. Petitions are being circulated throughout the State of California, asking the Legislature to pass a Sunday law at the present session. The Woman's Christian Temperance Union has the thing in charge, and expects to roll up so large and influential a list of names that the Legislature will not dare ignore the matter. We shall soon see what we shall see.
