In many of the States the Legislatures will have before them this winter the matter of making a Sunday law. Will not our friends help us, and at the same time serve the cause of truth, by telling us all that is being done? We want to make the American Sentinel the guardian of the rights of the people in every quarter; and we shall utter no uncertain sound on all questions that properly come before us. You who know something about the tendency, keep your eyes open and inform us of the doings in your neighborhood, that we may stir up the people.
