# Proceedings of the Early National Reform Conventions.

The *Christian Statesman* advertises for sale three pamphlets which contain the complete reports of three important National Conventions held by National Reformers, namely, in Cincinnati, in 1872, in New York, in 1873, and in Pittsburg, in 1874. We feel like doing a little advertising for National Reform, and so we advise our friends to send sixty cents to the *Christian Statesman,* 1520 Chestnut Street, Philadelphia, and get these three pamphlets. They are worth more than that money to anybody who wants to see for himself, at first hand, just what this professed National Reform is. As proof that the speeches reported in these pamphlets, from which we have again and again quoted, are authority as to what National Reform is, we cite the *Statesman.* It says:—

> "These published reports of addresses give the best summary of arguments on this subject ever published." "These reports sum up all arguments in behalf of this movement. No one can be said to be thoroughly acquainted with the question, unless they are familiar with these addresses. A well-known lecturer on National Reform once said that when he had an address to deliver on the subject, he spent all his time reading these reports, and then spoke out of the fullness of his heart."

We freely advertise these for the *Statesman *and National Reform. We are not paid for it, and have not been asked to do it; but we have so great faith in the justice of the cause which we represent, and in the good sense and patriotism of our readers, that we believe the thing best calculated to set them against this so-called National Reform is to see it just as it is. All that we have been trying to do for the past three years, is to exhibit National Reform just as it is. So buy these pamphlets, study them carefully, and be convinced that the American Sentinel has always told you the truth.
