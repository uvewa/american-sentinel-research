Say what you will, religion and the church cannot be separated. Pure, undefiled religion marks its possessor as a member of the church of Christ; for no one can "keep himself unspotted from the world," unless he is a follower of Christ, and Christ dwells in him. But if this kind of religion marks one as a member of the true church of Christ, any less degree of religion marks its professor as a member of a false church. It is a base imitation of the pure coin. And so religious legislation by the State is church legislation, and that is as much a union of Church and State as has ever existed in the world. National Reformers give to union of Church and State the narrow definition of legislation by the State in favor of a single sect, and then say that they are not in favor of that. Of course they are not; but they boldly declare in favor of legislation in behalf of those principles which all sects hold in common, thus showing that they are in favor of Church and State union in the largest sense.
