The Overton (Neb.) *Clipper* has the following in reference to some lady who is securing signatures to the remonstrance against the Blair bill and kindred measures:—

> "What lunatic asylum has broken loose? Last Sunday an old woman was in town with a petition to Congress to not make a Church and State government of the United States."

To this the Phelps County *Herald* replies as follows:—

> "Evidently the above paper favors a Church and State government. If so, it does not realize its position. Better study history a little, and see what have been the terrible results of a union of Church and State in the past. All honor to the 'old woman'  who is contributing her mite toward keeping Church and State forever separate."

The *Herald* is one of our exchanges, and is posted on National Reform doctrines and methods.
