The *Times* of this city says that "the Paterson Board of Health has decided that where the placing of a green card on a house to indicate the presence of diphtheria on the premises, might diminish the business of a saloon-keeper, the card may be placed on the back door, where the general public will not see it." We do not know how it is in New Jersey towns, but if the object be to place the green card where its presence will the least interfere with business, it would be necessary as a general rule to change the card to the front door one day in the week, namely, on Sunday, in those towns where Sunday-closing is in vogue; because then the back door of the saloon is the avenue of business.
