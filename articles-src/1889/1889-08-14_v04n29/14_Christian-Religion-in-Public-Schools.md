We are opposed to the teaching of the Christian religion in the public schools, not because Christianity is not the true religion, but because the State cannot of right have anything whatever to do with any religion. Religion is defined by Webster to be "Recognition of God as an object of worship, love, and obedience; right feeling toward God, as rightly apprehended; piety." And in the very nature of the case only individuals can love God and have right feelings toward him.

Again. If we recognize the State as having the right to decide for us as to what is the Christian religion, as it must do if it is to be taught in the public schools, we virtually agree to stand by its decision, and for a Christian to agree to stand by the decision of any human authority upon matters of religion, is in effect to agree to apostatize from the faith whenever that authority may demand it. But whenever the State assumes to decide such questions it goes outside of its legitimate sphere, and puts itself in the place of God.
