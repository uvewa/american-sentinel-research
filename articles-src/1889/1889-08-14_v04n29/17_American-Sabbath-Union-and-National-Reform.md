The field secretary of the American Sabbath Union tries to dodge any connection with the National Reform Association, so as to evade an additional point which we make in regard to Sunday laws being religious legislation; but he, himself, was a part of the last National Reform Convention, held in Pittsburg last spring, and made a speech there. Rev. J. P. Mills, a district secretary of several years' standing, of the National Reform Association, is secretary and chief manager of the Ohio State Sabbath Association, which is auxiliary to the National Sabbath Union, and was organized under the direction of the field secretary, Dr. Crafts.

Again, Rev. M. A. Gault is a born and bred National Reformer, and for years has been, and is now a district secretary of the National Reform Association and one of its most active workers. Mr. Gault, with Miss Shaw of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, organized the Missouri State Sunday Law Convention held at Sedalia in May, at which Dr. Crafts was present and made a speech, and where, again, under his direction, a State Sabbath Association for Missouri was organized auxiliary to the National, of which Mr. Crafts is field secretary. And now, we have it on the authority of the Shenandoah *Post,* of Iowa, that "Mr. Gault has been appointed secretary of the Des Moines, Omaha, and Denver districts," and that as such he is now "giving his time to the Sunday-rest movement," and is holding Sunday-law conventions in his districts. Now if Dr. Crafts or anybody else can tell where the American Sabbath Union stops and the National Reform Association begins, we wish he would do it.
