# The Denver “News” on the Blair Bill.

In discussing the question of Sunday legislation, the Denver *News* of June 30 says:—

> “The Blair Sunday bill, which is expected to come before the next Congress and for which petitions are being circulated, can of course only affect such matters as are embraced within Federal jurisdiction. That bill is inspired by a sentiment of religious intolerance, although its friends may be unconscious of the fact. Mr. Crafts disclaims the measure in its present form, but Senator Blair would make the religious phase stronger if he could. The Rev. W. D. Gray, secretary of the Sunday Observance Convention, lately held in Missouri, does not disguise the real character of the movement as he understands it. In a speech made before that body he says: —

> “‘To appeal to divine authority in our legislation would be to fundamentally change the law of our land, or the principle adopted by our fathers when they said that all governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed. I for one do not believe that as a political maxim. I do not believe that governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed; and so the object of this movement is an effort to change that feature of our fundamental law. Jefferson was under the influence of French ideas when the Constitution was framed, and that had something to do with leaving God out of the Constitution. And I think that the provincial history of this country will compel us to come back to that, and recognize God in our Constitution. And I see in this reform a Providence teaching us the necessity of recognizing something else besides the will of the people as the basis of Government.’
> “Such views as the foregoing should kill any attempt to legalize Sunday as a day of rest. The fundamental principle of the Government suits very well, and no interest has enjoyed greater prosperity under its operation than religion. The churches of the United States have a vitality that is not equaled in any other country, and they owe it to the spirit of freedom and to the good sense that cut them entirely loose from the State. The severance cannot be too complete. Religion associated with civil affairs has been too frightful a curse to mankind and too often decimated the race to offer any inducements for such experiments in a land of freemen. A day of rest from toil is a boon that should be preserved, but it will not find legal aid through a measure that implies an Encroachment upon liberty of conscience or any alliance between religion and the State that has been happily dispensed with for a hundred years of unexampled national prosperity.”
The sentiment expressed in the last sentence of this quotation will be better understood in the light of the following words which occur previously in the same article:—

> “The object of such a law should be to limit the sum of Sunday labor, by stopping ordinary business, and it should be more especially directed against corporations and companies that employ persons to do work.

> “Even then the rights of those who from religious motives keep another day should be protected to the utmost, as also the rights of people who attach no religious significance whatever to any day.”
> “The law should be chary of any interference with the individual in his choice of a way for enjoying his Sunday rest. No restriction upon the individual that rests solely upon the religious conviction of another should form a legitimate feature in such a law. In a general sense the rule for measuring the degree of individual liberty should be that point beyond which the rights of others would be affected.”
This would indeed be a very mild Sunday law; much too mild to satisfy the so-called American Sabbath Union. [231-232]

Note.—No papers are sent by the publishers of the American Sentinel to people who have not subscribed for it. If the Sentinel comes to one who has not subscribed for it, he may know that it is sent him by some friend, and that he will not be called upon by the publishers to pay for the same.

The *Times* of this city says that “the Paterson Board of Health has decided that where the placing of a green card on a house to indicate the presence of diphtheria on the premises, might diminish the business of a saloon-keeper, the card may be placed on the back door, where the general public will not see it.” We do not know how it is in New Jersey towns, but if the object be to place the green card where its presence will the least interfere with business, it would be necessary as a general rule to change the card to the front door one day in the week, namely, on Sunday, in those towns where Sunday-closing is in vogue; because then the back door of the saloon is the avenue of business.

The Overton (Neb.) *Clipper* has the following in reference to some lady who is securing signatures to the remonstrance against the Blair bill and kindred measures:—

> “What lunatic asylum has broken loose? Last Sunday an old woman was in town with a petition to Congress to not make a Church and State government of the United States.”

To this the Phelps County *Herald* replies as follows:—

> “Evidently the above paper favors a Church and State government. If so, it does not realize its position. Better study history a little, and see what have been the terrible results of a union of Church and State in the past. All honor to the ‘old woman’  who is contributing her mite toward keeping Church and State forever separate.”

The *Herald* is one of our exchanges, and is posted on National Reform doctrines and methods.

We are opposed to the teaching of the Christian religion in the public schools, not because Christianity is not the true religion, but because the State cannot of right have anything whatever to do with any religion. Religion is defined by Webster to be “Recognition of God as an object of worship, love, and obedience; right feeling toward God, as rightly apprehended; piety.” And in the very nature of the case only individuals can love God and have right feelings toward him.

Again. If we recognize the State as having the right to decide for us as to what is the Christian religion, as it must do if it is to be taught in the public schools, we virtually agree to stand by its decision, and for a Christian to agree to stand by the decision of any human authority upon matters of religion, is in effect to agree to apostatize from the faith whenever that authority may demand it. But whenever the State assumes to decide such questions it goes outside of its legitimate sphere, and puts itself in the place of God.

It is urged by the advocates of Sunday laws that they do not infringe the rights of conscience, because while they forbid work on Sunday they do not forbid the keeping of another day also. But is this true? God has said, “Six days shalt thou labor and do all thy work.” This at least gives all permission to work six days out of each seven. The divine law also says, “The seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God; in it thou shalt not do any work.” One man reads that commandment and says, That requires me to keep the definite seventh day of the week. Another says, That means that I shall work six days and rest one; any stated day will do. The first man keeps Saturday, the seventh day of the weekly cycle. The second man keeps Sunday, the first day of the week. The State steps in and says to the first man, “You may keep the seventh day if you wish, but you must also keep the first day.” Does it not, by thus depriving him of one-sixth of his God-given time for labor, to all intents and purposes fine him for acting according to his convictions of duty?

The *Christian Nation* of July 17 says:—

> “The enemies of the Sabbath and friends of the liquor traffic, are doing their utmost to make the Cincinnati Sabbath observance law odious, so as to secure its repeal. The mayor of the city has issued an order closing up all places of business and stopping all vocations that are not strictly necessary. This is an old scheme of the liquor men—a retaliatory measure—which often causes the whole law to go by default.”

Well, the very object of the law is said to be to stop all vocations and business that are not strictly necessary. The petition for a National Sunday law in this respect only excepts work of “r*eal* necessity.” Then, if the law is good, how is it possible to make it odious by enforcing it? Let the reader imagine, if he can, how strictly laws against murder, manslaughter, assault and battery, and theft, would have to be enforced to be made odious. Such a thing is impossible. Such laws cannot be made odious by enforcing them. Their very virtue lies in the strictest enforcement possible. Any law that can be made odious by enforcement is a bad law, and Sunday laws everywhere are made odious always by a uniform enforcement; consequently all Sunday laws are bad laws and ought to be repealed.

The field secretary of the American Sabbath Union tries to dodge any connection with the National Reform Association, so as to evade an additional point which we make in regard to Sunday laws being religious legislation; but he, himself, was a part of the last National Reform Convention, held in Pittsburg last spring, and made a speech there. Rev. J. P. Mills, a district secretary of several years’ standing, of the National Reform Association, is secretary and chief manager of the Ohio State Sabbath Association, which is auxiliary to the National Sabbath Union, and was organized under the direction of the field secretary, Dr. Crafts.

Again, Rev. M. A. Gault is a born and bred National Reformer, and for years has been, and is now a district secretary of the National Reform Association and one of its most active workers. Mr. Gault, with Miss Shaw of the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union, organized the Missouri State Sunday Law Convention held at Sedalia in May, at which Dr. Crafts was present and made a speech, and where, again, under his direction, a State Sabbath Association for Missouri was organized auxiliary to the National, of which Mr. Crafts is field secretary. And now, we have it on the authority of the Shenandoah *Post,* of Iowa, that “Mr. Gault has been appointed secretary of the Des Moines, Omaha, and Denver districts,” and that as such he is now “giving his time to the Sunday-rest movement,” and is holding Sunday-law conventions in his districts. Now if Dr. Crafts or anybody else can tell where the American Sabbath Union stops and the National Reform Association begins, we wish he would do it.

There is an item of business that we should like for the field secretary of the American Sabbath Union to explain. In Portland, Oregon, in the First Congregational Church, July 22, there was placed in the slips of the pews, the following petition to be signed:— *“To the United States Senate:*

> “The undersigned, adult residents of the United States, twenty-one years of age and more, hereby earnestly petition your honorable body to pass a bill forbidding in the Nation’s mail and military service and in inter-State commerce, and in the District of Columbia and the Territories, all Sunday traffic and work, except works of religion and works of real necessity and mercy.”

We picked up in that church one of these blank petitions which we now have. Mr Crafts went from Portland to Puget Sound, and at Tacoma he circulated the following petition:—

> “The undersigned organizations, and adult residents (21 years of age or more) of the United States, hereby earnestly petition your honorable body to pass a bill forbidding, in the Nation’s mail and military service and inter-State commerce, and in the District of Columbia and the Territories, all Sunday traffic and work, except works of religion and works of real necessity and mercy, and such private work by those who religiously and regularly observe another day of the week by abstaining from labor and business, as will neither interfere with the general rest nor with public worship.”

Now why is this thus? Why do they circulate these two kinds of petitions? Why do they in one petition propose to exempt those who religiously and regularly observe another day of the week, and in the other petition make no sign of any such exemption? Not that we are in favor of such exemption, for we favor no exemption from the workings of Sunday laws unless it be uniform, and exempt everybody who does not want to obey the law. We only ask for information, why do they circulate these two kinds of petitions? And the columns of the Sentinel are open for the field secretary, or any other one in authority, to answer.

We are requested to state that on or about the 7th of March last, George D. McKinstry, a young man eighteen years of age, left Healdsburg, this State, to return to his home at Binghampton, Cal., and has not been heard of since. No cause can be assigned for his sudden disappearance and prolonged absence. Any information as to the young man’s whereabouts, either now or at any time since his disappearance, will be thankfully received by his father, H. H. McKinstry, Binghampton, Cal. [233]
