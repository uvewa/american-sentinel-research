# The Blair Amendment.

To those who think that the Sentinel’s strictures on the Blair Bills are partisan or sectarian, we commend the following on the Blair Educational Amendment to the Constitution. It is an editorial utterance of the San Francisco *Chronicle* of December 27, 1888, and no candid, thinking person can deny that it is a just criticism. The very same criticism, in part, was made upon this bill in the American Sentinel of last July

Senator Blair, of New Hampshire, has presented an amendment to the Federal Constitution, concerning the establishment of a national educational system, the provisions of which are briefly as follows:—

Section 1 provides that no State shall ever make or maintain any law respecting an establishment of religon, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.

Section 2 makes it obligatory on every State to establish and maintain a system of free public schools for the education of children “in the common branches of knowledge, and in virtue, morality, and the principles of the Christian religion,” but with an inhibition against the teaching of sectarian tenets, beliefs, ceremonials, or observances.

Section 3 provides that the United States shall guarantee to every State the support and maintenance of such a system of free schools as is provided for in the previous sections; and section 4 provides that Congress shall enforce the amendment by legislation when necessary.

It will be apparent that the proposed amendment is at variance with the spirit, at least, of the existing first amendment to the Constitution, which declares that “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion.” Undoubtedly the purpose of that amendment was to forbid any such union of Church and State as has obtained in Great Britain and other countries, and the Blair amendment does not, in terms, interfere with it; but can it be denied that it seeks to do indirectly what cannot be done directly under the Constitution? Where an article of the organic law provides that a certain thing shall be taught in the common schools of every State in the Union, is it not a mere evasion to say that it is [37] not an establishment of that particular thing by authority of law?

Suppose, for example, that the Constitution forbade the recognition by the State of the laws of mathematics. Would not an amendment which directed that the multiplication table be taught in every common school in the land, at the same time pledging the United States to the support and maintenance of such schools, be a repeal, or, at any rate, a palpable evasion of the prohibition against mathematics?

Without seeking to enter upon any polemical discussion, it is beyond controversy that the “principles of the Christian religion” must involve the divinity of Christ; for, so far as the purely ethical doctrines are concerned, they are common, to a greater or less degree, to all religions, and may, indeed, be found in certain philosophical systems which lay no claim to being considered religions at all. Senator Blair, then, would have every common school in the United States teach children, between the ages of six and sixteen, that Christ was divine. But if this be done, how can the conclusion be avoided that the United States has adopted a State religion? and what becomes of the rights of those of her citizens who believe otherwise?

The question is a serious one, and it cannot be left for decision solely to those who already believe in the Christian religion. They have, under the law, every right to believe; but their neighbors, who may be fire-worshipers, or Mohammedans, or Agnostics, have, under the same law, an equal right to disbelieve; and the question is, whether it is consistent with the idea of a Government which has always disavowed any union between Church and State to insist that all the children of the Nation shall be instructed in the principles of any religion, no matter what its intrinsic value or claims upon the world may be. Virtue and morality are one thing, the principles of the Christian religion another; and it behooves us to pause and reflect before we consent to such an innovation in legislation as the Blair Amendment proposes.
