In his speech at the Pittsburg National Reform Convention, the Rev. I. N. Hays said: "We are practically a Christian Nation without Christ." How such a thing as that can be practical, we are not informed. But that is the only sort of Christian Nation we shall ever have. True, so- called National Reformers may succeed in putting the name of Christ in the Constitution, but that will affect the case no more, practically, than putting the name of Christ into a spelling book would make a boy religious.

Again he said: "It is no less our duty than our privilege, to bring the crown royal and place it on the head of King Jesus." It is, in fact, nothing but overweening [38] self-conceit and presumption that would lead a man seriously to propose such a thing. Every king who receives his crown  from another, must necessarily be inferior to that other. The king who himself takes that which is his own by right, is independent; but the one who is indebted to another, is subject to limitations. And so this so-called National Reform movement, by presuming to win a kingdom for Christ, and to crown him as king, virtually places itself above God, who alone has power to remove kings and set up kings. In this it proclaims itself a true child of the Papacy.
