# The Blair Bills and National Reform.

The *Christian Statesman,* of December 27, 1888, in an editorial article entitled, "A Frank and Earnest Word to Our Friends," which is simply an appeal for pecuniary help, based on the progress of National Reform work, says:—

> "Since the last annual meeting, and since the foregoing appeal was made, several remarkable events have transpired which greatly strengthen the argument to increased liberality. A bill to provide for the nation a National Sabbath law has been introduced into the Senate of the United States, and two important hearings in support of it have been held before one of the most important of the Senate Committees. The school question has been brought into unexpected prominence by stirring and remarkable controversies in Boston and Pittsburg; and this discussion has also been lifted to the floor of the National Legislature by the proposed Constitutional Amendment respecting establishments of religion and free public schools! Both of these measures involve the principles of National Christianity, and both afford such an opportunity for the discussion of these principles before the nation as was never before known in her entire history. They who have eyes to see, and ears to hear, cannot fail to perceive the immense significance of these and similar occurences."

Note this. It is the indorsement of the Blair bills by the official organ of the National Reform Association. The Blair bills, says the *Statesman, *"involve the principles of National Christianity," which is what it and the National Reform Association desires. Therefore all who favor the Blair bills are in reality "National Reformers," although they may not have joined that Association. Let it be understood that when we speak of National Reformers, we include the National Sunday Association and the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, which has also given its official indorsement of the Sunday-Rest bill, and indeed of both. What is known as National Reform, is a great deal larger than the National Reform Association.
