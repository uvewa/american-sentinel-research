A gentleman in Ohio, a county official, in returning a list of signatures to the petition remonstrating against the passage of the Blair bill, says: "There would be no trouble here in our place to find enough signers to fill another such petition. The citizens, with myself, feel fully satisfied to let well enough alone, many having expressed themselves satisfied with the wisdom of our forefathers, in giving to us a Constitution insuring religious liberty to all." There are thousands of others throughout the country who feel just the same way.
