We are told by National Reformers that they do not want Church and State, but only National Christianity; that they do not want the State to enforce the tenets of any one sect, but to enforce only those principles which are common to all. Well, this is all that was done in the days of Constantine. There were many factions among professed Christians in his day, beside those championed by Athanasius and Arius. He did not incorporate into the laws the peculiar tenets of any faction, but assembled all the bishops, and adopted that upon which they all agreed. He simply enforced the principles of the Christian religion, as enunciated by the majority of the bishops. Yet everybody points to Constantine's action as the great union of Church and State. National Reformers want the same thing done again. As his action resulted in the establishment of the Papacy, so their action will result in something exactly like the Papacy.
