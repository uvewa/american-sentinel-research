There are more anomalies in this Sunday-law business than a Philadelphia lawyer could study out in a life time. They tell us that a Sunday law is needed in order to give working men a day of rest; and then they tell us that their Sunday law is simply a temperance measure, to close up the saloons on the day when everybody is idle. Queer, isn't it? In changing its color to suit circumstances, Sunday-law argument discounts the chameleon, by long odds.
