# Papal Impudence.

The following item from Montreal, dated January 11, shows the aggressive impudence of the Roman hierarchy in all its native ugliness:—

> “A sensation in political and religious circles has been caused here by the action of Cardinal Taschereau, in demanding and receiving a place in Parliament equal in rank and dignity to that of the Lieutenant-Governor and the direct representative of the Queen. Before Parliament opened, invitations were sent to the Cardinal and his clergy to be present at the formal opening yesterday. His Eminence replied to Coleman, usher of the Black Rod Hall, refusing to accept the first seat on the floor, which had been assigned him, demanding, as a right of the representative of the Pope, and according to the rules of the Church of Rome, that he be seated on equality with, and directly opposite the representative of the Queen.

> “The speaker of the Senate had a consultation with Premier Mercier, and the conclusion was come to that the Prince of the Church had to have what he demanded, or the vengeance of the Church would be visited upon the heads of the Government in no light manner.
> “Couriers hastened to inform his Eminence that no slight was intended, and that a provision would [35] be made for him in the Senate such as he desired. A throne, similar to the one upon which the Queen’s representative sits, was hastily constructed, and when the legislative body opened, the Cardinal and his body-guard of prelates were seated on the right, and on the same dais with the representatives of the Queen, and directly under the English royal arms, where they were saluted by the members of the Senate in consort to the salutations given to the Speaker, and treated with the same consideration as the Queen’s officers were.”
Such overwhelming impudence can be equalled only by the toadyism of the speaker and the prime minister. It is very evident that Cardinal Taschereau knows very little, and cares still less, about the Saviour’s instruction to take the lowest place when bidden to a feast, so that he may be called up higher. He doesn’t propose to take any chances; he might not be invited up, and so he strikes for the highest place, perfectly sure of his ability to keep it when he has gained it.

It makes one indignant to see *men* so pitifully afraid. It would be a great relief to find some official with enough backbone to tell even “the prince of the church,” that if he didn’t like the place assigned him he could stay away. But then,— there is that contemptible fear of losing office. Yes, the Pope rules in the Queen’s dominions, no less than in the Vatican. How long will it be before his Cardinals will not permit the Queen’s representatives to sit on the same level with them.

Cannot Americans learn a lesson from this? Will they not be warned by such manifestations of Romish aggressiveness? What has been done in Canada may be repeated in this country. Would our officials meet it in any different spirit?
