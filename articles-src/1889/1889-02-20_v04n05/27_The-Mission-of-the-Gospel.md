It is not the business of Christian missions to convert the world, that is, to lead all nations to accept of Christianity. In the divine plan, Christians are to preach the gospel, to persuade men, to be the means, under God, of gathering "o*ut of" *the nations "a people for his name." Acts 15: 14. And that disciple who does this in God's way, who, aided by the Spirit, preaches the word, shows men their lost condition, instructs them in the way of life, persuades them to accept of the only Saviour, Christ Jesus, and thus is the means of saving a few souls from their sins,—that missionary's work is a success. His mission is not a failure. The mission of Christ to Tyre and Sidon, although but one person's heart was reached, and that a poor Canaanite, was a success. Mark 7: 24-31. Paul's mission to Lystra was as much a success as it was at Berea or Corinth. The world will not be purified of wickedness till Christ comes; it is our mission as Christians to warn and persuade men to flee from the wrath to come and to accept of Christ. And when the redeemed are gathered "o*ut of* every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation," the work will be wholly a success. Christ's triumph will then be complete.
