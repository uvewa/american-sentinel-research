# How Sunday-Law Sentiment Is Manufactured.

When the Sunday-Law petitions were being presented to the Senate, January 16, Mr. Blair arose and made the following presentation, which we copy from the *Congressional Record* of January 17:—

> "Mr. Blair: I present petitions of several bodies, praying for the passage of a Sunday-rest law. Of the petitions, the following analysis is submitted by those who desire their presentation:—

*Petitions from national bodies.*

Contents:

> "Analysis of the latter:

> "First indorsement is that of the American Sabbath Union, which was officially constituted by official action of the General Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church, the Home Missionary Society of the Baptist Church, the General Assemblies of the Presbyterian Church (North and South), and the Synod of the Reformed Church, five denominations whose membership together is 5,977,693. Of the membership of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, the indorsement of whose international convention stands second, at least 20,000 citizens of the United States. Of the Knights of Labor, the indorsement of whose international convention stands third, at least 219,000 citizens of the United States. The Presbyterian General Assembly, North, whose action stands next, had at the time of the indorsement 722,071 members. The convention of Christian Workers, whose indorsement is next, had 450 present when the unanimous vote of indorsement was taken. The Woman's Christian Temperance Union, which comes next, had 185,521 at the time of the vote. The Roman Catholics, for whom Cardinal Gibbons speaks, number 7,200,000."
From this official analysis it appears, that of the alleged 14,174,337 signatures to the Sundaylaw petitions, only 407 were actual signatures. This is too insignificant a portion to be noted, so that practically the whole number was secured by vote.

Now let us look a little closely at the votes by which this number of alleged signatures was obtained. Take the Knights of Labor Assembly. That assembly, it is true, was a representative body. But the members of that body were elected to represent the organization in all questions pertaining to the government and policy of the organization, and not to represent the personal opinions of all the individual members, on matters foreign to the working of the organization. They were not elected for the purpose of acting on any such question as the enactment of a Sunday law. Therefore, when they voted on the petition which Mr. Crafts submitted to them, they did so only as individuals. If we knew how many men there were present at that meeting of the General Assembly of the Knights of Labor, and how many of them voted, we could tell just how many Knights of Labor have indorsed the Sunday-law petition.

We know that there are Thousands of Workingmen and Knights of Labor who are opposed to a Sunday law of any kind; yet they are, against their will, paraded as favoring one. We say again, that the action of that Assembly could no more be taken as showing how the great body of Knights of Labor stand on the Sunday question, than similar action concerning religion or politics could have shown to what church or political party all the members adhere.

The same may be said of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, and also of the various religious organizations that are paraded. We say this advisedly, for we know that very many members of each of the churches mentioned have, *with their own hands,* signed counter petitions. These are facts, and people who have a love for truth and justice should see to it that they are set before the law-makers in their proper light, to undo, as far as possible, the false impression that has been made as to the strength of Sunday-law sentiment.

The way in which these petitions have been handled, stamps the whole thing as un-American. The leaders in this affair have deprived the people of a fair representation. Their action is more adapted to an aristocracy, or a despotism, than a Republic. If they do not know that their whole procedure was fraudulent, then so much the worse for them. It shows that they have so far imbibed the spirit of Papal Rome that they can no longer appreciate the genius of American liberty. Certain it is that an abominable fraud has been perpetrated in order to boom the Sunday-law bill; and we intend to cry aloud, and spare not.
