The following we quote, italics and all, from "Neander's History of the Christian Religion and Church":—

> "If the reign of Constantine *bears witness that the State which seeks to advance Christianity by the worldly means at its command, may be the occasion of more injury to this holy cause than the earthly power which opposes it with whatever virulence,* this truth is still more clearly demonstrated by the reign of his successor Constantius."— *Volume 2, Section 1, Page 31.*

It would be a good thing if National Reformers would study church history for a little while.
