The Springfield (Ill.) *Journal* of January 24, contained the following item:—

> "Mr. Brokoski has prepared a bill in relation to Sunday closing, which he probably will introduce in the House to-day. It provides for the closing of all business houses, factories, and other places of employment on the first day of the week. The publication and circulation of Sunday newspapers, the running of Sunday street-cars and railroad trains, and the keeping open of drug stores exclusively for the sale of medicines, however, are permitted by the provisions of the bill, but cigar and tobacco stores and barber shops are required to be closed."

The Illinois Sunday Association is a very active organization, and will doubtless make every effort possible for the passage of this bill, or a similar one. We shall keep the readers of the Sentinel informed as to whatever action is taken in regard to the matter.
