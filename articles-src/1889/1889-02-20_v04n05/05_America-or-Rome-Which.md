# America or Rome, Which?

A dispatch from Haverhill, Mass., dated January 18, says:—

> “The French parochial school here, of which Rev. Father Boucher is in charge, is in trouble with the City School Committee, because it does not comply with the law. The law is that the English language must be the vehicle of instruction in all schools, public or private, and that United States history shall form part of the curriculum.

> “In Father Boucher’s school, which has two hundred and fifty pupils, two-thirds of the instruction is in French. A French history of Canada takes the place of a history of the United States. The teachers are ignorant of the methods in vogue in the American public schools.
> “Father Boucher has declined to bring his school up to the requirements of the law. The School Committee have ordered the truant officers to carry out the law; that is, to bring into court all parties who send their children to the unlawful school. This is the first case under the law governing private schools, and the case promises to be one of wide-spread interest.
This is a sample of the un-American policy of the Roman Catholic Church. Why should it be expected, in its schools, to follow the methods in vogue in American public schools, when it is Roman, and not American? We are saying nothing against individuals. There are men in the Catholic communion who are as loyal Americans as can be found in the country; but the Catholic Church, as a church, is as directly opposed to everything that is distinctively American, as anything can be. Let the Catholic Church have the power, and everything which has made the name “America” a synonym for freedom, would vanish at once.

It is time that the American people were beginning to awake to the encroachments of Romanism, and to the danger to our liberties. It is true that there is a sort of awakening, and a protest, but we are sure that the very ones who spoke so decidedly in Boston a few weeks ago, will, with few exceptions, sit still while Rome is gaining, in another guise, just what she wants. Indeed many of them will further her claims. How? Simply by working for the Blair Educational Amendment bill. Let it be once conceded that each State should provide for religious instruction in its public schools, and it will be absolutely impossible to prevent just such a condition of things as is complained of in Haverhill, Mass. A few words will suffice to make this plain.

It is a well-known fact that in many States the Roman Catholics are more numerous than any other sect. In no less than fourteen States they are more numerous than all other denominations combined. In California there are more than four times as many Roman Catholics as there are Protestants of all denominations. Now if the Constitution shall require that the Bible and religion be taught in the public schools of each State, it is evident that that form of religion which has the most followers will be taught in the schools. If the Blair Educational Amendment becomes a part of our Constitution, the majority of the schools in California, and in many other States, will teach, not American history, but Catholic history.

At the National Reform Convention that was held in Saratoga in July, 1887, it was plainly declared that no objections would be made to the teaching of the Douay Bible—the Catholic version—in the schools where the Catholics had a majority. Thus the National Reform Association has committed itself. But let everybody know that it will be a great deal more than a question of what version of the Bible shall be used. Let the principle of religious legislation be once established, let it be conceded that any kind of religion whatever may be taught in the public schools, and Roman Catholic history and Roman Catholic methods will very soon drive out American teaching and American methods. Are the American people ready for this state of things? Can they calmly contemplate such a result? If not, let them with all their might oppose the National Reform movement, as it has taken shape in the Senate bills framed and introduced by Senator Blair.
