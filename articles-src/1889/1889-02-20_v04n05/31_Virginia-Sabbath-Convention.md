The Virginia correspondent of the New York *Examiner* (Baptist) writes as follows to the issue of that paper dated January 24:—

> "It looks now as if the Christian people of Virginia are marshaling their forces for making battle on the Sabbath question. Richmond has its local evangelical alliance, and several of its meetings have been devoted to a discussion of this grave and perplexing problem. Christian people of all names seem to agree that we have fallen upon perilous times; that the old reverence for the Sabbath has fallen into decay, and that business and pleasure, as well as vice, seem bent on blotting the Sabbath from our calendar, or, at any rate, in diverting it from its sacred and economic uses. The indications at present point to the holding of a State Sabbath Convention, and if this is done it will be with a view of putting Virginia in line with the National Sabbath Union."

So the ball keeps rolling. We ask all who read the above to take particular notice to see if they can find anything in it about temperance or the working men. Does it say that the battle is to be waged for temperance or labor? Not at all. They are "marshaling their forces for making battle on the Sabbath question." And that's just what it is everywhere.
