The *Christian Herald* (Baptist) of Detroit, Mich., has a notice of the American Sentinel, in its issue of December 27, in which it says:—

> "Of course it [the Sentinel] is greatly exercised over the National Sunday bill now before the United States Senate. Its alarmed opposition is hard to account for if it is in favor of the quiet of the Sabbath, and the right of all men to rest on that day. For it is the common principle of all laws on the subject, to respect conscientious belief of seventh-day persons and communities, leaving them free to observe either day, but not to desecrate both. Shall the laws attempt to guard the Sabbath for their small fraction of citizens, or for both?"

For neither. The Sabbath doesn't need any guarding by the laws of the State. The Government of the United States should be for the people of the United States, and not for the Sabbath. The *Herald* talks as though Sunday laws guard the seventh day for those who wish to observe it. Would it say so if the case were reversed? Not by any means. We don't know of any law favoring seventh-day observance, and we don't know of anybody who wants one. But here is a proposition which we believe is sound: If laws enjoining the observance of the first day of the week, yet making exceptions in favor of those who observe the seventh day, can be construed as guarding the rights of seventh-day people to rest, then certainly, with no law at all on the subject, Sunday sacredness would be amply guarded.
