The National Reformers claim that they do not want any union of Church and State, and then they give their definition of Church and State union. They say that if the State should single out any denomination and enforce its tenets, that would be a union of Church and State. They indignantly deny that their proposal to unite Christianity and the State is anything like Church and State union. But if they were talking on religion alone, they would accuse anyone of bigotry who should single out any denomination, and should say that it was *the church.* They would claim that the Church of Christ is composed of all who believe in him, whatever name they bear. Thus they are inconsistent. For while they really believe that the Church of Christ consists of all believers, so that it is as extensive as Christianity, they virtually, in their definition of Church and State union, say that the Church of Christ is only one denomination. We wish they would make a plain statement, once for all, of what they do regard as the Church.
