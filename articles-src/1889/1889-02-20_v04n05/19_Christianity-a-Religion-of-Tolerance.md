# Christianity a Religion of Tolerance.

If any one might use constraint, Christ might, as the works he performed in the course of his ministry demonstrated that his mission was divine; yet, when surrounded with the glory of miraculous power, and when offering eternal life to creatures over whom he had an absolute control, what a tender and scrupulous regard did he show to their liberty. "If any man *thirst"* said he, "let him come to me and drink." "Blessed are they that *hunger and thirst* after righteousness, for *they* shall be filled." "And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will *draw* all men unto me." Behold I stand at the door and knock; if any man *hear my voice and open the door,* I will come in;" they are thieves and robbers who break open doors and enter by force.

When God's annointed King sent forth his ambassadors among the nations, they proclaimed Jesus as the Messiah, warning every man and teaching every man—they spoke the truth in love—and knowing the terrors of the Lord, persuaded men. Their ministry, indeed, was a warfare, but it was a benevolent one; its object was not to maim the persons or injure the estates of men, but to enlighten and sanctify their minds.

As coercing men into a profession of religion, is totally repugnant to the spirit, precepts, and precedents of Christianity, so it has been a source of many crimes and calamities. At the sanguinary shrine of persecution, thousands of the most estimable members of society have been wantonly sacrificed. How many of whom the world was not worthy, have wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins, being destitute, afflicted, tormented—how many have endured mockings and scourgings, bonds and imprisonments; have been stoned, sawn asunder, or slain with the sword!

If this infernal frenzy which has hurled men to the commission of so many impious atrocities, be curable, its cure ought to be attempted; and in the attempt, every man who is not inspired with ill will to his neighbor ought to co-operate.

For this purpose we ought, in the composure of reason and reflection, to store our minds with just ideas on the subject, lest, under the impetus of mistaken zeal, or the deception of specious names and fair pretenses, we should be induced to speak unadvisedly, or act illiberally.—*History of Intolerance.*
