# A Theological Sanitary Arrangement.

The preachers who are striving so zealously for the passage of National and State Sunday laws, very frequently assure us that they have no thought of making men religious; that all they want is “a sanitary arrangement,” “a police regulation,” etc. If they continue their attempts to substitute civil laws for the preaching of the gospel, we shall have no difficulty in believing that the last thing in their thoughts is the making of men religious. But while we readily believe that they are losing their desire to make men really religious, we cannot absolve them from the charge of wishing to make men outwardly *act* as though they were religious. To show our reason for this, we will cite a case in point.

At the recent Sunday-law meeting in Oakland, Doctor Dwindle was very careful to state that they did not want to make men religious. All they wanted, he said, was a sanitary arrangement, a police regulation. Yet in his speech and in his prayer he stated that they wanted the Sunday to be not simply a day of physical rest, but one of spiritual upbuilding. Doctor Briggs spent nearly all his time in trying to make the audience believe that Sunday is the true Sabbath of the Bible; and the appeal of the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union is for a Sabbath law that will be in harmony with the fourth commandment.

Now the question arises, If it is only a police regulation, a sanitary arrangement, that they are after, why refer to the Bible so much? and why make such labored efforts to show that the Sunday is the Sabbath of the Bible? Is it customary to preach sermons and read theological essays, when it is desired to improve the sanitary condition of the city? We never knew of any such ado over a city ordinance, such as prohibiting peddlers from vending their wares without a license, or draining the stagnant water from a cesspool. What a peculiar sanitary arrangement they want—one the necessity for which has thus far escaped the notice of every Board of Health in the United States. Dear reverend gentlemen, you will have to drop your theological argument entirely before we can give any credit to your pretensions of desiring only a sanitary arrangement.

In his speech at the Pittsburg National Reform Convention, the Rev. I. N. Hays said: “We are practically a Christian Nation without Christ.” How such a thing as that can be practical, we are not informed. But that is the only sort of Christian Nation we shall ever have. True, so- called National Reformers may succeed in putting the name of Christ in the Constitution, but that will affect the case no more, practically, than putting the name of Christ into a spelling book would make a boy religious.

Again he said: “It is no less our duty than our privilege, to bring the crown royal and place it on the head of King Jesus.” It is, in fact, nothing but overweening [38] self-conceit and presumption that would lead a man seriously to propose such a thing. Every king who receives his crown  from another, must necessarily be inferior to that other. The king who himself takes that which is his own by right, is independent; but the one who is indebted to another, is subject to limitations. And so this so-called National Reform movement, by presuming to win a kingdom for Christ, and to crown him as king, virtually places itself above God, who alone has power to remove kings and set up kings. In this it proclaims itself a true child of the Papacy.
