Christianity is much more disparaged by being confounded with dragooning apostles, holy wars, and penal statutes, than by all the jests, quirks, and slanders with which profane witlings have assailed it. But how do they read the New Testament, who confound things so unlike to each other? Light has as much to do with darkness, as the genius of Christianity has with that of intolerance.—*Thomas Clarke.*
