The *Christian Statesman* says that the Blair Bills, "involve the principles of National Christianity." Well, that's all that they had in Constantine's time, and in the centuries following. Christianity is simply the Christian religion. An organized company of professors of Christianity constitutes a local church. So when Christianity shall become national,—when the Nations shall, through its laws, profess Christianity,—we shall have simply a National Church, nothing more nor less. There was never in this world a more complete union of Church and State than would result from the adoption of the measures proposed by Senator Blair.
