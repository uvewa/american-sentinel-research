# A Word from the Workingmen.

We have before us a copy of *Ideas of Reform, *of Jan. 1, 1889, a paper published at Broken Bow, Nebraska, and devoted to the interests of the  workingman. It is in every sense of the word a labor reform paper, and is as outspoken against monopolies of every description, and the oppression of the laboring man by soulless capital, as any labor paper that we have ever seen. We state these points, so that full weight may be given to the following, which we take from one of its editorials:—

> "Fourteen million people have petitioned Congress, asking for the enforcement of a Sunday-law. This is evidently preliminary to an attempt to unite the Church and State. A halt should be called at once. Religion, by faith in God, is good, and no Christian, under our Constitution, is deprived of the privilege of observing Sunday as strictly as he desires. Religion, by law, by force, without conversion, is bad, and contrary to the principles of good government. . . . The United States Constitution says: 'Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.' Our petitioners would in substance say: 'Do away with the Constitution, and give us a law that we may imprison or fine every one whom we have been unable to convert to our faith, and who does not give tribute to our support.' Now, if this clamor for a Sunday law, coupled with the Blair Educational Bill—which advocates the teaching of the Christian religion in public schools—is not an attempt to unite the Church and State, neither was the act of Constantine in making Christianity the recognized religion of the Roman Empire. It is hardly time to allow 14,000,000 people to dictate how 60,000,000 people shall worship, in a free country like ours."

By this extract two claims of the Sunday-law National Reform advocates are shown to be false. The first is that their movement is in the interest of the workingman. We have always emphatically denied this, and have demonstrated the untruthfulness of it; but here is a demonstration that even the most obtuse can comprehend. When the most outspoken Labor Reform papers condemn the whole National Reform Sunday-law movement in such unmeasured terms, that movement cannot be said to be very much of a workingman's affair; for it will be conceded that the workingmen are competent to decide what will be to their interest.

Another fallacy that is exposed, is the idea that the vote taken at the General Assembly of the Knights of Labor committed all the laboring men in the country to the support of the Blair bills. It did nothing of the kind. There are thousands of laboring men in this country who do not propose to be put up in the market and sold to the National Sunday Association. That Association has attempted to convey the impression that a Sunday law would fill a long-felt want, and that everybody has been clamoring for it, when in fact the majority of the people don't know or care whether there is one or not.

*Ideas of Reform* says that it is hardly time to allow 14,000,000 people to dictate how 60,000,000 shall worship. True enough; and that principle appears still more strongly when we remember that there are actually only about one-eighth of fourteen millions of people really represented in that Sunday-law petition.
