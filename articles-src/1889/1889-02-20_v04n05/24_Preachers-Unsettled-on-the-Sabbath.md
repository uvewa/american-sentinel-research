The *Examiner's* Virginia correspondent, after stating that steps are being taken towards holding a State Sabbath Convention, says that "the weak point in the Sabbath discussion seems to be in the lack of definite conviction on the part of some of the preachers. They do not appear to have reached settled views as to the Christian Sabbath." Well, if the preachers are indifferent because of a lack of settled views on the subject, why should we be censured for being opposed, when we *have *settled views on the subject? We don't blame them, however, for being unsettled in their views, since there is nothing to settle them.
