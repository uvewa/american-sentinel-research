# A Theological Sanitary Arrangement.

The preachers who are striving so zealously for the passage of National and State Sunday laws, very frequently assure us that they have no thought of making men religious; that all they want is "a sanitary arrangement," "a police regulation," etc. If they continue their attempts to substitute civil laws for the preaching of the gospel, we shall have no difficulty in believing that the last thing in their thoughts is the making of men religious. But while we readily believe that they are losing their desire to make men really religious, we cannot absolve them from the charge of wishing to make men outwardly *act* as though they were religious. To show our reason for this, we will cite a case in point.

At the recent Sunday-law meeting in Oakland, Doctor Dwinelle was very careful to state that they did not want to make men religious. All they wanted, he said, was a sanitary arrangement, a police regulation. Yet in his speech and in his prayer he stated that they wanted the Sunday to be not simply a day of physical rest, but one of spiritual upbuilding. Doctor Briggs spent nearly all his time in trying to make the audience believe that Sunday is the true Sabbath of the Bible; and the appeal of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union is for a Sabbath law that will be in harmony with the fourth commandment.

Now the question arises, If it is only a police regulation, a sanitary arrangement, that they are after, why refer to the Bible so much? and why make such labored efforts to show that the Sunday is the Sabbath of the Bible? Is it customary to preach sermons and read theological essays, when it is desired to improve the sanitary condition of the city? We never knew of any such ado over a city ordinance, such as prohibiting peddlers from vending their wares without a license, or draining the stagnant water from a cesspool. What a peculiar sanitary arrangement they want—one the necessity for which has thus far escaped the notice of every Board of Health in the United States. Dear reverend gentlemen, you will have to drop your theological argument entirely before we can give any credit to your pretensions of desiring only a sanitary arrangement.
