# "Cunning Craftiness."

On Sunday, January 20, Rev. W. F. Crafts preached in Washington, in Dr. Sunderland's church, the First Presbyterian. His subject, of course, was "The American Sabbath." In the beginning of his discourse he stated that the present agitation was not brought about by the churches, but by the clamor of the workingmen everywhere, in behalf of a weekly rest-day. That sounds very well, until you hear testimony on the other side. The fact is that Mr. Crafts attended the General Assembly of the Knights of Labor, and spoke for an hour in behalf of the National Sunday-Rest bill. Then he spent another hour answering questions, and at the close the petition was indorsed by vote. Now if those workingmen had been clamoring for a Sunday law, why should Mr. Crafts spend two hours of his valuable time, besides the time and expense of travel, to convince them that they ought to have one? Can anyone tell?

Again, he visited the National Council of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, and had a similar experience. He spoke for an hour, and then for another hour answered the questions that were showered upon him. Yet the *Daily Union Signal,* of October 22, 1888, in which this item is found, prefaced it by saying: "A great victory for Sabbath observance was won by Rev. W. F. Crafts, Thursday. He appeared before the National Convention of the Brotherhood of Engineers, in session at Richmond, Va., and spoke an hour in behalf of the National Sabbath movement," etc. Now if these men had been frantically clamoring for a Sunday law, wherein did the victory consist? If the workingmen are so anxious to have a Sunday law, why does Mr. Crafts spend so much time trying to work them up to sign his petition? Isn't there a little discrepancy between Mr. Crafts's statement and his actions?

The fact is that nothing was ever heard of any desire on the part of the workingmen for a Sunday law, until the National Reform Association and the Woman's Christian Union stirred it up, and the clamor has all come from them. There are thousands of workingmen in the country who have no thanks to give to Mr. Crafts and his fellow-craftsmen for their disinterested (?) efforts in their behalf. On the contrary, they repudiate the whole affair as a very *crafty* piece of business.
