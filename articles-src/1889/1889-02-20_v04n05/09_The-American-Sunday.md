# The American Sunday.

The “American Sunday” and the “American Sabbath” are stock phrases in the religio-political literature and speeches of would-be National Reformers. One would think that Sunday sacredness originated in this country, or that this nation had instituted a Sabbath. But neither of these is true. The term is used as a taking phrase, to catch votes or curry favor. There is, it is well known, a strong opposition on the part of a very large class to anything foreign. The greater number of immigrants who land at Castle Garden are not the best timber from which to manufacture the constituent parts of this self-governed ship of State. It is from this class that anarchists and socialists are largely recruited. Strikes are promoted by them. Many of them are Catholics, subjects of the Roman Pontiff, while professing allegiance to our own Constitution and laws.

All these, and other reasons which might be named, prejudice many Americans against anything foreign, and to the same extent in favor of anything American. This prejudice has been made to do valiant service for National Reformers in the last two years.

The strict Sunday observance as borrowed from the Puritans and from Scotland, was engrafted on their descendants in the New England States; and from New England’s regard for the Sunday, has come the term, the “American Sunday;” and this is contrasted with what the same class call the Continental Sunday. But there are two points which we wish to notice right here, which show the hollowness of the claim put forth as regards the Continental and American Sundays:—

1. The origin of Sunday observance is Continental. It began in the days of Constantine, when he issued a decree in 321, A. d., that Sunday should be kept as a day of rest from secular labor in the cities and towns, but those in the country could follow their agricultural pursuits. This was a pagan decree for a pagan holiday [“the venerable day of the sun”], by a pagan emperor. Worldly bishops and priests in the Christian church took advantage of the law, to compel their flocks to do the same. But it was centuries before it was observed to any extent by Christians. Luther did not hold it sacred, neither did Calvin and other Reformers.

Certainly the proper way to keep the Sunday, if it should be kept at all, is the way that it was and is kept by that part of the world where it originated, and not the way that it is kept by those who have misconstrued the day altogether. If there is authority for Sunday at all, it is to be found in that age of the church that originated it as a holy day. The Continental Sunday, as a church day, is the only true Sunday, and the only one America has. An appeal to authentic history proves this true.

2. The *sacredness* of the American Sunday, about which so much has been said, is a myth. A few of the old Puritan stock in New England kept the day strictly; so do many on the Continent of Europe; but the great majority even of church members who have come under the writer’s observation, use it in any way but sacred. There may not be as much public so-called desecration here as on the continent of Europe, but there is as much private. Men cease from the out-door labor of the other days, but they labor otherwise. In the country districts, where the purest morality is supposed to exist, this is the case. The farmer uses that day “doing chores,” calculating his work, “figuring” up his accounts, roaming over his fields, planning his work for the future. A few go to church part of the day, and sleep the remainder, perhaps; many others spend the day in reading newspapers and novels, visiting friends, picking berries, fishing, or in fun and frolic. And the good housewife puts forth her best energy of the day in the preparation of a meal which will satisfy the gormandizing instincts of her varied household. And in time of haying or harvest it is not an uncommon thing in threatening weather to find first-day religionists in the field, gathering the hay or grain. In the maple-sugar season, Sunday-sacredness must be suspended if there comes a good run of sap. It is so as regards other crops and industries in other localities. Merchants and tradesmen may often be found at their places of business a part of the day. And Jew peddlers, who keep no day, have assured the writer that Sunday is the day in which they generally make their purchases from the first-day merchants, and rarely indeed are they refused.

This picture is not overdrawn. We can appeal to honest Americans everywhere if it be not true. Of course there are exceptions, but they are the exceptions, not the rule. Then why so exalt the *American* Sunday? What better is it then the Continental? True we do not have the beer gardens of Germany in our rural districts, for they are not so thickly populated; neither has the driving American time, nor do his tastes run in that direction. What, he does is, however, more wearing than what the German or Frenchman may do.

Then why the “A*merican* Sunday”? It bears a falsehood on the face of it; it is used to appeal to a national prejudice which has no foundation in fact, and the uses that is made of it is unworthy of *men,* not to say Christians, Reformers (?) though they be.M. C. W.
