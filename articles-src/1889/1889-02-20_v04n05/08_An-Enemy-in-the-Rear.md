# An Enemy in the Rear.

The *Interior,* of Jan. 24, has an article entitled, "Fortify the Weak Point," which strikes a blow at our public school system, and shows the religious trend of the day toward political preferment and ultimate control of the Government. It says:—

> "The swing of the educational pendulum toward secularism has proved disastrous both to State and Church—to the church in an alarming scarceness of consecrated workers; and to the State in an alarming increase of heartless demagogues—and it is time it was swinging back into the atmosphere of Christian morals. It may not bring the public schools with it; but, to succeed, it must produce a system of well-equipped, Christian academies."

And these academies, or intermediate schools, must be such "that will not divorce God in nature from God in redemption." And this would be all right, were it not designed to "run out"—so to speak—the public schools. The writer closes thus, and herein reveals his true animus:—

> "Let that work be pushed with persistent energy; but, in addition, let us outflank the enemy, and take his fortified position by tapping the public schools low down, and turning the current into Christian intermediate schools, thence into our colleges and seminaries. In that way we will be more likely, at last, to capture 'the powers that be ' for religion."

And then, woe to the heretic who dares to oppose those "Christian" powers. It is Rome right over again. The people have been led to think that the Catholic Church is the only foe of the public school system; but this is not so. Degenerate Protestantism is anxious to emulate her example.
