# Cunning Craftiness.

On Sunday, January 20, Rev. W. F. Crafts preached in Washington, in Dr. Sunderland’s church, the First Presbyterian. His subject, of course, was “The American Sabbath.” In the beginning of his discourse he stated that the present agitation was not brought about by the churches, but by the clamor of the workingmen everywhere, in behalf of a weekly rest-day. That sounds very well, until you hear testimony on the other side. The fact is that Mr. Crafts attended the General Assembly of the Knights of Labor, and spoke for an hour in behalf of the National Sunday-Rest bill. Then he spent another hour answering questions, and at the close the petition was indorsed by vote. Now if those workingmen had been clamoring for a Sunday law, why should Mr. Crafts spend two hours of his valuable time, besides the time and expense of travel, to convince them that they ought to have one? Can anyone tell?

Again, he visited the National Council of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, and had a similar experience. He spoke for an hour, and then for another hour answered the questions that were showered upon him. Yet the *Daily Union Signal,* of October 22, 1888, in which this item is found, prefaced it by saying: “A great victory for Sabbath observance was won by Rev. W. F. Crafts, Thursday. He appeared before the National Convention of the Brotherhood of Engineers, in session at Richmond, Va., and spoke an hour in behalf of the National Sabbath movement,” etc. Now if these men had been frantically clamoring for a Sunday law, wherein did the victory consist? If the workingmen are so anxious to have a Sunday law, why does Mr. Crafts spend so much time trying to work them up to sign his petition? Isn’t there a little discrepancy between Mr. Crafts’s statement and his actions?

The fact is that nothing was ever heard of any desire on the part of the workingmen for a Sunday law, until the National Reform Association and the Woman’s Christian Union stirred it up, and the clamor has all come from them. There are thousands of workingmen in the country who have no thanks to give to Mr. Crafts and his fellow-craftsmen for their disinterested (?) efforts in their behalf. On the contrary, they repudiate the whole affair as a very *crafty* piece of business.

The State is not an exhorter, or a persuader, or a debating club, but a positive law power for secular purposes; and hence, when it attempts to administer religion, it must of necessity give to it the law force, deciding what religion is true, and by what method it shall be promoted. There is no escape from this result, if we admit the principle from which it springs” - *Samuel T. Spear, D. D. *[39-40]

Note.—No papers are sent by the publishers of the American Sentinel to people who have not subscribed for it. If the Sentinel comes to one who has not subscribed for it, he may know that it is sent him by some friend, and that he will not be called upon by the publishers to pay for the same.

The *Examiner’s* Virginia correspondent, after stating that steps are being taken towards holding a State Sabbath Convention, says that “the weak point in the Sabbath discussion seems to be in the lack of definite conviction on the part of some of the preachers. They do not appear to have reached settled views as to the Christian Sabbath.” Well, if the preachers are indifferent because of a lack of settled views on the subject, why should we be censured for being opposed, when we *have *settled views on the subject? We don’t blame them, however, for being unsettled in their views, since there is nothing to settle them.

The *Christian Nation* has found another ally for its theory of political religion. In its last issue it says:—

> “Some ministers believe it ought to be impossible to determine from a minister’s preaching what his political opinion is. We have no desire to set up a standard, but we are reminded of a true story we heard recently. A minister who belongs to this school of thought had made a statement of his belief at a public meeting. Joe Hess, ex-prizefighter, now an evangelist, was the next speaker, and he delivered himself thus: ‘The speaker who preceded me declares it to be wrong to speak of politics on Sunday. I want to say that when a man’s politics are of such a character that he dare not speak of them on the Sabbath, I have little respect for his religion.’”

National Reformers ought to be happy now, since they have an ex-prize-fighter on their side. Who’ll be the next?

The Springfield (Ill.) *Journal* of January 24, contained the following item:—

> “Mr. Brokoski has prepared a bill in relation to Sunday closing, which he probably will introduce in the House to-day. It provides for the closing of all business houses, factories, and other places of employment on the first day of the week. The publication and circulation of Sunday newspapers, the running of Sunday street-cars and railroad trains, and the keeping open of drug stores exclusively for the sale of medicines, however, are permitted by the provisions of the bill, but cigar and tobacco stores and barber shops are required to be closed.”

The Illinois Sunday Association is a very active organization, and will doubtless make every effort possible for the passage of this bill, or a similar one. We shall keep the readers of the Sentinel informed as to whatever action is taken in regard to the matter.

It is not the business of Christian missions to convert the world, that is, to lead all nations to accept of Christianity. In the divine plan, Chrisians are to preach the gospel, to persuade men, to be the means, under God, of gathering “o*ut of” *the nations “a people for his name.” Acts 15: 14. And that disciple who does this in God’s way, who, aided by the Spirit, preaches the word, shows men their lost condition, instructs them in the way of life, persuades them to accept of the only Saviour, Christ Jesus, and thus is the means of saving a few souls from their sins,—that missionary’s work is a success. His mission is not a failure. The mission of Christ to Tyre and Sidon, although but one person’s heart was reached, and that a poor Canaanite, was a success. Mark 7: 24-31. Paul’s mission to Lystra was as much a success as it was at Berea or Corinth. The world will not be purified of wickedness till Christ comes; it is our mission as Christians to warn and persuade men to flee from the wrath to come and to accept of Christ. And when the redeemed are gathered “o*ut of* every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation,” the work will be wholly a success. Christ’s triumph will then be complete.

We are told by National Reformers that they do not want Church and State, but only National Christianity; that they do not want the State to enforce the tenets of any one sect, but to enforce only those principles which are common to all. Well, this is all that was done in the days of Constantine. There were many factions among professed Christians in his day, beside those championed by Athanasius and Arius. He did not incorporate into the laws the peculiar tenets of any faction, but assembled all the bishops, and adopted that upon which they all agreed. He simply enforced the principles of the Christian religion, as enunciated by the majority of the bishops. Yet everybody points to Constantine’s action as the great union of Church and State. National Reformers want the same thing done again. As his action resulted in the establishment of the Papacy, so their action will result in something exactly like the Papacy.

The National Reformers claim that they do not want any union of Church and State, and then they give their definition of Church and State union. They say that if the State should single out any demonination and enforce its tenets, that would be a union of Church and State. They indignantly deny that their proposal to unite Christianity and the State is anything like Church and State union. But if they were talking on religion alone, they would accuse anyone of bigotry who should single out any demonination, and should say that it was *the church.* They would claim that the Church of Christ is composed of all who believe in him, whatever name they bear. Thus they are inconsistent. For while they really believe that the Church of Christ consists of all believers, so that it is as extensive as Christianity, they virtually, in their definition of Church and State union, say that the Church of Christ is only one denomination. We wish they would make a plain statement, once for all, of what they do regard as the Church.

It is often stated that Sunday laws are necessary for the physical well-being of the people; and by many this supposed fact is eloquently urged as a reason why all should have a stated day of rest, and also why all should be required to rest upon the same day, namely, Sunday. But the force of the argument seems to be weakened somewhat by the well-established fact that on an average Jews enjoy better health, and consequently live longer, than any other civilized people. Of course many of them have a stated weekly rest-day, but a very large portion of them have practically no stated rest; and even those who do conscientiously observe the Sabbath, do it under conditions which the advocates of Sunday laws declare render the necessary mental and physical rest impossible. Now the question arises, If Jews can enjoy good health and long life with no Sabbath, or at best with only a noisy Sabbath, why, in order to enjoy good health, must Christians have a law to compel both themselves and everybody else to rest on Sunday?

The Virginia correspondent of the New York *Examiner* (Baptist) writes as follows to the issue of that paper dated January 24:—

> “It looks now as if the Christian people of Virginia are marshaling their forces for making battle on the Sabbath question. Richmond has its local evangelical alliance, and several of its meetings have been devoted to a discussion of this grave and perplexing problem. Christian people of all names seem to agree that we have fallen upon perilous times; that the old reverence for the Sabbath has fallen into decay, and that business and pleasure, as well as vice, seem bent on blotting the Sabbath from our calendar, or, at any rate, in diverting it from its sacred and economic uses. The indications at present point to the holding of a State Sabbath Convention, and if this is done it will be with a view of putting Virginia in line with the National Sabbath Union.”

So the ball keeps rolling. We ask all who read the above to take particular notice to see if they can find anything in it about temperance or the working men. Does it say that the battle is to be waged for temperance or labor? Not at all. They are “marshaling their forces for making battle on the Sabbath question.” And that’s just what it is everywhere.
