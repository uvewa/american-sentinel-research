The *Christian Nation* has found another ally for its theory of political religion. In its last issue it says:—

> "Some ministers believe it ought to be impossible to determine from a minister's preaching what his political opinion is. We have no desire to set up a standard, but we are reminded of a true story we heard recently. A minister who belongs to this school of thought had made a statement of his belief at a public meeting. Joe Hess, ex-prizefighter, now an evangelist, was the next speaker, and he delivered himself thus: 'The speaker who preceded me declares it to be wrong to speak of politics on Sunday. I want to say that when a man's politics are of such a character that he dare not speak of them on the Sabbath, I have little respect for his religion.'"

National Reformers ought to be happy now, since they have an ex-prize-fighter on their side. Who'll be the next?
