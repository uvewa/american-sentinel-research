The New York *Independent* of January 31, 1889, in noticing a late book of Dr. Uhlhorn, of Germany, says:—

> "The Roman Catholicism of the day, particularly in Central Europe, is aggressive as never before. And in this aggression it has taken a new departure in method that is as remarkable as it is surprising. It means to defeat Protestantism on its own ground and reclaim what it had been tacitly yielding to its old opponent all along. Roman Catholic scholars have entered the arena of scientific discussion in the widest sense of the word, with the avowed object of showing that in the light of true research the Church of Rome stands spotless. Roman Catholic writers, at their head the leading German Bishop Ketteler, of Mayence, have endeavored to prove that a return to Rome is the only cure for all the ills that the modern body, social and politic, is heir to."

This movement is not confined to Europe; it is also being carried on in the United States. The worst feature of it here is that that which passes for Protestantism is so anxious to help forward the efforts of the Romish Church, by joining hands with her and co-operating with her in any way that she may choose.
