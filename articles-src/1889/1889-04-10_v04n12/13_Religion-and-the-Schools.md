# Religion and the Schools.

Under the above heading the Grand Rapids, (Mich.) *Herald-Telegram* prints the Blair Educational Amendment and comments upon it as follows:—

This proposed amendment, as may be seen, purposes "to establish and maintain the principles of the Christian religion," or, in other words, to "establish and maintain" somebody's definition of the Christian religion. No religion can be so established and maintained except by penal law; and penal law so employed has ever resulted in more or less persecution. Such a religion would necessarily be formulated as a creed, and declared to be the religion of the State.

Section 2 of the Amendment declares that, "Each State in this Union shall establish and maintain a system of free public schools," giving instructions in the common branches of knowledge, and in virtue, morality, and the principles of the Christian religion. Our public schools now teach all that this Section requires, except the principles of the Christian religion. The latter portion of this section shows that "the principles of the Christian religion" would have to be so interpreted as to meet the approval of a majority of the Christian sects.

When it shall have become necessary to so define "the principles of the Christian religion" the task will fall upon Congress; or, if they think themselves incompetent to decide theological questions, they, or the President of the United States, may, and probably will, appoint a Board of Trust, upon whom would devolve the task of deciding what "the principles of the Christian religion" are. This Board of Trust will necessarily be composed of leading men from all the Christian churches. Such a Board of Trust might be properly named the American Ecumenical Council. When this body shall have formulated "the principles of the Christian religion," Congress, to carry out section 3, will necessarily have to enforce upon the several States "the principles of the Christian religion" so formulated. Then it will be the legitimate work of each State to place this new gospel in every school. This will convert all our public teachers into preachers of this new religion in all the public schools throughout the United States, and that, too, at public expense.

What will the American people then have but a State religion, taught in the public schools and supported by public taxation? Then the people of this country will be compelled to receive their religion, not from the Bible, but from the National Congress. It is the so-called National Reform Association, with headquarters in Philadelphia, who for more than twenty years have been working up this measure which has just been introduced in the Senate of the United States. Whether a man would believe in the "principles of the Christian religion," so defined, or not, he would be compelled to acknowledge it or take the consequences of refusal. If this large and growing party do not mean, by and by, to have enforced what they may call the Christian religion, why ask to have our National Constitution so changed that laws can be formed under which the revolting cruelties of the past ages can be revived. The old proverb, "Experience is a good teacher," should be heeded.

> "When the Quakers first appeared in the State of Massachusetts, there were no statutes in being against them; but, in view of the general law against heresy, they were all banished. Severe laws were soon enacted, which ordained that Quakers of the male sex should, on the first and second conviction, lose their ears; that those of the female sex should be severely whipped; and that on a third conviction, whether male or female, they should have their tongues bored through with a red-hot iron."—*Clark's History of Intolerance.*

These are such crimes as can be perpetrated where there is an established religion. If such an opportunity should present itself in our fair land there are doubtless many imbued with the old Puritanical principle, who might exhibit the same spirit of intolerance that was manifested toward the Quakers. Should these measures which are proposed in the Blair Amendment become a part of the organic law of our country, it would result in the manifestation of a power which would soon claim to be the supreme judge and director of the consciences of men; from the day laborer to the President in the White House; from the member of the household that sits in the shade of privacy to the legislator in the halls of Congress.

It has been well said that our public school system is the bulwark of American liberty. This system then should be the pride of every citizen. When we see a power arising that will enslave and eventually ruin it, every lover of this glory of lands should earnestly oppose it. Gen. U. S. Grant has said, "Leave the matters of religion to the family altar, the church, and the private school, supported entirely by private contribution. Keep the State and the church forever separated." Under a constitutional guaranty for religious and political freedom, together with our public-school system, the United States has surpassed all other nations, intellectually, morally, spiritually, financially, and in everything that constitutes national greatness. The adoption of Mr. Blair's amendment would be the "mene, mene, tekel, upharsin," of all that is valuable in this best of all Governments.
