# God in the Constitution.

Under the above heading the Hon. John L. Rupe contributes to the Richmond (Ind.) *Telegram,* February 21, 22, quite an extended and critical exposition of the National Reform movement. On the general principles it is sound, although the author has fallen into the error of thinking that Sunday laws may to a certain extent be defended on civil grounds. With this one exception, the whole paper is excellent, and we shall make two or three other articles from it besides the following:—

The principal reason for the amendment of the Constitution as demanded by the National Reform Association, and declared by those recognized by the association as speaking authoritatively upon the subject, are:—

1. That this is in fact a Christian Nation, and that our written Constitution, being the people's highest expression, should embody and declare their true sentiment. That as a large majority of the people in fact recognize God as the source of all power, the Lord Jesus Christ as the ruler of Nations, and the revealed will of God as of supreme authority in civil affairs, therefore, our organic law should contain explicitly such declaration and recognition, and the omission therein is a national sin against God, for which the Nation will be held accountable; and that to allow this condition to remain, is to subject the Nation to constant danger from the divine wrath or from the withholding of the divine blessing and favor.

2. That the omission by the authors of the Constitution of the substance of the declarations, which it is now claimed should be added by amendment, was due to the influence of infidelity and irreligion, which prevailed to a marked degree at the period of its adoption; that this condition was temporary and no longer exists, and that the mistake in the omission influenced by the condition should now be corrected by the adoption of a suitable amendment. It is but fair to say that not all the advocates of amendment approve this argument.

3. That the absence of any recognition in the Constitution of the divine sovereignty, or of the revealed will of God as of supreme authority in civil affairs, gives a basis for the claim by those of the people who are opposed to Christianity, that the Nation, viewed as a civil Government, is *not* a Christian Nation; and that there is no warrant in our organic law for the enactment of laws for the observance of the Sabbath; for the use of the Bible and religious teaching in the public schools; or for any laws with a purpose to regulate moral conduct in conformity with the divine law. That such an amendment is necessary now, in order that laws of the character indicated may be placed upon an undeniable legal basis.

The first reason stated, or argument presented, in favor of amendment of the Constitution, viz., that this is a Christian Nation in fact, and that the Constitution should be made to conform to the fact, etc., etc., does not appear to rest upon any very substantial basis. The mere statement of the argument tends strongly to exclude everything contemplated by it above a religious sentiment. The argument that God will hold the people of the Nation accountable for failure to formally declare their dependence upon him, and recognize formally his supreme authority in all civil affairs, as a national sin, when, as the argument assumes, the people constitute a Christian Nation in fact, does not strongly commend itself to the reason and judgment of men. Indeed, it seems as fallacious as that the *substance* should not be regarded as of importance until the *shadow *should be drawn to it.

The argument appears at variance with recognized truth as to the divine character. Our teaching is that God in his omniscience sees whatever may be in the hearts of men, whether openly professed or declared or not. If we have *not *that which we profess, God knows us as hypocrites, and if we have that within us which is pleasing in his sight, the declaration of it is not essential. Every man who is a Christian in fact professes Christ before the world, not by declaration of the lips, but by living always in obedience to the divine law; and thus he fulfills the measure of his duty. So it is that a Nation which is a Christian Nation in fact will give evidence of it in the organic principles upon which it rests, by the spirit which pervades its laws, and by its public acts and observances. The acts of the individual indicate his character; the acts of the Nation indicate the national character; by their acts are their characters judged, and not by profession or declaration.

By suggesting that the character of the Nation must be sought in its organic principles and national life, and not in its declarations, I would not be understood as conceding the assumption in the argument under consideration, that a Nation is accountable to God for neglect of religious observance, as an individual might be. I think the proposition assumed must be denied. Civil government depends for the exercise of its functions upon human agencies; the officer exercising civil power does not cast the sin he may commit therein upon the State; the accountability is personal. God does not view human beings as American, Frenchmen, or Russians. National distinctions and characteristics rise no higher than human affairs. All men in the economy of God's universe are leveled to a common plane of personal accountability; hence it is a solecism to say that a Nation, a soulless thing, existing only in legal fiction, is held accountable to God for sin which is in its essence personal. This first argument considered must, I think, be regarded as evasive of the real issue and not intended to comprehend in its scope the real questions involved. I think it may be assumed that if it was sought to amend the Constitution by placing in it an explicit recognition of God and his supreme authority in civil affairs, as an expression of the religious sentiment of the people, and no other purpose was declared or foreshadowed by its advocates, the proposition would meet no serious opposition. This consideration, however, has not been the real cause which has moved the advocates of the measure. The real cause has its origin in a different motive and in a different spirit, as I shall attempt to show in another connection.
