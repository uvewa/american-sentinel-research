The *Standard* says: "Emperor William deserves the gratitude of his subjects for stopping horse-racing on Sunday. What a blessing it would be if we had an emperor just long enough to issue an edict against some of our Sunday abominations and desecrations." Never fear, friend *Standard;* you will find a hierarchy despotic enough to suit the most intolerant. When the National Reform Association, the National Sabbath Union, *et al.,* get their scheme into running order, Emperor William and the Czar can come to this country to take lessons in despotic government.
