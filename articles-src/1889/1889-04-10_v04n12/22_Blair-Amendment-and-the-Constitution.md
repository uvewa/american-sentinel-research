The Phillipsburg (Kansas) *Herald* speaks of the Blair Educational Amendment thus:—

> "The objection is not to the principles of the Christian religion, but the proposition to confer on certain parties in power the authority to define by law what those principles are. Now on account of the conscientious differences of opinion as to what are, and what are not, essential principles of the Christian religion, would it not be better to leave the Constitution as Washington, Franklin, and the fathers of the republic framed it, and allow everyone to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience? The other features of the Blair bill seem to be wholesome and unobjectionable. If it passes it will probably be amended in such a way as to avoid the objections alluded to."

Very good; but if the amendment is to be amended, we should prefer to see it done before it is adopted. To let it pass, with the expectation that its objectionable features would afterwards be removed, would be too much like a girl marrying a drunkard in hope that she can reform him after marriage. No; whoever objects to the amendment must do their protesting before it is adopted. Not only so, but they must let the careless and indifferent know that it is objectionable. Even if there is no immediate danger of its adoption, the people should be aroused to a sense of the danger there is in the fact that such a thing can be seriously considered by a large body of influential persons.
