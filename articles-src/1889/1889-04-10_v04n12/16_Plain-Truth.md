# Plain Truth.

The following from *Plain Truth,* a religious and educational paper published in San Marcos, Cal. has the right ring to it:—

> "We do not object to a law forbidding, on Sunday, whatever is a public nuisance or crime on other days of the week; but whatever is morally right on other days cannot properly be outlawed on Sunday, simply because it is Sunday. If it is morally right to play base-ball, race horses or fight for prizes on Monday, it should not be unlawful on Sunday. On the other hand, whatever may make these things objectionable on Monday, should be the same on Sunday. It is not the day but the deed that is subject to legislation.

We are not speaking now of what Christians should do on that day, or of what they should allow done on their private premises. But our own conscience, not civil law, should govern us in such cases; and if only the consciences of men are disturbed by any action of one's self or another, the civil law has nothing to do with the case. We have laws already which will not allow a man to "disturb the peace" unnecessarily. Such laws are necessary. But when a law says you shall not carry on your private business or pleasure, in a quiet, peaceable manner, on your own or public premises, and without interfering with the rights of others in the least, but because another man's conscience forbids, then that law has usurped the place of conscience, and is, and should be, unconstitutional."

This is the same kind of plain truth that the American Sentinel teaches.
