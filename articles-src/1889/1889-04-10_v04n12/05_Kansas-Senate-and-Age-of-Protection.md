The *Union Signal* of February 28 says that "on February 12 the Kansas State Senate passed, by a vote of 26 to 9, a bill to lower the age of protection to girls from 18 to 12 years."

What reason any man could ever offer in support of any such a bill as that we cannot imagine, unless it be his own wish to have it so. And when such a bill as that can be passed by the Kansas Legislature it is high time that the people of Kansas were taking some steps for the protection of their daughters from the members of their Senate. The *Signal* says that the president of the State W. C. T. U. has sent out a plea to all her Unions to immediately forward a protest to the House of Representatives to prevent its passage there. In view of the vote in the Senate on the bill, this action to defeat its passage in the House is probably necessary; but when such action as that is necessary to protect the girls of Kansas from attacks by the Legislature of that State, what can the State be coming to? Kansas has justly prided herself upon her prohibition record. Is it possible that she is going to allow herself to be so shamefully disgraced before the eyes of all civilized people? It is impossible for us fitly to express our abhorrence of this act of the Kansas Senate. Language is impotent in the presence of such infamy.
