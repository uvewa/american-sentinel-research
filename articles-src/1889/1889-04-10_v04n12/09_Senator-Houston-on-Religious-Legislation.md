# Senator Houston on Religious Legislation.

In 1853 a delegation of ministers, having knowledge that Senator Houston had joined the Sons of Temperance, called upon him in Eastern Texas, and requested him to bestow his influence and aid to secure the enactment of a Sunday and Prohibition law. The following is his reply, as taken from the biography of this great man, now in press, and to be issued in a few days by Judge Wm. Lewis:—

> “I agree with you that any unnecessary amusement that is calculated to disturb and annoy persons engaged in religious worship on the Christian Sabbath is wrong and censurable, such as horse racing, gambling of all devices, and indulging in a social glass in public.

> “You request me to use my influence and exertions, such as I possess, to induce the Legislature to enact a law to effect the suppression of the same. I understand by that that you desire the law-making power to declare it a penal offense for a person to perform certain acts on a particular day.
> “In reply I hold and maintain that it is far better to suffer from the ills of even a great evil than to violate, in the least, a vital principle of civil and religious liberty.
> “When tyrants ask you to yield one jot of your liberty, and you consent thereto, it is the first link forged in the chain that will eventually hold you in bondage.
> “The Irish, that brave race so prolific of brave warriors, grand statesmen, and brilliant orators, whose deeds of glory have immortalized every battle-field over which waved the British flag, permitted the English lords to be centuries in forging their fetters, inch by inch, here a little, and there a little, until to-day they are in helpless bondage.
> “The time to resist the encroachments of tyranny is at the incipient stage thereof. The Constitution of the United States says: ‘Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free use thereof.’ Our State constitution says: ‘Ministers of the gospel, being by their profession dedicated to God and the care of souls, ought not to be diverted from the great duties of their functions; therefore no minister of the gospel or priest of any denomination whatever, shall be eligible to the Legislature.
> “The clause in our State constitution disfranchising clergymen, I think, is an abridgment of religious liberty. Had I been a member of the constitutional convention, I would not have given it my support. It violates the very principles intended to protect, inasmuch as it recognizes the right to control, the free enjoyment of religious belief by law. The men, many of them, that framed and voted for it, were smarting from the effects of the tyrannical acts of the Mexican priesthood, which was the cause, I have no doubt, that inspired the enactment.
> “I wish to be understood in my remarks that I have no prejudice against the persons embracing the Catholic faith that would debar me from according to them the same rights due to any other denomination of Christians or any other religious creed.
> “History teaches us that men composing all denominations of religious faith, when clothed with ecclesiastical and temporal power combined, have been tyrants.
> “Now, any law made by the law-making power of the State, intended to regulate a person’s religious or civil conduct on Sunday, is in violation of the spirit of the Constitution of the United States, if not the letter. That clause was placed there by wise men, by men who had been careful students of history. They determined that their beloved country should not be the bloody battle-ground of religious enthusiasts. They were not ignorant of early colonial history—a history that disclosed the fact that the New England colonists enacted and enforced laws compelling persons to observe and subscribe to a particular religious faith. Laws were enacted regulating persons’ conduct on Sunday, which were so severe that people dared not prepare food for nourishment. They were compelled to prepare the traditional Indian pudding and baked beans on Saturday to be served cold on Sunday. It is asserted that laws declaring Sunday, the first day of the week, a day of rest, and to be unlawful for any person to do certain acts on that day, that are lawful on week-days, are not in violation of the spirit or letter of the Constitution, because it is necessary for the moral and physical good of man to rest one day out of seven.
> “Let us suppose that the Quakers, the Jews, the Seventh-day Baptists, and others that believe that Saturday, the seventh day, is the day that God set apart as the day of rest and holy observance, should combine and get control of the legislative branch of Government, and should enact that all persons should abstain from labor, sale, or barter of goods, wares, or merchandise on that day under pains and penalties affixed thereto. What do you suppose the religious people, who believe that the first day of the week is the day that Christ ordained as a day of sacred rest, would say? Would they not all say that such a law was a violation of the Constitution, because it in effect abolishes the Christian Sabbath, a day of rest and divine worship? They would rebel against the enforcement of such a law, and claim their rights guaranteed by the sacred enactments of the law of the land, which declares that the free use of religious worship shall not be prohibited. We must remember that this is a land of equal rights to the Jews as well as to the Gentiles.
> “The laws of Mexico intended to prescribe and regulate a person’s religious belief, were the first moving cause that inspired the Texan patriots to draw swords in defense of enlightened freedom and religious toleration.
> “The men that fought for her and won her independence dedicated her soil to be the dwelling-place of freemen of every kindred and tongue, coming from all nations to enjoy, unmolested, as they may think proper, the religious views and customs taught them in their native land.”—*Dallas Herald.*
The Fayette (Missouri) *Herald* quotes Mr. Gault’s statement that Hon. T. C. Richmond, leader of the Prohibition party in Wisconsin, is laboring constantly to convince the people that the Prohibition party should drop every other issue but prohibition, and very justly says:—

> “Mr. Richmond’s idea is correct. If prohibition is what the Prohibitionists want, why are they not willing to [94] work for that alone? If prohibition is what they want, why are they not willing to secure the help of every element that can be enlisted in favor of prohibition? The very fact that the so-called Prohibition party will not work for prohibition alone, is proof that the religio-political managers of that party are only using the prohibition issue as a stepping-stone to the establishment of their power, and the subordination of the civil to the ecclesiastical power.”
