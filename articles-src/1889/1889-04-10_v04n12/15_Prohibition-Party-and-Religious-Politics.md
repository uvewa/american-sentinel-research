The Fayette (Missouri) *Herald* quotes Mr. Gault's statement that Hon. T. C. Richmond, leader of the Prohibition party in Wisconsin, is laboring constantly to convince the people that the Prohibition party should drop every other issue but prohibition, and very justly says:—

> "Mr. Richmond's idea is correct. If prohibition is what the Prohibitionists want, why are they not willing to [94] work for that alone? If prohibition is what they want, why are they not willing to secure the help of every element that can be enlisted in favor of prohibition? The very fact that the so-called Prohibition party will not work for prohibition alone, is proof that the religio-political managers of that party are only using the prohibition issue as a stepping-stone to the establishment of their power, and the subordination of the civil to the ecclesiastical power."
