# Is It Destruction?

The *Church News,* published at Duluth, Minn., says of Sunday: "We defend the day as a friend to the working masses, and he who would destroy it is an enemy of men and society and the Nation." This is said with reference to those who have been circulating petitions asking Congress not to enact Sunday laws. The *Church News, *like a great many of its class, is considerably off its base. There has no effort been made to destroy the Sunday as a rest day, and least of all by the American Sentinel or those who are working with it. We respect every man's religious convictions. We recognize everybody's right to rest on whatever day he pleases, without hindrance; and we should most vigorously protest against a law, if it were possible to think of such an one being proposed, which would even tend to hinder men from resting on Sunday if they wished to.

Is it trying to destroy the Sunday institution to say that it should not be enforced upon those whose conscience and reason cry out against it. Is it destroying the Sunday institution to say that everybody should be left as free as air to rest upon it or not, just as they choose. If so, then the day is not worth saving. If so few people have any regard for the day that it would be lost sight of as a rest-day without a law compelling people against their will to observe it, then when such a law should be passed, it will show that this country is no longer a pure democracy, but an oligarchy. They say a great deal about the right of their majority to rule; we do not admit that right; much less do we admit the right of a minority to make laws to compel everybody to do just as they do.
