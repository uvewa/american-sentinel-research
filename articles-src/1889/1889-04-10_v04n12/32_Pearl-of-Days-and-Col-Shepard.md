Says the *Pearl of Days: "*It will become more and more apparent that the real defenders of the day [Sunday] are among those who regard it a divine, not merely a human, institution." Very true; that is what we have always claimed. And that proves that those who are working for laws enforcing its observance are working for the enforcement of a religious institution upon the people, regardless of their belief. This they do avowedly, although, because the American Sentinel has exposed the wickedness of such legislation, they often deny it. Yet in the very same issue from which the above was quoted, we find the following in the report of a speech by Col. Elliott F. Shepard, president of the American Sabbath Union:—

> "You have to say 'yes' or 'no,' whether you will stand by the decalogue—whether you will stand by the Lord God Almighty—or whether you will turn your back upon him. The work, therefore, of this society is only just begun. We do not put this work on mere human reasoning, for all that can be overthrown by human reason. *We rest it directly and only on the divine commandment."*

This is from headquarters. It is official. Quote it to your friends when they begin to talk about Sunday laws from a health standpoint.
