The Virginia correspondent of the St. Louis *Christian Advocate,* in his letter to that paper of March 13, deplores the disregard of Sunday by the Post-office Department, and says: "State laws requiring cessation from ordinary labor on the Sabbath are supposed to have no application to persons engaged in handling or transporting mail. Uncle Sam, or the Postmaster-General, seems to be the Lord of the Sabbath for America." Well, why shouldn't he be? Who should be the lord of "the American Sabbath," except those at the head of the Government? They want "Uncle Sam" to make laws for Sunday observance, and so he must be its lord. And when professed Christians depend upon the Government, whether of this or any other country, to enforce religious practices, they thereby acknowledge that those religious customs have no higher authority than the civil power, and that the god they worship is a god of their own making.
