The *Christian Cynosure,* after noting the fact that President Harrison has laid down a strict rule that there shall be no work at the White House on Sunday, and that he has secured a sitting in each of the three Presbyterian churches of Washington, says: "All this gives us hope that the present administration will not only contradict the bad auspices attending the inauguration, but give substantial aid to the effort now being made to restore the Sabbath-day to its place among the people." It is also pleased to note that nearly all the members of the Cabinet are Presbyterians. Now no one can question the right of President Harrison to abstain from labor on Sunday, and to say that no work shall be done at the White House on that day. Neither has anybody a right to find fault with Mr. Wanamaker for going to Philadelphia every week to take charge of his Sunday-school class. He has as much right to do that as another man has to go fishing on Sunday. But neither the one nor the other has any right to say how the people at large shall observe the day. They have no power to say that the people of the United States shall conform to *their* private habits; and for the *Cynosure* to expect anything of the kind shows that the mania for the enforcement of Sunday observance tends to drive all idea of justice out of one's mind. Sunday observance and Sunday legislation originated under a despotism, and they cannot be so far disassociated from their origin as to make them compatible with a republican form of Government.
