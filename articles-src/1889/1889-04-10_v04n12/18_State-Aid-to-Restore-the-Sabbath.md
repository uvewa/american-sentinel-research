Says a correspondent of the St. Louis *Christian Advocate: *"If the Postmaster-General will issue an order prohibiting the handling and the transportation of the mails on Sunday, and Congress will prohibit by law the carrying by common carriers of passengers and freight from one State to another on Sunday, State laws and religious teaching can be trusted to do the rest toward restoring the sanctity of the Sabbath."

Just so. If Cesar will lend his help, the Lord may be able to look out for and preserve his own. Is that it? That's what they say; but if they believed that the Sunday really were the Lord's day, they would be willing to trust it entirely to the Lord. As a matter of fact however, they leave the Lord out of the question entirely. The heads of the departments, Congress, the various State Legislatures, and the churches, are to combine to do the work.

But one thing is shown most clearly by the foregoing extract, and that is that what they want of the State and Nation is help in making Sunday a Sabbath—not simply a "civil Sabbath," but a sacred Sabbath. They aspire to impart sanctity—a thing which only divine power can do. In short, they want the State to take the place of God.
