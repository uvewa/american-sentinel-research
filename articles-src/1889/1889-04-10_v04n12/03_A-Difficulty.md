# A Difficulty.

Mr. Crafts and the American Sabbath Union have the thing very nicely arranged in regard to Sunday mails in cases of sickness. The original Sunday-Rest bill allowed letters to be delivered on Sunday if it was certified on the face of the envelope that the matter within concerned the health, life, or decease of any person; but this was omitted from the revised bill as unnecessary, on the ground that the telegraph would answer every purpose. But in a speech in Detroit, Mich., February 11, before a meeting of the Evangelical Alliance, Mr. H. B. Ledyard, President of the Michigan Central Railroad, made a point which might not be so easily disposed of. Said he:—

> “The absolute cessation of Sunday work would [91] not be practicable, or, if practicable, might not, perhaps, be wise. It would in many cases entail suffering, and perhaps loss. If one of you should be called to-morrow to California on account of the severe illness of some member of your family, you certainly would not feel very kindly toward the railroad company that might land you in Ogden Saturday night, and keep you there until Monday morning.”

Perhaps Mr. Crafts and his fellows would say that this is an instance where the few would have to suffer for the benefit of the many; but if he himself were one of the few, we imagine that he would at once begin to learn what that meaneth, “I will have mercy, and not sacrifice.” As a National Reformer once said to us, “There are a good many perplexing things in connection with this matter.” We suggest that the easiest way out is to allow the Lord to run his affairs in his own way.
