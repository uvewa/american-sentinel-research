The following words of Dr. T. L. Cuyler express the position of the American Sentinel precisely:—

> "With the Woman's Temperance Union I am in the warmest sympathy, and constantly delightful co-operation. Nowhere are they more cordially welcomed than in my church. But I firmly believe that their true province is in earnest, effective Christian labor, and the less they have to do with partisan politics, the better."
