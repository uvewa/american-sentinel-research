The beauties of an established religion are illustrated in the following clipping from the New York *Independent* of January 31, 1889: —

> "A catechism prepared by the Rev. F. A. Gace, Anglican vicar of Great Barling, England, and widely circulated, contains the following:—

> "'In what light ought we to consider dissenters? —As heretics.
> "'Is their worship a laudable service?—No; their worship is idolatrous.
> "'Is dissent a great sin?—Yes; it is in direct opposition to our duty to God.
> "'Why have not dissenters been excommunicated?—Because the law of the land does not allow the wholesome law of the church to be acted on.
> "'Is it wicked to enter a meeting-house?—Most assuredly.'"
