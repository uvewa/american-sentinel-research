# What They Have to Meet.

The *Christian Statesman* of March 14 has considerable correspondence from the Pacific Coast, to which it calls special attention. Its California correspondence is all about the Sunday law which didn't materialize. One correspondent who writes from the Senate Chamber at Sacramento, gives a very fair account of the effort made by the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, *et al.,* to secure such a law, and of the reception which the bill met in the Senate.

After speaking of the defeat of the bill, and the determination of its friends to keep up the struggle, he says:—

> "The best organized and most consistent opposition of this work is that of Seventh-day Adventists. They present arguments in a way that commends them to the minds of many men. The following conversation illustrates the arguments they use:—

> *"Question —* 'Why do you Adventists so strenuously oppose the passage of laws against allowing saloons, prize-fights, gambling-houses, etc., to be conducted on Sunday—take the present bill for illustration?'
> *"Answer-* 'We don't oppose closing them up on Sunday. Close them up every day in the week, and then they will be closed up on Sunday.'
> *"Q*—'But isn't it a partial victory to get them closed up on one day of the week?'
> *"A.*—'No, not any more than it would be to have a law against murder or stealing Sunday. A law stopping them only on Sunday, is a law tacitly admitting them to be right on other days. It gives these places that ruin our children appearance of respectability—and apparent sanction of the law—and it makes them worse than they were before. It is on the principle of high license —one of the devil's most delusive traps.'
> "Q.—'But do not Christians have a right to be protected in their worship on Sunday?'
> "A.—'Most assuredly they have. We have no Sunday law in this State now, yet Christians are protected in their worship. It was only the other day, as you know, one man in San Francisco was sentenced to an imprisonment of fifty days, and another to an imprisonment of thirty days, for disturbing a meeting on Sunday. Laws should protect all in their religious observances, but compel none.'
> *"Q.*—'But why do you oppose Sunday laws when Sabbatarians are exempted?'
> "A.—'Because a person has a right to refrain from resting just as much as he has a right to rest. We are opposed for the same reason we would be opposed to laws compelling everybody to worship Christ, except those who conscientiously worship some other deity. Laws cannot of right interfere with an individual's rights, either positively or negatively. The infidel has a right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness just as much as a Christian. Says our Constitution: "All men are created equal." I wouldn't ask for an exemption clause. If the laws are right it is wrong to exempt. There should never any exemption be made to a just law.'
> "These are the arguments that have to be met. The Adventists are just about as obstinate as the traditional Quaker; and their views on religious liberty are quite similar. An Adventist would go to jail and stay there indefinitely before he would pay what he considers to be an unjust fine. These facts and arguments are particularly responsible for the course just taken by the Legislature of California."

With the exception of attributing to the Constitution the language of the Declaration of Independence, we do not see what fault can be found with this statement. If it were not for that error, we should be tempted to think that the writer is not a National Reformer; but his evident unfamiliarity with the great charter of American liberty shows him to be one. However, if those are the arguments which have to be met against Sunday laws, it is certain that National Reformers have a big job on hand. Unfortunately they don't meet them. They dodge them every time. In that same issue of the *Statesman* is an instance of how such arguments are ignored. But nevertheless the *Statesman* has for once given its readers a good sample of the justice of the opposition, and of sound reason. Its failure to answer those arguments, and the fact that it is fully committed to a course which is opposed to so reasonable a position, shows at once the weakness and the iniquity of its own course.
