In another column we have called attention to the fact that Hon. T. C. Richmond, the Prohibition leader in Wisconsin, has been constantly and strenuously advocating that the party adhere to the one issue of prohibition; and now comes the announcement that he has withdrawn from active labor, and has issued his farewell address to the Prohibitionists of the State. This is very significant. It shows that a man who is simply prohibitionist, whose sole aim is the extirpation of the liquor traffic, cannot work harmoniously with the Prohibition party.
