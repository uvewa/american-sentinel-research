# Sectarian Instruction.

The National Reformers have an ally in the Denver *Times.* It strongly favors the teaching of religion in the public schools, and it is more bold and honest in its utterances than are those National Reformers who have been forced to learn craftiness by arguments which they long ago learned that they could not meet. It proclaims its readiness to accept sectarian teaching in the schools, because, it is logical enough to see that, having favored religious teaching, sectarian teaching must naturally follow. Thus it says:—

> “The great objection raised by the Catholic clergy against the public-school system is ungodliness and unrighteousness. And is there not some ground for this? The cry has always been that morality should be taught in the public schools, but not religion or sectarianism. And now the old cry is receiving one of its periodical and spasmodic repetitions. The school authorities are earnestly exhorted to teach morality, and in the same breath are hysterically warned against religion or sectarianism.

> “Now, is it possible to teach morality without religion? Moral conduct implies a moral law. The law suggests the lawgiver. Thus we come directly to Deity, to Divinity, to the Bible. There can scarcely be religious teaching without sectarianism. All religious teachers are more or less of sectarians. And few of them can habitually keep their sectarianism completely and steadily subdued.”
This is the truth; but few who favor the teaching of religion by the State dare admit it, for then they would not have even a shadow with which to defend themselves against the charge of desiring to unite Church and State.
