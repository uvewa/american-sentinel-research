In no country and in no age was it ever known that anybody was forced to receive Christian baptism—immersion. Never was anybody ever forced to partake of the Lord's Supper, as the Lord himself instituted it. No State ever compelled a man to acknowledge that Jesus Christ is the only begotten Son of God. In short, secular power has never been employed in the propagation of things plainly commanded in the Bible, or of pure and undefiled religion. Whenever force has been used in connection with any religious custom, it has always been in favor of some perversion of the truth, as in the Roman Catholic mass. It can be set down as a fact that a religion that could claim the approval of Heaven, that bore its credentials, and that could find its way to the hearts of people by the power of the Holy Spirit, never asked civil rulers for any assistance. Think of this, and make the application in the present movement for a National Sunday law.

From the Chicago *Globe* of March 4 we clip the following utterance at the Sunday-law meeting in that city, March 3:—

> "Bishop Fallows said that they did not want a German Sunday or an American Sunday, but a Sunday according to the law of God. They were entitled to it by the decrees of the Almighty as well as by the laws of the country, and by God's grace they were going to have it."

Well, if they will wait until the grace of God gives it to them, we shall not utter a word of protest. What we object to is their trying to act in the place of God, and claiming that what they get by civil enactment is by the grace of God. And then can anybody tell us how it would be possible to have a Sunday "according to the law of God"? Our somewhat extensive reading of the Bible has not revealed to us anything of the kind. If some of our Sunday friends will tell us briefly how it can be done, we will let our readers have the benefit of their information. Don't all speak at once.
