# Is It Destruction?

The *Church News,* published at Duluth, Minn., says of Sunday: “We defend the day as a friend to the working masses, and he who would destroy it is an enemy of men and society and the Nation.” This is said with reference to those who have been circulating petitions asking Congress not to enact Sunday laws. The *Church News, *like a great many of its class, is considerably off its base. There has no effort been made to destroy the Sunday as a rest day, and least of all by the American Sentinel or those who are working with it. We respect every man’s religious convictions. We recognize everybody’s right to rest on whatever day he pleases, without hindrance; and we should most vigorously protest against a law, if it were possible to think of such an one being proposed, which would even tend to hinder men from resting on Sunday if they wished to.

Is it trying to destroy the Sunday institution to say that it should not be enforced upon those whose conscience and reason cry out against it. Is it destroying the Sunday institution to say that everybody should be left as free as air to rest upon it or not, just as they choose. If so, then the day is not worth saving. If so few people have any regard for the day that it would be lost sight of as a rest-day without a law compelling people against their will to observe it, then when such a law should be passed, it will show that this country is no longer a pure democracy, but an oligarchy. They say a great deal about the right of their majority to rule; we do not admit that right; much less do we admit the right of a minority to make laws to compel everybody to do just as they do.

In no country and in no age was it ever known that anybody was forced to receive Christian baptism—immersion. Never was anybody ever forced to partake of the Lord’s Supper, as the Lord himself instituted it. No State ever compelled a man to acknowledge that Jesus Christ is the only begotten Son of God. In short, secular power has never been employed in the propagation of things plainly commanded in the Bible, or of pure and undefiled religion. Whenever force has been used in connection with any religious custom, it has always been in favor of some perversion of the truth, as in the Roman Catholic mass. It can be set down as a fact that a religion that could claim the approval of Heaven, that bore its credentials, and that could find its way to the hearts of people by the power of the Holy Spirit, never asked civil rulers for any assistance. Think of this, and make the application in the present movement for a National Sunday law.

From the Chicago *Globe* of March 4 we clip the following utterance at the Sunday-law meeting in that city, March 3:—

> “Bishop Fallows said that they did not want a German Sunday or an American Sunday, but a Sunday according to the law of God. They were entitled to it by the decrees of the Almighty as well as by the laws of the country, and by God’s grace they were going to have it.”

Well, if they will wait until the grace of God gives it to them, we shall not utter a word of protest. What we object to is their trying to act in the place of God, and claiming that what they get by civil enactment is by the grace of God. And then can anybody tell us how it would be possible to have a Sunday “according to the law of God”? Our somewhat extensive reading of the Bible has not revealed to us anything of the kind. If some of our Sunday friends will tell us briefly how it can be done, we will let our readers have the benefit of their information. Don’t all speak at once.

The New York *Independent* of January 31, 1889, in noticing a late book of Dr. Uhlhorn, of Germany, says:—

> “The Roman Catholicism of the day, particularly in Central Europe, is aggressive as never before. And in this aggression it has taken a new departure in method that is as remarkable as it is surprising. It means to defeat Protestantism on its own ground and reclaim what it had been tacitly yielding to its old opponent all along. Roman Catholic scholars have entered the arena of scientific discussion in the widest sense of the word, with the avowed object of showing that in the light of true research the Church of Rome stands spotless. Roman Catholic writers, at their head the leading German Bishop Ketteler, of Mayence, have endeavored to prove that a return to Rome is the only cure for all the ills that the modern body, social and politic, is heir to.”

This movement is not confined to Europe; it is also being carried on in the United States. The worst feature of it here is that that which passes for Protestantism is so anxious to help forward the efforts of the Romish Church, by joining hands with her and co-operating with her in any way that she may choose.

The Phillipsburg (Kansas) *Herald* speaks of the Blair Educational Amendment thus:—

> “The objection is not to the principles of the Christian religion, but the proposition to confer on certain parties in power the authority to define by law what those principles are. Now on account of the conscientious differences of opinion as to what are, and what are not, essential principles of the Christian religion, would it not be better to leave the Constitution as Washington, Franklin, and the fathers of the republic framed it, and allow everyone to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience? The other features of the Blair bill seem to be wholesome and unobjectionable. If it passes it will probably be amended in such a way as to avoid the objections alluded to.”

Very good; but if the amendment is to be amended, we should prefer to see it done before it is adopted. To let it pass, with the expectation that its objectionable features would afterwards be removed, would be too much like a girl marrying a drunkard in hope that she can reform him after marriage. No; whoever objects to the amendment must do their protesting before it is adopted. Not only so, but they must let the careless and indifferent know that it is objectionable. Even if there is no immediate danger of its adoption, the people should be aroused to a sense of the danger there is in the fact that such a thing can be seriously considered by a large body of influential persons. [95-96]

Note.—No papers are sent by the publishers of the American Sentinel to people who have not subscribed for it. If the Sentinel comes to one who has not subscribed for it, he may know that it is sent him by some friend, and that he will not be called upon by the publishers to pay for the same.

The St. Joseph (Missouri) *News* of March 13 says: “The Sunday question will be one of the issues in the election next month. It is reported that politics will be laid aside, and the fight will be on Sunday or no Sunday.”

Says the Cincinnati *Commercial Gazette:* “We have a profound respect for the pulpit. It is a great power. It should be far greater than it is and it would be if it kept severely within its legitimate sphere; but whenever it meddles with matters that are not within that sphere it loses its influence.” And so say we.

In another column we have called attention to the fact that Hon. T. C. Richmond, the Prohibition leader in Wisconsin, has been constantly and strenuously advocating that the party adhere to the one issue of prohibition; and now comes the announcement that he has withdrawn from active labor, and has issued his farewell address to the Prohibitionists of the State. This is very significant. It shows that a man who is simply prohibitionist, whose sole aim is the extirpation of the liquor traffic, cannot work harmoniously with the Prohibition party.

Next week we shall give some facts about recent Sunday legislation in Arkansas. A bill taking away the liberties granted in the act of two years ago, which was secured through the efforts of Col. R. H. Crockett, has already passed the Senate. Some of the speeches made on the occasion of its passage were most intolerant. We should like to present it this week, but that would involve the holding over of too much matter already in type. We have also a choice remnant of medieval barbarism to present from one of Oakland’s honored clergymen. It will show how the mania for Sunday laws blunts all sense of justice and right.

The *Standard* says: “Emperor William deserves the gratitude of his subjects for stopping horse-racing on Sunday. What a blessing it would be if we had an emperor just long enough to issue an edict against some of our Sunday abominations and desecrations.” Never fear, friend *Standard;* you will find a hierarchy despotic enough to suit the most intolerant. When the National Reform Association, the National Sabbath Union, *et al.,* get their scheme into running order, Emperor William and the Czar can come to this country to take lessons in despotic government.

The *Christian Statesman’s* correspondent who writes from the Senate Chamber at Sacramento about the Sunday bill that was introduced into the California Legislature, but failed to pass, says:—

> “Some editors, lawyers, and ministers had been circulating a counter petition to the one in favor of the Sunday bill, and thousands of signatures had been obtained, principally Adventists and laboring classes.”

It would seem strange if editors, lawyers, and ministers should circulate a petition and still not sign it; but allowing that the counter petition was signed only by the laboring class, what becomes of the argument that the clamor for a Sunday law comes from that class?

The Sunday-law people will find a good many hard problems before they get through with the job they have undertaken. They imagine that the enactment and enforcement of a Sunday law is going to do away with almost all lawlessness. As a matter of fact, we believe it will make more. It is certain that men cannot be made religious or moral by law. The fact that a strict Sunday law stops all work, will not make people any more religiously inclined than before. Those who respect Sunday as a sacred day will conform to the law, for they would abstain from work and amusement if there were no law, while those who have no conscientious scruples in regard to Sunday, being debarred from their ordinary amusements, will break out in some other place. Sunday laws will not make them religious, nor will they make them act as though they were religious.

One more instance is given in the *Christian Statesman* of March 14, of the unity of purpose of the Women’s Christian Temperance Union and the National Reform Association. Secretary Wylie devotes his report to a eulogy of a woman suffrage speech by Miss Shaw, superintendent of the Franchise Department of the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union, at the annual convention of the Steuben County Union in Ray, Indiana, and closes with the statement that “delegates were appointed to attend the National Reform Convention in Pittsburg in April.” We are in favor of temperance, especially of Christian temperance, but we should like to know how we can oppose the work that is falsely called National Reform and not oppose the work that the so-called Woman’s Christian Temperance Union is now doing. It is fast getting to be a temperance union only in name, and its Christianity is almost all politics. And such politics!

Says the *Pearl of Days: “*It will become more and more apparent that the real defenders of the day [Sunday] are among those who regard it a divine, not merely a human, institution.” Very true; that is what we have always claimed. And that proves that those who are working for laws enforcing its observance are working for the enforcement of a religious institution upon the people, regardless of their belief. This they do avowedly, although, because the American Sentinel has exposed the wickedness of such legislation, they often deny it. Yet in the very same issue from which the above was quoted, we find the following in the report of a speech by Col. Elliott F. Shepard, president of the American Sabbath Union:—

> “You have to say ‘yes’ or ‘no,’ whether you will stand by the decalogue—whether you will stand by the Lord God Almighty—or whether you will turn your back upon him. The work, therefore, of this society is only just begun. We do not put this work on mere human reasoning, for all that can be overthrown by human reason. *We rest it directly and only on the divine commandment.”*

This is from headquarters. It is official. Quote it to your friends when they begin to talk about Sunday laws from a health standpoint.
