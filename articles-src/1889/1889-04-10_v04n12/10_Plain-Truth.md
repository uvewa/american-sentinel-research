# Plain Truth.

The following from *Plain Truth,* a religious and educational paper published in San Marcos, Cal. has the right ring to it:—

> “We do not object to a law forbidding, on Sunday, whatever is a public nuisance or crime on other days of the week; but whatever is morally right on other days cannot properly be outlawed on Sunday, simply because it is Sunday. If it is morally right to play base-ball, race horses or fight for prizes on Monday, it should not be unlawful on Sunday. On the other hand, whatever may make these things objectionable on Monday, should be the same on Sunday. It is not the day but the deed that is subject to legislation.

We are not speaking now of what Christians should do on that day, or of what they should allow done on their private premises. But our own conscience, not civil law, should govern us in such cases; and if only the consciences of men are disturbed by any action of one’s self or another, the civil law has nothing to do with the case. We have laws already which will not allow a man to “disturb the peace” unnecessarily. Such laws are necessary. But when a law says you shall not carry on your private business or pleasure, in a quiet, peaceable manner, on your own or public premises, and without interfering with the rights of others in the least, but because another man’s conscience forbids, then that law has usurped the place of conscience, and is, and should be, unconstitutional.”

This is the same kind of plain truth that the American Sentinel teaches.

They tell us that they want the Sunday law because one day of rest in seven is a physical necessity. Grant it; then what? From five to seven hours of sleep in twenty-four is a physical necessity. Any physician will say that a man who gets regular rest every night, but works seven days in the week, will last longer than the man who rests every seventh day, but gets only half as much sleep as he ought to each night. Now if a Sunday law is necessary, why is not a night law equally necessary? If we are going to legislate for the man who doesn’t know enough to rest when he is tired, why not take in the man who doesn’t sleep at the time designed by nature for sleep, as well as the man who doesn’t rest on Sunday, possibly because he has already rested?

Says a correspondent of the St. Louis *Christian Advocate: *“If the Postmaster-General will issue an order prohibiting the handling and the transportation of the mails on Sunday, and Congress will prohibit by law the carrying by common carriers of passengers and freight from one State to another on Sunday, State laws and religious teaching can be trusted to do the rest toward restoring the sanctity of the Sabbath.”

Just so. If Cesar will lend his help, the Lord may be able to look out for and preserve his own. Is that it? That’s what they say; but if they believed that the Sunday really were the Lord’s day, they would be willing to trust it entirely to the Lord. As a matter of fact however, they leave the Lord out of the question entirely. The heads of the departments, Congress, the various State Legislatures, and the churches, are to combine to do the work.

But one thing is shown most clearly by the foregoing extract, and that is that what they want of the State and Nation is help in making Sunday a Sabbath—not simply a “civil Sabbath,” but a sacred Sabbath. They aspire to impart sanctity—a thing which only divine power can do. In short, they want the State to take the place of God.
