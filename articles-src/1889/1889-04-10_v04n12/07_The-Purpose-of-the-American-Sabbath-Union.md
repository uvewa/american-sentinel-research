# The Purpose of the American Sabbath Union.

It is a well-known fact, acknowledged by nearly every Christian convocation in our country for several years past, that the regard for Sunday as a Sabbath-day is growing less and less from year to year, and it is becoming more and more a holiday, a day given up to idleness, pleasure, and social amusements, until the prospect in the near future reveals a picture of a country without a Sabbath, and nothing to take its place but the Sunday of continental Europe. Well may Christians be alarmed for the future, and seek some means to prevent so sad a result.

But what are the means to be used by the Christian people to prevent such a result? Great effort has been made during the past year to harmonize their views on this question, and it has resulted in the formation of the “American Sabbath Union.” The third article of the Constitution of this Union says: “The object of the American Sabbath Union is to preserve the American Sabbath as a day of rest and worship.” How is this American Sabbath to be preserved? If we are to judge of the sayings and doings of its members thus far, the answer is in part, To procure such legislation as will compel people to cease all work on the so-called American Sabbath. But will such a law accomplish the end desired? By no means. It can only make the day one of much more idleness, revelry, and dissipation than it now is.

But the object of the projectors of the Union is to make the day one of worship, as well as of rest. Can this be done by the means which have already been used—moral suasion? If so, why the necessity of asking for laws to compel people to rest on this day. The American Sabbath Union does not propose to rest simply with the enactment of a law to compel people to rest on Sunday, but they must not ask for too much at once. Had those who asked for a new capitol at Albany asked for eighteen or twenty millions of dollars at first, or even half of these sums, to build it with, would they have obtained the appropriation? They knew enough to ask for a small sum, if they would get what they wanted. So with our American Sabbath Union; they must ask only for such things at first as they think will be readily granted. Having obtained the first grant, the next request will be for a law to compel worship or attendance at church on this day. At present the cry would be loudly raised that such a law would be unconstitutional, and could not be obtained. But if a law will compel Jews or Christians who have rested on God’s holy day to also rest on the American Sabbath, is it any greater step in advance to compel them also to worship on a designated day?

There will be much opposition, especially by those who have already observed one day of rest and worship, to the enforcement of such a law as named above, and the only way to stop the controversy will be by the enactment of another law something as follows: “Be it enacted, etc., that if any person living within the bounds of the United States, shall intimate or signify by any word or words, act or actions, that the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday or Lord’s day, Christian Sabbath or the American Sabbath, is not the day of the week commanded by God to be observed when he says, ‘Remember the Sabbath-day to keep it holy. . . . The seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God,’ etc., then such person or persons shall be punished for each and every offense by a fine of $500 and imprisonment for not less than five years and so much longer as the said fine remains unpaid. And be it further enacted, that if any person shall be suspected of holding any opinion or thoughts antagonistic to such a law, or shall show by word or act any sympathy for any person who shall suffer fine or imprisonment according to the provisions of this act, then such person shall be delivered over to a council who shall be empowered to use any means they may choose to determine whether such suspicions be founded on sufficient evidence, and if deemed by the council to be so founded, then the person so suspected shall be delivered over to the officers of the law for such punishment as the said council may decide.” The most of our readers will say that such thoughts are too silly to put into print, but it is the only way in which the American Sabbath Union can ever accomplish their purpose. It is the natural result of the first step toward an appeal for laws “to preserve the American Sabbath as a day of rest and worship.” Such laws have been enforced by the power which this Union seeks as its ally, and such will be the laws again, if this allied power is given permission to use its power.—*The Outlook.*
