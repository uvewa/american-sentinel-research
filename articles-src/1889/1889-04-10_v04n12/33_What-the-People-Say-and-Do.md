# What the People Say and Do.

We are receiving many encouraging letters from those who believe in the golden rule and the principles advocated by the American Sentinel. Some of the letters contain donations of from $5.00 to $500, to aid in circulating anti-National Reform literature. We give below extracts from a few of these letters.

A gentleman in Rochester N. Y., writes:—

> "A friend in Michigan has sent me a copy of the January Sentinel and one of the Battle Creek *Journals* containing the three grand addresses delivered in that city by A. T. Jones in defense of the Constitution. The result has been to make me a convert to your ideas in regard to religious legislation, and arouse in me a strong desire to do all I can to spread the truth. So I thought I would ask you to send me a few copies of your January number to use in soliciting subscribers. I do not think my neighbors are awake to the threatening dangers of the Blair bills. I would like a copy or two of the petition against those bills to circulate for signers."

"Queen's Road, Hull, Eng., Feb. 7, 1889.

> "Dear Publishers: Though I have been absent from America for more than seven years, I still feel deeply interested in the work in which you are engaged; and I rejoice that Cod has opened so clearly before your vision the real issue of this question, which is of vital interest to every citizen of our glorious republic. No compromise with those who are forging shackles by which to bind freemen, but one exemption from the proposed amendment, and that—the republic, race, politics, and religion, no impediments! For all, liberty, an army of devoted men and women, with lives and property set for the defense of the Federal Constitution, which vouchsafes the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity! Here is patriotism, philanthropy, magnanimity, Christianity! May God bless all whose efforts are thitherward directed.

> "Many, no doubt, will be interested in the circulation of the American Sentinel, and do all that they can, reasonably, for its success. Perhaps those whose efforts are directed in securing signatures to the petitions favoring the Constitution as it is will not be so numerous, though its importance can hardly be overestimated.
> "For the present we are deprived of the privilege of joining with you in the struggle. Our sympathies are with you, and our prayers are for you Be of good courage.
"Yours faithfully, A. A. John

> "P. S. —Inclosed please find order for $5.00 Use in cither circulating the petitions or Sentinel, as seems best to you who are in the conflict."

"Petaluma, Cal., Feb. 12, 1889.

> "Dear Sir: Inclosed you will find cash for one year's subscription to the Sentinel. I am an out-and-out free-thinker, but your journal is so frank and patriotic, so free from contumely and slander, so broad and liberal in its religious views, such a stern advocate and defender of our Constitution, that it finds its way to the heart of every true American who has read it.I remain yours, II. J. Schroobeda."

Rev. E. H. Fairchild, president Berea College (Kentucky), writes:—

> "I have read the Sentinel and heartily approve of its position in regard to the Union of Church and State. . . .

> "Those who desire the Sabbath to be made a legal holiday have a right to secure protection against unnecessary disturbances if they have the power, but cannot require others to keep the Sabbath holy."

A minister in Nashua, Iowa, writes:—

> "You say the Sentinel is opposed to everything tending to a union of Church and State. I, too, am heartily opposed to such a union, and I earnestly hope and pray that it may never be effected. The right to 'life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness,' is too precious to be sold so cheaply.

> "Some months ago a few copies of the Sentinel were sent to me, and I was glad to learn that it met the issues so boldly and ably, yet kindly." [97]
