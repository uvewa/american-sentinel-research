# The Enforcement of Idleness.

In the New York *Independent* of January 31, Dr. John Hall publishes an article on "The Bad Elements in New York Life." Among the first of these he names "idlers and adventurers of the city." He says:—

> "They come from all parts of this continent and various portions of Europe and crowd into the city. . . . As Satan proverbially finds mischief for idle hands, the mischief these idlers do implies companions."

We have no complaint to find with Dr. Hall's article in itself. But New York is not alone in this; it is only one amongst the great cities of the land upon this question. But there is another question that hangs upon this. It is true that the chiefest of all the bad elements in our large cities are the idlers and adventurers; and idleness is the root of it all. But we well know that Dr. John Hall is enlisted in a national movement to enforce more idleness. What we mean is that Dr. John Hall is one of the men who are working for a National Sunday law to compel men to be idle the whole of Sunday every week in the year. This can end only in multiplying the evil of the bad elements of the large cities. Springing from idleness now, which is entirely voluntary idleness, and being as bad as it is, what will it not be when the Nation shall be brought to the support of it by compelling everybody to be idle one-seventh of the time? It is well known that the evil of the great cities is the basis of much of the argument in behalf of Sunday laws. But as this evil of the cities springs chiefly from idleness, how can the evil be anything else than vastly increased by enforced idleness, to whatever extent it may be? How can the evils of idleness be cured by the enforcement of more idleness? In replying, about a year ago, to the demand of some of the Sunday-law preachers for more stringent Sunday laws to check the tide of Sunday evil, the Cincinnati *Commercial Gazette* said:—

> "They declare Sunday the moral ruin of the people. They prove it by alleged statistics of criminal prosecutions to show that more crimes of violence are committed on Sunday than on all other days of the week. Why is this? Because the saloons are open? They are open on other days. This reduces them to the sole reason that it is because it is a day of idleness.

> "Their argument is absolutely destructive to the beneficence of the custom of a rest-day. They continually affirm that a Sabbath-day is the very foundation of religion, morals, and society, and they as incessantly de lare that the custom of Sunday cessation from work in the cities has made it a day of moral ruin. What is their recourse from the destruction which they charge upon the day of idleness?— *To make statutes more stringent to enforce idleness.* Arguing that idleness on that day leads mankind to moral ruin, they call for a more rigid enforcement of idleness, to lead mankind to the ways of salvation. [90]
> "Surely there is need to revise their basis in season before they can proceed rationally in legislation. Selling beer is no more a sin on Sunday than on other days. The reason why more crimes of violence are done on Sunday than on other days— if that is a fact—is not that the saloons are open, but that men are idle. The good of a day of rest for the toilers has to be taken with the drawback of this unavoidable evil from idleness and indulgence of the appetites. The cause is the cessation of labor."

This argument is perfectly sound. And further: When the State enforces a day of idleness it subjects men to the penalties of fine and perhaps imprisonment for following their perfectly honest and laudable occupations on that day, while if they will only remain idle, they may gamble or carouse, and run hither and thither in almost any reckless way with perfect immunity. Such an act on the part of the State at once relegates honest occupations to the realm of crime, and puts a premium upon idleness and recklessness. No such thing can ever be done with safety to civil society. The following words of the California Supreme Court of 1858 are aptly appropriate just here:—

> "When we come to inquire what reason can be given for the claim of power to enact a Sunday law, we are told, looking at it in its purely civil aspects, that it is absolutely necessary for the benefit of man's health and the restoration of his powers. and in aid of this great social necessity, the Legislature may, for the general convenience, set apart a particular day of rest, and require its observance by all.

> "This argument is founded on the assumption that mankind are in the habit of working too much, and thereby entailing evil upon society; and that, without compulsion, they will not seek the necessary repose which their exhausted natures demand. This is to us a new theory, and is contradicted by the history of the past and the observation of the present. We have heard, in all ages, of declamations and reproaches against the vice of indolence; but we have yet to learn that there has ever been any general complaint of an intemperate, vicious, unhealthy, or morbid industry. On the contrary, we know that mankind seeks cessation from toil from the natural influences of self-preservation in the same manner and as certainly as they seek slumber, relief from pain, or food to appease their hunger."

Some may say that this argument reflects upon the wisdom of the Creator in appointing a Sabbath-day, and commanding that upon it there shall be no work. But it does not. God commands men to do no work on the Sabbath, *for a purpose;*—the purpose of setting apart the Sabbath as a day to himself in which no work shall be done is that men shall worship the Creator and honor him as such. And in the worship of God and the holy sanctions with which he has surrounded the Sabbath, there are compensations which more than counter-balance that which would otherwise be idleness. In appointing the Sabbath, and commanding men to observe it and perform acts of worship in his honor, God in no way either enforces or promotes or sanctions idleness. The benefits which the Sabbath, with its worship and its holy sanctions, brings to men makes it anything but a day of idleness, and can never tend in any degree to idleness.

And right here, those who are working for what they call Sabbath laws, to compel men to do no work on a certain day, are brought into a dilemma. For, for the State to attempt to compel men to do no work during one whole day of the week can be nothing else than to enforce idleness, because the State never can furnish those holy sanctions which belong with the Sabbath of God, and which alone prevent it from being a day of idleness. And as "Satan always finds something for idle hands to do," as idleness is only a root of wickedness, any such effort on the part of the State is only to sanction wickedness and to multiply the elements of evil. Either this, or else the State is compelled to try to supply the compensations which God has attached to his Sabbath, and compel men to observe it religiously, and as a holy day. But any attempt to enforce religious observances only makes hypocrites, and multiplies sin, because love for God is essential to every act of religious duty. For a man to pretend to render obedience or homage to God when he has no love for God in his heart, only dishonors God, and does violence to man's own nature. For anybody to obey God or perform religious observances from interested motives is sin; and for the State to exert its power to compel men to act religiously and to honor God, does force them to act from interested motives, and, consequently, is only to compel them to commit sin.

But hypocrisy and sin increased and multiplied by the exertion of national power, can end only in ruin, and that in a little while. Therefore, it is only at its peril that the State can ever enforce the observance of a Sabbath. For to enforce it without its religious sanctions is only to enforce idleness, which can only end in more wickedness; and for the State to attempt to supply the religious sanctions is only to enforce hypocrisy, multiply sin, and so increase unto more ungodliness. Therefore the sum of the whole matter is, as we have stated often, and as we have proved from the direct statement of Scripture, that civil government can never of right have anything to do with the observance or non-observance of the Sabbath.

Dr. Hall, in naming idlers as the first of the bad elements in our large cities, makes an unanswerable argument against his own effort to secure Sunday laws and their enforcement. A. T. J.
