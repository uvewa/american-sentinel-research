They tell us that they want the Sunday law because one day of rest in seven is a physical necessity. Grant it; then what? From five to seven hours of sleep in twenty-four is a physical necessity. Any physician will say that a man who gets regular rest every night, but works seven days in the week, will last longer than the man who rests every seventh day, but gets only half as much sleep as he ought to each night. Now if a Sunday law is necessary, why is not a night law equally necessary? If we are going to legislate for the man who doesn't know enough to rest when he is tired, why not take in the man who doesn't sleep at the time designed by nature for sleep, as well as the man who doesn't rest on Sunday, possibly because he has already rested?
