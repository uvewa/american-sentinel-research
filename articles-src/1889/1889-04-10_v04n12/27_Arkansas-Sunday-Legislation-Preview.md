Next week we shall give some facts about recent Sunday legislation in Arkansas. A bill taking away the liberties granted in the act of two years ago, which was secured through the efforts of Col. R. H. Crockett, has already passed the Senate. Some of the speeches made on the occasion of its passage were most intolerant. We should like to present it this week, but that would involve the holding over of too much matter already in type. We have also a choice remnant of medieval barbarism to present from one of Oakland's honored clergymen. It will show how the mania for Sunday laws blunts all sense of justice and right.
