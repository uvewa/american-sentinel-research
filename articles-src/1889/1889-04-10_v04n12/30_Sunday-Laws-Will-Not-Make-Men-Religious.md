The Sunday-law people will find a good many hard problems before they get through with the job they have undertaken. They imagine that the enactment and enforcement of a Sunday law is going to do away with almost all lawlessness. As a matter of fact, we believe it will make more. It is certain that men cannot be made religious or moral by law. The fact that a strict Sunday law stops all work, will not make people any more religiously inclined than before. Those who respect Sunday as a sacred day will conform to the law, for they would abstain from work and amusement if there were no law, while those who have no conscientious scruples in regard to Sunday, being debarred from their ordinary amusements, will break out in some other place. Sunday laws will not make them religious, nor will they make them act as though they were religious.
