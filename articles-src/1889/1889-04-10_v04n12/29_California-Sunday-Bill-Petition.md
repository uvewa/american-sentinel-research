The *Christian Statesman's* correspondent who writes from the Senate Chamber at Sacramento about the Sunday bill that was introduced into the California Legislature, but failed to pass, says:—

> "Some editors, lawyers, and ministers had been circulating a counter petition to the one in favor of the Sunday bill, and thousands of signatures had been obtained, principally Adventists and laboring classes."

It would seem strange if editors, lawyers, and ministers should circulate a petition and still not sign it; but allowing that the counter petition was signed only by the laboring class, what becomes of the argument that the clamor for a Sunday law comes from that class?
