One more instance is given in the *Christian Statesman* of March 14, of the unity of purpose of the Women's Christian Temperance Union and the National Reform Association. Secretary Wylie devotes his report to a eulogy of a woman suffrage speech by Miss Shaw, superintendent of the Franchise Department of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, at the annual convention of the Steuben County Union in Ray, Indiana, and closes with the statement that "delegates were appointed to attend the National Reform Convention in Pittsburg in April." We are in favor of temperance, especially of Christian temperance, but we should like to know how we can oppose the work that is falsely called National Reform and not oppose the work that the so-called Woman's Christian Temperance Union is now doing. It is fast getting to be a temperance union only in name, and its Christianity is almost all politics. And such politics!
