The American Sentinel, Oakland, Cal., for August 28, is largely devoted to refuting charges brought against it and its editors by W. F. Crafts, field secretary of the American Sabbath Union, who made an affidavit at Colorado Springs that the editors were guilty of willful and malicious falsehood and slander "by the square foot." With the Sentinel's showing by means of *facsimiles* of letters written by Crafts to Prof. Jones, one of its editors, compared with the sworn statements of Crafts, the conclusion that the apostle of the National Sabbath law advocacy is guilty of perjury, is irresistible—*Silver Gate (San Diego), Sept. 14.*
