# Let Them Persuade Men.

Men who do not have enough religion or enough of the Spirit of Christ to draw them to the house of worship, but are compelled to rest on Sunday, are going to be the worse off for a Sunday law. The wickedness is in their unregenerate hearts, and it is going to find a way out, unless its place is filled by the Spirit of Christ. It is not all poetry which parents say to their children, “that Satan finds some mischief still for idle hands to do.” If a man has not the spirit of the gospel to draw him to God and to make a Christian of him, the State cannot do it. It can only plunge him the deeper into his own sins. Can you dam up Niagara so that the waters will not run? Can you cover up Vesuvius and hermetically seal it so that it will not yield to the elements within? If you could, another crater would soon be found. If from the engine you do not allow the steam to escape from one valve, it will from another.

Now take the favorite statement of Sundaylaw advocates that it is a civil Sunday that they want, and not a religious Sunday. That is, they want to compel men who have no religious incentive, to be idle on Sunday. If they do not allow men to work on that day, they force them to be idle; and when they do that they simply force them to find some new way to give vent to the deviltry which is within. The only remedy for sin is the gospel of Christ; but they cannot take the love of Jesus Christ and by law put it into the hearts of men. It is impossible to make them better, but they will make it possible for men to be worse than they were before,—they will make hypocrisy a necessary result. If ministers will go to men and use persuasion, if they will talk from the pulpit, or write through the press, and work every day of the week, they are but exercising their right to get men to observe the first day of the week, and they should be protected in it; but to solicit the aid of the State to make men righteous by keeping Sunday, is un-American and un-Christian.
