The Rev. Mr. Carroll of the Central Methodist Church, Stockton, in his sermon last Sunday took a very radical stand for a minister of his denomination. In speaking of a national Sunday law he maintained that the mixture of religion and government had resulted in evil from the time of Constantine down to the Puritans; that freedom of conscience and its exercise was guaranteed by the Constitution. The Rev. Mr. Carroll is an American and believes in American institutions.—*From the Los Angeles Tribune.*
