The spirit of "National Reform" sometimes comes to the surface in a garb that is simply appalling. It would be some relief, when an occasional individual of the more rabid type assures the public that he only speaks for himself in his ultra utterances, were it not for the fact that these expressions of sentiment are never disclaimed by any of the party. The clamor of the more outspoken in this "reform" movement for laws that will disfranchise, socially ostracise, banish, and even put to death opponents, has never yet been disowned by any organ or representative of the National Reform Association. The appeal for a theocratic government, a *counterfeit* of the government of ancient Israel, reveals an inward vindictiveness on the part of some otherwise meek- appearing men that seem almost incredible. But, as "out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh," we are compelled to believe the evidence. So that, when one openly advocates human laws that will put to death his Sabbath-breaking neighbor, and will put to death the blasphemer, we naturally infer that he longs to see that extreme penalty executed. And this in the name of Christianity!
