# The Evangelical.

At the hearing before the Senate Committee on Education and Labor February 15, 1889, in behalf of the Blair resolution, to teach religion in all the schools of the nation, there were prominent men pleading for the adoption of the proposed amendment, from Philadelphia, New York, and Baltimore. Rev. George K. Morris, D. D., of Philadelphia, drew the line between those who favored the amendment and those who opposed it, by the following statement:—

> “I ask your attention to the fact that on this matter of the proposed constitutional amendment, the country stands divided principally along the line indicated by the evangelical church bodies on the one side, and the Roman Catholic Church on the other.”

Upon this the chairman asked,—

> “In that do you count all who are Catholics on one side and all who are not Catholics on the other?”

*Rev. Dr. Morris*—”No, sir, we count all who are Catholics on one side and all who are of evangelical faiths on the other side.”

Then presently Senator George inquired,—

> “Exclusive of the Mormons, too?”

*Rev. Dr. Morris*—“No, not the Mormons. They would be evangelical in one sense.”

And so the Mormons have become evangelical! We don’t see, then, why the churches should make such a great complaint about the Mormons and their hierarchy so long as they can be classed with the evangelicals. But Dr. Morris says they are evangelicals in one sense. He didn’t say in which sense it is, but it is presumable that they are evangelicals because they favor the Bible and the teaching of religion in the public schools.

From Dr. Morris’ speech it is evident that those who favor the use of the Bible and the teaching of religion in the public schools, are evangelical, and all who oppose it are not. All who favor it are evangelical, even though it be the Mormon Bible and the Mormon religion which they favor. Joseph Cook favors the Edmunds amendment rather than the Blair amendment to the Constitution. And the Edmunds amendment proposes to allow the reading of the Bible in the public schools. It would devolve upon the people in each State or Territory or school district to say what Bible should be read, and the majority, having the power to decide, would have the Bible which pleases the majority. Where the Catholics are in the majority it would be the Catholic Bible; where the Protestants are in the majority it would be the Protestant Bible; and where the Mormons are in the majority it would be the Mormon Bible. But, as the Mormons are evangelical, we suppose it is badly unorthodox to protest against any such system.

We do protest, nevertheless. We deny the right of the Protestant majority to compel the Roman Catholic minority to read, or to listen to the reading of, the Protestant Bible in the public schools. We likewise deny the right of a majority of the Catholics to compel the Protestant minority to read, or listen to the reading of, the Roman Catholic Bible in the public schools. We deny the right of the Mormon majority to compel the gentile minority to read, or listen to the reading of, the Mormon Bible in the public schools; and we deny the right of the evangelical Protestant and Mormon majority together to compel the unevangelical Catholic and gentile minority to submit to the dictates of their unevangelical religion.

The sum of it all is, that by no right whatever can religion ever be taught, or the Bible read, in the public schools.A. T. J. [303-304]

Note.—No papers are sent by the publishers of the American Sentinel to people who have not subscribed for it. If the Sentinel comes to one who has not subscribed for it, he may know that it is sent him by some friend, and that he will not be called upon by the publishers to pay for the same.

From October 1, 1888, to October 1, 1889, there were printed and circulated 1,288,566 copies of the American Sentinel. The Sentinel is a success and is going to remain so. We ask our many friends to help us to reach the 2,000,000 line at the end of 1890.

Here is a proposition which we submit to the candid consideration of all men, upon the question of religious instruction or the use of the Bible in the public schools: The public school fund is drawn from the whole people, without discrimination or preference, and with no reference whatever to any question as to either religion or the Bible. Therefore the same fund should be used and applied for the benefit of the whole people *as it is raised,* without discrimination or preference. As the money is raised without reference to those who believe in the Bible or religious instruction, so it should be expended and used. If the money when raised is to be applied according to the dictation and according to the religious wishes of those who believe in the Bible and religious instruction, then justice demands that the money shall be raised by taxation only upon those persons. The conclusion is that justice will never allow religious exercises or religious instruction in the public schools.

It is urged by the advocates of Sunday legislation that such laws are necessary to prevent the day from being wholly devoured by greed. But that this is not true is shown by facts stated by Rev. W. F. Crafts, in his book, “The Sabbath for Man,” page 53. Referring to Sunday, he says:—

> “The Sabbath is now marked in the French Code only by the unimportant by-laws that make it a *dies non* in judicial proceedings, and by a few other very indirect recognitions; but while the Sabbath laws have diminished in the last fifteen years, Sunday trade has also diminished. The earliest note of this change that we find is in the New York *Times* of June 8, 1869, and is as follows: ‘A very profound and wonderful reform has just been begun in Paris. The principal shops, including those of nearly all linen drapers, hosiers, silk mercers, and venders of ready-made apparel, will henceforth close on Sundays. The merchants have taken this step of their own accord, and the employes appeal to the goodwill of the public to aid them in making the measure general.’”

If Sunday rest can become more general in France without a Sunday law, why can it not be maintained in this country without such a law?

In the *Christian Statesman,* August 22, there is a report of a Sabbath convention at Ocean Grove held by the New Jersey Sabbath Union, which is an auxiliary of the American Sabbath Union. Rev. J. H. Knowles, general secretary of the American Sabbath Union, was chairman of the convention. Representatives were present from the Philadelphia Sabbath Association, and the King’s and the Queen’s County Sabbath Observance Societies of New York, and the Law and Order Leagues of Trenton, and Newark, New Jersey. Rev. Dr. Kynett, of Philadelphia, was one of the speakers, and said:—

> “The American Sabbath is a religious institution. It is a day of rest, but not of recreation. The American Christian Sabbath lays the obligation on the conscience, as it is a day of religious rest.”

And yet they will call legislation in behalf of that institution *civil* legislation! The enforcement of the observance of such an institution as that, they call the observance only of the *civil *Sunday. They may call it all these things, and whatever else they please, but their calling it so will not make it so. The fact is that the Sunday institution is ecclesiastical only, and any legislation looking to its observance is only ecclesiastical legislation, and the enforcement of an ecclesiastical institution. And it is wicked.

The *Christian Nation* says:—

> “One of the greatest hindrances in the way of National Reform is the false idea of civil government— the theory so largely carried into practice in all national affairs, that civil government is a mere secular institution.”

Yes, that is true. That is the theory of the American Constitution. It is the American theory, and being so it is indeed a great hindrance to National Reform. If this government had been started with a constitution pledging the government to things of another world, and to the affairs of men’s souls instead of their bodies, then it would never have been any hindrance in the way of the National Reform scheme of government. But then it would not have been a civil government at all. It would have been a religious government, and only a part of the machinery of the church. But, fortunately for the people, our fathers considered that the church ought to be able to do its own work without the aid of governmental power, and that the government could better do its legitimate work without any of the meddling interference of the church managers. Therefore they forbade the National Legislature to have anything to do with religion, or another world, or with men’s souls. And this is the great hindrance to National Reform! Yes, that is true, and therefore, nothing could more clearly show that the National Reform movement is essentially un-American and subversive of the liberties guaranteed in the United States Constitution. And every American and every man in America who loves American principles ought to be uncompromisingly opposed to it, as the American Sentinel is.

In the Sunday campaign that has of late been carried on in California, Judge Stephen J. Field’s opinion of 1859 has been made to do duty for all that its indorsers think it is worth. If it were to be made to do duty for only what it is worth, it would not amount to much; but when for what its indorsers *think* it is worth then it amounts to a good deal. One statement from it was used in the Los Angeles Sunday Convention by a lawyer to the effect that the object of Sunday laws “is not to protect those who can rest at their pleasure, but to afford rest to those who need it and who from the conditions of society could not otherwise obtain it.”

No Sunday law that ever was made was enacted with any such object. The only object that has ever been in the enactment of Sunday laws is religious. The very law which Judge Field was discussing in this opinion had respect to religion as such, for it distinctly named “the Christian Sabbath.” The very law in support of which this opinion is quoted distinctly declares its object to be to protect the Lord’s day as a day of rest and *religious* worship. And the petition which they would support by the opinion not only asks for legislation in behalf of religion but for the enforced *“religious* observance” of a day. The object of Sunday laws never has been to protect anybody, but in almost every case to compel everybody. It never has been to protect anybody’s rest, but to compel everybody to rest. It never has been to protect the religious observances of the people, but to compel people who are not religious to conform to the religious opinions of those who profess to be religious.

The “Sunday-rest civil Sabbath” by legal compulsion *a la* old Blue Laws of Connecticut enacted about 1650, is quite a scheme, but the hard-worked young men of San Diego seem to take their Sunday rests in a very active way out at Recreation Park. Some of their neighbors object, but we have never yet known any of the base-ball boys object to their opponents either going to church or to bed for rest on Sunday. Let the boys shut out gambling, intoxicants, unbecoming language, and undue noises, from their park; and let the church folks shut out gambling fairs, intoxicating-wine sacraments, “dress parades,” from their sanctuaries; and shut out from their hearts, especially, that uncharitableness that cannot allow others what they claim for themselves,—the right to do as they please so long as they commit no offense against the laws of the land; and both parties will be the better for it.—*Silver Gate, September 14.*

The czar of all the Russias has become displeased with the Lutheran Church and has issued a ukase abolishing it throughout his dominions. All his imperial majesty lias to do with the greatest institutions is to forbid their existence and they are abolished. Churches are amenable to royal displeasure, and Russia cannot even have a religion if the czar feels hostile to it. While the Greek Church is the popular religion of Russia the Lutherans are the great body of Christians throughout Northern Europe, as that church is recognized in Germany and all the Scandinavian countries. The Lutherans form the most consistent body of Christians in all the Old World countries, and yet the czar abolishes them as easily as one could say “Jack Robinson.” It is to be hoped that his royal highness will go a little slow in his despotic rulings, or he may abolish things divine and otherwise. He might try his hand on the evil one and see if he can get away with him. If Satan is abolished in Russia the Muscovites can get along comfortably without the churches. As there are only three millions of Lutherans in Russia, the czar can abolish them if the Nihilists don’t succeed first in abolishing the czar.— *Oregonian.* [305]
