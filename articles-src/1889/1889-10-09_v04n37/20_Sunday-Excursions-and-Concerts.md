The *Nation,* not the *Christian Nation,* says:—

> "There is more happiness, better order and less crime among the poorer people of New York since cheap Sunday excursions enabled them to take a trip up the river or down the harbor, than when necessity kept them cooped up through the day in tenement houses."

There is not the least doubt but that this is true. And yet the Sunday-law workers propose to stop every kind of excursion or journeying on Sunday, especially with the poorer people, because the rich can afford to own their own carriages and can take a ride or drive as they please. But under the proposed Sunday-law system all the poorer people will be "cooped up" through the whole day in their crowded tenement houses and narrow streets and alleys; which shows clearly enough that the Sunday-law movement instead of being a movement in favor of the poorer people is a direct discrimination against them.

Again the *Nation* says:—

> "The most rigid Sabbatarian with the most violent prejudices against Sunday concerts for example only needs to view the wonderful spectacle presented in Central Park on Sunday afternoon in mid-summer to feel—and confess if he is honest—that he has not understood what he has been talking about in his ignorance."

Yes, he will, if he is honest; but there is the rub. It is very seldom that Sunday-law bigotry ever becomes honest enough to make such a confession as that, because it is not against any essential evil in those concerts that the complaint is made, but solely as the Kings County Sunday-law Association said, that they are afraid that "the churches will be depopulated." And to the Sunday-law churchman that fearful alternative turns everything that is done on Sunday into the blackest of crimes.
