"Office is opportunity," is the motto displayed on the letter-heads used by the field secretary of the American Sabbath Union. This is but another version of the standard political maxim, "To the victors belong the spoils." The constant display of this avowal may be taken as a declaration that the union seeks political power, and if successful will not be slow to use it for the furtherance of its schemes. A country that is fully awake to the value of liberty, will be slow to place official "opportunity" in the hands of a party of religionists whose aims are expressed by such mercenary sentiments.
