Professor Blanchard, in Elgin Convention, said, "In this work we are undertaking for the Sabbath we are the representatives of God." W. F. Crafts, in *Christian Statesman,* July 5, 1888, said, "The preachers are the successors of the prophets." Will not these "representatives of God" be content with the use of the "sword and the bullet" in this life, or do they claim the right to inflict punishment beyond it?— *W*, *in Prohibition Journal.*
