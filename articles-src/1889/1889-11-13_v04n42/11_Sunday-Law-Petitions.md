# Sunday-Law Petitions.

It may be surprising to those unacquainted with the proceedings of the National Reform party, to witness the rapidity with which numbers can be added to the list of petitioners for the passage of a Sunday-Rest law, under the supervision of W. F. Crafts, field secretary of the American Sabbath Union.

At the close of an address delivered by him in the lecture-room of the First Baptist Church of St. Paul, Minn., September 29, he called for all who desired to express themselves in favor of the passage of a Sunday-Rest law, to make it manifest by rising. No sooner had part of the audience risen than the pastor, without taking the trouble to count, declared the number standing to be two hundred.

Mr. Crafts allowed this to pass without entering a word of protest, and it therefore evidently met his approval.

The pastor said he had counted the chairs in the morning. Knowing the number of chairs, he considered himself prepared to decide at a glance, with sufficient accuracy, as to the number to be added to the list of petitioners of those favoring the passage of a Sunday-Rest bill. Such guesswork would not be allowable in ordinary business petitions, but this movement seems to be a very prolific movement in easy and quick methods in the petition work. R. C. Porter.
