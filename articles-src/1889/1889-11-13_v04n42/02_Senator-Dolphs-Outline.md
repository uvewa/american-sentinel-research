> "Senator Dolph, of Oregon," says the *American Standard,* "has outlined the work of Congress this winter thus: Justice must be done the Chinese immigration laborers who hold return certificates. The interstate commerce and civil service laws will be amended; Blair's education bill will come up. The pension office will be investigated, and the tariff will be revised."
