# A Good Templar, on Sunday Closing of Saloons.

The following letter speaks for itself. The writer is not, however, indebted to us, but to some friend, for the copies of the American Sentinel for which he thanks us.

Ottumwa, Iowa, October 22, 1889.

Editors American Sentinel: Please accept my thanks for copies of your paper. I have carefully read them, and am pleased to know that such an able advocate of “equal and exact justice to all men, of whatever state or persuasion, religious or political,” is published in my favorite State, now the home of my people. I hope erelong the American Sentinel will be a welcome weekly visitor in the majority of the homes of sensible, liberty-loving people throughout the United States.

At the present time many such fearless advocates of equal rights are needed. A certain class whose motto is “Rule or Ruin” is slowly but surely gaining ground. The laboring masses must conform to their ideas of right, or they will put on the thumb-screws.

I do not believe in Sunday closing of saloons. I am a Good Templar, and wish that all such places could be closed forever. But Sunday closing does not better the condition of the drinking man’s family.

As a general thing, the working-men receive their wages for the week on Saturday evening. In times past they would buy the household necessities, take a drink or two, reserve a small sum for Sunday drinks, and go home. Where the Sunday-closing law is strictly enforced, the greater portion, and sometimes all, of the hard earnings of those who drink goes to purchase enough whisky to get beastly drunk, and to purchase enough to carry home to last over Sunday. The consequence of this is that there is regular Saturday-night rackets in such homes, and the frightened wives and children creep into their miserable beds to think of the dinnerless morrow. Can they think of church?—Ah no!

Now let us view the other side of the matter. Suppose the husband and father is sober and industrious (and there are thousands of such) but has a large family to support and house rent to pay. Can he clothe his family in the garb that is suitable to enter the grand churches? He is at perfect liberty to join any church he chooses and give all he can to help keep it up. But let his wife enter the portals of the magnificent church with an unfashionable bonnet on her head or a last year’s cloak on her back, the grand dames (who, by the wav, have the most to say about Sunday religion) will draw their silks and satins more closely around them for fear of contact, and shake their plumed heads in grave disapproval. The poor woman notices all this and prefers staying at home, while the husband makes up his mind to seek for recreation for himself and family the next Sabbath where they will not be made fun of. And who can blame him?

I used to know many families in San Francisco that went almost regularly on the Sunday to Woodward’s Gardens. Their excuse was, they could hear good music by going there, and it was their only opportunity for doing so, as they were laboring men and could not dress fine enough to go to church. Let such places be closed on Sunday, also the beautiful parks, and where in the name of common humanity are such people going to catch a glimpse of the beauties of this life?— Nowhere. They must slave all the week and spend their Sundays shut up in a crowded tenement home.

There is much I would like to say regarding the Sunday question, but I have already taken too much space.
