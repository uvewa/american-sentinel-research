The harvest of grains and fruits is not more regular or abundant than the yield of human affections, sympathies, fellowships; but here also there are differences of seasons and of soils. We must improve our spiritual husbandry. We must enrich the ground from which good qualities spring. We must expose our inmost life to the quickening sun.— C. *G. Ames.*
