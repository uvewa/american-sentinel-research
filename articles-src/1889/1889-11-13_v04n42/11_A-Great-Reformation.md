# A Great Reformation.

Dr. Bothwell, of the Chase Street Congregational Church, West Oakland, delivered a lecture, October 27, on Pope Gregory VII., or, “Rome’s Most Successful Attempt at Universal Dominion.” In the report in the *Morning Times* occurs the following extract:—

> “Gregory effected a great reformation during his reign, effecting the celibacy of the clergy, and taking away the benefice of the kings by elevating the spiritual above the temporal power, compelling the greatest emperor of his time, Henry IV., to humble before him. He accomplished this because he excelled other men in brain power, in knowledge, in zeal and singleness of purpose, and in his grasp of the mighty basic principles of the Redeemer’s kingdom. Christian people should, therefore, be content with no ordinary attainments, and with the full inspiration from God they should be able to accomplish much; and to enjoy the vastness of his kingdom all should make the fullest preparation.”

Mr. Bothwell is an ardent Sunday-law advocate. This is the apology for this notice of the utterance above quoted. The fact is pertinent in connection with such a sentiment, as showing the general tendency of that class of religionists to sympathize with the Catholic ideas of the church’s relation to the State. There is no doubt of the facts asserted in regard to Gregory’s aggressiveness, and also of his success in securing the domination of the church over the State. It may be fairly admitted that Gregory was actuated by a zeal for the reformation of the church, of which it certainly stood in much need in his day, and that his motive was not altogether a power-seeking one. There is no doubt that this was his idea of reformation.

But to characterize the things here specified by the lecturer as “a great Reformation,” looks like an almost desperate attempt on the part of a Protestant minister to apologize for the domineering policy of the Papacy as regards its attitude toward the secular power. It would seem that Protestant aspirants for ecclesiastical domination in secular affairs, seeing their cause is so palpably papal in its nature, feel constrained to indorse almost anything coming from Rome in order to make a show of consistency.

When a married Protestant minister will hold up before his congregation, and before the public, the idea that “effecting the celibacy of the clergy” was “a great reformation,” it certainly appears as though there was some pressing necessity for presenting papal dogmas in a favorable light. And is not the same conclusion doubly assured when the same estimate is placed upon the act of “taking away the benefice of the kings by elevating the spiritual above the temporal power?” And what shall we say when in the same strain he parades these extreme assumptions of the Papacy as “the mighty basic principles of the Redeemer’s kingdom”?

Yet this man, only a few weeks ago, when advocating a Sunday law, utterly disclaimed being in favor of a union of Church and State. Can anyone read the extract from his lecture here quoted without the conviction that the Doctor has certainly changed his mind? Well, if he does not favor the *union* of Church and State, it is because he believes in “elevating the spiritual above the temporal power” so high that the latter will have nothing to say whatever, and the church will have “universal dominion.”

A correspondent of the *Jewish Voice,* St. Louis, Mo., writes as follows to that paper:—

> “Not long ago your correspondent saw in one of the daily newspapers an account of the arrest of several Jews for not keeping their stores closed on Sunday. These same men had rested the day preceding. What shall we say to this? There is no one more devoted to his country, no one who has less prejudice and more regard for the opinions of his fellow-men, than the writer. Yet this deed approaches his sense of the unjust, and arouses as much of a feeling of resentment as dare be found in the heart of a Jew, and he still be called a Jew in the sight of God. Is there any nation which has representatives in the United States who are more peaceable than the Jews? Is there any nation that causes less annoyance to the government?—None! If you ask why, we answer, Because the turbulent spirit has been conquered by years of cruel persecution. They love the Constitution of the United States. Why?—Because it is founded on the one which their great Lawgiver framed for them. Still, in this very country, that has the statue of liberty at the entrance of the harbor of its most densely populated city, freedom of thought, of action, is forbidden; aye, more than that, *punished *by law; it is true, not by the rack or the stocks, but by a *refined* mode suitable to the age.”

The President’s Thanksgiving proclamation is peculiar in that it says “that the people of our country, ceasing from the cares and labor of their working-days, shall assemble in their respective places of worship and give thanks to God, who has prospered us on our way,” etc. This reminds us of the idea which has been expressed— we cannot now recall the words—that that which is at first given only as advice comes in time to have the force of positive command. Of course it was not the purpose of the President to command anybody to observe Thanksgiving, but the language which he has used is suggestive of the tendency toward official supervision of religious matters. We know of no greater farce, however, than our American Thanksgiving, and they who suppose that God is honored by a day set apart to gormandizing have a very low conception of Deity. [343-344]

Note.—No papers are sent by the publishers of the American Sentinel to people who have not subscribed for it. If the Sentinel comes to one who has not subscribed for it, he may know that it is sent him by some friend, and that he will not be called upon by the publishers to pay for the same.

The *Pacific Coast Eight-Hour Herald,* Vol. 1, No. 1, is upon our table. It is the organ of the Pacific Coast Eight-hour League. It is a bright paper, ably edited, and will, no doubt, exert a powerful influence in favor of shorter hours of labor. The *Herald* is a four-page monthly, published at 834 Howard Street, San Francisco. Subscription price, 50 cents per year.

Conspicuous among the many excellent educational institutions of the Pacific Coast, is the San Francisco Business College. The president, Niel S. Phelps, is one of the finest educators in the State, and indeed the names of the Faculty are a sufficient guarantee of the excellence of the instruction given. The college paper, *San Francisco Business College Journal,* is one of the brightest and best we have ever seen, and any of our readers contemplating a business course should send for a specimen copy, and thus learn more about the college which it represents.

In Peru the only church recognized by the government is the “Holy Catholic Church.” There is a Protestant church at Lima and another at Callao; but no building for Protestant worship is allowed to be in sight from the street; it must be within such walls as will give no public indication of a place of worship. This is the same sort of toleration which the American Sabbath Union proposes to grant to those who do not agree with them as to the obligation to keep Sunday religiously; they will kindly permit them to do private work on Sunday in out-of-the-way places, behind walls and shutters.

Rev. N. R. Johnston, a correspondent of the *Christian Statesman,* thinks “a Christian people [should] scatter away all iniquity by constitutional or statute law.” Iniquity is sin; therefore he must think that sin can be scattered away by civil law! We would like to know of a single instance where it has been done. The Scriptures teach that only the power of God can take away sin, that only the grace of God can forgive sin, and that only the Spirit of God can so renew the human mind that it will not love sin. Had Mr. Johnston only lived before Christ, possibly the Son of God need not have died, and sin might have been abolished by civil law!

The National Reformers do not want a union of Church and State. Oh, no, they are bitterly opposed to anything of that sort! What they do want may be inferred, however, from the following from an article by Rev. J. M. Foster, one of the district secretaries, in the Christian *Cynosure *of October 17. Mr. Foster says:—

> “According to the Scriptures, the State and its sphere exist for the sake of, and to serve the interests of, the church. The true State will have a wise reference to the church’s interests in all its legislative, executive, and judicial proceedings. . . . The expenses of the church, in carrying on her public aggressive work, it (the State) meets in whole, or in part, out of the public treasury. Thus the church is protected and exalted by the State.”

This makes it clear that it is not union but vassalage which National Reformers want; the State to be the vassal. No wonder they wish to change that feature of our fundamental law which accords with the idea that governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed. They know that the “governed” in this country will never willingly submit to their wicked schemes.

The *Statesman* (Chicago), more bold than its fellows, in an editorial in its September number says:—

> “The open sale of liquors on Sunday is doubtless a serious evil, as is its sale on all days; but the question at issue is not the sale of an injurious article, nor the presence in the market of a pernicious traffic. The question which has been before the Chicago public for some years is the Sunday slavery, resulting to many thousands of her citizens through an utter disregard of all Sunday laws by some of her citizens. The fight is not specifically against the saloon, but against unlawful Sunday toil and traffic of every sort.”

Thus it appears, as we have often said, that the real object of Sunday closing is the exaltation of Sunday rather than the promotion of temperance and the restriction of the liquor traffic. Now let us hear no more of this hypocritical cant about Sunday prohibition of rum-selling when the saloons are allowed free course on the other six days and till midnight on Saturday.

The Presbyterian Synod of Minnesota, at its recent meeting in Minneapolis, adopted the following report of the committee on better Sabbath observance:—

> “1. That the synod of Minnesota gives the American Sabbath Union, national, State, district, and local, most hearty indorsement and support.

> “2. That our pastors, stated supplies, and elders representing vacant churches, be requested to urge the immediate organization of local unions in their respective communities, and that they hold themselves in readiness to superintend the local interests of Sabbath reform, including the formation of a citizens’ committee on Sabbath closing, and the circulating of petitions requesting the enactment and enforcement of Sunday-Rest laws.
> “3. That the members of our churches be urged to co-operate in all proper measures for the furtherance of the cause of Sabbath observance, and that they be particularly urged to give official indorsement to petitions presented by pastors, stated supplies, or elders.”
This shows the drift of sentiment among the majority of popular religionists; it is not toward more consistent living on their own part, but toward laws compelling those who are out of the church to observe church institutions.

The *Christian Cynosure* says:—

> “However Protestants may voice their fears of Jesuit aggression and intrigue, they are unlikely to use too vigorous language when the leading Romanist papers, like the *Catholic Review,* can speak of the patrons of the American public school and of the school fund in such terms as these: ‘Catholics will not make war on the public school, because they believe in admitting the State to a limited share in educating the children; because they know that half the millions of America are pagans who desire a pagan training for their children; and because they are certain that the public schools, in their present state, are suitable for these people. Believing that the State should take an interest in education, but knowing that the State school, admirably suited for pagans, is not the school for Catholic or Protestant children, they are bound to build up a Catholic branch of the public-school system, where children will be educated as Catholics at the expense of the State.’”

And, pray, why not, we would like to ask, if it is the province of the State to teach religion at all? So far as the matter of teaching religion in the schools is concerned, Catholics and Protestants of the *Cynosure* type are at one: they both want religion taught in the public schools and at public expense, the only difference being that each party demands that their religion shall be that which shall be taught.

The American Sabbath Union is an extensive religious combination to effect a political object, and is, therefore, according to the words of Hou. Richard M. Johnson, dangerous. In 1828-29, Congress was asked to suspend the carrying of the mails upon Sunday. The matter was referred to the committee on post-offices and post-roads, of which Mr. Johnson was chairman, who reported adversely. One of their reasons was as follows:—

> “Extensive religious combinations to effect a political object are, in the opinion of the committee, always dangerous. This first effort of the kind calls for the establishment of a principle which, in the opinion of the committee, would lay the foundation for dangerous innovations upon the spirit of the Constitution, and upon the religious rights of the citizen. If admitted, it may be justly apprehended that the future measures of the government will be strongly marked, if not eventually controlled, by the same influence. All religious despotisms commence by combination and influence, and when that influence begins to operate upon the political institutions of a country, the civil power soon bends under it; and the catastrophe of other nations furnishes an awful warning of the consequences.”

These words were true sixty years ago, and they are just as true to-day. Therefore, let all who love liberty beware of the American Sabbath Union and its work.

The following is from Dr. Barrows’ thanksgiving service in the October number of the *Treasury.* It does not well accord with some of the ideas advanced by that school of religionists who think that our nation’s Constitution is infidel because it is secular. Dr. Barrows says:—

> “The eloquent voice of the Honorable William C. P. Breckinridge, of Kentucky, has shown us that liberty is the child of that interpretation of the Bible which became general with the Protestant Reformation. We may say with truth that ‘free America was born of the Bible.’ From the Bible came the simpler forms of self- government, in town and church, that have gone with our civilization in its westward march. . . Hence came also the separation of Church and State, and the soul liberty which Roger Williams learned from Him who said, ‘My kingdom is not of this world.’ From the Bible came, as Edward Everett declared, ‘the better elements of our national institutions.’ It was an echo from the Scriptures which Jefferson sounded in the great Declaration. From the Bible came the moral forces that carried through our first Revolution, and which have withstood the castings of corruption in succeeding years. From the same source have sprung the moral reformations that have preserved our nationality and our freedom. ‘The American republic is of heavenly birth.’” [345]
