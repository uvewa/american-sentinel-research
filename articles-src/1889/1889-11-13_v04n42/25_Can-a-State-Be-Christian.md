Romish priests and editors are busy trying to make it appear that this is a Christian nation; also the Protestants, who are clamoring for Congress to enact a Sunday-observance law. Will someone tell us how a State, a corporation without a soul, can be Christian? We can readily understand how the people of a nation can call themselves Christian, but suppose all the people of the United States were believers in Christ, would that make the State, which has neither entity, soul, or conscience, Christian? The State is the community formed for the protection of its citizens in their civil rights, to prevent crime, and afford all equal rights.— *Western American.*
