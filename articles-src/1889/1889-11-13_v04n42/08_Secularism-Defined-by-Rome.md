# Secularism Defined by Rome.

That which is denominated “secularism” is not infidelity, as many who are not well informed imagine, nor is it akin to infidelity; it is simply the American doctrine of the total separation of Church and State, of civil and ecclesiastical governments. Nor is it simply a correct political doctrine; it is the very essence of true Protestantism and sound Christianity. There is, and can be, no middle ground; either the State has *all* to do with religion or it has *nothing* to do with it; either the majority have the right to dictate to the minority in matters of religious faith and practice or they have not. If they have the right they alone are the proper judges as to how far they shall exercise that right; but if they have not that right any interference whatever is usurpation and tyranny. The following article, from the *Catholic Review* of October 20, may perhaps help some to see just what secularism is, and also to see that by opposing it as infidelity they are simply giving aid and comfort to the Papacy, advocating a union of Church and State, and jeopardizing the liberties of themselves and their children. The *Review* says:—

> “Every day the character of the struggle with secularism is becoming more bitter and better understood. It is a fearful struggle. In France it is acutest, and secularism has just achieved in the elections half a victory. In Italy secularism is triumphant, since its enemies are effectively muzzled. The era of persecution has set in in both these countries, but it has not yet come to blood. In Austria and Germany Christians still control the situation; in England secularism is steadily pushing its way to the front under the guidance of men like John Morley.

> “On the American continent it is magnificently entrenched. Mexico and many of the South American republics are its victims, and the United States is its stronghold. Its conscious and unconscious adherents in the United States must number forty millions. Its chief support is the Protestant sects, with all their machinery and wealth. They are yielding to it from without and are undermined by it from within. They are, in fact, the most active propagandist of secularism outside European Freemasonry that exists in the world. The professed secularists have no press, no pulpit, no machine in this country. They have but to write an essay after the fashion of Edwin D. Mead, its latest apostle, and immediately the entire American press and Protestant pulpit is at its command.
> “Outside of the Episcopalian and Lutheran denominations every pulpit is its rostrum. Outside of the papers published by these denominations every journal in the country professes its belief in secularism. Among the daily journals the *Sun* and the *Journal of Commerce* stand alone against it. Among the sectarian journals, the *Independent,* the *Christian Advocate, Zion’s Herald,* the *Christian Union,* the *Congregationalist,* the *Intelligencer,* all leading papers and all models which their minor brethren follow, are promoters of secularism. Blinder than bats, they give all their time to proving that the patriotic duty of the hour is to establish secularism on a sure basis, to make it the government religion, force it into State schools, colleges, academies, libraries, hospitals, asylums, prisons, army and navy, wherever it can be pushed; to support it richly, endow it, bribe it, coddle it, and foster it, reduce to powder all opposition to it; and all the time they continue to cry out that Christ is God, and that all men must be saved through him; that this is a Christian country and shall never be anything else, and that popery must be crushed, while atheism will die of itself.
> “Their leading doctrines are: Church property must be taxed like any other property; State money must never go to any charity or institution of learning which is under total or partial control of any Christian denomination; into State institutions no religious rites or instructions must be allowed to take place; Catholic soldiers and sailors and orphans and aged and wounded and helpless, must never hear mass or receive the sacraments if it can be avoided; the children of the nation must be educated without any religion except secularism, and if they are educated in a Christian manner the expenses must be borne by themselves. In other words, the entire force of the government, its institutions and schools and charities, its offices and employments, its moneys and influences, are all to be thrown into the rut of secularism, and all to be used in favor of that one damnable error, which, more than any other, is working to-day for the ruin of Christianity.
> “This program of secularism is the very program which the atheists and Freemasons of Europe have adopted. They are in line with American Protestantism, which, alone in the world, joins hands with atheism for the destruction of itself and its hated enemy, Romanism. These sects are content to die by their own hand if in the ruin they can involve Catholicity. Shame on them who profess to believe in Christ and so dishonor him. Shame, too, on the few Catholics who with the same blindness uphold these misguided people.
> “The time is coming rapidly when the struggle in America will reach a critical point, when once for all men must take sides against the error. The Catholics are preparing. Their program is made out, and they will carry it out to the letter. They will insist on every privilege and right being granted to them which is theirs, in spite of secularism and its main support, and they will get them. What are the Protestants doing on their side?—Nothing. When the decisive moment comes most of them will be completely secularized; the others will be Catholics. “
The *Catholic Review* is correct in one thing, namely, the time is coming when “all men must take sides,” all must decide between “secularism” and the Papacy. True, it may not be in name the Papacy of Rome, but it will be the same in principle, the very image of that anti- christian and iniquitous system. Yes, all “must take sides,” but not as the *Review* says, against “the error of secularism;” there is a better choice, and those who love liberty and hate oppression will “take sides” against the monstrous error that civil governments have of right anything whatever to do with the teaching or enforcing of any religion, either Christian or anti-christian.
