# The Sunday Paper in Melbourne.

The tottering institution of Sunday observance, like every other man-made idea, must look for human support when the light of truth begins to penetrate the hollow recesses of its false foundations. Lately, someone proposed to meet a growing demand for a Sunday newspaper in Melbourne. A cry of dismay went up from the guardians of the Sunday observance, and there was a hurrying to and fro. There is no doubt the innovation would have received a warm reception from both friend and foe. It would have been interesting to the on-looker who believes in religion and order, but does not include Sunday sacredness in his moral code. But a period was put to the proceeding by the government warning the audacious innovator that he would be prosecuted if he proceeded.

But the circumstance caused an investigation of the legal defenses of Sunday-keeping, when it was discovered that the prosecution of such an enterprise would be attended with some perplexities, and some chance of escape to one who sought to earn his living by publishing a newspaper on a day which God never blessed; so there is to be a strengthening of the law and a shorter cut to condign punishment for such an offender. The attorney-general has drawn up a brief act in two clauses and submitted it to Parliament, which distinctly prohibits the publication and sale of newspapers on Sunday, with penalties from £100 for the first offense up to fine and forfeiture of plant for the third.

The demand for a respectable Sunday paper is undoubtedly an increasing one. When we consider other means of amusement and entertainment which are allowed, it does not appear an unreasonable one. The only logical objection there can be to its introduction consists in the two facts of their being sold and read. But will Sunday zealots claim that they have a right to legislate as to what a man shall read on Sunday? If so, they would better legislate the trashy novel out of their church members’ hands. To sell a newspaper is certainly no greater offense to God or man than to sell a cigar or a pipeful of tobacco, and yet these may be freely purchased in Melbourne on Sunday. The labor of producing the paper comes almost entirely upon the preceding day. It is a well-known fact that the papers which are read with such a clear conscience on Monday morning by minister and people, are the products of Sunday labor.

The whole animus of the matter lies in a determination to uphold an institution which lacks scriptural support. It would be just as reasonable to enforce upon an unwilling people the practice of infant sprinkling as the observance of Sunday, both of which had the same origin.

Religious dogmas present a pitiable spectacle when they must be propped up to an upright position by civil laws and penalties. An appeal to the Bible at once reveals the serene form of God’s ancient Sabbath, but the sight of this cannot be endured by Sunday advocates. With the utmost contempt they cover it with their reproach and cry, “Great is Diana.”—*Bible Echo, Melbourne, Australia. *[341]
