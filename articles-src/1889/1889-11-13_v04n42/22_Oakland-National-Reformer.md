There lives in our city of Oakland a National Reformer of the most ultra type. He wants a man-made theocratic government in the United States, and his principal reason seems to be in order that the people who work on Sunday may be summarily dealt with. Because under a real theocracy it was lawful to put men to death for Sabbath breaking, he can't see why it would not be right under a counterfeit theocracy to put men to death for refusing to religiously observe Sunday. He wanted to advocate this theory through the medium of the Sentinel. And now he feels that he has been unfairly treated because we do not give him the use of our columns *ad libitum, *in which to further his wicked scheme. In the *Christian Statesman* of the 24th ult., referring to the Sentinel, he uses this language:—

> "It is not only a fiery foe to Sabbath legislation, but it is so far from being a free journal it is cowardly. Occasionally it has permitted me to be heard in its columns; but time after time, for years, it has refused articles and communications in reply to their false positions and unfair charges against Reformers. Its editors are afraid to give a hearing to the truth."

> "Cowardly," forsooth! "Afraid to give a hearing to the truth!" Any journal which declines to open its columns to the advocacy of a governmental policy which, if fully carried out, would put to death its editors and publishers, must be *cowardly* indeed! This is simply another specimen of characteristic National Reform logic. How many of that kind of "communications in reply to their false positions and unfair charges" would either of the National Reform organs publish to accommodate their opponents? Echo answers, How many?
