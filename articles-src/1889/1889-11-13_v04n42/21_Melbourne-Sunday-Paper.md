The *Bible Echo,* Melbourne, Australia, of October 1, has the following:—

> "A large and influential meeting of the citizens of Melbourne was convened at the Federal Coffee Palace to protest against the action of the government in so summarily refusing to sanction the publication of a Sunday paper. The meeting was addressed by Mr. W. H. L. Bailey, the prime mover in the enterprise, who stated that the government had granted him a copyright and received his money for the same. At the conclusion of the meeting, resolutions were adopted protesting against the action of the Lord's Day Observance Society in representing that they expressed the voice of the people, and viewing with alarm the encroachment of the government upon the rights and privileges of private citizenship.

> "It certainly does not commend the inherent strength or stability of a religious institution that it must be sustained by such strict legal enforcements against the evident wishes of the community at large, nor will such an institution thus upheld ever exert a salutary influence over the morals of those who are so restrained."
