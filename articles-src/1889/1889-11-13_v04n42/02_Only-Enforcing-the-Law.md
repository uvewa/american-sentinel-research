# Only Enforcing the Law.

The *Catholic Review* publishes a sad story of how Roman Catholics are whipped and maltreated in Russia to compel them to apply for membership in the “Orthodox” or established church of the empire. This the *Review* calls “persecution.” But how is it persecution? We are told that the Church of Rome never persecuted, that she only adjudged certain persons to be “heretics,” and then simply allowed the law to take its course. Those who were tortured and put to death brought all their troubles upon themselves by refusing to obey the law. Then how comes it that the same thing is persecution in Russia? Is that which was only enforcing the law in Spain persecution in Russia simply because in the latter country Romanists are the sufferers, while in the former only Protestants felt the rack and the stake?

But we do not justify such enforcement of the law, nor even such laws themselves. And we need not go to Russia, nor yet to Spain, for examples to show the wickedness of laws which make persecution for conscience’ sake possible. In more than one State in our own country, honest, God-fearing men have been, and are still liable to be, cast into foul prisons, reduced to poverty by fines and costs, dragged from the bedside of dying wives and children, for no other offense than that of daring to keep as the Sabbath a day other than the one observed by their neighbors, and then exercising their Godgiven privilege to work; for the support of their families on the other six days of the week. The spirit of persecution is latent in many countries, but it is not dead, and it needs only the touch of religious legislation to revive it in all its old-time fury and devilishness. Bigots are as ready to “enforce the law” as they ever were, and climate makes no difference in human disposition in this respect. Sectarian malice and hate are as bitter in our own sunny South as in the frozen regions ruled over by the czar of all the Russias. Would that Rome might learn from the persecution of her own people in Russia, a lesson of tolerance for others, and that degenerate Protestants might read aright the history of what their forefathers have suffered in the past. But it is too much to hope.
