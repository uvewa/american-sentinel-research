The *Herald,* of Saint John's, Arizona, is another patriotic paper that isn't quite ready for national compulsory religion. We are in receipt of a copy quoting our editorial on the teachings of the American Sabbath Union secretary and his visit to Arizona in the interest of Church and State. Arizona's press has already more real Christian qualities than many self-styled religious sheets.—*Moral and Scientific Companion.*
