The New York *Tribune* says, and says truly: "It is a singular fact that California has no Sunday law. There was such a law, but it was repealed in 1883; yet it cannot be said that there is any less observance of Sunday since the repeal of the law. On the contrary, an investigation shows that Sunday is observed more as a sacred day the present year than it was the year the law was repealed."
