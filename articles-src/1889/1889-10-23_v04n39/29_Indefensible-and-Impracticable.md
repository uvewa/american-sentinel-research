Last April the field secretary of the American Sabbath Union wrote to the Chicago *Advance* these words:—

> "The only defensible and practicable Sabbath reform is that which uncompromisingly agitates for an impartial suppression of all Sunday work for gain, save works of real necessity and mercy."

Yet the American Sabbath Union is asking for a law which shall exempt, so far as ordinary work is concerned, those who observe a day other than Sunday. Is it not then, according to its field secretary, asking for a law which is both indefensible and impracticable?
