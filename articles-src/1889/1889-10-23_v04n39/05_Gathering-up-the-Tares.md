# Gathering up the Tares.

The great burden of National Reformers seems to be to rid the earth of everyone who will not accept their theory of government. A few weeks ago Dr. A. T. Wolff, who, according to the *Christian Statesman,* “is a thorough National Reform man,” delivered a lecture on “People We Can Do Without.” In his list, he mentioned “grumblers,” “fault-finders,” and “discontented people,” and also those who have no “religion in politics.” That is to say, that God’s great wheat-field, the world, could very well do without the tares which the enemy has sown. We are glad to say that we heartily agree with Dr. Wolff on this point, although a dispute might arise as to who constitutes the tares, should we attempt to settle it.

Having agreed with the Doctor that tares are “a nuisance, and we could well do without them,” we would now like to inquire what the National Reformers propose to do with them. Rev. E. B. Graham wants to send them to some wild, desolate land, and let them stay there till they die.” And Dr. Edwards declares that “atheism and Christianity cannot dwell together on the same continent.”

Under the National Reform system of government, all persons who are regarded by them as tares will have to do one of two things,—they will have to pretend to be good wheat or else they will have to allow themselves to be gathered up and transferred to some other continent, and if that continent should chance also to have a “Reform” government, there is no telling when or where they would stop.

This question of what shall be done with the “tares” is a very important one, so important that it is asked and answered by Christ himself. He says: “The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up? But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them.” Notwithstanding this plain command of Christ’s, many of his professed servants have undertaken to gather up the tares and root them out, but the result has always been that they rooted out more wheat than they did tares. Millions of stalks of the choicest wheat were destroyed during the Dark Ages in the vain endeavor to pluck up the tares. “Let both grow together,” says Christ, “until the harvest; and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them; but gather the wheat into my barn.” Again Christ says, “The harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels.” Whosoever, therefore, undertakes to root up the tares is undertaking a work which belongs only to the angels, and which not even they have a right to attempt until commanded by Christ at the end of the world. A. Delos Westcott.
