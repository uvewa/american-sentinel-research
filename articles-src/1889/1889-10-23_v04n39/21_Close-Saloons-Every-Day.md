The *California Prohibitionist,* August 1, very wisely says:—

> "If Cincinnati wants to settle the contest with the saloon in the easiest manner, let her close the saloons every day in the week as well as Sunday. There is no sense in allowing the traffic six days in which to get up muscle with which to fight the law on the seventh."
