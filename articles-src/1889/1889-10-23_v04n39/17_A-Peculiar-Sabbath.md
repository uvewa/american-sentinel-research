# A Peculiar Sabbath.

W. F. Crafts, field secretary of the American Sabbath Union, who is traveling about the country establishing auxiliary State unions, has again visited Omaha to see what progress the society he established here two months ago is making. At the only meeting held by that organization, Bishop Worthington was elected temporary chairman and T. H. Taylor secretary. Since then the society has slept the sleep of the just.

The national union has been in operation two years, and Mr. Crafts prides himself in having started auxiliary societies in nearly every State in the country. Some of the alleged evils he is fighting are the running of Sunday trains, and the issuing of wicked Sunday-morning papers.

Mr. Crafts endeavored to infuse a little life into the local organization at the Y. M. C. A. rooms at 3 p. m., and this evening he will deliver a lecture at the same place on the proper observance of the Christian Sabbath. No admission fee will be charged, but a collection will be taken up.—*Omaha Bee, Sept. 25, 1889.*
