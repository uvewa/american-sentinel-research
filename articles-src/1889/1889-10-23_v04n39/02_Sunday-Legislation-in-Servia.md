It is stated that in Servia a law has been passed requiring all shops and places of business to be closed, not only on Sunday, but on all the holy days of the church as well. All told, the number is 180. The law is rigidly enforced. A shop keeper who supplied a customer with a little rice on one of the interdicted days, was recently fined 100 francs for his crime. But this is only Sunday legislation carried to its legitimate conclusion. If the State has a right to say that business shall be suspended on Sunday, it has the same right to say that it shall be suspended on other so-called holy days.—*Signs of the Times.*
