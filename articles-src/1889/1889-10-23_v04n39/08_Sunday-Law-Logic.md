# Sunday-Law Logic.

Of all that passes for logic the Sunday-law arguments excel in contradictory assertions; notice some of the inconsistencies:—

1. They claim, as stated above, that protection is their object, and yet offer a bill enforcing the day upon all, containing no provision for its real protection.

2. They explicitly claim that they are trying to secure merely a civil Sabbath, but their own bill squarely contradicts them by saying, “the religious observance of the day.”

3. That bill is upheld on a health basis, but the “religious observance” clause proves them guilty of deception.

4. Then the bill is to close the saloons, but the same “religious” specification, together with the entire absence of any mention of liquors or saloons, condemns that claim; the bill pays no attention to liquor; its hold is upon every individual in the land; it is easier to close every saloon in America forever than to pass this religious bill, but they would rather have the bill and bid the liquor traffic Godspeed.

5. After disclaiming any intention of enforcing Sunday as a religious day, they appeal to the church to support the fourth commandment; here is another inconsistency—that commandment sanctifies the seventh day; everybody knows that Sunday is the first, and sanctified nowhere in the Bible.

6. They wish to put this government’s laws on a Christian basis, when Christ commanded that civil and divine homage be paid to separate powers.—*Moral and Scientific Companion.*

In proportion as the ecclesiastics became colegislators, heresies became civil crimes, and liable to civil punishments.—*Dean Milman.*
