The Omaha, Neb., *Bee,* of September 25, has this item:—

> "Rev. Wilbur Crafts, of New York, the traveling secretary of the New York branch of the Y. M. C. A., is in the city, and it was announced that he would deliver lectures yesterday afternoon and evening on the subject of 'Sabbath Observance.' In both the afternoon and evening the attendance was so light that it was deemed best to postpone the lecture indefinitely, which was done."
