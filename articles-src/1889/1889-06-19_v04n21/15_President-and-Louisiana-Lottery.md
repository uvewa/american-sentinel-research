The *Advance* urges that because the President and Postmaster-General are church-members they should see to it that the Louisiana State Lottery be not allowed to use the United States mails in their swindling business. No lottery should be permitted to use the mails; but an appeal to the officers of the Government to enforce the laws should not be based upon the fact that they are church-members. If it be true that President Harrison ought to officially do certain acts because of his religious belief, it follows that another President, holding different religious views, should act differently. Every President should execute the laws faithfully, whatever his individual opinions and religious preferences may be.
