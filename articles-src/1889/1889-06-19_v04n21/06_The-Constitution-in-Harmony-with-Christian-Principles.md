# The Constitution in Harmony with Christian Principles.

The various associations which are making a specialty of badgering Congress for a religious amendment to the National Constitution, do so on the assumption that the United States is a Christian Nation and should have a Christian Constitution. If these parties were actuated in their work by “the principles of the Christian religion,” which they so loudly profess to have at heart, and only desired that Christianity have free course in the land, they would realize that the Constitution is already adapted to that end. It could not be bettered in that respect were such a result the main object of its existence.

The principles of Christianity are thus laid down by Christ himself: “Whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you, do ye even so unto them.” He did not apply this merely to secular affairs; he was a religious teacher, and was imparting a religious lesson when he uttered those words. If this language means anything, it means that if ye would that men should allow you freedom in the exercise of your religious views, you must allow them the same. And this is just what the Constitution of the United States, as it stands, is intended to do,—allow everyone perfect liberty of conscience in the matter of religion.

All that Christianity asks of any Government is equality before the law. This much, Christianity is always willing that others should have. Whatever element in society would ask more, or seek to grant less, is *un*christian. Any Government that will give one class of citizens the privilege of exacting more of another class than they are willing to give in return, could not fairly claim to be Christian; it would be a despotism, and Christianity is in no sense despotic. Christ never [166] compelled anyone to follow him; he said, “Whosoever *will,* let him come.”

The first amendment to the Constitution provides that “Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.” Whosoever will may be a Christian, and Congress must not interfere; and whosoever will not has an equal right not to be; and the great Head of Christianity has given no further authority to any power. He certainly would not grant to any agency authority beyond what he himself would exercise. The unchristian advocates of a religious amendment say, in effect: “Whatsoever we would that men should do, we will urge the enactment of laws compelling them to do.”

Under the protection to civil and religious liberty secured by the Constitution as it is, this country has grown and flourished, besides giving to Christianity such freedom as it never before enjoyed. Under the influence of our free institutions, both at home and abroad, Christianity has for a hundred years received encouragement unparalleled in history. Why, then, it will be asked, is not Christianity satisfied with the Constitution as it is? The reply is, *Christianity is satisfied.* It is the hydrahead of religious bigotry seeking power, everywhere springing up in worldly, ambitious churches, and in the hearts of unchristian professors of Christianity, that demands a change of the Constitution.

Therefore, in the name of Christianity, and for the sake of the free exercise of Christian liberty, let the Constitution remain as it is. A constitution guaranteeing equal and exact justice to all men harmonizes with Christian principles; while one inspired by religious intolerance cannot guarantee justice to all alike, and can be “only evil continually.W.
