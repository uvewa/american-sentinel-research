The following indictment by the Grand Jury of Forsyth County, Georgia, is probably all that need to be said on the subject just now. It would seem that the mere reading of the indictment to any intelligent jury ought to secure the prompt acquittal of the accused. The trial, we understand, is to come off in August. We shall watch the case and let our readers know the result.

State of Georgia,

Forsyth County.

The Grand Jury, in the name and behalf of the citizens of Georgia, charge and accuse Day Conklin, of the county and State aforesaid, with the offense of misdemeanor for that the said Day Conklin, on the second day of December, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and eighty-eight, in the county aforesaid, with force and arms did unlawfully, then and there, pursue the work of his ordinary calling upon the said second day of December, eighteen hundred and eighty-eight, which was then and there the Lord's day, by cutting timber and clearing lands and by digging and other work then and there, did said work and said cutting timber and said clearing and said digging, not then and there being work of charity, and not then and there being work of necessity, the said Day Conklin then and there being a tradesman, the said Day Conklin then and there being an artificer, the said Day Conklin then and there being a workman, the said Day Conklin then and there being a laborer, the said Day Conklin then and there being a farmer,

Contrary to the laws of said State, the good order, peace, and dignity thereof.
