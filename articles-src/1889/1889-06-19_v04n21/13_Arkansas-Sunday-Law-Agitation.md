The advocates of a stringent Sunday law (without exemption) in Arkansas, on their recent defeat in the Legislature, declared their intention to persistently agitate the subject for the next two years, and prepare for an overwhelming victory at the next session. This is the sentiment and policy of religious coercionists throughout the country; now the question arises, What will the great majority of the people—who are undoubtedly opposed to Sunday laws—do while the enemies of religious liberty are at work? Wisdom would say, Manifest an equal degree of diligence to maintain the integrity of our free institutions. But there is such confidence in the apparent impregnability of our Government, that the masses will probably rest secure until it is too late. However, the Sentinel proposes not to be found sleeping on guard, and its weekly warnings will be faithfully sounded forth. [167-168]
