# How Others Look at It.

We present the following to the readers of the American Sentinel, not because it contains any points which have not already been given in these columns, but that they may see how others view these matters. We are glad of these evidences that the true principles of civil and religious liberty are finding advocates all through the land. The article is from the Camden (N. J.) *Post* of April 11:—

All asseverations to the contrary notwithstanding, it strikes me that Senator Blair’s Educational Amendment is a wolf in sheep’s clothing. It presents an issue which must be met, and before the damage is done is the time to meet it. Let us read the second section of the bill, and mark carefully every word:—

> “Sec. 2. Each State in this Union shall establish and maintain a system of free public schools adequate for the education of all children living therein, between the ages of six and sixteen years, inclusive, in the common branches of knowledge, and in virtue, morality, and the principles of the Christian religion.” That is to say, no State shall ever make or maintain a law respecting an establishment of religion, but every State in this Union shall make and maintain laws establishing the principles of the Christian religion; and to make assurance doubly sure, Section 3 declares that the United States shall guarantee to every State, and to the people of every State, and of the United States, the support and maintenance of such a system of free public schools as is herein provided. And that is to say, the United States Government pledges itself that every State shall establish and maintain the principles of the Christian religion. This proposed amendment, therefore, at one stroke, establishes Christianity as the national religion, because it declares that every State shall maintain the principles of the Christian religion in the public schools, and the Nation is pledged to see that this is done.

Therefore there must be a national decision of some kind declaring just what are the principles of the Christian religion.

Then when that decision shall have been made, every State will have to receive from the Nation just those principles of religion which the Nation shall have declared to be the principles of the Christian religion, and which the Nation will have pledged itself shall be taught in the schools of every State. In other words, the people of the United States will then have to receive their religion from the Government of the United States, and no longer from the Bible, as their own conscience, enlightened by the Spirit of God, may dictate. Therefore, if Senator Blair’s proposed amendment to the National Constitution does not provide for the establishment and maintenance of a national religion, then no religion was ever established or maintained.

But how shall the national decision be made as to what are the principles of the Christian religion? It will follow inevitably that there shall be officially called a national council of the churches to decide what are the principles common to all, and to establish a national creed, which shall be enforced and inculcated by national power in all the public schools in the United States. And that will be the establishment of a national religion. And that is exactly what Senator Blair’s constitutional amendment assures, so surely as it or anything similar to it shall ever be adopted. Another important consideration is this: Under this amendment the teachers in the public schools will have to inculcate the principles of the Christian religion. Who are to compose the examining board that shall pass upon the qualification and orthodoxy of the teachers? Assuredly none but the leading theologians in the churches. This will require that such a board shall be statedly convened to deal out what shall have been decided by each successive council to be the principles of the Christian religion.

It was in this way precisely that the thing was worked in the fourth century and onward. Constantine made Christianity the recognized religion of the Roman Empire. Then it became at once necessary that there should be the imperial decision as to what form of Christianity should be the imperial religion.

To effect this an imperial council was necessary to formulate that phase of Christianity which was common to all. The Council of Nice was convened by imperial command, and an imperial creed was established, which was enforced by imperial power. That establishment of an imperial religion ended only in the imperious despotism of the Papacy. As surely as the complete establishment of the Papacy followed and grew out of that imperial recognition of Christianity in the fourth century, just so surely will the complete establishment of a religious despotism after the living likeness of the Papacy, follow and grow out of this national recognition of Christianity provided for in the constitutional amendment proposed by Senator Blair.
