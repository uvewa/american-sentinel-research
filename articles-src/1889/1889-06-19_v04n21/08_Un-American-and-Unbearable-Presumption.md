At the hearing before the United States Senate Committee on the National Sunday law, the basis of Sunday observance and Sunday laws was revealed by Dr. Herrick Johnson, as follows:—

*Mr. Johnson*—"This appointment of one day in seven is arbitrary. There is nothing in nature to indicate that division of time. There is the day of twenty-four hours, there is the month, there is the year, all these are natural divisions; but there is nothing in nature to indicate the weekly division, the observance of one day in seven. It is arbitrary, and we regard that as an evidence of its divine origin."

*The Chairman*—"How do you base the Sabbath itself upon a divine ordinance when there is no natural law to indicate which is to be observed?"

*Mr. Johnson*—"It is in revelation, and it is bound to be exactly in accord with the laws of nature."

*The Chairman*—"You base the law of one day's rest in seven upon revelation; that is to say, upon the Bible?"

*Mr. Johnson*—"Yes, sir."

*The Chairman*—"There are many who doubt that it is established by revelation, are there not?"

*Mr. Johnson*—"I think no one who accepts the Bible doubts that there is one day in seven to be observed as a day of rest."

*The Chairman*—"Will you just state the authority?"

*Mr. Johnson*—"Remember the Sabbath-day to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labor and do all thy work."

*The Chairman*—"Is there any other?"

*Mr. Johnson*—"There are references to this law all through the Bible."

*The Chairman*—"Now you come and change that Sabbath-day to which the Lord there refers."

*Mr. Johnson*—"That we hold was changed by himself."

*The Chairman*—"When did he do that? and by what language?"

*Mr. Johnson*—"There was a meeting for worship on the first day of the week, the day the Lord arose, and seven days after there was another meeting for the same purpose, and then it is referred to as the Lord's day."

*The Chairman*—"After the change?"

*Mr. Johnson*—"Yes, sir; after the change."

*The Chairman*—"It is based, then, upon two or three days being observed as days of religious worship after the resurrection?"

*Mr. Johnson*—"Yes, sir."

Could anything be more presumptuous than is this scheme of the preachers, in demanding that the national Legislature shall frame into law and enforce upon all the people, such baseless assumption as the Sunday theory is shown by their own words to be?
