# Who Is Doing the Clamoring?

For several months past Rev. Wilbur F. Crafts has not ceased to tell us how the labor organizations all over the land were clamoring for Sunday legislation. He would have us believe that the workingmen had started such a sweeping crusade for Sunday that the ministers were almost forced to join them. But in his enthusiastic endeavor to exalt the American Sabbath Union, he overreached himself at the Boston Monday lecture, March 25, 1889. After stating that this union “originated in a petition to the Methodist General Conference, which met in May, asking it to take the *initiative* in forming a national society for the defense [not of the workingmen but] of the Sabbath, to be constituted by official representatives of [not the labor organizations but] the evangelical churches,” he proceeded to name the *religious* organizations which had concurred in the arrangement, and then said:—

> “This successful union, to prevent the heathenizing of America, *of those churches* that have not yet succeeded in uniting to Christianize Japan; this co-operation of such intense Republicans as our President, Col. Elliott F. Shepard, with such Southern leaders as Senator Colquitt, who has accepted honorary membership; *and the co-operation this union has established *outside of its membership on the basis of a broad humanity *with the leading labor organizations and the head of the Catholic Church*—this is surely as wonderful a ‘union’ as the *churches* can show.” [All italics mine.]

This shows that the American Sabbath Union was called for by the churches; that it was made up of “official representatives” of the evangelical churches; that it was the churches that took the “initiative” in forming a “national society for the defense of the Sabbath;” and that this Sabbath Union importuned the official representatives of the labor organizations to co-operate with them. We know, too, that this was accomplished by long and earnest argument on the part of the union. And then they will tell us how the laboring classes are “begging” for Sunday laws!A. Delos Westcott.

The advocates of a stringent Sunday law (without exemption) in Arkansas, on their recent defeat in the Legislature, declared their intention to persistently agitate the subject for the next two years, and prepare for an overwhelming victory at the next session. This is the sentiment and policy of religious coercionists throughout the country; now the question arises, What will the great majority of the people—who are undoubtedly opposed to Sunday laws—do while the enemies of religious liberty are at work? Wisdom would say, Manifest an equal degree of diligence to maintain the integrity of our free institutions. But there is such confidence in the apparent impregnability of our Government, that the masses will probably rest secure until it is too late. However, the Sentinel proposes not to be found sleeping on guard, and its weekly warnings will be faithfully sounded forth. [167-168]

Note.—No papers are sent by the publishers of the American Sentinel to people who have not subscribed for it. If the Sentinel comes to one who has not subscribed for it, he may know that it is sent him by some friend, and that he will not be called upon by the publishers to pay for the same.

The *Advance* urges that because the President and Postmaster-General are church-members they should see to it that the Louisiana State Lottery be not allowed to use the United States mails in their swindling business. No lottery should be permitted to use the mails; but an appeal to the officers of the Government to enforce the laws should not be based upon the fact that they are church-members. If it be true that President Harrison ought to officially do certain acts because of his religious belief, it follows that another President, holding different religious views, should act differently. Every President should execute the laws faithfully, whatever his individual opinions and religious preferences may be.

We learn from the *Pearl of Days* that the Particular Synod (Dutch Reformed), of New Brunswick, held in Philadelphia May 8, adopted unanimously a resolution condemning Sunday papers for interfering with worship and preventing attendance at the house of God. The resolution earnestly requested all their members to refuse to buy or read any such papers. This is certainly a proper way of getting at the matter. It is perfectly right for those who are conscientiously opposed to reading secular papers on Sunday to refuse to do so, but that is a very different thing from demanding laws to prohibit the publication of such papers, or to prevent those from reading them that wish to. So long as the various churches confine themselves to adopting resolutions requesting their members not to patronize Sunday papers, they will be tending strictly to their own business, and we have no fault to find with them.

We have received from a friend in Cleveland, Ohio, a copy of a paper entitled *Herald of Reform,* Rev. Jas. P. Mills, A. M., editor and manager. This gentleman is also district secretary of the National Reform Association, and State secretary of the American Sabbath Union, and of course an ardent National Reformer.

The number which we have received is “Vol. 3, No. 5,” dated May 15, 1889, which fact demands some explanation, since the paper is only a monthly, and the first number was issued in January, 1888, and the second in April of the same year. The explanation, as given by the publisher himself, is that the volumes have been stuffed to make it appear that the paper is old and well established. It is desirable to give this impression, says the honest publisher, that they may get a better advertising patronage, and also make it appear that the paper “has come to stay.” From the standpoint of ordinary mortals, this would scarcely seem to be honest, but it is probably all right with National Reformers. Of course the paper is an ardent advocate of the legal enforcement of the law of God as understood by National Reformers, but we would suggest that while professedly advocating some portions of the decalogue so earnestly, the editor should not neglect the ninth commandment, which is understood to forbid falsehood. We shall keep an eye on the *Herald of Reform* to see if it profits by our advice.

The *Argus,* Leadville, Colorado, has an article on “Sunday, Its Use and Abuse,” in which, referring to the Sunday-Rest bill, it says:—

> “Clearly stated, the purpose of that bill is to *compel *a day, not of rest but of *worship.* It may be admitted that both are linked together in the bill, but *the* feature is the latter compulsion. In other words, it is a covert attempt to enforce a day of worship rather than to secure for the toilers a day of rest and recuperation. The enforcement of such legislation would be a flagrant abuse.”

And of the proposed amendment providing that the principles of the Christian religion shall be taught in the public schools, the *Argus* says:—

> “Religion does not require this sort of a constitutional amendment; the people do not want it. More than that, they will not have it.”

That the *Argus* gives utterance to these sentiments not from opposition to religion but from love of simple justice is apparent from the following item clipped from another page of the same paper:—

> “The arrest of the Salvation Army in Leadville was an unmitigated outrage, and ought to bring the blush of shame to a city government which allows, without a word of protest, the almost daily parades of a band hired for the purpose by the proprietor of the most notoriously infamous dive in the city. The officers are not, of course, to be censured for obeying the instructions of the council, but that body should have shown a little more respect for the fundamental laws of the land. If the parade was criminal in its purpose, or resulted in a breach of the public order, there would then have been justification for the arrest; but it cannot be alleged that any crimes were committed as a consequence of the parades, or that they were productive of riot or disorder. The action of the council was in derogation of all the tenets of common law and decency, and was very properly characterized by the bar of the city as an outrageous discrimination against an inoffensive class of citizens.”

We are free to confess that Salvation Army methods are not according to our ideas of the fitness of things, but this is not a question of propriety, but of civil and religious rights, and we maintain that as a matter of simple justice they have the right to worship God just as they please, and to parade with music, just as any other organization is permitted to parade. No attempt to regulate religious worship by law should be tolerated for a moment in this country.
