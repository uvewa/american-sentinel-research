Editor American Sentinel—*Dear Sir:* As a friend of religious liberty, I certainly sympathize with you in your noble effort to maintain the liberty vouchsafed to us by the Revolutionary fathers, and which is so unmistakably taught by Christ and his apostles. Having for the last eighteen years been a minister of a church which adheres strictly to the observance of the first day of the week (Sunday), what I have to say can be looked upon in no other light than in the cause of justice and a willingness to grant to others the same rights and privileges I demand for myself.

I have before me the "National Sunday bill" as introduced into the United States Senate by Senator Blair, and the amendments proposed by the American Sabbath Union, and I can look upon the measure in no other light than as a stepping-stone to a union of Church and State, and a repetition of all the intolerance and bigotry that characterized the Dark Ages. I am opposed to the Blair bill, first, because it antagonizes the teachings of the Bible; second, because it undermines the principles of a free Government; and third, because it is an invitation to a serious and bloody religious war. I want to go on record as being, first, last, and forever, opposed to all such arbitrary laws, cunningly devised by designing men as a means to assist them to ride into power.

I have a right to express my opinion in common with every other citizen, and I am willing to grant to others the same privilege; but it seems that there are some persons in this country who are not satisfied unless they are trying to pull down someone else. I want each individual to be free in politics and religion.. Let every man be his own pope, vote as he pleases, and think for himself.

There can be no objection to the principles of morality (in the common acceptation of the word) being taught in our public schools, but there is no use in talking about teaching the "principles of the Christian religion" in the schools, for before it could be done, some ecclesiastical conclave would have to decide as to what constitutes the "principles of the Christian religion." And after all it would not be the principles of the Christian religion, for, as taught by Christ and his apostles, those principles are one thing, and, as taught in the creeds and dogmas of men, they are quite another. Religion should be left to individuals, each man to worship as he pleases and when he pleases.

Constantine's decree fixed a sabbath, and united Church and State; and the logical result was the Papacy—that wicked power which in the name of religion put to death 70,000,000 souls, and destroyed political and religious liberty for over 1,200 years. It is to be hoped that the United States will not make the same fatal mistake. Religion and politics cannot be mingled together without corrupting both. Unite Church and State, then the blood of our fathers will have been spilt in vain, and political as well as religious liberty in this country will be at an end. Pass the Blair bill, and the time will not be far distant when the horrors of Roman and Protestant cruelty will be repeated in this country. God forbid that such should ever be the case! Religious intolerance is bad enough without being backed up by the strong arm of the Government to enable it to carry out in fact what it would do if it had the power. A church that has not got merit enough to stand without the aid of human law, is not worth being continued, and deserves to come to naught.

Apostate churches have always tried to enlarge their borders by the aid of human law; but not so with Christ and his followers—and when teaching and moral suasion fail, the proper work of the man of God is at an end.

Every Union soldier who signed the Sundaylaw petition has done just that much to build up the very thing that he fought to pull down. As our Government now stands, it gives to every man the right to "worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience." And no one but an ecclesiastical bigot, or would-be tyrant, would want it otherwise.

What would the world have thought of Christ and his apostles should they have gone to Cesar and asked him to force, by decree, the Jews and pagans to keep the first day of the week, and teach the "principles of the Christian religion" in their synagogues and temples? This is just what these "orthodox" churches are asking our Government to do. I am neither Jew nor Seventh-day Baptist, but when it comes to opposing them by human law, I am opposed to it.

A union of Church and State is not only subversive of the liberties of the citizens of the State but it weakens the church also. Mr. Goldsmith, in his "History of Rome," page 306, says that "Constantine, being sole monarch of the empire, resolved to establish Christianity on so sure a basis that no new revolutions should shake it. He commanded that in all the provinces of the empire, the orders of the bishops should be obeyed." On page 308 he says: "After this, it never resumed its former splendor; but, like a flower transplanted into a foreign clime, languished by degrees, and at last sunk into nothing."

There is a move in this country, by the so- called "orthodox" churches, which if successful will bring about the same result. It does not require a prophet's eye to see what is coming. They will not ask just what they want at first, [165] but will commence with one thing and then ask for another, till they secure a perfect union of Church and State. I look upon such a law as proposed by Mr. Blair, as an invasion of the sacred rights of the sanctuary. Hands off, this is holy ground. It would be just as consistent to dictate as to what men and women shall eat and drink, or wear, as it would to say when and how they must worship.B. A. Smith.
