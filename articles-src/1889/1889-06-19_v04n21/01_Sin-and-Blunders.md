It is generally supposed by Christian people that sin is the worst thing in the universe. It seems, however, that Rev. Charles F. Thwing, D. D., of Minneapolis, Minn., has discovered something worse. He says, "The man who refuses to take rest on Sunday is not simply committing a sin, but what is possibly worse, is committing a blunder." This shows conclusively, we suppose, that there should be a civil law which will prevent men from committing blunders. The law of God may be sufficient to restrain from sin, but it seems that it is entirely impotent in the matter of blunders, and it follows that it should be supplemented by civil enactment.
