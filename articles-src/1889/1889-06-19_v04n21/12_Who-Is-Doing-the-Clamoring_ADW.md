For several months past Rev. Wilbur F. Crafts has not ceased to tell us how the labor organizations all over the land were clamoring for Sunday legislation. He would have us believe that the workingmen had started such a sweeping crusade for Sunday that the ministers were almost forced to join them. But in his enthusiastic endeavor to exalt the American Sabbath Union, he overreached himself at the Boston Monday lecture, March 25, 1889. After stating that this union "originated in a petition to the Methodist General Conference, which met in May, asking it to take the *initiative* in forming a national society for the defense [not of the workingmen but] of the Sabbath, to be constituted by official representatives of [not the labor organizations but] the evangelical churches," he proceeded to name the *religious* organizations which had concurred in the arrangement, and then said:—

> "This successful union, to prevent the heathenizing of America, *of those churches* that have not yet succeeded in uniting to Christianize Japan; this co-operation of such intense Republicans as our President, Col. Elliott F. Shepard, with such Southern leaders as Senator Colquitt, who has accepted honorary membership; *and the co-operation this union has established *outside of its membership on the basis of a broad humanity *with the leading labor organizations and the head of the Catholic Church*—this is surely as wonderful a 'union' as the *churches* can show." [All italics mine.]

This shows that the American Sabbath Union was called for by the churches; that it was made up of "official representatives" of the evangelical churches; that it was the churches that took the "initiative" in forming a "national society for the defense of the Sabbath;" and that this Sabbath Union importuned the official representatives of the labor organizations to co-operate with them. We know, too, that this was accomplished by long and earnest argument on the part of the union. And then they will tell us how the laboring classes are "begging" for Sunday laws!A. Delos Westcott.
