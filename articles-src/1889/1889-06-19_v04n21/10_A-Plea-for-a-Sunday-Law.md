The following letter from a zealous National Reformer in Kansas will be fully appreciated by our readers:—

Editor American Sentinel: As one of my neighbors is taking your paper, and I have been reading it, I would like to say a word on this Sabbath question. It appears to me that you are going to extremes in regard to the Sabbath. You don't think the laws of the United States should have anything to do with the Sabbath. Here I think you make a grand mistake. ... I know, and you know, that if we had no Sabbath law, thousands of people would work all day Sunday, or stay in the saloons or gambling dens, or stay at home and read some trashy newspaper or dime novel, or be at some other mischief, while if we had a law to protect our Sabbath so that people would not dare to do these crimes, they would go to church; probably not for any good at the time, but by going and hearing the gospel they might become interested and be convicted and converted. We know the unconverted are blind in sins and are not likely to become Christians if they cannot be placed under the influence of the gospel, therefore ought we not to use every possible effort to bring them under the influence of the gospel? . . . Oh, that men would lay the world and worldly things aside, and put on the armor of almighty God, that when we (tome to leave this world we can say with the apostle Paul, "We have fought a good fight, we have kept the faith, and are going home to wear a crown of glory!"

This is genuine National Reform argument. If there is no Sunday law people will not go to church, and if they don't go to church they won't be converted; therefore they ought to be compelled to choose between going to church on Sunday and sitting all day with folded hands doing nothing! But suppose they should still refuse to go to church? Oh, in that case a law would be in order compelling them to go! And that is just what this National Reform logic leads to every time if it is followed to its conclusion; for if the State has a right to interfere in one particular in matters of religion it has the right to interfere in all such particulars; if it may decide one question of religious duty it follows that it must be perfectly competent for it to decide all such questions, and then the State would be Pope.

We have the most implicit faith in the gospel, and believe most heartily that it is the power of God unto salvation to all that receive it, but we do not believe that any man or any set of men have any authority to force the gospel upon anybody, or even to so hedge them about with law that they will choose it as the least of two evils. The National Reform plan of getting people converted by legislative enactment is entirely foreign to the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ as we understand it, and as it is clearly revealed in the Scriptures. If any authority to coerce people has ever been given it must have been in a later revelation than the New Testament, one about which we know nothing, and one which must have come by way of the Pope of Rome or through the Inquisition.
