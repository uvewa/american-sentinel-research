> "Dark Ages" is the expression used by Protestants to designate that period in which Catholicism ruled the Old World. Now that Protestants are straining every nerve to bring the civil institutions of this country under the control of the church, does it not look as though they rather envied the Papal prestige of those by-gone days? When they seek to re-inaugurate a system of government similar to that which they have been wont to style dark, is it not because they prefer a condition of darkness? The effort to erect in the United States an image to the power that held sway in Europe during the Dark Ages, is made by so-called Protestants. Then is Protestantism really a failure, as charged by Catholics? or is this backward move merely a proof that men love darkness rather than light, because their deeds are evil?
