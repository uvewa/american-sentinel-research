We have received from a friend in Cleveland, Ohio, a copy of a paper entitled *Herald of Reform,* Rev. Jas. P. Mills, A. M., editor and manager. This gentleman is also district secretary of the National Reform Association, and State secretary of the American Sabbath Union, and of course an ardent National Reformer.

The number which we have received is "Vol. 3, No. 5," dated May 15, 1889, which fact demands some explanation, since the paper is only a monthly, and the first number was issued in January, 1888, and the second in April of the same year. The explanation, as given by the publisher himself, is that the volumes have been stuffed to make it appear that the paper is old and well established. It is desirable to give this impression, says the honest publisher, that they may get a better advertising patronage, and also make it appear that the paper "has come to stay." From the standpoint of ordinary mortals, this would scarcely seem to be honest, but it is probably all right with National Reformers. Of course the paper is an ardent advocate of the legal enforcement of the law of God as understood by National Reformers, but we would suggest that while professedly advocating some portions of the decalogue so earnestly, the editor should not neglect the ninth commandment, which is understood to forbid falsehood. We shall keep an eye on the *Herald of Reform* to see if it profits by our advice.
