# Piety by Proxy.

There is a craze for doing all duties and curing all evils by proxy. Rich Christians try to do their charity by checks and other substitutes, and poor Christians leave all the praying and teaching and working to the pastor and his appointed assistants. The theory that every man has personal duties that no one can do for him is quite exploded, and the Romish idea that the church and the priest can settle all religious matters, private and public, is popular.

As a natural result of such opinions we find that many persons rely upon law to take their place in all public responsibility. A few men are elected or appointed to official positions, and thousands at once surrender all their interests and relinquish all their civic duties to these representatives. The claims of morality upon every individual, to use influence and force of character and self-denying effort in favor of right and justice and honesty and temperance, are ignored because there are laws to establish and enforce these claims. There are laws against all offenses, and police and magistrates to execute them, and therefore the average citizen is satisfied. If the law is broken or not enforced, it is no concern of the citizen, but only of the official. It is the duty of the individual to prevent intemperance in his family and among his servants; but instead of doing his personal duty to those dependent upon him he prefers to place this duty upon the lawmakers, and charges them to prevent drunkenness by prohibitory law. Law has potency because it can punish, but it has no saving or reformatory power. The triumphs of the gospel of Christ from the time of the apostles have been signal examples of personal power under divine inspiration. The passage, “To every man his own work,” needs reiteration and enforcement, for multitudes are putting off their own work upon other people.

This is one reason for empty churches and decaying charities and benevolent work that seems “run to seed.” The personal Christian life is gone, and there is only a corpse or a machine; the spirit of individual duty has departed, and what is left will soon shrivel and decay. We need love in place of law, life in place of form, the constraining love of Christ, which makes duty a pleasure, instead of the cold demand of the law, which is satisfied with a substitute or a proxy. Much that might be done to bring sinners to salvation is neglected, because those who ought to use their personal influence with friends and relatives and associates and dependents are timid or careless or unwilling to speak and act for Jesus.— *Augustus, in the New York Observer.*
