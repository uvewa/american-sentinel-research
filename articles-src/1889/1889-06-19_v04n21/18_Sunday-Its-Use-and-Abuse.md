The *Argus,* Leadville, Colorado, has an article on "Sunday, Its Use and Abuse," in which, referring to the Sunday-Rest bill, it says:—

> "Clearly stated, the purpose of that bill is to *compel *a day, not of rest but of *worship.* It may be admitted that both are linked together in the bill, but *the* feature is the latter compulsion. In other words, it is a covert attempt to enforce a day of worship rather than to secure for the toilers a day of rest and recuperation. The enforcement of such legislation would be a flagrant abuse."

And of the proposed amendment providing that the principles of the Christian religion shall be taught in the public schools, the *Argus* says:—

> "Religion does not require this sort of a constitutional amendment; the people do not want it. More than that, they will not have it."

That the *Argus* gives utterance to these sentiments not from opposition to religion but from love of simple justice is apparent from the following item clipped from another page of the same paper:—

> "The arrest of the Salvation Army in Leadville was an unmitigated outrage, and ought to bring the blush of shame to a city government which allows, without a word of protest, the almost daily parades of a band hired for the purpose by the proprietor of the most notoriously infamous dive in the city. The officers are not, of course, to be censured for obeying the instructions of the council, but that body should have shown a little more respect for the fundamental laws of the land. If the parade was criminal in its purpose, or resulted in a breach of the public order, there would then have been justification for the arrest; but it cannot be alleged that any crimes were committed as a consequence of the parades, or that they were productive of riot or disorder. The action of the council was in derogation of all the tenets of common law and decency, and was very properly characterized by the bar of the city as an outrageous discrimination against an inoffensive class of citizens."

We are free to confess that Salvation Army methods are not according to our ideas of the fitness of things, but this is not a question of propriety, but of civil and religious rights, and we maintain that as a matter of simple justice they have the right to worship God just as they please, and to parade with music, just as any other organization is permitted to parade. No attempt to regulate religious worship by law should be tolerated for a moment in this country.
