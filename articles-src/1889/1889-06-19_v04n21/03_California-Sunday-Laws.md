The following from the *Light of Home,* published at Alfred Center, New York, is a pointed and truthful statement:—

It is clear that, without any opposition on the part of those who observe the seventh-day Sabbath, public opinion in California is opposed to the re-enactment of any general Sunday law. Prohibitory legislation against liquor traffic on all days ought to be obtained in California and elsewhere. Any law which is directly or indirectly in the interest of religious observance of any day has no right to demand a hearing, there or elsewhere. All laws which are based upon the idea that it is wrong to attend to "secular affairs" on Sunday seek to establish a religious observance of the day. Some men may injure themselves through overwork by not resting on Sunday, but ten times as many injure themselves by dissipation, smoking, drinking, etc., when the law compels men to make it a holiday. If Sunday laws are to be supported mainly on hygienic grounds, they must be made to include smoking, drinking, "late suppers," and scores of other unhealthful practices which compulsory idleness induces.
