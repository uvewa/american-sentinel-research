We learn from the *Pearl of Days* that the Particular Synod (Dutch Reformed), of New Brunswick, held in Philadelphia May 8, adopted unanimously a resolution condemning Sunday papers for interfering with worship and preventing attendance at the house of God. The resolution earnestly requested all their members to refuse to buy or read any such papers. This is certainly a proper way of getting at the matter. It is perfectly right for those who are conscientiously opposed to reading secular papers on Sunday to refuse to do so, but that is a very different thing from demanding laws to prohibit the publication of such papers, or to prevent those from reading them that wish to. So long as the various churches confine themselves to adopting resolutions requesting their members not to patronize Sunday papers, they will be tending strictly to their own business, and we have no fault to find with them.
