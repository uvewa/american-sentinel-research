The Spokane Falls (W. T.) *Review* refers to the fact that up in Dakota there was quite "a war of words over the proposition to put God in the Constitution." It says that a Fargo gentleman, signing himself "Saul," wrote to his home paper opposing the religious features suggested. This writer said that "the Federal Constitution has no such provision, and that it has served a very good purpose nevertheless." "This," the *Review* continues, "called out a furious tirade from the other side." One writer replies in this vein:—

> "If the scoffers and infidels do not wish to live in God's country, let them remove themselves and their odious doctrines to some other country. Not only so, but I hope to see the day when the law will prevent the circulation of the blasphemies of would-be smart men like "Saul." . . . That the people of the United States have become a prosperous nation, notwithstanding the fact that God is not mentioned in the National Constitution, is a proof, if it proves anything at all, not that a people will prosper because they ignore the Supreme cause, but—that God is just, and that he does not visit the sins of the Constitution makers upon the people who are not responsible for the reprehensible action. Who is prepared to say, however, that the authors of this Constitution were not punished? Can Saul assure us that the scoffing infidel of the last century is not suffering the pangs of the lost in the place of eternal punishment?"

This is a fair sample of National Reform sentiment. It is characteristic of that class of so-called Christians who feel the necessity of being branded as such by the Constitution in order to be recognized, and that they are ready to use the most unchristian means to further their ends.
