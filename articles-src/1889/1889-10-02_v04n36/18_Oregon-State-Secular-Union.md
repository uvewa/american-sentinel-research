The annual convention of the Oregon State Secular Union for 1889, is to be held in the city of Portland, October 12-14. The main object of the Secular Union, as we understand it, is to oppose all forms of religious legislation, the encroachment of the religious upon the civil power, or the mixing up of religious with civil things. Webster's definition of "secular" is:—

> "Pertaining to this present world, or to things not spiritual or holy; relating to things not immediately or primarily respecting the soul but the body; worldly."

This definition properly describes the place and nature of the State. The State pertains solely to this present world. No State that ever existed will ever reach another world. The State, therefore, itself pertaining to this present world, can have nothing at all to do with the affairs or interests of another world or with men's relations to another world. Consequently the functions of the State are wholly secular. They do pertain solely to things not spiritual or holy.

Again: All with which the State can ever have properly to do, in this respect, is with the bodies and the bodily relations of men. It never can have anything to do with the soul. Consequently the relations of the State toward men is in the very nature of the case wholly secular. Therefore any union or combination formed for the purpose of keeping the State and its functions strictly secular is a proper combination and such purpose is a laudable purpose.

And just at the present time such purpose and effort are doubly laudable, in view of the persistent and wide-spread purpose of religious combinations to pervert the powers, and subvert the true principles of the State; efforts to commit the State to the inculcation, and the guardianship, of the things not of this present world, but of another world, and to things spiritual and holy; efforts to make the State, its powers and functions, to relate to things immediately and primarily respecting the souls and not the bodies of men.

And it is this effort of the religious combinations that has called into existence the secular unions and other combinations to keep the affairs of State within the proper civil or secular limits and maintain them upon that basis. Accordingly the "object" of the Oregon convention is "to secure the total separation of Church and State." This purpose is strictly in harmony with the Scriptures. It proposes to render to Cesar the things that are Cesar's, and to leave every man free to render to God the things that are God's. We wish success to the Oregon convention in its efforts to awaken wider public attention to the evils and the danger of religious legislation, and of the encroachments of the religious upon the civil power.
