As this Sentinel goes to press there is a debate in progress between Alonzo T. Jones, editor of the Sentinel, and Rev. G. W. Bothwell, M. A., D. D., Chancellor of Columbia University of New Orleans, member of the New Orleans Academy of Science, and of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. The debate is on the Sunday Rest-law Petition. The proposition is the one that Mr. Crafts did not debate: namely, "Resolved that the following petition ought to prevail." There are to be four sessions of the debate, each speaker to occupy an hour and fifteen minutes each session. The speeches are being reported, and it is probable that at least a synopsis will be given in the Sentinel.
