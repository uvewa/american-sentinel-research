The daily *Oregonian* of August 19, tells the following:—

> "A Philadelphian engaged in work upon a family vault in a graveyard accidentally got locked in. He began to laugh, but when night came on his companionship with seventeen corpses became anything but a joke, and so worked upon his nervous system that his black hair was turned to white. He has firmly resolved to change his business."

Well, well, we should think that any man who would be afraid of a corpse ought to have his hair turned white. We wonder that every separate hair didn't fall out by the roots. It is true that there were seventeen corpses there, but neither seventeen, nor seventeen *thousand,* corpses are a particle more dangerous than is one. Nor is a corpse any more dangerous in the night than in the day. Yes, we should think he ought to change his business; but what business such a person as that can be fit for in this world or any other, is a mystery. Why didn't he lie down and go to sleep and take things easy till the door was unlocked?
