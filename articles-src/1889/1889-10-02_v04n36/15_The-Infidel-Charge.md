National Reformers and Sunday-law advocates are very profuse with the word "infidel" in referring to the opponents of their schemes. When we remember that to oppose religious legislation is all that is necessary to constitute infidelity in the mind of the modern National Reformer, that term loses much of the intended stigma when emanating from that source. It does not derogate much from the reputation of the Constitution framers to be denounced as infidels for having given to the country a fundamental law under which Christianity has enjoyed such privileges as it never before experienced in any country; and under whose protecting care it has flourished as under no other government either past or present. On the other hand, is it not plain, that to destroy this very liberty-of- conscience feature which has been productive of so much good, would be the breach where the real infidelity would enter?
