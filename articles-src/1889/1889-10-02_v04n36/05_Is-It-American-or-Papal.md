# Is It American or Papal?

The *Catholic Review,* of June 9, 1889, contains the following editorial note which explains itself in such a way as to be of much interest in the discussion of the question of religion in the public schools:—

The Congregational Club of Brooklyn held its last meeting of the season a few days ago and had a most distinguished attendance. The speaker of the evening was Rev. Thomas B. McLeod, who asked and answered the question: "Shall the public schools be secularized?" The points which he developed were: That the welfare of the State demands that the instruction of her children shall embrace the inculcation of a strong morality; that the culture of the conscience, as well as of the intellect, is essential to citizenship; that religious instruction is essential to national morality; that it is the business of the State to make religious instruction one of the prime factors in the system of education. No nation that has divorced religion from instruction has escaped moral ruin, said Mr. McLeod. We are very thankful to the reverend gentleman for his strong words in behalf of the religious principle in education. The Pope himself is not stronger than he on this important matter, and as there is not the slightest doubt that he represents the opinion of many thousands of honest thinkers, it is encouraging to Catholics to hear such language on such an occasion. The points upon which he might differ from a sound Catholic are too unimportant to discuss. When a man holds one true principle of the fundamental kind, he is not apt to be over-prejudiced against his supporters in the opposite camp, a fact which Mr. McLeod well illustrated in his own speech. He said not a word against Catholics.
