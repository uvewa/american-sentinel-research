At the Los Angeles Sunday-law convention, Rev. A. W. Rider said: —

> "I believe not only in the one-seventh allotment of time for physical rest, and in which the constitution of the State ought to protect the community, but in the principles of the observance of the Sabbath in the deeper religious sense. The question is, how shall we obtain this, how shall we obtain the most of spiritual good? We cannot compel men to be spiritually minded or moral by legal means, but the Christian means of making men spiritually minded ought to be guaranteed by the State."

But when the State guarantees the Christian means of making men spiritually minded it thereby guarantees an established religion and devotes the machinery of the government wholly to the service of the ruling ecclesiastics. All that the nations of Europe did in the supremacy of the Papacy was to guarantee the so-called Christian means of making men spiritually minded, and everybody knows how that worked. And an attempt to do the same thing in this country is simply an attempt to repeat the methods and times of the Papacy. In such an effort as was this proposed by Mr. Rider, the true functions of both the State and the church are perverted and the result is such a confused mass of iniquity as nothing else under the sun can produce.
