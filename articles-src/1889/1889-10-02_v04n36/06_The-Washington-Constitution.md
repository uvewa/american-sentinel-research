# The Washington Constitution.

## DEBATE ON THE PREAMBLE.

The following report of the debate in the Constitutional Convention of the new State of Washington, is of peculiar interest. We print the fullest report we have been able to find:—

Article 1, the preamble and declaration of rights, was taken up, and the convention went into committee of the whole, with Stiles, of Tacoma, in the chair.

The whole article was read, and then the preamble was taken up, reading thus:—

> "We, the people of the State of Washington, to preserve our rights, do ordain this constitution."

Lindsley moved the following substitute:—

> "We, the people of the State of Washington, grateful to Almighty God for our freedom, to secure and transmit the same unimpaired to succeeding generations, do ordain this constitution."

Dyer moved to add after "State of Washington" these words: "Grateful to Almighty God for the blessings of liberty and self-government and order."

Turner said he also had a pet preamble which he should like to lay before the committee. It reads thus: —

> "We, the people of Washington, in order to form a more independent and perfect government, establish justice, insure tranquillity, provide for common defense, promote the general welfare and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and to our posterity, profoundly grateful to Almighty God for this inestimable right, and invoking his favor and guidance, do ordain and establish the following constitution and form of government for the State of Washington."

Mr. Lindsley withdrew his substitute in favor of Mr. Turner's.

Mr. Dyer's motion was first considered, and that gentleman argued briefly in favor of placing the name of God in the constitution.

Mr. Comegys said: "I am opposed to the substitute. The gentleman is in favor of it because he thinks we ought to be grateful to Almighty God. I would like to ask him if he thinks this provision would add anything to our gratitude by being in that preamble. He admitted the necessity for brevity, and has made it as brief, he says, as he could and include that point. Now, as I understand it, Mr. President, this has nothing to do with gratitude or reverence, or irreverence. A man may be very reverent or very grateful without lifting up his voice on the street corners, or he may lift up his voice and claim to be very grateful and yet not be grateful. The question is, Shall we advertise it in this way? Has it anything to do here? The framers of the Constitution of the United States had this matter under advisement, and after mature deliberation (and many framers of that Constitution were devout Christians), they deemed it not wise to have any reference to the Deity, because they had agreed that Church and State and matters of religion should be forever separate from civil government. Now, what object is to be attained? Will we be more grateful by reason of putting it there, or will we be less grateful though we do not put it there. The preamble should briefly state the facts. The preamble of the Constitution of the United States recites somewhat more, as it ought. If it is our duty to put that in the Constitution, how much more should it have been the duty of the framers of the Constitution of the United States to put it in theirs."

Mr. Turner said: "I admit that this is purely a matter of sentiment, but it accords with the feelings of ninety-nine out of every hundred citizens of Washington. We are here to make a constitution for the sovereign people of Washington, and it would be a disregard of their desires to omit recognition of the Deity."

S. G. Cosgrove said: "I do not consider this a special time to show our respect for the Deity, nor do I consider it an attempt to connect the Church and State by recognizing God in the constitution, but I do consider it a respect for the opinions of mankind that we recognize the name of the Deity in our constitution. It does not in any way associate the Church and State because of this recognition of God or a deity. It is not necessarily recognizing the church in any sense. We are framing a constitution not only for ourselves, but for the people of this vast country. We expect to get a large amount of immigration into this country before many years, and I do not care what the committee intended by leaving it out of this preamble, the masses of people of the United States will take it as an indirect attack upon the church, and as an indirect pandering to infidelity by leaving out this word. Let me say, gentlemen, that this territory would have been built up long ago had it not been that the people of the East believed that Washington Territory was a heathen land, peopled by heathens, without government. You can go back to the Eastern States to-day, and they are but now commencing to learn that the people of Washington Territory are civilized and enlightened; and when that feeling is worn off among the people of the United States you will see such a pouring of people into this Territory as has never been seen or known in any other State in the Union, and you cannot afford by a little bit of pandering to infidelity, to leave out this word in our constitution. I say if we, in this convention, do not respect God, God will not respect our work. I say further that the man who is not accountable to a deity of some kind or other, is unsafe in any community, and if we advertise ourselves as attempting to avoid this, I do not care for what purpose, you will see that it will check a great portion of the people that come to this country from remaining. You can well afford to put it in, but if it is left out it will do us such an irreparable injury that none of the framers of this constitution can now conceive of."

Mr. Buchanan said that apart from any pecuniary consideration, it behooved man to consider that he didn't stand at the head of creation. There is some intelligence far above and beyond the stretch of our intellectuality. "I ask to be placed in no better company than him whose name this State bears. I ask to have read the following as a part of my remarks":—

The first inaugural address of Washington was the document sent to the desk, and the clerk read it.

Mr. Turner moved his form of preamble as a substitute for Mr. Dyer's, and expressed briefly [283] his belief in the propriety of thus recognizing the Supreme Being.

Mr. Warner, chairman of the preamble committee, would yield to no one in reverence for God, but likened the placing of his name in the constitution to the action of the Pharisee in the Scripture. He didn't believe it essential there any more than is the Lord's prayer. It was merely a sentiment. If the convention wants to put it there he should not object, but he should vote against putting it there.

Mr. Griffitts had hoped no such discussion would arise here, and he believed the gentleman offering it would do a great favor if, with the consent of the convention, he would withdraw it.

A voice—He couldn't get it.

*Mr. Griffitts*—From at least one speech I have heard I should judge he could not, but this action places the opponents of this measure in a peculiar position, from which I shall not shrink, I am not called upon to proclaim my personal religious beliefs, and shall not do so. The only question here is whether the preamble, as reported by the committee, is a sufficient preface to the constitution which follows. It certainly is sufficient, for what follows is simply political and does not profess to deal with man's religious views. A majority of the State constitutions, as well as that of the United States, commit this sacrilege and irreverence of leaving out God in the preamble. Mr. Turner's substitute is almost an exact copy of the United States Constitution, with the addition of the words "profoundly grateful to Almighty God," etc. If seeking immigration involved the necessity of reverence to God in the constitution, then the United States ought to have its Constitution covered all over with references to God, for immigration was the one great thing they wanted. He cited the following States as having no reference to God in the preamble: Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia (1818), Illinois, Indiana, Kansas (1855), Kentucky (1792), Louisiana, Maryland (but did put God into a later constitution), Michigan (1835), and said he might go further with the Carolinas, Virginia, and others.

*Mr. Cosgrove*—Does recognizing God in the constitution recognize religion?

*Mr. Griffitts*—It is well known that a great discussion has been going on over this very matter, and I merely wish to avoid provoking any more such discussion. If omitted, nobody's feelings can be hurt or his opinion opposed. I would strike out the slightest reference to anybody's religious belief. We are dealing only with civil and political rights, and should not transcend our province by putting into the constitution these words to which some people object.

Mr. Turner didn't care to follow the last speaker in examination of the constitution, but where he referred to the earlier constitutions of States, it was a fact that later constitutions in the same States did have reference to God in the preamble. This was a matter of sentiment, he admitted. It also represented his own personal sentiment, and he believed also the sentiments of 999 out of every 1,000 of adults of the State for whom we are making this constitution, and the convention would simply be recreant to their trust if they did not represent this sentiment in the preamble.

Mr. T. M. Reed cordially coincided with the last speaker and claimed that no religious question or discussion was here presented, except so far as the gentleman from Spokane (Griffitts) had raised it. The substitute merely proposed to recognize gratitude to Almighty God, which he believed was the fact with the people of this State and country.

Mr. Eshelman was indifferent as to the placing of the name of the Deity in the constitution, but supported Mr. Turner's substitute as a far better form of words, aside from this question of Deity— although he was in favor of the whole substitute.

Mr. Sullivan, of Pierce, said: "I believe the report of this committee should be sustained. It is certainly an able committee, and they considered the subject carefully before they came in here and made this report. The argument we hear, that if we do not put our gratitude into the constitution, it will prevent immigration to this Territory, it seems to me is on a very low basis. The Constitution that has been referred to here, the supreme law of the land, did not have God in it, and yet certainly there has been a reasonable amount of immigration to this country, and the class of people who came here are reputable citizens. I say that the argument is no argument at all. I would have little respect for the men who would remain away simply because in this political organization the name of the Deity was not mentioned. This is not a question of gratitude. As well might we express our gratitude to the Congress of the United States, who really permitted us to meet here. And how many members of this convention, if arraigned before the Almighty God this morning—and he were to select those who were profoundly grateful in the highest sense— how many members would be selected by the Almighty God. If we treat it as a political matter, how would he respond to that, coming from a political organization, as to its gratitude to him? I believe simply that it is a matter of sentiment in the convention, and not a question of absolute principle. For this reason I oppose it."

Mr. J. Z. Moore regretted the bringing of this question here, but being here, he should discuss it. He had never been a member of any religious body and did not speak from that standpoint, but he supported the substitute as being pleasing to that great body of the people who profoundly and sincerely believe in God. As to those who deny God, they being simply in a negative position, need not feel hurt. As to Mr. Griffitts' statement about constitutions, he was wrong if he meant to claim that a majority of the present constitutions had no reference to God. After having this up for discussion, a refusal to put it into the constitution was a bad example to the youth of a growing State.

Mr. Comegys asked if the United States Constitution was a bad example to youth.

*Mr. Moore*—According to the tenor of my remarks it would seem so.

*Mr. Buchanan*—May I answer the gentleman?

*The Chair*—Mr. Moore has the floor.

*Mr. Moore*—I yield to the gentleman from Adams (Buchanan) for that purpose.

*Mr. Buchanan*—I have always considered that the real preamble to the United States Constitution was the Declaration of Independence, which distinctly and repeatedly acknowledges God.

*Mr. Moore*—Three times in the Declaration of Independence do the signers thereof recognize God, and in our annual Thanksgiving-day the whole nation recognizes God.

Mr. Tibbetts said he occupied exactly the same position as the last speaker, and should heartily support the substitute.

Mr. Sullivan, of Whitman, said he should have supported the report of the committee if it had put God into the constitution, and should stand by it now. If there was anything he had contempt for it was doing anything for show and buncombe. To put this in or to leave it out means absolutely nothing. It is all stuff and nonsense, and nothing more or less. If this is left out, what detriment will it be to the people of this State or God? The Supreme Being pays no attention to this convention, or any other political gathering, or to anything else save the motives of a man. Mr. Chairman, I hope this convention will presently quit this moonshine. The greatest disgrace that has fallen on this convention since it assembled in this city has been the spending of so much time on this stuff and nonsense.

*Mr. Power*—I call the gentleman to order for imputing such motives to delegates.

*Mr. Cosgrove*—As he is taking up the greater portion of the time himself, he is simply commenting on his own motion.

*Mr. Buchanan*—The gentleman is entirely out, of order; he is imputing the basest motives to gentlemen who have spoken most reverently on this subject.

*The Chair*—The gentleman is in order, but getting very close to the line. [Laughter.]

Sullivan continuing, said: "If I remember right, the Bible says there is a time and a place for everything. It also says 'don't take my name in vain.' The convention therefore should not place or put the name in anywhere simply to tickle the ear of any individual or set of individuals."

Mr. Turner desired to speak, but was ruled out having spoken once, so long as others wished to speak.

Mr. Dyer believed the making of a constitution was one of the most sacred and solemn duties that could be performed. We are not to discuss revealed or natural religion. From the beginning of history, all people have had a God, and he believed in beginning this great constitution by recognizing the Supreme Being, whether as God, Allah or Jehovah, and expressing gratitude to him.

Mr. God man regretted the turn this debate had taken. He recognized the great value of the teachings of Christ, and reverenced as much as any man the supreme intelligence, but he believed the convention should deal with things seen, things practical, and not with sentiment or mystery, with which the convention had no business to meddle. The matter is immaterial, and I will support the report of the committee. I do not think that the substitute, if adopted, would increase our commerce or the fertility of the soil. If it had been there, I would have left it there. It is a mere matter of sentiment, and I do not believe in lugging sentiment into this constitution. If 999 asked to have anything done for sentiment and one opposed it on principle, I would stand by the man of principle.

Mr. Sturdevant said: "I cannot say, with my colleague, Mr. E. H. Sullivan, that had this matter been placed in the preamble by the committee that I should have voted for it, for my feelings are such as would not permit me to do so, not for the reason that I do not entertain the greatest reverence for a Supreme Being, but for this reason: I consider that this is simply a business meeting; I consider that the people of Washington Territory have sent us here to this Constitutional Convention [284] not for the purpose of advancing any religious belief, not for the purpose of advancing any sentimentality, but for the purpose of doing straightforward business, in a candid, common- sense manner; to frame a business article upon which they are to predicate the future laws of this State. The framers of the Constitution of the United States left out of that Constitution any recognition of the Supreme Being. I think its omission shows no irreverence, for I think that we must all recognize directly the interposition of the hand of the Almighty in our prosperity, in the liberties which have been given to us and maintained by our people. In reply to the argument of Mr. Buchanan, I challenge him to show me one word by George Washington in that debate where he raised his voice in favor of placing in that Constitution any recognition of the Supreme Being. The gentleman from Garfield (Cosgrove) is fearful that if we do not put this in the Constitution its effect upon immigration is going to be disastrous. He tells us that it is supposed away back across the States, perhaps to the Atlantic, that we are a set of savages out here, that we do not possess any degree of civilization. I do not know that we are worse than other States and Territories. The farther East you go, the stronger is that impression. The expression was used in Boston four or five years ago, in a meeting, that we were the 'Rowdy West,' and they were very anxious for the safety of the nation when they recognized the fact that the West was 'the rowdy West.' Emory Storrs, that great orator, was at that meeting, and was called upon to express his views, and he expressed them somewhat in this way: That he thought the people of the rowdy West, as it was called, were as capable to rear their children in a sense of enlightenment and in a sense of morality as those who claimed to live at the center of culture, 'one-half of whom doubted the existence of a Supreme Being, and the other half believed they were descended from an ape.' I see no use for this in our constitution. As well acknowledge the existence of a Supreme Being and an overruling providence in the making of a promissory note, as in this constitution; yet who would not say it was ridiculous if you saw a promissory note something like this, 'For value received, I promise to pay to John Doe, or order, $100, recognizing the overruling providence of the Supreme Court, and the credit business and the great privileges which have been conferred upon me by the Supreme Being by reason of this promissory note.' Then again, what would be said in court of the lawyer commencing his complaint in this way: 'John Doe vs. Richard Roe; the plaintiff in the above-entitled action, recognizing the overruling power and constant care of the Supreme Being, complains of Richard Roe, and alleges,' etc. Now that is just as sensible, in my opinion, as placing it in the preamble of the constitution. Let us ask God to guide us and teach us common sense in the business which we are trying to transact in this convention."

Mr. Buchanan did not recollect any debate on this subject in the original Constitution, and asked Mr. Sturdevant about that.

Mr. Sturdevant said he had not examined the subject.

*Mr. Buchanan*—You made the assertion.

*Mr. Sturdevant*—I made no assertion. I simply asked the gentleman to show if Washington said anything on that subject. I am informed by a friend (Mr. Comegys) that he believes the subject was fully debated there.

Mr. Cosgrove said such method of argument was essentially unfair, and he was glad it was made so apparent to the convention. He commented on the sermon on Christian religion which one gentleman (Sullivan, of Whitman) had delivered when the Christian religion had not been brought up at all, and if, as the gentleman has said, this convention is the laughing-stock of the press for its actions, it is for just such debates as this and for just such remarks as have been made here this morning. The party which organized this convention, from president to page, would be held responsible for all that was left out as well as for all that was put into this constitution, and might find itself needing votes for this document from the very people who would withhold them from it, unless a simple recognition of the Supreme Being was in.

Mr. Warner was a member of a church which had the most reverent devotion to God, but did not believe it necessary to advertise that fact in their business transactions. The committee had discussed the matter very briefly, and simply recognized the constitution as a business document, and decided to leave out any mere matter of sentiment.

Mr. Turner said Mr. Sullivan, of Whitman, had been in the habit, from the very commencement, of lecturing and hectoring this convention, in season and out of season, and in common with others he had borne it with what equanimity he might, but when he commented with the coarsest buffoonery on the motives of gentlemen on this floor, and upon his own (Turner's) motives in offering this substitute, he had gone too far. It was from the highest motives of duty that he had offered this substitute. He felt profoundly reverent, personally, for the happy circumstances under which the convention and the people of the State are living, and prefaced his substitute under that motive alone. He repeated that he considered it in bad taste, as well as in contradiction of the rules of this body, to impute such motives to any member who exercised the merest privilege of duty in offering such substitutes and amendments as he thought right.

Mr. Sullivan wanted to say, for the benefit of Judge Turner and any other man, that he should have better judgment than to impute motives to a gentleman who was declared to be in order by the chair. "I imputed no motives. The gentleman can keep his insults to himself. I can take care of myself, both in and out of this convention."

Mr. Cosgrove called the gentleman to order.

Mr. Turner hoped the gentleman would be allowed to proceed, and the chair allowed him to proceed.

*Mr. Sullivan*—I desire to say this, I do not want any member of this convention to impute any motive to me at all regarding my arguments in debate here. I do not think of the individual. I never impute motives in a question in debate I rise above that; I take the arguments of the gentlemen and look at them, analyze them, if possible, without looking at their motives. If their argument is good, I will endorse that. If it is bad, I will try to show the fallacy. I do not want any man to get up here and talk about buffoonery or anything else. I am getting sick of this convention, and I am getting sick of this imputing of motives outside of it. Why drag outside matters into this convention? Why do that? I am not impugning the motives of my friend Turner, and I say to this committee, and I want to say to him, and I want to say to every member of this convention before I sit down, that I have not criticised the action of this convention so far as its motives were concerned at all. Inside of this convention and outside of this convention I have said this, and I repeat it here irrespective of motive: We have fooled away our time here, and I say the people are objecting, and I am perhaps as much to blame as any other man in this convention. I do not deny that. I do not want any man to get up here and abuse me. I do not propose to stand it—Judge Turner or anybody else. I have never allowed that since I was five years old, and I do not propose to stand it now."

Mr. Dunbar attempted to pour oil on the troubled waters, but Mr. Griffitts thought they were in the second round, and he ought to have another chance.

The chair recognized Mr. Dunbar, on the ground that even if they were in the second round, any delegate who had not spoken at all was entitled to the preference.

Mr. Dunbar moved that the committee rise and report progress. Carried; yeas 36, nays 24.

The president resumed the chair, and Mr. Stiles reported progress on behalf of the committee, and leave to sit again was granted.

Mr. Dunbar moved to adjourn. Lost.

Mr. Griffitts moved to take a recess till 2 o'clock. Carried.

The convention reassembled at 2 o'clock, the president in the chair.

On motion of Warner, the convention resolved itself into a committee of the whole on the preamble and bill of rights; Stiles, of Tacoma, in the chair.

The question was stated by the chair to be on Mr. Dyer's motion.

Moore said it was generally understood that they were speaking to the amendment offered by Turner.

The chair stated that Dyer's was merely an amendment to the preamble, whereas Turner's was a substitute for the whole preamble.

On Dyer's amendment the question was put, and it failed.

Turner's substitute was taken up, read and failed; yeas, 32; nays, 34.

Minor offered the following substitute:—

> "We, the people of Washington, with profound reverence for the Supreme Ruler of the Universe, in order to secure and perpetuate the blessings of self-government, do ordain and establish this constitution for the State of Washington."

Adopted—ayes, 33; nays, 32.

The question was then put on the adoption of the preamble as thus amended.

T. M. Reed raised a point of order that the adoption of the substitute adopted the preamble.

The chair stated that the point was not well taken.

The motion to adopt the preamble was voted on, and the vote was a tie, 33 to 33, so the motion failed.

Sullivan, of Tacoma, moved to refer back the preamble to the committee on preamble.

Griffitts moved to adopt the preamble as reported originally by the committee.

T. M. Reed moved to lay on the table.

Cosgrove raised a point of order that Griffitts' motion was out of order. The chair ruled the point well taken.

Mr. Griffitts asked, "What is the status of the question now."

*The Chair*—The preamble as amended is now [285] before the committee for amendment, or anything else.

Griffitts said that when a thing had failed it was dead as he understood it, and so there was no preamble, and he ought to be allowed to move anything he asked for a preamble.

*Moore*—The chair should give the deciding vote.

*Chair*—I voted on the point, and there made a mistake.

*Cosgrove*—It was no mistake. The chair has a right to vote in committee of the whole.

*Griffitts*—I now move that we adopt the following preamble "We, the people of the State of Washington, do ordain this constitution."

Mr. Hoyt stated that the chair should not vote, except on roll-call or a rising vote.

*The Chair*—I suggest that the question be put again as the best solution.

*Mr. Turner*—I move that the committee report the preamble back to the convention, with the recommendation that it be recommitted to the Committee on Preamble; so ordered.

Wednesday forenoon session, the convention again went into committee of the whole on preamble.

Mr. Stiles, of Tacoma, resumed the chair. The majority and minority reports of the Committee on Preamble were read, as follows:—

Majority report.

> "We, the people of the State of Washington, to secure the blessings of liberty, insure domestic tranquillity and preserve our rights, do ordain this constitution."

MINORITY REPORT.

> "We, the people of Washington, grateful to the Supreme Ruler of the Universe for our liberty, do ordain this constitution.

Lindsley moved that the minority report be adopted.

Sullivan (Tacoma) moved that the committee rise and recommend that the convention settle the whole matter. Lost.

Warner did not rise to discuss the matter, but simply stated the position of the committee.

> "We have considered it a mere sentiment and of little consequence either way, and shall be satisfied whichever way the committee decide, but trust the subject will not be debated."

Comegys moved to amend by substituting "majority" for "minority."

Cosgrove called attention to the real point at issue, so that the gentlemen who have said they had no real objections to the name of the Deity in the constitution need make no mistake.

Willison asked the effect of voting aye, as he was absent from the debate yesterday.

The chair stated that voting "aye" on this motion was equivalent to leaving out the name of God from the preamble.

The motion of Comegys was lost, and Lindsley's motion prevailed—yeas 45, nays 22. So that the phrase, "Grateful to the Supreme Ruler of the Universe for our liberties," is the way it will stand in the constitution.
