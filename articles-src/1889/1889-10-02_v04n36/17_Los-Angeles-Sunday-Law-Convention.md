September 1 and 2 a convention was held at Los Angeles, Cal., in the interests of a National Sunday law. The meetings were well attended, yet the results were rather disappointing to the American Sabbath Union. That assumption of authority and spirit of over-lordship which characterizes the work of the American Sabbath Union does not take well in the free air of California.

The usual effort was made to make it appear to be a movement in the interest of the workingman and they went a little further than they did in San Francisco. They actually engaged a workingman to make a speech, and he endeavored to do so. But the whole thing, both his effort and that of the American Sabbath Union on this point, was a dismal failure. And when at another session Mr. Crafts took occasion to advertise one of his own books, the Los Angeles daily *Tribune* says, "it fell like a wet blanket upon the audience and evidently took all the inspiration and enthusiasm out of the meeting."

If the American Sabbath Union consisted of anybody but Mr. Crafts, we should advise it to employ a different sort of a worker before it enters its next annual campaign; but as he is himself the Union, there is of course no room for any such advice in the matter.
