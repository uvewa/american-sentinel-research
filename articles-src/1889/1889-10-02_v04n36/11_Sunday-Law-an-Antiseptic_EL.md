# Sunday Law an Antiseptic.

National Reformers strenuously deny that the outcome of a National Sunday law will be a union of Church and State, and that the efforts which they are making to secure such a law are in the line of religious legislation; but there is a significance to the fact that the men who stand at the head of the movement, with few exceptions, are preachers, and this significance becomes more apparent when we come to notice some of their arguments in favor of the law. For instance, Rev. T. P. Stevenson, in his argument before the Senate Committee, among other things, said: "With the loss of the Sabbath, religion will perish."

We must conclude, then, that this proposed Sunday law is for the purpose of *preserving religion.* But what is there about the *civil* observance of Sunday that is so preserving to religion? Unless a civil Sunday law will make a praying man of a Sabbath-breaker, and convert him to every other proper form of religious worship, it will fail of its object, only so far as it makes him a hypocrite on the particular point of Sunday observance. So, in order to preserve religion from perishing, it will be necessary to legislate on the subject of prayer, and every other religious practice; for it is just as true that with the loss of prayer and other religious duties, religion will perish, as it is with the loss of the Sabbath.

But if it is mere physical rest for the workingmen that they are after in this Sunday law, why mention religion at all? "Ah," says Mr. Crafts, "Take the religion out, and you take the rest out." Then it isn't so much the rest for the tired workmen, after all, that they want, but it is the preservation of religion. And why should they be so anxious about the preservation of religion? Why, a preserved religion brought about by a civil Sunday law, is supposed to mean full church pews, and well-preserved salaries. Don't you see? Wonderful preserving properties possesses this civil Sunday law.
