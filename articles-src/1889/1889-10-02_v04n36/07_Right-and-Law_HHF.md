# Right and Law.

> "The right of rest for one is the law of rest for all," is an expression often used by National Reformers and one would think that they regard it as a self-evident truth that needs no proof. It needs but a moment's thought to see its absurdity. They use it to prove the obligation of the Sunday rest upon all. No one disputes their right to rest on Sunday if they choose, therefore they say that all should rest. Let us try it another way. Sabbatarians have the right to rest upon the seventh day, even the National Reformers admit this, therefore if their logic is good for anything, all should rest upon that day also, and thus we have all men observing two days. Of course they will not for a moment admit of this conclusion; and, therefore, their proposition only serves to show the utter inconsistency of the cause which seeks to be sustained by such arguments.

Let us carry this a little further and see how the same argument will work with respect to another Edenic institution, that of marriage. The right of marriage for one is the law of marriage for all. Anyone can see the absurdity of the proposition. Any single person has the right to marry; therefore, on the National Reform theory, if any exercise the right, all *must* do so; and if they do not marry, a law must be enacted to compel them to do so.
