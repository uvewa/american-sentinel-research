# A National Religion.

Judaism is not more alien to Catholicism or any branches of Protestantism than are these to one another. If the majority succeeded in stamping the United States officially as a Christian country, would the majority of the Christians be satisfied until it were labelled a *Protestant *Christian country? And when that had been accomplished none of the principal branches of Protestantism would rest content until it had been decided whether it should be a Protestant Episcopal Christian country, a Congregationalist Christian country, or a Methodist Episcopal Christian country.

This is not the whole difficulty, however. Even if some satisfactory arrangement could be effected as to the association of Christianity with the national government, the real danger would present itself when the same principle is logically applied to local government. Here we would have to face the worst menace in our republican institutions.

If the Protestant majority is to dominate our national affairs, what is to prevent the Catholics laying hold of the administration of affairs in those municipalities where they are in the majority? It needs no elaboration to form a conception of the terrible results that await us if such a condition of things should ever come to pass.

The only safeguard against such a consummation that is to be devoutly deplored, lies in the absolute and unconditional alienation of the State from any sectarian association. This is what the founders of our country had in view when they embodied in the Constitution the provision that "Congress should make no law respecting an establishment of religion."

The only functions of government in this country, its States and cities, are legislative, administrative, and judicial. None of these require for their exercise any association with religious bodies. Those that are engaged in them may be, nay should be, animated by religious impulses. This, however, only implies their individual affiliation with religious bodies, and does not at all necessitate any such relationship between the Church and the State.—*American Hebrew.*
