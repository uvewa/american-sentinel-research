# The Image of the Papacy.

The *Christian Nation* of August 14 gave a report of the Prohibition Convention for Allegheny County, Penn. The first two resolutions read as follows:—

> *Resolved,* 1. That the prohibitionists of Allegheny County, in convention assembled, recognize the Lord Jesus Christ as the rightful sovereign of our State and Nation, in conformity with whose most holy character and will all our laws ought to be made.

> *Resolved,* 2. That we are in favor of a most conscientious and scriptural observance of the Sabbath as absolutely essential to the welfare of society and the preservation of the State.
This goes to the full length of that the National Reformers themselves propose. To make the Saviour the sovereign of either the State or the Nation is but to make the Governor of the State or the President of the Nation only the representative, the vicegerent of Christ in the chair of State, to execute his will upon the subjects of the State or Nation. When he should speak, therefore, he would speak as the vicegerent of Christ; and for anybody to doubt would be to be damned, and for anybody to refuse assent would be to be guilty of the highest crime. Between the Papacy and such a system as that there would be not the shadow of a difference. It would be a living likeness of the Papacy itself.

The second resolution, as regards a more conscientious and scriptural observance of the Sabbath, is an excellent resolution, but when it makes the object of it only the welfare of society and the preservation of the State, it takes away from the Sabbath both its conscientious and its scriptural sanctions, and to propose the observance of the Sabbath for such an object is only to propose the violation of the Sabbath. And above all, when such observance is being secured by enforcement of law, and human law at that, the evil element in the proposition is vastly increased. Nor is the State convention much behind the Allegheny County convention in this matter. The platform, as adopted by the State convention and reported in the *Voice* of Sept 5, “acknowledges Almighty God as the source of all power and authority in human government.” The third plank declares,—”The Sabbath must be preserved by the due enforcement of existing laws, and the speedy enactment of such additional legislation as may be necessary to insure its due observance.” It also indorses the platform of the National Prohibition Party adopted at Indianapolis, May 30, 1888. That same copy of the *Voice* advocates the abolition of the liquor traffic because it is sin and argues for prohibition upon that basis.

This is all of a piece. The Alleghany County resolutions, the State platform, and the editorial of the *Voice* are each but parts of one stupendous whole which embodies the movement to religiously amend the Constitution; turn this republic into a theocracy, after the express image of the Papacy; and to enforce the observance of the day established by that counterfeit theocracy— in fact it contains the very elements of the mystery of iniquity. Therefore the third party Prohibition party should be uncompromisingly opposed by every man who loves either Christianity or civil government.
