The *Christian Union,* in commenting on the resolution passed by the Boston ministers' meeting, accusing all those ministers who do not work for prohibition in their pulpits, of being in alliance with the enemies of the church and the State, says some things that are very pertinent in this time, when there is a growing desire for the pulpit to shape legislation. It says:—

> "We have often expressed our conviction that it is unwise, except in very extraordinary cases, for the clergy of any denomination to identify themselves with any particular party, or any particular form of legislation. We do not think that the issue raised by the prohibitory movement constitutes one of the rare exceptions to the general principle. The ministers will do wisely not to identify the religion of Christ with any particular temporary political measure; they will do unwisely if they attempt to convert their churches into political machines for the purpose of carrying specific enactments, whether constitutional or legislative."

The Rev. Dr. Harcourt, a Methodist pastor of San Francisco, is reported as having expressed himself in the following sensible manner concerning Sunday newspapers:—

> "I am inclined to think that a preacher who cannot get an audience without a stringent Sunday law, could not get one with it. There are some of my own cloth so strict in the observance of the Sabbath that the sight of a Sunday newspaper throws them into a fit of nausea, the work of which is done on Saturday, while they are the first to get Monday's paper, the work of which is done on Sunday. O consistency, thou art a jewel! It is possible for even ministers to convert a festival into a funeral, and to make infidels out of the mourners. The Sunday newspapers have come to stay. Would it not be better for us to set ourselves about elevating their general tone rather than decrying their existence? And if, as some say, the people stay at home to read their Sunday papers in preference to going to church, then let us make our sermons so strong and helpful to men that they will give their preference to the church and the sermon."
