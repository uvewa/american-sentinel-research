# Heartless Double Dealing.

The Rev. J. M. Foster, a "secretary" of the National Reform Association, has been holding forth in Cincinnati, and in his last report he says that when an opportunity was given to ask questions, a student asked: "Would not the enactment of a National Sabbath law oppress the conscience of those who keep the seventh day?" He says that "it was answered," and the following is the way in which he did it:—

> "We have Sabbath laws already in every State in the Union, with the exception of California. We would not think of abolishing these laws because a few brethren object. Now what we want is to have the Nation fall into line with the States. The Legislature of Connecticut passed a law that no unnecessary trains should run on Sabbath. Ten thousand railroad men were emancipated from railroad toil. But the mail trains ran through the State on Sabbath, and the State was powerless to prevent it. The State could not control the Nation's Sabbath profanation. A national Sabbath law, making it unlawful to continue the United States mail service or inter-State traffic on the Lord's day, is what is needed."

This is what Mr. Foster calls an answer to the question, "Would not the enactment of a Sabbath law oppress the conscience of those who keep the seventh day?" His answer is, that most of the States have Sunday laws, and "we would not think of abolishing these laws because a few brethren object." That is to say, "What if it does oppress the consciences of those people? There are not very many of them anyway, and it doesn't make any difference if they are oppressed. We wouldn't think of stopping on that account." Let it be understood, then, that the National Reform way of answering questions as to whether or not their schemes will oppress conscientious people, is to say, "We don't care if they do."

But another tack is sometimes taken, and it is implied in Mr. Foster's answer. It is this: When asked if a national Sunday law will not be oppressive they say that all the States have Sunday laws, and the people are not oppressed, and that therefore no objection ought to be made to a national Sunday law. This is a very common but a most unfair argument. It conceals the real object aimed at. The Sunday-law people would have us believe that all State Sunday laws are merely dead letters, and that all they want to do is to have a National Sunday law that will likewise be a dead letter. They would have us believe that they are working just for the fun of the thing, and that they don't expect their national law to be enforced. If they expect us to believe such an absurdity, they must give us credit for an extreme amount of gullibility.

What do they themselves say when they are pleading with Congress for a Sunday law? They say that they want a law that will make effective the laws which they already have. In his first hearing before the Senate Committee on Education and Labor, Mr. Crafts said: "The State has no power to stop the Nation's Sabbath breaking in its borders." That is just what Mr. Foster says. Read the last part of the paragraph quoted. He says that Connecticut has a Sunday law which is made of no account, because of the lack of a national Sunday law, which will stop the mails and inter-State commerce.

In the hearing before the Committee on Education and Labor, in December, Mrs. Bateham gave the following as a part of the basis of their claim for a national Sunday law:—

> "Nearly every State has its Sabbath laws, but the national Government has none, though greatly needed, since the question has become emphatically a national one, and the very perpetuity or loss of our national rest-day, the Christian Sabbath, seems to depend on its being protected by the Government from the encroachments of organized capital, and the re-inforcement of State laws by national.

> "It is in gross violation of nearly every State Sabbath law that railroads run their Sunday trains, yet these States are powerless to prevent it, since only Congress can control inter-State commerce."

There you have it again. The object of the required national Sunday laws is to breathe life into the too feeble State laws. And this is what Senator Blair said plainly, on the same occasion. After stating that the general Government takes advantage of the powers delegated to it by the States in the matter of the mail and inter-State commerce, to destroy the Sunday in the States, he said:—

> "To prevent this is the object of this legislation. That is all that is undertaken here. It is simply an act proposing to make efficient the Sunday-Rest laws of the States, and nothing else."

Yet in the face of these declarations, the National Reformers try to beguile us into supporting the Sunday-law movement, or at least into withholding opposition to it, by the statement that since State laws are largely a dead letter, this will be too; that they are trying merely to get another law which will be dead when it is enacted. "Surely in vain is the net spread in the sight of any bird."

Those who have read the article in last week's Sentinel, entitled, "Where Sunday Laws Hit," will conclude that State Sunday laws are not always dead letters. The Arkansas law was pretty active four years ago; what will it be with a national law back of it to make it "efficient"?
