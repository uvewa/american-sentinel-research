# "The Seventh and First Days" of the Week Are the Same.

Such is the startling head which appeared in the *Mailand Express,* of February 11, 1889. Under it was reported a meeting held at the West Fifty-first Street Presbyterian Church, on the preceding evening. The editor of the *Mail and Express* made an address at that meeting, a summary of which is given in the following words:—

Col. Elliott F. Shepard, president of the American Sabbath Union, also addressed the meeting in favor of keeping one-seventh part of time holy to the Lord God, and of unifying the time set apart for this purpose by all religious bodies.

The Jews had what they pleased to call the seventh day, and the Christians what they pleased to call the first day, and the Seventh-day Baptists what they knew to be the original hebdomadal of God's rest.

But how inaccurate and unreliable are all human calculations.

For instance, the Christian era did not commence to be the reckoning of time until the fourth century, when the monk Dionysius started it, and everybody now knows that he made a mistake of four years in fixing the year of the Lord's birth, so that really we are now living in 1893. That is only a sample of the way in which all mankind may be mistaken as to the days and years.

## The first is the seventh day.

Then, as to the seventh or first days; take three men in this city, let one of them remain here, let another start on Saturday to travel around the world eastward, and when he returns here he will have lost one day; that is, he will find that his seventh day has now synchronized with the first day of the week of the man who remained here; let another start westward on Sunday to do the same, and when he arrives back he will have gained a day, and his first day will have synchronized with the seventh day of the man who remained here; which shows that the man who stands still may correctly make his Sabbath either on the seventh or on the first day, or keep them both if he will. If these travelers start on the same day in their opposite journeys, as one gains a day, and the other loses a day on the calendar of the stationary man, then we have three sacred days coming together, which would synchronize with Saturday, Sunday, and Monday. By this process of travel, as first proposed, the seventh becomes the first day of the week, and the first day becomes the seventh! and this amalgamation of the days seems pointed out by revelation and history.

## THE FIRST SABBATH WAS GOD'S SEVENTH AND MAN'S FIRST DAY.

Thus, God's seventh day of rest after the creation was man's first day of existence, so that his first Sabbath of rest was his first day, although it was God's seventh day. And the apostles, evidently by divine direction and sanction, made the Christian Sabbath commemorate our Lord's rising from the dead on the first day of the week, thus apparently restoring the day to be the hebdomadal of God's resting after creation, and the day intended in the fourth commandment. But, however that is, it is impossible to say that we have correctly either the seventh or first days of the week in a direct, perfect chronology from the creation.

## ALL SHOULD KEEP SUNDAY.

So that the question of the particular day to be observed as a holy rest and worship day is very much one of convenience in the community. And it seems desirable that there should be a common consensus of observance of the day which will now best accommodate the largest number. In this country this day is Sunday, and therefore it would be wise for Jews and Seventh-day Baptists to unite with Christians in keeping Sunday, although it cannot be told certainly that it is not both the seventh and first days combined, or the seventh day alone, or the first day alone, or neither the seventh nor the first. It is the usual day of rest and worship, and therefore all ought to keep it as patriotic citizens wishing well to their kind.

We give this summary of Mr. Shepard's address entire, not because of its value, but that the reader may see into how great a dilemma the president of the American Sabbath Union has fallen. There is a jewel called "consistency," and a method in argument called "logic," which we venture to commend to the consideration of the editor of the *Mail and Express.* We do not wonder that he has fallen into this trouble, since men who strive to evade the plain statement of the Scriptures are sure to find themselves in positions which are both painful and ludicrous. Not many weeks since, in his opening address as President of the Sabbath Convention at Washington, Mr. Shepard said:—

> "The fourth commandment, 'Remember the Sabbath-day to keep it holy,' is actually in force in this city of Washington, in the city of New York, in New Orleans, San Francisco, Milwaukee—it is actually in force throughout the whole United States to-day.

> "Every man, woman, and child in our country is going to be judged by the fourth commandment."

Every student of history knows that the people to whom this commandment was given understood it as applying to a specific day, the seventh day of the week, and that they have kept that day with unbroken regularity from the time the commandment was given to the present. When Colonel Shepard has not a theological theory to propound, he must be aware of this fact, as well as of its associate fact, that all theories in theology concerning the observance of Sunday are based upon the assumption that Sunday is the *first day of the week.* The national organization, of which [108] he is president, exists for the following object:— "The object of this union is to preserve the Christian Sabbath as a day of rest and worship."

By the "Christian Sabbath" this union means a specific day of the week, the first,— Sunday. It is laboring earnestly for a national law, which shall compel all men to recognize this specific first day of the week as a day of rest and worship. All this is easily understood; there is no "amalgamation of days" when Colonel Shepard is defending Sunday, or is seeking legislation in its support. Nor is there any difficulty in any department of human experience in understanding the fact that Sunday is the first day of the week, and bears a specific relation to the seventh day of the week, which precedes it. Why, then, is it that this prominent Sabbath-reform advocate and editor tumbles so soon into the vortex of "amalgamated days"? Why is it that Sunday, and all things connected with it, have drifted so soon into an oblivion as dense as that which hides the sepulcher of Moses on Mount Nebo? How does it happen that a journalist who is astute enough to understand the mysteries of New York State politics, even during a presidential campaign, has fallen into such perversion of vision? Are there no calendars in the sanctum of the *Mail and Express,* not even an almanac? Has the strange notion that this year is not 1889 but 1893 wrought utter confusion in the brain of Colonel Shepard? What has so shaken up the end and the beginning of the week, as with a charge of dynamite, and left the American Sabbath Union, the *Mail and Express,* the Jews, the Seventh-day Baptists, and people in general, hunting amid the *debris* of "amalgamated days," trying in vain, with weary fingers and muddled brains, to decide whether Sunday is

> "The seventh and the first days combined, or the seventh day alone, or the first day alone, or neither the seventh nor the first"?

This is indeed a terrible tangle. It oppresses us with sad forebodings. How can Colonel Shepard tell when to stop those Fifth Avenue stages hereafter. In the midst of this mirage of "amalgamated days" he might chance to stop them on Saturday; this would too much rejoice the wicked Seventh-day Baptists. He might issue orders that would strike on Monday, and leave the unholy rumble of Sunday-crushing wheels to go on through all the day which hitherto people have supposed was the first day of the week; but no, there is no Sunday; it is swallowed up by the seventh day, or has fallen out altogether and gone—to—"amalgamation." • What an amalgamation is here, my countrymen! The Anglo-Saxon and African amalgamation problem grows pale compared with this state of things!! Whence does this trouble arise? We suppose the *Mail a**nd Express* is a total abstainer; but in the presence of Colonel Shepard's speech, we are forcibly reminded of the state of Robert Burns in "Death and Dr. Hornbook," wherein he says, speaking of the rising moon:—

> "To count her horns wi' a' my power

> I set mysel' ;
> But whether she had three or four
> I could na' tell."

Sunday, and Saturday, and Monday, caught in the swirl of Colonel Shepard's amalgamation crucible, seem to evade detection and identification, with even greater persistency than did the horns of the rising moon to the eyes of the unsteady poet. The real source of this difficulty is not far to seek. Speaking at Washington, Colonel Shepard declares that the fourth commandment is still binding upon all people. Thinking the matter over, he discovers that the fourth commandment has reference to a specific day of the week—the last one; and that by no system or logic, no statement of Scripture, no fact in history, can he transfer the commandment to any other day. Looking still more carefully, he finds that the week is the primeval, and the universal, time measure; that whatever changes have been made in the calendar have been made to harmonize the civil year with the solar year, and that these changes cannot in any way affect the order or identity of the week. Thinking still more carefully, he discovers that even if the pious monk made a mistake in the starting-point for the Christian era, and that if we are really living in 1893, and not in 1889, that fact does not touch the week. All these facts crowding in upon the mind of the editor of the *Mail and Express,* and showing him the inconsistency of claiming that the fourth commandment supports the observance of Sunday, have evidently demoralized his logic, as a midnight charge demoralizes a regiment of raw recruits. In the midst of this mental and theological demoralization, he was unfortunately called to speak at the meeting, as above reported, in which speech he has certainly demonstrated "how inaccurate and unreliable are all human calculations." Great art thou, O Consistency; and greater thou, O Logic; and terrible are the results when ye are both slain; strangled in the morass of "amalgamated days"!— "*Sabbaticus,*"* in New York Tribune.*
