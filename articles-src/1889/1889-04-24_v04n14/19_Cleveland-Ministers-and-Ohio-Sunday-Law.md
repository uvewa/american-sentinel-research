The ministers of Cleveland, Ohio, unite in asking the mayor of that city to enforce the law of Ohio, which reads as follows:—

> "Whoever, on the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday, participates in or exhibits to the public, with or without charge for admittance, in any building, room, ground, garden, or other place in this State, any theatrical or dramatic performance of any kind or description, or any equestrian or circus performance of jugglers, acrobats, rope dancing, sparring exhibitions, variety shows, negro minstrelsy, living statuary, ballooning, or any base-ball playing, or any tenpins, or other games of similar kind or kinds, or participates in keeping any low or disorderly house of resort, ... he or she shall, on complaint made within twenty days thereafter, be fined in any sum not exceeding $100, or be confined in the county jail not exceeding six months, or both, at the discretion of the court."

In other words, they want the State to put a premium on vice during the week, by declaring it wrong to keep open low and disorderly houses on Sunday.
