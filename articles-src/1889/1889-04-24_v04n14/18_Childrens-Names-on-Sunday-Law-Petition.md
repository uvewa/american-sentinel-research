Our correspondent from Kentucky, William Covert, informs us that when the friends of Sunday legislation were canvassing the city of Nashville, Tennessee, last fall, they recorded the names of the children in the Sunday-schools, upon their petition, asking for a Sunday law. His informant, a lady in Nashville, whose name and address he gives, says that after the Sunday-law people had worked the Sunday-schools they came to her house for the signature of her husband, herself, and her son. The son is ten years old, and was a member of one Sunday-school, where the names of the children were taken for the petition. If these names have not already been presented to Congress, they will doubtless appear there next fall, all duly certified to as being the names of persons "twenty-one years of age or more."
