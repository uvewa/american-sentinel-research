J. J. Dean, M. D., of Florida, says:—

> "Have been getting signers to the petitions against the Blair bills and find nine-tenths of the people decidedly against any change in our Constitution when they come to fully understand the subject."

A banker in Nebraska writes:—

> "Inclosed find draft, etc.; commence my subscription with the first weekly number issued. I am very much pleased with the Sentinel, and believe that its mission is a grand one. I believe quite a number of subscribers could be obtained here. About 400 signatures were obtained to the remonstrances against the Blair bills.

> "The town has been somewhat stirred over the agitation of the Sunday-Rest bill, and the Religious Amendment to the Constitution. Yours for the defense of American liberty.

A lady in Kansas writes:—

> "I find that the American Sentinel meets with much appreciation. I have taken 300 names against the Blair bills, and have left reading matter at almost every house."

E. J. Ross, of Rome, Mich., in renewing for the American Sentinel, signs himself, "Yours for the liberty our forefathers supposed they bequeathed to us."

The following are expressions of opinion from attorneys at law in various States: "I like your views on the Blair Sunday bill."

> "The subject that is now agitating the people is of vital importance."

> "I do not think that religion should be taught in the public schools."
> "I am opposed to any union of Church and State."
> "I am decidedly opposed to any instruction in Christianity in our free public-school system."

Mayor John B. Glascock, of this city, in speaking of the Blair bills, says that they are "an infringement upon the personal liberty of the people. Church and State should be kept as far apart as possible. Let our schools teach knowledge and not religion." [113]
