# What Is the Politics of the Sunday Movement?

I have presented the petitions in opposition to religious legislation in Indiana, Kentucky, and Tennessee, and I cannot see that there is any particular difference upon this subject between Democrats and Republicans. Prohibitionists have almost to a man refused to sign our petitions. A very large majority of both Democrats and Republicans sign them when the subject is plainly set before them. Where they refuse it is generally because of religious prejudice. The youth often want to sign, but our workers of course refuse to let them.

In the South we often find married ladies and mothers who are not 21 years old. These cannot sign the petitions because they are not old enough.

The House of Representatives in Indiana took a test vote to see how they stood on the subject of the Sunday-Rest bill. Most of the Republicans voted in favor of it; most of the Democrats against. The Lieutenant-Governor is a preacher and a Republican, and I think he led the Republicans to vote as they did. Yet the vote was not a strictly party vote. Some Democrats were in favor, and I understand some Republicans opposed. It was next tested in the Senate. Both Houses are strongly Democratic. The decision was against the Sunday bill.

The ministers of the Christian Alliance learned that the Legislature had decided against the bill, and they determined to work the members over and get them to vote in favor of it. We decided to head off the Alliance, and therefore telegraphed immediately for American Sentinels to give to every member of both Houses until they should be informed upon the subject.

The matter did not come up the second time. I suppose the Alliance thought it would not be best to try it over after the Sentinels were in the hands of the voters.

William Covert.
