# Illinois Sunday Legislation.

The "Brokoski Sunday Closing bill," introduced in the House in the Illinois Legislature, was tabled March 13 in the committee to which it was referred. Another bill, however, introduced by Mr. Cochennour, February 15, prohibiting the playing of base-ball on Sunday, is on the first reading in the House. There seems to be a feverish desire to get some kind of Sunday legislation. If it can't be an old straight-jacket law that will not allow even whistling on Sunday, they will accept anything, just so it is a Sunday law. Of course all they want Sunday laws for is to get a civil Sabbath. But the gentleman in speaking in favor of his bill before the House Judiciary Committee said that Sunday was made hideous in bis part of the State by boys playing base-ball, *"who ought to be at churchy* If it is only a *civil* Sunday that they want, why ought these boys to be at church in the place of playing ball? Would they not observe a *civil* Sunday if they quietly staid at home?

The statutes of Illinois already provide a fine of $25 for anyone who shall disturb either the peace of society or private families on Sunday. It seems to us that this is enough. If protection in worship and even private devotion was all that was wanted, the laws that we now have would be ample. In fact, our statutes are so framed that citizens of Illinois could be protected in religious worship on Sunday or any other day without any Sunday law at all. For our statutes provide that "whoever, by menace, profane swearing, vulgar language, or any disorderly conduct, interrupts or disturbs any assembly of people met for the worship of God, shall be fined [107] not exceeding $100. If boys play ball or anything else in such a way, or in such a place, as to interfere with religious meetings, this act is abundant to have the difficulty relieved. But if they are so far away that they will not necessarily annoy anyone on Sunday in their worship why have a law to stop them from playing ball, so that they might go to church? If boys are so poorly trained in the popular estimation of right as to play ball on Sunday, will a law simply stopping the game make the boys good Sunday-school scholars right off? No indeed! The average boy would be farther away from worship than he was before the law was passed and enforced upon him. In the place of inspiring a feeling of worship, it would make him disgusted with the whole system of Christianity. For he would associate the men who thus try to force religion upon him with the religion they profess, and he would revolt at the idea of being compelled to accept a religion that he either did not believe or else did not care to accept.

Let us cling to the old-fashioned gospel method of persuading men to come to Christ. We have learned by experience, as well as by the teaching of history, that this plan will work, because it is scriptural. But the process of compelling people by civil law to go to church and appear pious on Sunday, or on any other day, has always worked disastrously, because contrary to the divine rule. A. O. Tait.
