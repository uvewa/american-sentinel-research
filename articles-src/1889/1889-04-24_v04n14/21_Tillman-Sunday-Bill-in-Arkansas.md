When the Tillman Sunday bill was under discussion in the Arkansas Legislature, Senator Brickell "paid a high tribute to his venerable predecessor, the Hon. Robert H. Crockett, but [said] on the question, he was here to undo what his more brilliant and experienced predecessor had done." We think that it would be the part of wisdom for him to take some lessons from experience. His predecessor was more experienced, but he proposed in his inexperience to undo his work. Senator Crockett's work was to secure a cessation of one of the worst persecutions that has ever disgraced this country. Senator Brickell, like Senator Tillman, proposes to revive that persecution. Where did such men get their ideas of liberty? One would naturally think that it was in Russia. Yet in all the ranks of the National Reform Association, and the American Sabbath Union, and the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, not a voice is heard in disfavor of such injustice.
