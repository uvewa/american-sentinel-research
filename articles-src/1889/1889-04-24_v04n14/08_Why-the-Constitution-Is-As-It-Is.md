# Why the Constitution Is As It Is.

The second argument advanced by the advocates of constitutional amendment as stated, viz., that the omission to recognize God and Jesus Christ in the Constitution by express declaration, originally, was influenced by a spirit of infidelity then prevailing, I think must be denied. It is perhaps true that at the period of the adoption of the Constitution there was greater tendency toward infidelity than now. But it must appear manifest, after the most casual review of our colonial history, that there were other and very different reasons which were influential with the wise founders of our Constitution than the influence of infidelity, or any prevailing tendency toward irréligion.

There can be no better refutation of the claim that the omission stated was influenced by infidelity or irreligion, than the statement of the historical truth that the people of the American colonies were essentially a Christian people, so much so that it would seem impossible that they should have agreed to and ratified a National Constitution from which had been purposely omitted any recognition of God or religion, and such omission had been demanded or influenced by a prevailing spirit of infidelity.

The real cause of the omission is not difficult to discover. The history of the colonies is full of controversy in matters of religion, and of persecution between the different religious sects. The Puritans of New England, who had come to these shores singing their praises and thanksgivings for their deliverance from religious persecution, became themselves persecutors and intolerant. Religious tests were established in the Colonies, and men were proscribed by the colonial laws, both in [110] their religious beliefs and forms of worship. Eminent divines were prosecuted, persecuted, and banished for preaching the gospel contrary to the laws of the colony. During this period one had better be a thief in some of the colonies than a Quaker. Protestant persecuted Protestant, and all joined in the persecution of the Catholics. The laws were based upon the theory of the right of the State to control views, conduct, and beliefs in matters of religion as well as their conduct in civil affairs. And such laws became and long continued oppressive in the extreme, and grievously burdensome in their exactions for the support of the church and their assumed control over the conscience.

The blue laws of New Haven Colony, commonly called the blue laws of Connecticut, furnish an illustration of the ideas and practices in civil government as held and practiced in that time. I believe the historical account of these laws, as now commonly accepted, is, that the New Haven Colony had no code of laws at all; but upon the formation of the colony the founders agreed that the Bible should be their law and guide in all their affairs. Under this system of government the magistrate became the expounder of the law, as well as the administrator of it. For any act the citizen might do he was liable to arrest, and if the magistrate determined that the act was not in harmony with the teachings of the Bible, as *he* interpreted it, the offender was punished. These blue laws, so called, were not therefore laws in a proper sense at all, but were simply the records of trials, determinations, and convictions by the civil magistrates. Roger Williams, one of the most devout and eminent men of his time, and who became the founder of the State of Rhode Island, was cast upon that shore in a storm while he was in banishment from Connecticut for the offense of preaching the gospel as he understood the truth of the gospel to be, and he became one of the foremost and ablest champions and advocates of religious liberty.

The continued agitation by the advocates of full and complete liberty of conscience, who were among the ablest men of that age, the continued persecution, and oppressive character of the laws, had the effect in time to change the oppressive character of the laws and to secure in the charters of new colonies provisions guaranteeing full liberty of conscience.

In 1779, when the convention completed the work of forming our National Constitution, the people were profoundly impressed with the importance of a strong National Government. This necessity was more plainly manifest because of the serious delays which had been encountered in carrying on a government by the consent and independent action of the States during the period of the revolution, and because of the dangers which had appeared in their present imperfect forms of government. There was a manifest determination among the wise and great men who were privileged to give to their posterity our great National Constitution, to meet upon a plane above selfish or local consideration, and, by mutual concession, in whatever of local or sectional prejudice might be involved, to form a stable and permanent Government, sufficient for the present and the great future they foresaw, and especially to avoid the dangers and evils which their experience in colonial government and confederation of States had given them to see. It would be strange indeed if this body of remarkable men, actuated by such purposes, remembering vividly the struggles of the people for civil liberty, remembering as well and as vividly the persecutions among Christians under the earlier Governments, and the struggle for liberty of conscience, should not have given the most careful thought and consideration as to the proper relation of the Church and State, and as to the proper functions of government as related to matters of religion and as affecting the conscience.

I think it cannot be doubted that the founders of our Constitution, because of these conditions which had existed among the people of the Colonies and the States resulting from the union of the Church and State, the oppression the system brought upon the people, the persecution that it fostered, and because of the spirit of religious liberty which then not only strongly prevailed, but was suspicious, watchful, and active, deemed it wise to omit everything from the instrument which could by any possibility give color to any claim of right or power in civil Government to control the conscience, and to plainly mark the lines of power in the Government formed upon the broad theory that in all matters of religion men are accountable only to God, and that it is the province of civil Government to deal only with men’s civil and national affairs. I am strongly impressed with the belief that there is no higher evidence of the superior wisdom and statesmanship of the founders of the American Constitution, than appears in their manifest recognition of this broad and comprehensive theory of civil government.

It may be further said that the wisdom of this theory is strongly attested by the fact that since the adoption of our Constitution, which has now covered a century of time, all religious sects existing among our people, and the people representing all shades of opinion concerning religion, have dwelt together in harmony and peace under the Government; and the church, having thrown off all civil interference by the State, and declined all civil aids, has gone steadily forward in its great work, and occupies to-day a position of greater strength and power, nearer to the hearts and affections of the people, and nearer a state of Christian unity, than ever before.—*Hon.
