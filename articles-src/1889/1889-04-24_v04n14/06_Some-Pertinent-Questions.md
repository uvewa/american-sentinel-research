# Some Pertinent Questions.

The *Christian Cynosure* of March 28 contains some very pointed questions addressed to Mr. Gault, which are good enough to be reproduced. We are glad that the *Cynosure’s* readers have the privilege of having their mind stirred up by such pertinent questions, but we are sorry that they cannot read a reply by Mr. Gault. However, the questions are so aptly put that he must be a dull scholar who cannot answer them for himself. The questions are by W. W. Ames, Menomonee, Wis. Here they are:—

Brother Gault says substantially that God gave to the republic of Israel a form of judiciary like the Supreme Court of the United States. Was Israel a republic? I had always supposed that the government of Israel was a theocracy. Had the people anything to do by way of electing Moses as their leader? Was he not expressly appointed by Jehovah? Did the thousands and hundreds, the fifties and the tens, nominate the judges, and ask Moses to confirm them? or did he nominate them and ask the people to confirm them? Was Moses a President? Was there a legislative body, chosen by the people, enacting laws for his signature?

Admitting that the advice of Jethro to Moses to appoint judges over the people was of God, was it intended as the institution of a Supreme Court? Were they not appointed simply as subordinate assistants to Moses? Were they not to bring all the great matters to Moses? and was not he to bring them to God? In a word, was not the arrangement made simply to save the time and strength of Moses, who was the mouth-piece for God in all matters too hard for them?

How shall we make the Supreme Court to consist wholly of learned Christian lawyers and doctors of divinity? Must it not be, if at all, by so Christianizing public sentiment that there shall be a great majority of Christian men in the Senate? Will it not even then be necessary to have an amendment to the Constitution making it necessary that the President and Vice-President shall be Christians, or professedly such? And then would the people be sure of a thoroughly Christian Supreme Court without an amendment prescribing such a make-up of that body? Would there not be many men who would not scruple to profess Christianity just for the sake of political preferment? What is the prospect of such amendments being submitted to the people? And what is the prospect of the people voting for them when submitted? Does not this point to the doubling and twisting of Church and State into a very hard knot?

If, as Brother Gault says, civil penalties are never to be inflicted for the violation of a mere church law, unless it also involves the violation of a civil law, what is the object of compulsory Sunday laws, if it is not to give the State power to punish infractions of ecclesiastical law?

If the precise day of the Sabbath is “moral positive,” and not “moral natural,” a distinction nowhere hinted at in God’s word, do not Brother Gault and others make this distinction in order to convey to us the idea that the Sabbath obligation is eternal in its nature, the same as that to love God and each other? If the Sabbath itself is moral in its nature, and eternally binding, why do we speak of the precise day as “positive,” if it is not because God prescribed the day, or rather the precise day? Why did God prescribe the precise day, if men knew what day to keep without being told by him? Would it have been either logical or reverential or deferential for Moses to have instructed the people that the precise day was not of the essence of the commandment? If there is no express precept for keeping the first day of the week as the Sabbath (and Dr. Leonard Woods, a former great light of Andover Theological Seminary, says there is none), does it not savor of the most vaulting arrogance to meddle with and change that part of the Sabbath commandment which it was necessary to prescribe, and did prescribe, giving special reasons therefor, and without hint that it might ever be changed? If it would have been a gross impertinence and sin for Moses to change the day without express precept, and to have taught that the precise day was not of the essence of the command, can we be certain that it is right to do the same thing?

If the Blair Sunday-Rest bill passes without exemption in favor of seventh-day keepers, will not that which was, beyond cavil, the habitual practice of the Saviour, be declared a crime? Are not the advocates of the bill urging Congress to make that declaration? In the language of another, “Can that which Christ habitually practiced during his earthly life, ever be made a crime?” Shall we ask Congress to make that which was Christ’s habitual practice, punishable with fines or imprisonment or both? Because we are pleased to denominate the “precise day” as positive, is there therefore no moral element in it? If a man would feel his paternal dignity wounded by a child taking such liberty with his commands, and changing the order of his requirement without special direction or permission, are we safe in concluding that God is not displeased with such treatment of the Sabbath? Is there no moral element inhering in obedience to a [109] positive command of God? If so, can we be certain that the precise day is destitute of a moral element, and is not the essence of the institution? Did not God give a reason for the *precise day* as well as for the institution? Would not the significance of the institution be lost without designation of the precise day?

If the decree of Constantine in A. d. 321, while yet a pagan Roman emperor, changing the observance of the weekly rest from the seventh day of the week to “the venerable day of the sun,” was not “thinking to change times and laws,” will you be so kind as to tell what is?
