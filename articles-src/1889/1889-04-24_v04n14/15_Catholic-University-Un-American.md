*America* well says that the new Roman Catholic University in Washington, which is soon to begin educating American young men, will probably prove itself as un-American in all the ideas and methods found within its walls, as anything could well be. Bishop Kane is picking up Italian professors to man the new university, and it will be, to all intents and purposes, a foreign institution of learning planted on American soil, and reeking with the dogmas of Rome.
