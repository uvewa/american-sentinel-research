The New Jersey Conference of the M. E. Church, numbering over two hundred ministers, at a recent session in Salem, New Jersey, unanimously indorsed the movement in behalf of a national Sunday-Rest law in the Government service, and also heartily commended the various publications of the American Sabbath Union. This commendation of course included the request, contained in the "Monthly Document" for December, that the strength of the Sunday-law petition be duplicated by securing the individual signatures of those who had previously been counted for it in Massachusetts.
