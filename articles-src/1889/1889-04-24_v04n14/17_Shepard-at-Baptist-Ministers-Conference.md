The Baptist Ministers' Conference in New York was addressed recently by Col. Elliott F. Shepard, who, after giving the opinion of how Sunday should be observed, said:—

> "Now it may be that someone will say, 'Very well, why don't you go to work and stop every street railway in the city and put your opinions in effect.' I do not affect to be the whole community. I have not got the legislative power of this State nor of this country under my control. I can only do humbly what little I am able to, and with the blessing of God I intend to do that."

The only reason why he does not put *his opinions* into effect, and force everybody to act on Sunday just as he thinks they ought to, is that he hasn't the power. But the American Sabbath Union, of which he is president, is seeking to get the legislative power under its control, and then we may be sure that this country will be modeled after the opinions of the leaders of that association. It will then be a crime for a man to have an opinion of his own.
