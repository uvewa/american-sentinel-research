# Religion and the Constitution.

In 1874 a petition was presented to Congress, asking for an acknowledgment of God in the Constitution. The petition was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary, which made the following report, February 18:—

> *"The Committee on the Judiciary, to whom was referred the petition of E. G. Goulet and others, asking Congress for 'an acknowledgment of Almighty God and the Christian religion' in the Constitution of the United States, having considered the matter referred to them, respectfully pray leave to report:*

> "That, upon examination even of the meager debates by the fathers of the Republic in the convention which framed the Constitution, they find that the subject of this memorial was most fully and carefully considered, and then, in that Convention, decided, after grave deliberation, to which the subject was entitled, that, as this country, the foundation of whose government they were then laying, was to be the home of the oppressed of all nations of the earth, whether Christian or pagan, and in full realization of the dangers which the union between Church and State had imposed upon so many nations of the Old World, with great unanimity, that it was inexpedient to put anything into the Constitution or frame of government which might be construed to be a reference to any religious creed or doctrine.
> "And they further find that this decision was accepted by our Christian fathers with such great unanimity that in the amendments which were afterward proposed in order to make the Constitution more acceptable to the Nation, none has ever been proposed to the States by which this wise determination of the fathers has been attempted to be changed. Wherefore, your committee report that it is inexpedient to legislate upon the subject of the above memorial, and ask that they be discharged from the further consideration thereof, and that this report, together with the petition, be laid upon the table."

In this report the exact truth is told, namely, that the fathers of the republic carefully considered the matter of religion and the Constitution, and kept them separate for good reason. That religion was not left out of the Constitution by accident, is evident from the fact that the first amendment was added almost immediately after the adoption of the Constitution.
