# What Is the Politics of the Sunday Movement?

I have presented the petitions in opposition to religious legislation in Indiana, Kentucky, and Tennessee, and I cannot see that there is any particular difference upon this subject between Democrats and Republicans. Prohibitionists have almost to a man refused to sign our petitions. A very large majority of both Democrats and Republicans sign them when the subject is plainly set before them. Where they refuse it is generally because of religious prejudice. The youth often want to sign, but our workers of course refuse to let them.

In the South we often find married ladies and mothers who are not 21 years old. These cannot sign the petitions because they are not old enough.

The House of Representatives in Indiana took a test vote to see how they stood on the subject of the Sunday-Rest bill. Most of the Republicans voted in favor of it; most of the Democrats against. The Lieutenant-Governor is a preacher and a Republican, and I think he led the Republicans to vote as they did. Yet the vote was not a strictly party vote. Some Democrats were in favor, and I understand some Republicans opposed. It was next tested in the Senate. Both Houses are strongly Democratic. The decision was against the Sunday bill.

The ministers of the Christian Alliance learned that the Legislature had decided against the bill, and they determined to work the members over and get them to vote in favor of it. We decided to head off the Alliance, and therefore telegraphed immediately for American Sentinels to give to every member of both Houses until they should be informed upon the subject.

The matter did not come up the second time. I suppose the Alliance thought it would not be best to try it over after the Sentinels were in the hands of the voters.

William Covert.

*America* well says that the new Roman Catholic University in Washington, which is soon to begin educating American young men, will probably prove itself as un-American in all the ideas and methods found within its walls, as anything could well be. Bishop Kane is picking up Italian professors to man the new university, and it will be, to all intents and purposes, a foreign institution of learning planted on American soil, and reeking with the dogmas of Rome. [111-112]

No papers are sent by the publishers of the American Sentinel to people who have not subscribed for it. If the Sentinel comes to one who has not subscribed for it, he may know that it is sent him by some friend, and that he will not be called upon by the publishers to pay for the same.

The Baptist Ministers’ Conference in New York was addressed recently by Col. Elliott F. Shepard, who, after giving the opinion of how Sunday should be observed, said:—

> “Now it may be that someone will say, ‘Very well, why don’t you go to work and stop every street railway in the city and put your opinions in effect.’ I do not affect to be the whole community. I have not got the legislative power of this State nor of this country under my control. I can only do humbly what little I am able to, and with the blessing of God I intend to do that.”

The only reason why he does not put *his opinions* into effect, and force everybody to act on Sunday just as he thinks they ought to, is that he hasn’t the power. But the American Sabbath Union, of which he is president, is seeking to get the legislative power under its control, and then we may be sure that this country will be modeled after the opinions of the leaders of that association. It will then be a crime for a man to have an opinion of his own.

Our correspondent from Kentucky, William Covert, informs us that when the friends of Sunday legislation were canvassing the city of Nashville, Tennessee, last fall, they recorded the names of the children in the Sunday-schools, upon their petition, asking for a Sunday law. His informant, a lady in Nashville, whose name and address he gives, says that after the Sunday-law people had worked the Sunday-schools they came to her house for the signature of her husband, herself, and her son. The son is ten years old, and was a member of one Sunday-school, where the names of the children were taken for the petition. If these names have not already been presented to Congress, they will doubtless appear there next fall, all duly certified to as being the names of persons “twenty-one years of age or more.”

The ministers of Cleveland, Ohio, unite in asking the mayor of that city to enforce the law of Ohio, which reads as follows:—

> “Whoever, on the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday, participates in or exhibits to the public, with or without charge for admittance, in any building, room, ground, garden, or other place in this State, any theatrical or dramatic performance of any kind or description, or any equestrian or circus performance of jugglers, acrobats, rope dancing, sparring exhibitions, variety shows, negro minstrelsy, living statuary, ballooning, or any base-ball playing, or any tenpins, or other games of similar kind or kinds, or participates in keeping any low or disorderly house of resort, ... he or she shall, on complaint made within twenty days thereafter, be fined in any sum not exceeding $100, or be confined in the county jail not exceeding six months, or both, at the discretion of the court.”

In other words, they want the State to put a premium on vice during the week, by declaring it wrong to keep open low and disorderly houses on Sunday.

Monday evening, March 25, The Boston District Committee of the American Sabbath Union was appointed, in the parlors of Joseph Cook, Mr. Crafts being present and officiating. The work of the committee is to organize State, county, and local Sunday associations in the New England States, except Connecticut. It consists of “all members of the American Sabbath Union in the territory indicated—namely, the Hon. Alden Speare, vice-president of Massachusetts, and the Rev. Daniel Dorchester, D. D., both of Boston, and both appointed to membership by the Methodist General Conference; the Rev. A. J. Gordon, D. D., Baptist vice-president, and Mr. W. N. Hartshorn, both of Boston, and the Rev. H. Hinckley, of Lynn, three of the representative members appointed by the Baptists; Joseph Cook, the Rev. H. M. Dexter, D. D., the Rev. Arthur Little, D. D., the Rev. William C. Wood, all of Boston, and all honorary members with full privileges; the Hon. Nelson Dingley, M. C. Lewiston, vice-president for Maine; Mr. J. G. Lane, Manchester, vice-president for New Hampshire; the Hon. Franklin Fairbanks, vice-president for Vermont.

> “This committee added to itself the Rev. Dr. Hazen, and the persons not already mentioned whose names appear below in another connection. This District Committee elected for its chairman the Rev. David H. Ela, D. D.; for vice-chairman, the Rev. J. B. Dunn, D. D.; for district secretary, the Rev. Arthur Little, D. D. The District Committee then proceeded to organize a Boston Sabbath Committee, which is to supplement and co-operate with the work of the Law and Order League. On the committee were appointed the Rev. Arthur Little, D. D., the Rev. C. A. Bickford, editor of the *Morning Star,* the Rev. Charles Parkhurst, editor of *Zion’s Herald,* the Rev. L. B. Bates, D. D., the Rev. William C. Wood, the Rev. A. H. Plumb, D. D., the Rev. A. J. Gordon, D. D., Mr. W. N. Hartshorn, the Hon. Alden Spears, the Rev. Daniel Dorchester, D. D., the Rev. Dr. Rogers, the Rev. J. H. Ross, Mr. H. M. Moore, Mr. L. Edwin Dudley, the Rev. D. Gregg, D. D., Hon. B. B. Johnson, the Rev. Frederick Boyles Allen, the Rev. William Graham, D. D., the Rev. A. P. Foster, D. D., and the Rev. D. H. Ela, D. D.”

This list has such a “reverend” appearance that many people will be in danger of supposing that the whole movement is a religious affair. Where are the “workingmen” with whom the thing is said to have originated?

When the Tillman Sunday bill was under discussion in the Arkansas Legislature, Senator Brickell “paid a high tribute to his venerable predecessor, the Hon. Robert H. Crockett, but [said] on the question, he was here to undo what his more brilliant and experienced predecessor had done.” We think that it would be the part of wisdom for him to take some lessons from experience. His predecessor was more experienced, but he proposed in his inexperience to undo his work. Senator Crockett’s work was to secure a cessation of one of the worst persecutions that has ever disgraced this country. Senator Brickell, like Senator Tillman, proposes to revive that persecution. Where did such men get their ideas of liberty? One would naturally think that it was in Russia. Yet in all the ranks of the National Reform Association, and the American Sabbath Union, and the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union, not a voice is heard in disfavor of such injustice.

J. J. Dean, M. D., of Florida, says:—

> “Have been getting signers to the petitions against the Blair bills and find nine-tenths of the people decidedly against any change in our Constitution when they come to fully understand the subject.”

A banker in Nebraska writes:—

> “Inclosed find draft, etc.; commence my subscription with the first weekly number issued. I am very much pleased with the Sentinel, and believe that its mission is a grand one. I believe quite a number of subscribers could be obtained here. About 400 signatures were obtained to the remonstrance against the Blair bills.

> “The town has been somewhat stirred over the agitation of the Sunday-Rest bill, and the Religious Amendment to the Constitution. Yours for the defense of American liberty.
A lady in Kansas writes:—

> “I find that the American Sentinel meets with much appreciation. I have taken 300 names against the Blair bills, and have left reading matter at almost every house.”

E. J. Ross, of Rome, Mich., in renewing for the American Sentinel, signs himself, “Yours for the liberty our forefathers supposed they bequeathed to us.”

The following are expressions of opinion from attorneys at law in various States: “I like your views on the Blair Sunday bill.”

> “The subject that is now agitating the people is of vital importance.”

> “I do not think that religion should be taught in the public schools.”
> “I am opposed to any union of Church and State.”
> “I am decidedly opposed to any instruction in Christianity in our free public-school system.”
Mayor John R. Glascock, of this city, in speaking of the Blair bills, says that they are “an infringement upon the personal liberty of the people. Church and State should be kept as far apart as possible. Let our schools teach knowledge and not religion.” [113]
