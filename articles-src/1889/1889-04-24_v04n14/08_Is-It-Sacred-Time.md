# Is It Sacred Time?

One of the subscribers of the *Morning Times *of Oakland has written it a letter, stating that his only objection to the paper is that it publishes a Sunday edition, thus necessitating secular labor on sacred time. The *Times,* after informing its correspondent that the bulk of the labor on a Sunday-morning newspaper is completed before Saturday at midnight, a fact familiar to everybody who knows anything about newspapers, goes on to make some telling points, which we should be pleased to see answered, if they are answerable. Accordingly, we present to our readers a portion of the article:—

> "But our Christian friends say that we are transgressing divine law by not resting our printing press on Sunday. With that we must respectfully, but firmly, take issue. . . .We declare that all Sabbath legislation from the time of Constantine to the present has been purely human—not divine."

> "As to the main objection, that the Sunday newspaper requires secular labor on sacred time, if it must be suppressed on that account, then all the sails on the sea, all the furnaces of the land, all the lines of travel, must close up on Sunday for the same reason. But is Sunday *sacred* time?
> "We would ask our Christian friend where and when did Christ (whom he will admit has all authority in Heaven and on earth in religious matters) ever declare the first day of the week to be sacred time? We cannot find it on record, nor can we find that Christ ever authorized anyone else to declare it sacred time.
> "We cannot find that Christ ever called the first day of the week a Sabbath, much less *the* Sabbath, nor ever, by word or deed, authorized anyone else to do so.
> "We cannot find that he ever kept the first day of the week as a Sabbath—that is, a rest-day—nor did he ask anyone else to do so.
> "We cannot find where the apostles of Christ, who represented him, ever so much as hinted that the first day of the week was to be observed as a Sabbath. Paul, who made allusion to the observance of days, declared that no man should judge his brother in such matters, and that every man should be fully persuaded in his own mind.
> "If divine wisdom had intended the first day of the week to be observed as a rest day, as a 'holy Sabbath-day,' surely there would have been given, as in the case of the Sabbath of the Jews, a law governing the observance of the day, that it might not be desecrated by such unholy passions and purposes as lead to the commission of more crimes on Sunday than on all the other days of the week.
> "Now if the Sunday morning paper keeps people from the church, it is because the paper has more drawing power than the pulpit, and the fault is with the pulpit, not with the paper. We do not claim that the contents of the Sunday morning paper are entirely wholesome or purifying, but this our Christian friend should give us aid to regulate, not annihilate, for it is possible to accomplish the former, but the latter can never be done."

Can any of the readers of the Sentinel find any of these things which the *Times* professes itself unable to find, and which it avers do not exist? If those who are laboring so zealously for Sunday laws cannot find this divine authority, will they be candid enough to say so? If they will, it will materially narrow down the controversy. We do not mean that the absence of Scripture authority for Sunday observance makes Sunday legislation any less objectionable, or that if they could find any such authority they would be justified in Sunday legislation; for we have demonstrated time and again that the State has no right to legislate concerning religious matters. But if our Sunday friends will admit that there is nowhere in the Bible any commandment for the observance of Sunday, it will then be patent to everyone that the only reason why Sunday laws are asked for is that certain ones want to set the fashion for the world, and to compel the world to follow the fashion.
