A man cannot publish a Sunday newspaper in Arkansas without rendering himself liable to imprisonment, or the payment of a fine. Such is the law. The use of the shot-gun is, however, still fashionable. It was in this State that the Seventh-day Baptists were so shamefully persecuted a few years ago, for insisting upon the right, under the Constitution, of working six days in the week, and resting on the only day declared in the Bible to be sacred time. It is a little surprising that the National Reform Association does not remove its headquarters to Arkansas.—*Denison Texas Gazetteer.*
