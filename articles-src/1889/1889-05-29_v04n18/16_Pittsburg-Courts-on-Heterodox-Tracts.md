The *Alta California* says that the local courts of Pittsburg, Penn., have ruled that it is disorderly conduct to distribute heterodox tracts on the streets. We should like to know what judge decides what tracts are orthodox and what are heterodox. If the Pope ever comes to America we know where he will find a congenial home. He could no doubt find employment for his leisure hours in assisting the local courts of Pittsburg.
