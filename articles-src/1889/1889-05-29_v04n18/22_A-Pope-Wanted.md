Some papers are very indignant over the 'fact that Mr. Bennet has invaded London with his *Herald,* and is actually selling it on Sunday, thus destroying the rest of the people, because the paper is sold by the thousands. We have yet to learn that any efforts have been made to compel people to buy the paper, or that anybody has bought a copy who did not want one, therefore we cannot tell just where the invasion of Sunday rest has come in. But the following from the London *Christian* shows what idea some who would fain be called Christians have of the way to propagate Christianity:—

> "In the days of Nehemiah men of Tyre brought fish and all manner of ware, and sold on the Sabbath to men of Judah and in Jerusalem; but that wise governor put a summary stop to their operations, and set his servants at the gates, that there should no burden be brought in on the Sabbath-day. We need a Nehemiah in like manner to prevent this man of America bringing such a Sabbath-day burden into our country."

What they want is a Pope.
