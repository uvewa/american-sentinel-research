We have already announced the debate between Mr. Crafts and A. T. Jones, to be held June 12, 13, 14. This discussion will without doubt be one of great interest, and will be worth hearing. Many people will doubtless travel quite a distance to be present; but still only a few of those who are interested in the matter can hear the discussion. But we are resolved that they shall lose nothing of it except the tones and gestures of the speakers, and have made arrangements to have all the speeches reported stenographically, so that the next Sentinel that appears after the debate will have the first installment of it. If possible, we shall publish the whole of one evening's session in one paper, so that no injustice may be done to either party. The numbers of the Sentinel that contain the matter will be of special interest to everybody, friends of Sunday legislation as well as opposers —inasmuch as both sides will be presented impartially. We cannot at present tell just what numbers will contain the discussion, but those who wish extra copies to distribute can send in their orders just the same. State that you want the numbers containing the discussion.
