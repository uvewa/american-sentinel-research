# The Principles of the Christian Religion.

What are they? The amendment to the Constitution proposed by Senator Blair calls for the teaching of the principles of the Christian religion in the public schools. It also provides that no public money shall be appropriated to any school in which “the doctrines, tenets, belief, ceremonials, or observances peculiar to any sect, denomination, organization, or society, being, or claiming to be, religious in its character,” are taught.

Are not the principles of the Christian religion to be found, then, in all the controverted doctrines of the popular churches of the land? The reply is, “They are to be found only in the doctrines in which they are all agreed.” But on what are they all agreed? What principle or doctrine of Christianity is not denied by some of them? Is it all simmered down to the keeping of Sunday, “the wild, solar holiday of all pagan times”? If so, the Sunday-Rest bill is all that is needed as a guide. R. F. Cottrell.

The Denton (Texas) *Chronicle* of April 20 contains a screed on Sunday legislation, by a lady who signs herself Jenny Bland Beauchamp, in which she shows her ignorance of the question by the statement that “two hundred and forty thousand Knights of Labor and Associated Engineers signed the petition” for the passage of a Sunday law. That is a bigger claim than even Mr. Crafts ever made. If any more than two Knights of Labor ever signed the petition it has had a decided boom of late. [143-144]

Note.—No papers are sent by the publishers of the American Sentinel to people who have not subscribed for it. If the Sentinel comes to one who has not subscribed for it, he may know that it is sent him by some friend, and that he will not be called upon by the publishers to pay for the same.

The *Alta California* says that the local courts of Pittsburg, Penn., have ruled that it is disorderly conduct to distribute heterodox tracts on the streets. We should like to know what judge decides what tracts are orthodox and what are heterodox. If the Pope ever comes to America we know where he will find a congenial home. He could no doubt find employment for his leisure hours in assisting the local courts of Pittsburg.

The ubiquitous field secretary of the American Sunday Union—Mr. Crafts—is nothing if not refined in his language. In a recent speech in New York he said that his Sunday-law movement is opposed only by “a little insignificant set of hair-brained, woolly-headed fanatics, of about one hundred men.” Well, well! If that is all the opposition Mr. Crafts finds, we should think he would stay at home and take his ease, and let his religio-political machine run itself. He must be traveling about the country because he likes change of scenery.

We have already announced the debate between Mr. Crafts and A. T. Jones, to be held June 12, 13, 14. This discussion will without doubt be one of great interest, and will be worth hearing. Many people will doubtless travel quite a distance to be present; but still only a few of those who are interested in the matter can hear the discussion. But we are resolved that they shall lose nothing of it except the tones and gestures of the speakers, and have made arrangements to have all the speeches reported stenographically, so that the next Sentinel that appears after the debate will have the first installment of it. If possible, we shall publish the whole of one evening’s session in one paper, so that no injustice may be done to either party. The numbers of the Sentinel that contain the matter wi11 be of special interest to everybody, friends of Sunday legislation as well as opposers —inasmuch as both sides will be presented impartially. We cannot at present tell just what numbers will contain the discussion, but those who wish extra copies to distribute can send in their orders just the same. State that you want the numbers containing the discussion.

The *Christian Union* is often considerably confused in its theology and its views of National polity, but when it does get on the right track for a while its utterances are as good as those of any other paper that speaks truth. In its issue of May 2 it has “A Centennial Homily,” in which it gives expression to some weak thoughts and some good ones, and among the latter are the following:—

> “The church is a corporation of men and women organized for certain purposes, which, whether wholly good (as the church people claim) or wholly bad (as the infidel pamphleteer claims), or partially good and partially bad, are certainly, on the one hand, innocent, and therefore entitled to the protection of the State, and, on the other, non-political and therefore not entitled to any partnership with it. We would have the State appropriate no moneys to institutions under church control; we would have it enter into no entangling alliances with church or clergy in the work of education; we would have it recognize no religious tests; we should be glad to have it abolish all oaths, and punish false affirmation with the penalties now visited on perjury; we would have it enforce no religious observances, except as such enforcement is necessary to protect the religious rights of the individual—no Sunday laws, for example, except to protect the individual’s right to his Sabbatical rest.”

The National Reform Association does not receive much aid and comfort from the St. Louis *Christian Advocate*, although it believes in National Reform principles. In a recent issue it spoke as follows of the Pittsburg Convention, which was then in session:—

> “We have closely watched conventions, conferences, and general meetings of this kind, and are free to say that they have not, as a general thing, been promotive of much good to the great body of the people. In many cases it was evident that the zeal of the leaders was far in advance of their discretion, and intelligent, sober-minded men were rather turned against than for that which they advocated. We must, however, be careful what we say about such proceedings, or, rather, about the spirit which prompts them, as the principal actors are usually of the class that not only think themselves right, but are exceedingly sensitive and impatient of anything and everything like contradiction or opposition.”

This is a very just estimate of the men who run the National Reform machine. The American Sentinel is fully conscious of the fact that they are exceedingly “impatient of anything and everything like contradiction or opposition,” yet it calls on all its readers to bear witness that it has endeavored faithfully to do its duty. We would that we had less reason for opposing them.
