The New York *World* says:—

> "The fact that the restriction of Sunday trains on the New York Central Road to business only which will not bear delay, is to be accompanied by corresponding reduction of pay, robs the change of all attractiveness to the employés concerned. Similarly the movement to persuade the street-car companies to reduce the Sunday transportation service will prove unpopular with the men when it is known that it means a diminished opportunity to earn money. It will scarcely be contended that seven days' pay can be regularly given for six days' work, and this appears to be a necessary condition to bring the philanthropists and those whom they desire to benefit together on the same ground."

That shows clearly the full extent of the workingmen's desire for a Sunday law. If those who work on Sundays could get the same wages for six days' work that they now do for seven, they would very naturally like to have Sunday work stopped. So they would like to have work stopped every day in the week, if they could get as much money by lying idle as they now get by working. As we have often stated, money, and not conscience, rules in this matter. If a man is conscientious in regard to Sunday observance, he will not work on Sunday, and nobody can compel him to, law or no law. If he is not conscientious as to Sunday observance, and chooses to work on that day, nobody has any right to interfere and say that he must rest. To do so would be fully as great an infringement of his liberty as it would be to compel him to work on Sunday if he didn't want to. The Sunday-law people talk against monopolies, yet they propose to build up the greatest monopoly this country has ever seen.
