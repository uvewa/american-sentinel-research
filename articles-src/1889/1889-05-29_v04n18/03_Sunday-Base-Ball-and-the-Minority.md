The *Pearl of Days* says that "nearly nine thousand persons witnessed the Sunday base-ball game at Ridgewood, L. I., on Sunday, April 14." And so it is everywhere. It is an undeniable fact that the majority of people in the United States do not regard Sunday religiously. Therefore the attempt of the American Sabbath Union to enforce the religious observance of the day is an attempt on the part of the minority to override the will of the majority. Such people have no right to apply the word American to themselves.
