The ubiquitous field secretary of the American Sunday Union—Mr. Crafts—is nothing if not refined in his language. In a recent speech in New York he said that his Sunday-law movement is opposed only by "a little insignificant set of hair-brained, woolly-headed fanatics, of about one hundred men." Well, well! If that is all the opposition Mr. Crafts finds, we should think he would stay at home and take his ease, and let his religio-political machine run itself. He must be traveling about the country because he likes change of scenery.
