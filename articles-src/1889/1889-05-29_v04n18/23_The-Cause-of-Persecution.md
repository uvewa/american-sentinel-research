Our Government, having existed over one hundred years under a Constitution tolerating all religions alike, has been more prosperous than any country on earth under any other form of government. Therefore we would let well enough alone, knowing that intolerant religious legislation of any kind, in favor of any religion, has always been attended with disastrous consequences. The student of history searches in vain for an exception. It is a principle of logic that when one event follows another for a great number of times without an exception, one is the cause; the other, the result. Therefore religious intolerance is the cause of persecuting barbarity, whether the religion be heathen, Hebrew, Mahommedan, or Christian. Similar barbarities were practiced by Nero, Mohammed, the Pope, the Presbyterian, the English Church, the Orthodox, and the Puritans; burning, torture, banishment, are used alike by all. In all countries, at all times, in all religions, from the Druids to the National Reformers, intoleration, with its attendant barbarity, has been instigated by the priesthood.—"M*arcus," in Alexandria *(*Minn.*)* Post.*
