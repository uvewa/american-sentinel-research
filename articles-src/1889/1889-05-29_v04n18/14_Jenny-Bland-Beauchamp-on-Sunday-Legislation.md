The Denton (Texas) *Chronicle* of April 20 contains a screed on Sunday legislation, by a lady who signs herself Jenny Bland Beauchamp, in which she shows her ignorance of the question by the statement that "two hundred and forty thousand Knights of Labor and Associated Engineers signed the petition" for the passage of a Sunday law. That is a bigger claim than even Mr. Crafts ever made. If any more than two Knights of Labor ever signed the petition it has had a decided boom of late.
