# Some Inconsistencies of National Reform.

If the future work of National Reformers follows in the line indicated by their present utterances, it will present to the world one of the sublimest spectacles of inconsistency witnessed by modern times. One of the secretaries of the National Reform Association, Rev. M. A. Gault, in a decree against those who dissent from his theories, says:—

> “Our remedy for all these malefic influences is to have the Government simply set up the moral [divine] law and recognize God’s authority behind it, and lay its hand on any religion that does not conform to it” (*i.* e., the divine law.)

This is a “remedy” which possibly, like many other so-called remedies, would only aggravate the disease. Does Mr. Gault mean to assert that should the Government grant the National Reformers license to dose out their “remedy,” all will thereby be made righteous, and thus the millennium begin? This must be his thought, for the Bible says, “It shall be our righteousness, if we observe to do all these commandments before the Lord our God, as he hath commanded us.” Deut. 6:25. Now one of those commandments says, “Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain.” Jesus says, “Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.” Matt. 12:34. Then if a man blasphemes, it is because he has it in his heart. So then if this proposed “remedy” effects a cure for the man, it must change his heart.

Again, we are warned against the Joss-house and its idol worship. “The Government must establish a standard of religion or admit anything that is called religion,” and then “lay its hand on any religion that does not conform to it.” The first commandment says, “Thou shalt have no other gods before me.” Paul says, “Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry.” Col. 3:5. Now, we are exceedingly anxious to know how these doctors are going to apply their “remedy” to that particular form of idolatry which Paul warns against? A man does *not “*conform” to God’s law when he covets; he is an idolater, and violates not only the tenth precept but also the first.

Do these men mean what they say? If they do, then they design to invent some means by which to control men’s thoughts. If the patent has not run out perhaps Rome will loan them her inquisitorial machine, and although a little rusty from recent disuse, it would be an excellent appliance in the administration of their “remedy.” To be consistent, National Reformers should adopt this Papal plan as the most efficient process for the prohibition of free thought that has ever yet been devised.

Let us glance further to see the consistency of enforcing upon the citizens of the United States obedience to God’s law. Paul says, “The carnal mind is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.” Rom. 8:7. Are not the great mass of citizens of the United States carnally minded?—Yes; and this is stating the case very mildly. Very well; then they can’t “conform” to the law of God till they are converted and possess the Spirit of God. So these doctors, in their arrogant assumptions, have set themselves about the huge task of accomplishing an impossibility. O consistency! thou art a precious jewel, but as yet undiscovered in the realm of National Reform.

The gospel of Jesus Christ is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that *believeth. *Rom. 1:16. The good result of obedience to God’s law can be secured only by faith, not by force. If the righteousness of the people is what the National Reformers indeed seek, why do they not apply the *Lord’s* remedy, and not their own? The fact that they utterly repudiated Hon. Mr. McDougal’s speech recommending to them the gospel for “malefic influences” is evidence that that is *not* what they seek; they want power, civil power, to enforce their “remedy.” “State and religion” is what they want, says Jonathan Edwards, and he continues, we “are *going to have it.”* It must come, says M. A. Gault, though the terrors of the *“sword* and the *bullet”* become agents in its accomplishment. Is it possible that the sentiments of this Jesuitical order are about to be crystallized into American fundamental law? Where are the champions of American rights? Let them herald the note of warning with trumpet tones, and let all true citizens realize that “eternal vigilance is the price of liberty.”E. E. Marvin.
