The Iron Mountain Railway, a branch of the Missouri Pacific system, has given notice that all unnecessary Sunday trains, both passenger and freight, will be discontinued on that road after May 1. It does well. Any railroad that is in the habit of running unnecessary trains on any day in the week ought to discontinue them if it wishes to make any money.
