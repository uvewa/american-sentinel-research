The National Reform Association does not receive much aid and comfort from the St. Louis *Christian Advocate*, although it believes in National Reform principles. In a recent issue it spoke as follows of the Pittsburg Convention, which was then in session:—

> "We have closely watched conventions, conferences, and general meetings of this kind, and are free to say that they have not, as a general thing, been promotive of much good to the great body of the people. In many cases it was evident that the zeal of the leaders was far in advance of their discretion, and intelligent, sober-minded men were rather turned against than for that which they advocated. We must, however, be careful what we say about such proceedings, or, rather, about the spirit which prompts them, as the principal actors are usually of the class that not only think themselves right, but are exceedingly sensitive and impatient of anything and everything like contradiction or opposition."

This is a very just estimate of the men who run the National Reform machine. The American Sentinel is fully conscious of the fact that they are exceedingly "impatient of anything and everything like contradiction or opposition," yet it calls on all its readers to bear witness that it has endeavored faithfully to do its duty. We would that we had less reason for opposing them.
