The American Sabbath Union says:—

> "It is sometimes said by opponents of Sabbath laws that government has no right to dictate how a man shall spend the day. But at quarantine, government proves its right to dictate how a man shall spend a fortnight when the general good requires it."

And it is unmitigated sophistry and inexcusable trickery to argue that Sunday work is as dangerous to the general public, as is a ship laden with pestilence or infected with small-pox, or cholera, or yellow fever. It would seem that the people must have taken leave of their senses who can be caught with such chaff as is being sown by the advocates of Sunday laws.
