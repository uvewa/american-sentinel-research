The chronic unfairness of the "American Sentinel" appears in its incessant ringing of the changes on the union of "Church and State."— *Christian Statesman.*

And the chronic inconsistency of the *Statesman *appears in its incessant denial that it favors a union of Church and State, while carrying at its mast-head in every issue this avowed purpose: "To secure such an amendment to the Constitution of the United States as will declare the Nation's allegiance to Jesus Christ and its acceptance of the moral laws of the Christian religion, and so indicate that this is a Christian Nation, and place all the Christian laws, institutions, and usages of our government on an undeniable legal basis in the fundamental law of the land." If the *Statesman* is not dealing in unadulterated Church and State, it should take down the sign.
