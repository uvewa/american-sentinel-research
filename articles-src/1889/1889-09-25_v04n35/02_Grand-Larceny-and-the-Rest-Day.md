The religious legislationists declare that "It is grand larceny to take away the toilers' weekly rest-day." Even if that were true, nobody can commit such larceny, because nobody can take away the toilers' weekly rest-day. Every man can have his rest-day who wants it bad enough to take it; and nobody can take it away from him. So nobody can ever commit any such larceny. But if it be grand larceny to take from the toiler his rest-day which nobody can do, then what is it for the government, under pains and penalties, to take away from the industrious citizen his *work *day, which these people by their Sunday law propose to do. Because, from the man who has taken his weekly rest-day on another day than Sunday, they intend to have the government to take away one of his work days. They propose under cover of governmental power to rob such a man of one-sixth of his income as a tribute to their ideas of the sacredness of Sunday. This is not only grand larceny in fact, it is so with tyranny added.
