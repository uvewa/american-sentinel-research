We learn from a private letter from Los Angeles that the workingmen of that city, in whose interest the American Sabbath Union is professedly so much interested, did not take kindly to the recent Sunday-law demonstration under the auspices of the "field secretary." It seems that it was announced in a circular that one of the leaders of the workingmen would address them at one of the meetings, and that some of the Catholic priests would also be on hand and perhaps speak. When the time came, Mr. Butler (the representative of the workingmen) attempted to speak, but his fellow workingmen, not liking the tone of his remarks, hissed him down.

The writer continues: "This put a damper on the meeting, and the priests (if there were any present) were not called upon. Mr. C. [Crafts] seemed greatly discouraged, but made a few remarks, principally in denouncing the Sentinel and Prof. Jones, and wound up in a towering rage." [281]
