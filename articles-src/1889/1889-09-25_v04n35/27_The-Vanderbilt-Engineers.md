The proposition which it is said the Vanderbilt engineers made some years ago, that they "would be willing to do ten days' work in six if they could only have the seventh for rest," is rather extravagant for sober-minded practical men. No man can continuously do ten days, work in six, even with the seventh day's rest, nor with two days' rest in seven. There is too much Sunday-law theology cropping out in that statement to allow it to be of any weight.
