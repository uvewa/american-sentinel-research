In the Los Angeles Sunday-law convention, September 1, Rev. Mr. Hutchins said:—

> "A government like ours must be held together by the adhesive power of virtue."

Now Mr. Hutchins was speaking in favor of the enactment of a National Sunday law, as necessary to preserve the government. His argument therefore is, that there is in law the "adhesive power of virtue." But this is not true. The only adhesive power of virtue that there is in this world is in the gospel of Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ is the source of virtue to this world. "The whole multitude sought to touch him for there went virtue out of him and healed them all." This virtue can be secured only by faith; this faith can only be inculcated by the preaching of the gospel of Christ. The Sunday-law preachers are working by perfectly antagonistic means to secure what they profess to want. And this proves that they have forgotten the virtue and the power of the gospel of Christ.
