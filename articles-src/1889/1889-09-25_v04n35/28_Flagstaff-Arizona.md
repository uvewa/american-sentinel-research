Advices from Flagstaff, Arizona, indicate that the American Sabbath Union has made some headway in that village. The field secretary had an audience of about seventy, at his lecture on the 5th instant. Of these, fifty voted in favor of a Sunday law. Our correspondent says: "Many who but a few hours before had laughed at the idea of there being any danger of such a law, are to-day supporting the scheme." People who value the freedom of conscience guaranteed by the Constitution as it is, should remember that the field secretary leaves an organization in every place he visits. They should remember, also, that although the great majority of the people of the United States are opposed to religious legislation, an organized minority may succeed in procuring measures that will fasten such a calamity upon the Nation. "Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty."
