Here is a point that reveals not only the interest that the Sunday-law workers have in the workingmen, but also the true inwardness of the Sunday movement. Sunday night, September 1, the field secretary of the American Sabbath Union addressed a mass meeting in Los Angeles. The Los Angeles *Evening Express* tells the rest:—

> "It was there given out to the vast audience that a full report of the address by Dr. Crafts would appear in this morning's *Times* and that the opportunity to procure a copy should not be neglected. Nothing was said, however, about the fact that the hard-working compositors employed in the *Times* office would have to work on Sunday night setting up Dr. Crafts' denunciation of Sunday work."

It is not Sunday work that they want to stop as much as it is Sunday-keeping they want to enforce. It is not so much the workingmen they want to protect, as it is the preachers that they they want to empower.
