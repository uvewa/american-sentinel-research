In a recent lecture on the question of Home Rule in Ireland, Prof. J. P. Mahaffy, of Dublin University, made a most important distinction between Catholicism and Protestantism, which it would be well for all to bear in mind. He had made the statement that Home Rule in Ireland meant Roman Catholic supremacy, and that that meant persecution. He then noticed the charge that Protestantism also has persecuted, which he frankly admitted, stating that those who attempted to deny it did themselves and their cause an injustice; but, said he, "When the Catholic Church persecutes, she persecutes according to her own principles, and when the Protestant persecutes, he persecutes against his own principles."

This is indeed a most important distinction, from which it follows that when the Protestant persecutes he adopts Catholic principles, and ceases to be Protestant. Now apply this to the National Reform Sunday movement. We find that wherever National Reform principles have been carried out, as in Arkansas and Tennessee, and Sunday laws have been enforced, there has been most bitter, malignant, and wicked persecution. And it is a fact that has never been denied by the leaders of the National Reform movement, that the enforcement of the Sunday laws in those States is strictly in accordance with so-called National Reform principles. No paper published in the interests of legal Sunday observance has ever disavowed one feature of that abominable and un-American persecution. Therefore we are justified in our assertion that the Sunday movement as set forth by the National Reform Association, the American Sabbath Union, etc., is opposed to every principle of Protestantism; that every true Protestant will oppose the movement; and that he who does not oppose it, or at least does not withhold his assent from it, has no right to call himself a Protestant.
