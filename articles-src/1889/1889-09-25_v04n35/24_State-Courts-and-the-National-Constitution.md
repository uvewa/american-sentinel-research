The American Sabbath Union still persists that Sunday laws are constitutional under the National Constitution, because they have been declared to be constitutional in the States. In other words, persists that decisions of State Supreme Courts are decisions of the United States Supreme Court. Worse than this, however, is the fact that the people to whom it is told believe it. And yet worse than all is the fact that the great majority do not know enough of the National Constitution, or of the system of government of the Union, to be able to detect the falsehood; and do not have a disposition to study the question enough to find out the truth in the matter. A people who will thus carelessly allow themselves to be robbed of their liberties and constitutional rights, are unworthy of them.
