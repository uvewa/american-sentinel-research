It is not enough to say that "the requirement of one day of rest in seven is based on the necessities of human nature." Upon which of these necessities is it based? Is it based upon those necessities of human nature with which the State can have to do? The requirement of the seventh day's rest is based, *not* upon the *physical,* but upon the spiritual necessities of human nature. And with the spiritual part of man, civil government can never of right have anything to do. That pertains solely to God. The Sabbath rest therefore belongs to God. And Christ commands to render to God, not to civil government, that which is God's.
