The American Sabbath Union says he was written to from Nevada, "There is no use of your coming down here, everybody works on Sunday." Consequently the Union did not go to Nevada. If the Sunday-law movement is in the interests of Sunday rest, it would seem that such a place as that should be the very place where he would most need to go. But no, that is the very place where he does not go at all. This again shows the principle of the move to be, to call not sinners but the righteous to repentance.
