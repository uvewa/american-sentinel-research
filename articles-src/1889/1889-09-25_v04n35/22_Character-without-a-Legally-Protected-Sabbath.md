It is declared over and over again by the American Sabbath Union that "You can no more produce character without a quiet and legally protected Sabbath, than you can produce in California your marvelous fruits without water." What is here meant by a legally-protected Sabbath is one enforced by law. Now there are thousands of people in this Nation who keep the Sabbath or Saturday; and that day is not at all legally protected, according to the above idea. Yet everybody knows that as a body there are no better characters than those of the seventh-day Christians. And this character is produced without a legally-protected Sabbath in any sense as the Union uses that term. The reason of this is that those people depend on Jesus Christ, the true source of good character, rather than upon the civil power.
