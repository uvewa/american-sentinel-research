I live in Washington City, and am pastor of the Central Presbyterian Church, which is located in a densely-populated portion of the city. There are no rented pews; the seats are free at all the services; the entire revenue is derived from the weekly gifts of the congregation; all comers are equally and alike made welcome. There are persons of all conditions and classes who are regular members of the church and congregation. In the last few years every house within four blocks of the church has been visited by members of the congregation, going two and two, and the inmates have been kindly and cordially invited to the services. The pastor has extended repeated invitations to scores of the "masses" living near the house of worship. Yet at this very moment there are enough of these "masses" within five minutes' walk of the church, who never attend the worship of the Most High God, to pack to its utmost capacity our present edifice and another one of the same size.

Now, what are we to do to save these masses who refuse to be saved; to evangelize these masses who will not be evangelized; to gather into the church these masses who will not be gathered? Some of the masses are lawyers, capitalists, merchants, mechanics, wage-workers, and some very poor; but, as they do not and will not come to church, they are all masses. Is my life and the life of my congregation to be entirely devoted to one unceasing effort to bring these people to church? If, after repeated invitations and offers of the gospel, they continually and willfully reject Christ, is it like our Lord, and does it honor him, to force his salvation on unwilling souls?

A chosen apostle said: "Seeing ye thrust it from you and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles." The church has been fairly flooded of late years with publications of all sorts and sizes proclaiming the gross neglect of the masses by evangelical churches and Christians. Statistics have been tabulated, *ad nauseum,* to prove that all manner of failures and dire evils are upon us. True, the facts are dark enough. The devil is very busy, and evil is rampant. True, believers continue, as they have ever been, a little flock, and as they will continue until the Lord returns, when he will give them the kingdom. Christ is still a rejected king. I venture the assertion that nine-tenths of the churches of this land, city or country, are never filled at any regular service, morning or evening; and, if all the services are considered, we can furnish seats free for just as many more people as now come to church. The church has always furnished, and is furnishing to-day, far more seats than there are persons who come to fill them. The gospel agents, agencies, and accommodations are sufficient to evangelize all the masses of cities and countries in less than a week, if only the masses were willing; but, alas! this unwillingness is the supreme difficulty, which only the Holy Spirit can remove.—*Rev. A. W. Pitzer, in the Interior.*
