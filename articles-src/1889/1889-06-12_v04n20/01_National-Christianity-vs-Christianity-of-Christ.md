*America* remarks that Elizabeth Stuart Phelps has contributed an able article to the *Forum,* entitled, "The Christianity of Christ," and adds: "This subject is little studied in the present generation, yet it is the only Christianity which should engage our thoughts or our devotion."

*America* is evidently not well indoctrinated in the principles of National Reform, else it would understand that the Christianity of Christ is getting to be somewhat out of date, and is, according to that program, to be shortly superseded by National Christianity. Nevertheless, the words of *America* are true; the Christianity of Christ "is the only Christianity which should engage our thoughts or our devotion."
