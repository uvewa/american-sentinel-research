The St. Louis *Observer* says:—

> "Christ's kingdom is not of this world. The church is not a police board, nor Cesar's lieutenant, but a Saviour of lost sinners. Its simple, sole, glorious mission is to bring sinners to Jesus by preaching the gospel to them with the Holy Ghost sent down from Heaven."

And commenting upon this the Cedar County (Neb.) *Nonpareil* remarks:—

> "This has been our idea of true Christianity, and of the duty of the church. That is, to convert, to preach the gospel, and argue, and appeal to man's better nature—rather than to say to the sinner, You must do this and you must not do that, and meddle with politics and pass laws in the attempt to compel people by force to be good."

All of which is sound and in accordance with the principles advocated by the American Sentinel.
