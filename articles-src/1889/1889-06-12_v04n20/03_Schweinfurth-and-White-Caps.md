Somebody has sent us a Chicago paper containing the following marked paragraph:—

> "The gentleman named Schweinfurth, who is posing as the Beekmanite Christ down about Rockford, is in a very pretty fix. The White Caps have served notice on him to leave that neck of woods. The fetching part of the ukase, however, lies in the alternative which they present. If he doesn't decamp by a certain time the gentlemanly White Caps promise to take Mr. Schweinfurth into the near-by woods, plaster the tar on him as long as it will stick, and then set him on fire. That's all. Only just that. And still Schweinfurth hesitates to skedaddle."

We have read of this man before, but never thought him worthy of any mention, and do not now; certain it is that we have no sympathy with his blasphemous pretensions, but we wish to say, now that the matter is up, that we think that bad as he may be he is not half as dangerous to the community as are the lawless scamps that threaten dire vengeance against him; neither are his doctrines likely to do a tithe of the harm that will surely rise from the idea that seems to be gaining ground quite rapidly, that the majority of a community have a right to dictate to a minority in matters of religion. If the Illinois pretender has violated the civil or criminal law of the State, then let the State deal with him as with other offenders; but if his only offense has been to teach erroneous doctrines, whereby he has drawn away disciples after him, he should be protected from violence even if the Governor has to order out the militia to do it. This White Cap business should be promptly stamped out.
