The *Christian Nation* says of such men as Murat Halstead, editor of the Cincinnati *Commercial Gazette,* that "the best thing to do with them is to send them out of the country." What is his offense? Why, he is not the kind of a politician that suits the National Reform idea. If it will aid in securing the supremacy of his party, he "will openly declare that a Sabbath law cannot be enforced anyhow." That makes him an awfully bad man from a National Reform standpoint, and he "should not be appointed to any office." It is said that "coming events cast their shadows before," and such utterances as these from the *Christian Nation* show what kind of a Government we may expect when the "Reformers" shall have succeeded in making this a "Christian Nation" by constitutional amendment. They make very smooth pretensions, but occasionally the real spirit of the religious amendment movement crops out. The foregoing is in perfect keeping with the sentiments expressed by leading National Reformers on various occasions, and is a fair indication of their ultimate intentions. [159-160]
