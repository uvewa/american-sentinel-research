# Mr. Crafts against Facts.

We have before us a copy of the Vineland (N. J.) *Evening Journal,* of April 19, which contains a report of an address on the Blair Sunday- Rest bill, delivered in that place by Doctor Crafts. From that report we make the following brief quotations, that we may compare them with the facts:—

> “The Blair bill, said he, is not what its enemies would have it. Blair drew this bill for the Sabbath men the same as any lawyer would draw bills for any client. Blair has drawn bills for another sect who are opposed in some degree to the American Sabbath, or a day of rest. The two bills are put together by enemies of the Rest bill, and thus misrepresentations are made. When Blair drew the original bill he used his own language, and the bill read ‘promote ’ Sabbath observance instead of ‘protect.’ Enemies took the word ‘promote ’ as an effort to get God in the Constitution and establish State religions—that is, religions supported and maintained by the State.

> “The friends of the bill never had any desire to ‘promote ’ Sabbath observance, and therefore that word was stricken out and ‘protect ’ inserted, and this was done immediately, but the enemy still delights in informing the people that ‘promote ’ is the word. Dr. Crafts gave a history of how the movement for Sabbath observance first started, and denied, as has been charged, that the W. C. T. U. was at the head of the move. The movement was started, not as a religious measure at all, but because some people saw that it was necessary to have a day of rest for the health of the multitudes, and that in these days of soulless corporations and combinations, it was necessary that law should stand between the ‘spoiler’ and the employes. When P. M. Arthur, the head of the Locomotive Engineers, and T. V. Powderly, the head of the Knights of Labor, each representing thousands of signatures, signed the petition for this Sunday-Rest bill, it was plain that they saw a need of a day of rest for the workingmen. Now labor organizations are taking the matter up and will carry reform out. Understand that ‘religious observance ’ nor the ‘word of God’ are not mentioned in the bill, and are no part of it. The ‘Rest bill ’ is for the benefit of the masses and the health of the people. The bill does not deny the right to work to any citizen in the United States, on any day of the week, provided that citizen does not engage in trade where there is competition, so that his neighbor is compelled to keep open his shop.”
We know nothing of a bill that Mr. Blair has drawn for a sect that is opposed to the American Sabbath or to a day of rest. Indeed, we do not know of any sect in the United States that is opposed to a day of rest; but whatever other bills Mr. Blair may have drawn up, the enemies of the Sunday-Rest bill have not put together nor confounded it with any other. All our strictures have been made upon the Sunday-Rest bill, without any regard to any other bill. Further, Mr. Blair did not draw up the Sunday-Rest bill just as a lawyer would draw up any bill, but has shown himself intensely partisan in pushing the bill. In the notice which the April number of *Our Day* gives to the hearing on the Rest bill, we find this sentence: “We subjoin from its pages some of the dialogues between Senator Blair (who showed himself matchless in cross-questioning) and the opponents of the bill.” This states the case exactly, as the reader of that hearing will see. Mr. Blair did act the part of a paid attorney, cross-questioning and arguing with the opponents of the bill, but assisting those that were praying for its passage. This may be set down as one instance where Mr. Crafts unfortunately differs with facts.

Again, concerning the relative importance of the words “promote” and “protect.” It is not true, as Mr. Crafts states, that “the enemy still delights in informing the people that ‘promote ’ is the word.” It is a matter of fact that the bill [156] was not amended, nor was any substitute introduced during the session of Congress. All there is to it is this: The American Sabbath Union, at its meeting in Washington last December, saw that the statement that the bill was designed to *promote* the observance of Sunday as a day of religious worship, showed too plainly upon its face that it was an act to establish a State religion. Accordingly they appointed a committee to formulate changes they desired in the bill. This committee reported; and among other things was the substitution of the word “protect” for “promote” in the preamble and last clause of the bill. These changes we immediately noted, publishing the original bill side by side with the bill as the Union desired it to read; we have printed it more than once, and have repeatedly referred to the change from “promote” to “protect;” although, as it has been said before, the bill which was introduced into Congress read, “to promote its (the first day) observance as a day of religious worship,” until the bill died a natural death by the adjournment of Congress.

What Mr. Crafts objects to, however, is the fact that we have showed that the word “protect” does not conceal the object of the bill any more than did the word “promote.” We have shown again and again that so far as the people who observe Sunday are concerned, they do not need any more protection than they already have. There is abundant provision in the laws of every State for the protection of religious worship. And the bill which Mr. Blair introduced does not say that it is desired that *the people* shall be protected, but that *the religious observance of the day* shall be protected; and that can mean nothing else but that all the people shall be prohibited from using the day in any other way than as a day of religious worship.

And this is just what Mr. Crafts himself has said that they desire to secure by the passage of the bill. In the Washington Convention he declared that “the bill which has been introduced makes Sunday the ideal Sabbath of the Puritans, which day shall be occupied only by worship.” So here we have No. 2 of Mr. Crafts’s unfortunate collisions with facts.

Again, the report says that “Dr. Crafts gave a history of how the movement for Sabbath observ- ance first started, and denied, as has been charged, that the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union was at the head of the movement.” Unfortunately for Mr. Crafts, we have something upon this point also. In the *Union Signal* of May 3, 1888, there appeared a report of a hearing which the Senate Committee on Education and Labor gave on the 6th of the preceding month to the friends of a Sunday law. Mrs. J. C. Bateham, the superintendent of the Sabbath Observance Department of the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union, presented the opening paper, and was followed by several ministers. The *Union Signal, *to which we just referred, said: “Senator Blair will now draft and present a bill for us.” This shows that the bill was introduced at the request of the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union.

Again, in the hearing before the committee on Education and Labor, on Thursday, December 13, 1888, Mrs. Bateham, in replying to a question by Mr. Blair, said: “This petition work has been done chiefly by our Woman’s Christian Temperance Union. The ministry, I may say, have had almost nothing to do with it. It was started in behalf of the elevation of the masses to protect the morality of the people.” This is sufficient on that point.

Mr. Crafts says that the movement was started, not as a religious measure at all, but because some people saw that it was necessary to have a day of rest for the health of the multitude. Again he says: “Understand that ‘religious observance ’ nor the ‘word of God ’ are not mentioned in the bill and are no part of it. The Rest bill is for the benefit of the masses, and the health of the people.” Mr. Crafts may presume upon the ignorance of the people to whom he lectures, but he ought to take some precaution to keep his lectures from getting into print, where they can be seen by those who are familiar with the Blair bill. With his statement that religious observance is not mentioned in the bill, and is no part of it, compare the preamble of the bill. We quote it with the changes desired by the American Sabbath Union, so that Mr. Crafts can find no fault with it. It reads as follows:—

> “A bill to secure to the people the enjoyment of the Lord’s day, commonly known as Sunday, as a day of rest, and to *protect its observance as a day of religious worship.”*

Now it is technically true that the term “religious observance” does not occur in this preamble; that is, the words do not occur in just that relation; but nevertheless it is plainly declared that the bill is to protect the religious observance of the day. But this is not all; the bill itself closes with the statement that “the act shall be construed so far as possible to secure to the whole people rest from toil during Sunday, their mental and moral culture, and *the protection of the religious observance* of the day.” Yet in the face of this Mr. Crafts wishes us to understand that “religious observance” is not mentioned in the bill and is no part of it! The reader can draw his own conclusions as to the design of Mr. Crafts in making that statement.

Again he says that “when P. M. Arthur, the head of the Locomotive Engineers, and T. V. Powderly, the head of the Knights of Labor, each representing thousands of signatures, signed the petition for this Sunday-Rest bill, it was plain that they saw the need of a day of rest for the workingmen.” Mr. Crafts is here trying to substantiate his assertions that this Sunday movement was originated solely by the workingmen and not by the churches. But it is about as nefarious a statement as the other; for, as a matter of fact, Mr. Powderly and Mr. Arthur did not indorse the petition in behalf of the thousands who had never seen it, until Mr. Crafts had labored with them for several hours, overcoming their objections. And further than this, the *Union Signal,* referring to the vote passed by the General Assembly of the Knights of Labor after Mr. Crafts had argued and pleaded with them, said that it was a wonderful victory achieved by Mr. Crafts. It could not have been very much of a victory to secure the signatures of those workingmen, if the workingmen had instituted the movement. There seems to be a little discrepancy here which we will leave to Mr. Crafts to explain.

Once more, Mr. Crafts says that the bill does not deny the right to work to any citizen in the United States, on any day of the week, provided that citizen does not engage in trade, where there is competition, so that his neighbor is compelled to keep open his shop. If we had the space we would reprint the bill in full; but those who have files of the American Sentinel can find it, and can verify our statement that the bill specifies nothing of the kind. We will quote enough to show that it does deny the right of any person subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States to work on Sunday, even if he is not engaged in trade, and if there is no competition. Section 1 of the bill (and let it be understood that we are quoting from the bill as amended by the American Sabbath Union) reads as follows:—

*Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,* That no person or corporation, or the agent, servant, or employe of any person or corporation, shall perform or authorize to be performed any secular work, labor, or business to the disturbance of others, works of necessity, mercy, and humanity excepted; nor shall any person engage in any play, game, or amusement, or recreation, to the disturbance of others on the first day of the week, commonly known as the Lord’s day, or during any part thereof, in any Territory, district, vessel, or place subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States; nor shall it be lawful for any person or corporation to receive pay for labor or service performed or rendered in violation of this section.”

We advise Mr. Crafts to study the Sunday bill a little more thoroughly before he lectures again. We might dwell at length upon the last statement quoted by Mr. Crafts in regard to competition, but if we merely call attention to it it will be sufficient in this place to let the reader see that if his statement were true it would show that the Sunday movement was simply a part of a gigantic monopoly, that if carried out would eclipse anything that has ever been known. All that we designed to do in this article was to call attention to the almost constant collisions between the statements of the leaders in the Sunday-law movement and the truth. It can truly be said of them that they are not afraid of the truth, for they meet it in conflict nearly every day. E. J. W.
