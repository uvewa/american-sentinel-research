The excellent article, "Is the United States a Christian Nation?" on another page of this paper, is from the *Lutheran Witness,* published in St. Louis, Mo., and is well worth a careful reading. In these days, when, through a mistaken zeal, the leaders of so many of the churches are seeking some sort of an alliance with the civil power, it is refreshing to find in the organ of one of the oldest and most respectable denominations, the proper relation of Church and State so clearly set forth. The sentiments expressed in the article are not only Lutheran doctrine relative to Church and State, but they are the doctrine of all true Protestants of whatever name.
