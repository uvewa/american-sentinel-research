The New York *Mail and Express* says:—

> "These Sunday newspapers take away the Sabbath of those who make them up and sell them. They teach young people, into whose homes they go, that worldly matters need not be laid aside on Sunday; they secularize the day for every Christian who reads them."

How do the Sunday newspapers take away the rest of those who work at them on Sunday? Why, just as a farmer's corn-field takes away his rest when he hoes corn on Sunday. But who is to blame? the farmer or the corn-field? the printer or the Sunday paper? A corn-field or a Sunday paper that is mean enough to take away a man's rest on Sunday ought to enter the toils of the Inquisition at once.

But why need worldly matters be laid aside on Sunday? Isn't it a "civil Sunday" that they want the law to enforce by civil penalties? Are not worldly matters civil matters? and is it not proper to attend to civil matters on a civil day?

Again, *"they* secularize the day for every Christian who reads them." Who secularizes the day for Christians? Is it the paper? or the professed Christians who read it? Is it the cornfield? or the Christian that hoes in it? Why don't you tell the truth, and put the blame where it belongs? Why don't you say that these excellent Christians (?) have not enough conscience and moral backbone to do what they believe to be right, and that you want a law that will take away from them all chance to do wrong, so they will be compelled to receive the blessing of God and go to Heaven? Without a Sunday law, no doubt many of these good Christians would continue reading the Sunday newspapers till the day of Judgment; and when asked why they were not ready for Heaven, they would reply, "O Lord, we should have been ready if it had not been for those Sunday papers. You see we tried to get a law to stop them, for we did not want to read them; but they kept on printing them, and they would creep right into our homes on Sunday, and we just had to read them." And they will expect the Lord to excuse their hypocrisy and pass them into the realms of the blest, while he pronounces judgment upon the Sunday newspapers in the words, "Be ye eternally damned!"

But why should you blame the Sunday papers, or Christians, or anybody else, for secularizing Sunday? Isn't that what the leaders in the Sunday-law movement profess that they are trying to do? Are they not urging Congress and every State Legislature to pass laws enforcing the observance of Sunday *"as a civil institution,"* and do not secular and civil mean the same thing? We would like to have somebody tell how they can make Sunday a "civil institution" without making it at the same time secular. The Christians who read the Sunday papers are merely carrying out in their actions what those that censure them are trying to enact into law. They are making Sunday a civil, or secular, institution. A. Delos Westcott.
