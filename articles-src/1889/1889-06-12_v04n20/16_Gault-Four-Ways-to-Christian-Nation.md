M. A. Gault, district secretary of the National Reform Association, says that there are four ways by which this may be made a Christian Nation, namely, first, agitation; second, petition; third, by the ballot; fourth, by the sword. In attempted justification of the latter method, he says: "Don't think we are advocating war; but if we are not faithful in the use of these other means, as it was with the anti-slavery question, after they had agitated and petitioned, and used the ballot, they drew the sword; *so shall we, as a last resort, be compelled to use the sword and the ballot."* And in this he exposes the true animus of the association to which he belongs.
