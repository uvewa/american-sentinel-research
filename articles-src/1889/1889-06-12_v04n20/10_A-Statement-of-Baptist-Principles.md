The following letter, referred to elsewhere in these columns, and which we are kindly permitted to publish, is from a Baptist clergyman, and should commend itself to every fair-minded person, both by the candor of its tone and by the sentiments expressed in it. It is another evidence that all Baptists are not ready to prove recreant to the principles for which Roger Williams so heroically suffered. We trust it will be carefully read, and candidly pondered, especially by those who imagine that opposition to religious legislation is akin to infidelity.

Salinas, Cal., May 9, 1889.

W. A. Runnels—*Dear Sir:* Your kind letter of April 17 is before me, and I have received two or three copies of the American Sentinel. One of the principal reasons why I am a Baptist is the positive and radical position of the denomination on the subject of Church and State. The entire and absolute separation of Church and State has been a cardinal principle with American Baptists from Roger Williams down to the present time. It was through the direct efforts of Virginia Baptists, aided by Washington, Jefferson, and Madison, that the first amendment to the Federal Constitution was adopted, providing that Congress should have no power to establish a religion, or prohibit the people in the free exercise of their individual religious convictions. The literature of the American Baptist Publication [158] Society is liberally permeated with the doctrine of soul liberty and the rights of conscience.

The sermon on this subject, by Rev. R. D. Clark, of Eureka, published in the Sentinel of April 24, has the true Baptist ring. No intelligent Baptist can controvert his position. It is as fundamental and firm as the everlasting rock, and in vain will the waves of religious fanaticism and intolerance break against it. All that Christian people have a right to ask of the State is, *protection in their worship and church work.* All Sunday laws and Sabbath laws which require the people to yield a certain observance of a certain day in the interests of religion, is contrary to the spirit of our Government, and an invasion of the civil rights guaranteed to every citizen of the republic. When will the people learn that the religion of Jesus Christ can never be implanted in the heart by legislative enactments and civil processes? I believe the first day of the week is the "Lord's day," to be observed by his people under the new covenant, but I do not believe *its observance is to be enforced by legal enactments. *If this institution of religion is to be sustained by the pains and penalties of civil power, then why not all other Christian institutions, including baptism and the Lord's Supper? Where is the difference in principle? While I insist upon my right to hold public worship on the first day of the week, I insist with equal tenacity that the Sabbatarian has just as good a right, from a civil standpoint, to hold public worship on the seventh day of the week.

It is the province of the State to recognize, track out, and punish crime; but, when it comes to the ordinances, institutions, and forms of Christian worship, we say to it, Hands off.

These are my views upon this subject, and I have written them at your request. You are at liberty to make any use of them you think best.

Very truly yours, E. B. Hatch,

*Pastor Salinas Baptist Church.*
