On another page we publish a letter from a Baptist minister of this State, which breathes true Baptist principles. Indeed, as we not long since told a prominent Baptist clergyman of this State, the principles for which the American Sentinel contends are those for which Roger Williams contended, and every consistent Baptist will be with us. We are sorry to know, however, that all Baptists are not consistent. Many forget the persecution which Baptists suffered for their religion in the early history of this country, and are willing, in turn, to become persecutors for conscience' sake. A ease in point is called to mind by the reference made in this letter to the sermon preached by Rev. R. D. Clark, of Eureka, which was recently published in the Sentinel. Because of that sermon, Mr Clark has been compelled to resign his pastorate. But we rejoice to know that there are many, not only among the Baptists, but among all the denominations, who heartily indorse the work of the Sentinel.
