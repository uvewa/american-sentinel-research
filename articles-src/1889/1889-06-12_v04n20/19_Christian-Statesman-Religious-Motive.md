The *Christian Statesman* of May 16 has the following item:—

> "There is sufficient justification for a general movement of workingmen to recover their lost Sabbath, in the following words of Carroll D. Wright: 'No man likes to work on Sunday; the only railroad men who favor Sunday work are those who don't work themselves on that day.' At the same time, while this would justify a general movement of the working classes, it will never bring it about. The only motive strong enough to preserve and maintain the Sabbath is the religious motive. The fear of God is the only sufficient defense for the rights of man!"

We doubt Mr. Carroll's statement, though possibly he may voice the feelings of the majority of railroad men; but even if they all want to rest on Sunday that would not justify a law compelling other people to rest if they don't want to. But the point to which we wished specially to call attention is the admission made in the latter part of the paragraph quoted, namely, that the religious motive is the only one strong enough to maintain Sunday rest. It has been most persistently urged that the movement in favor of Sunday laws was not from a religious but from a sanitary standpoint; now the *Statesman* candidly acknowledges that the religious motive is the only one strong enough to do the work. It follows that if the religious element is the stronger it must give its color to the whole thing, and so, after all the denials, the demand for Sunday laws is a demand for religious legislation.
