Discussing Sunday laws in a recent letter to that paper, the Washington correspondent of the *Christian Standard* says:—

> "No State Legislature has a right to pass a law because it is the will of God; to put on the statute books, for example, the first and second commandments; to legislate people into Christianity. To do this would be for the State to establish a religion, and to infringe that right of self-liberty which is the atmosphere of our Constitution and laws. Again, it will not do to pass a law for the benefit of the individual; to make a man more moral; to compel a man to attend divine worship. To do so would violate liberty."

Yet, strange to say, that same correspondent urges the passage and the enforcement of laws compelling everybody to rest upon Sunday. His want of consistency brands him as a genuine National Reformer.
