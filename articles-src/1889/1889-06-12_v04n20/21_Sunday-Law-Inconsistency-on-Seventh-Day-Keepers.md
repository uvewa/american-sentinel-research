Sunday-law advocates claim that such legislation is no infringement upon the rights of those who observe the seventh-day Sabbath, as they are at perfect liberty to keep any day they choose. Suppose that we have a Monday law, instead of a Sunday law, would the first-day philanthropists think that it was no hardship on them to forego business on that day on account of their conscientious rest on Sunday? Indeed, they would not so admit. One of their strong arguments in favor of a law to compel all classes to close business on Sunday is, that he who conscientiously rests on Sunday cannot successfully compete with others who continue their business seven days. They protest against the financial disadvantage against which the Sunday man labors in resting while others work, but claim that it is no disadvantage to the seventh-day man to be required to do the same thing. The man who is foolish enough to keep the seventh day according to the fourth commandment, ought to be willing to pay tribute of one work day's income for the privilege of obeying God—in this land of liberty! This is another specimen of National Reform consistency.
