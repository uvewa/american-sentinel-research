A minister of the Christian Church writes from Winters, Cal., to a friend of the American Sentinel, as follows:—

Dear Sir: Your letter is before me. In reply, will say, first, I am opposed to civil enactment for the purpose of compelling obedience to religious rites, ceremonies, ordinances, or institutions. Such laws contravene the law of God and invade the rights of men. God requires a willing and personal obedience, not one made mandatory by civil enactment. Man is accountable to God alone for his religious faith and practice. I regard the efforts being put forth by the Sabbath Union as Gentile-Judaism gone mad. Such laws as they seek to have enacted would be subversive of every principle of individual religious liberty, and would outrage the consciences of Christian people who fail to understand that God made a mistake and meant the first day when he commanded all Israel to observe the seventh day as a Sabbath of rest.

I doubt the wisdom of a law compelling the people to rest one day in seven as a police measure, and when a civil enactment intervenes to compel all people to observe the first day of the week as a Sabbath such intervention is an outrage upon personal liberty. The right of candid investigation and independent inquiry in all matters pertaining to faith and morality are through such laws slaughtered by blind fanaticism, religious bigotry, and intolerance. Such a law would be an unwarranted assumption of power.

As a Disciple I do not feel it my duty to observe any day as a Sabbath. It seems to me, however, to be the climax of absurdity and religious ignorance for these first-day-of-the-week- Sabbath observers to base their authority upon the fourth command of the decalogue, which plainly made mandatory the observance of the seventh day. In all the Old Testament Scriptures no reference is made to the first day of the week as a Sabbath-day, and to use the fourth command of the decalogue to prove that the first day of the week is a Sabbath-day, or to enforce its observance as such, is about as logical as an essay on botany for the solution of a mathematical problem. While I do not indorse all of the religious views of the American Sentinel, I can but admire its ability, honesty, and devotion to personal liberty in religious faith and practice, and its able defense of such liberty.

I am, with great respect, your humble servant.
