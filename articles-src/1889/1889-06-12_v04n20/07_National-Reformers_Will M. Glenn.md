# National Reformers.

They tell us again and again that our Government is atheistic, because, as a Nation, we have never acknowledged God as the supreme ruler of the universe, a statement wholly at variance with truth, no matter how often it may be repeated. They can hardly put on cheek enough to deny the official character of the Declaration of Independence, the national and necessary preamble to the Constitution and laws of the United States. Every school-boy knows that in the first sentence of that first official deliverance of the Nation, “the law of nature and of nature’s God” are acknowledged; and again, near the close of it, it “appeals to the supreme Judge of the world” and confesses “reliance on divine providence.” If this is not acknowledgment of God by the Government of the United States, then there was no Fourth of July in 1776. This is our atheistic Government!

But they ask that the name and the religion of the Son of God be put in the Constitution. Now a little reflection will convince the candid mind that this would unite Church and State.

The blessing of God and “the protection of divine providence” having been invoked in behalf of the Nation in its preambles, the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution itself must be an inventory of its own powers. These powers all being compulsory, forbid its connection with the Christian religion.

God has appointed the State, or secular power, as a representative of justice with power to compel obedience.

He appointed the church, or spiritual power, as a representative of mercy, with power only to persuade. If, then, the religion of Christ be recognized by the secular power at all, it will belong to that power as a proper subject of forcible propagation or forcible suppression, neither of which is admissible. God has appointed his church to carry the religion of his Son to all the world, but he has not appointed the State either to help or hinder, because it knows no power but force.

It is the duty of the State, or secular power, here and everywhere, to protect the persons and property of those who believe, preach, or practice the religion of Christ, and nothing more. The church of Christ, with her omnipotent Founder to lead, needs no State support, nor will her great charter allow it. To show that the National Reformers hold no such truths as these, we have only to quote from their own official organ, the *Christ**ian Statesman.* That paper says:—

> “We advocate such a religious amendment to the Constitution of the United States as will place all our Christian laws, institutions, and usages on an undeniable legal basis in the very charter of the Government.”

The above language certainly implies an amendment that would give Congress the control of the Christian religion, and it would depend upon the religious complexion of that body whether we had a Protestant or Catholic establishment. They tell us that their amendment would not unite Church and State, for the Constitution already provides that “Congress shall make no laws respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof and that is true, and a glorious truth while it stands there; but we propose to show that their amendment will erase it. For example, Article IV, section 3 of the Constitution provides for the rendition of fugitive slaves, but the thirteenth amendment abolishes slavery entirely, and of course abrogates the rendition article. An amendment always abrogates a former clause inconsistent with that amendment, and the courts will so decide. Now take the *Christian Statesman* for what that amendment is to be, and put it in the Constitution, with congressional power to enforce it, then if you have not got a union of Church and State there is not a lawyer in the United States that can write down with pen and ink what would constitute a legal establishment of religion by the State.

They are challenged and defied to answer the following question without self-stultification: If there was a party in this country that wished to unite Church and State, where else could they begin than with this amendment?
