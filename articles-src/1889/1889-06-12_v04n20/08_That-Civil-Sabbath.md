# That Civil Sabbath.

The New York *Mail and Express* says:—

> “These Sunday newspapers take away the Sabbath of those who make them up and sell them. They teach young people, into whose homes they go, that worldly matters need not be laid aside on Sunday; they secularize the day for every Christian who reads them.”

How do the Sunday newspapers take away the rest of those who work at them on Sunday? Why, just as a farmer’s corn-field takes away his rest when he hoes corn on Sunday. But who is to blame? the farmer or the corn-field? the printer or the Sunday paper? A corn-field or a Sunday paper that is mean enough to take away a man’s rest on Sunday ought to enter the toils of the Inquisition at once.

But why need worldly matters be laid aside on Sunday? Isn’t it a “civil Sunday” that they want the law to enforce by civil penalties? Are not worldly matters civil matters? and is it not proper to attend to civil matters on a civil day?

Again, *“they* secularize the day for every Christian who reads them.” Who secularizes the day for Christians? Is it the paper? or the professed Christians who read it? Is it the cornfield? or the Christian that hoes in it? Why don’t you tell the truth, and put the blame where it belongs? Why don’t you say that these excellent Christians (?) have not enough conscience and moral backbone to do what they believe to be right, and that you want a law that will take away from them all chance to do wrong, so they will be compelled to receive the blessing of God and go to Heaven? Without a Sunday law, no doubt many of these good Christians would continue reading the Sunday newspapers till the day of Judgment; and when asked why they were not ready for Heaven, they would reply, “O Lord, we should have been ready if it had not been for those Sunday papers. You see we tried to get a law to stop them, for we did not want to read them; but they kept on printing them, and they would creep right into our homes on Sunday, and we just had to read them.” And they will expect the Lord to excuse their hypocrisy and pass them into the realms of the blest, while he pronounces judgment upon the Sunday newspapers in the words, “Be ye eternally damned!”

But why should you blame the Sunday papers, or Christians, or anybody else, for secularizing Sunday? Isn’t that what the leaders in the Sunday-law movement profess that they are trying to do? Are they not urging Congress and every State Legislature to pass laws enforcing the observance of Sunday *“as a civil institution,”* and do not secular and civil mean the same thing? We would like to have somebody tell how they can make Sunday a “civil institution” without making it at the same time secular. The Christians who read the Sunday papers are merely carrying out in their actions what those that censure them are trying to enact into law. They are making Sunday a civil, or secular, institution. A. Delos Westcott.

The *Christian Nation* says of such men as Murat Halstead, editor of the Cincinnati *Commercial Gazette,* that “the best thing to do with them is to send them out of the country.” What is his offense? Why, he is not the kind of a politician that suits the National Reform idea. If it will aid in securing the supremacy of his party, he “will openly declare that a Sabbath law cannot be enforced anyhow.” That makes him an awfully bad man from a National Reform standpoint, and he “should not be appointed to any office.” It is said that “coming events cast their shadows before,” and such utterances as these from the *Christian Nation* show what kind of a Government we may expect when the “Reformers” shall have succeeded in making this a “Christian Nation” by constitutional amendment. They make very smooth pretensions, but occasionally the real spirit of the religious amendment movement crops out. The foregoing is in perfect keeping with the sentiments expressed by leading National Reformers on various occasions, and is a fair indication of their ultimate intentions. [159-160]

Note.—No papers are sent by the publishers of the American Sentinel to people who have not subscribed for it. If the Sentinel comes to one who has not subscribed for it, he may know that it is sent him by some friend, and that he will not be called upon by the publishers to pay for the same.

The excellent article, “Is the United States a Christian Nation?” on another page of this paper, is from the *Lutheran Witness,* published in St. Louis, Mo., and is well worth a careful reading. In these days, when, through a mistaken zeal, the leaders of so many of the churches are seeking some sort of an alliance with the civil power, it is refreshing to find in the organ of one of the oldest and most respectable denominations, the proper relation of Church and State so clearly set forth. The sentiments expressed in the article are not only Lutheran doctrine relative to Church and State, but they are the doctrine of all true Protestants of whatever name.

M. A. Gault, district secretary of the National Reform Association, says that there are four ways by which this may be made a Christian Nation, namely, first, agitation; second, petition; third, by the ballot; fourth, by the sword. In attempted justification of the latter method, he says: “Don’t think we are advocating war; but if we are not faithful in the use of these other means, as it was with the anti-slavery question, after they had agitated and petitioned, and used the ballot, they drew the sword; *so shall we, as a last resort, be compelled to use the sword and the bullet.”* And in this he exposes the true animus of the association to which he belongs.

Discussing Sunday laws in a recent letter to that paper, the Washington correspondent of the *Christian Standard* says:—

> “No State Legislature has a right to pass a law because it is the will of God; to put on the statute books, for example, the first and second commandments; to legislate people into Christianity. To do this would be for the State to establish a religion, and to infringe that right of self-liberty which is the atmosphere of our Constitution and laws. Again, it will not do to pass a law for the benefit of the individual; to make a man more moral; to compel a man to attend divine worship. To do so would violate liberty.”

Yet, strange to say, that same correspondent urges the passage and the enforcement of laws compelling everybody to rest upon Sunday. His want of consistency brands him as a genuine National Reformer.

The St. Louis *Observer* says:—

> “Christ’s kingdom is not of this world. The church is not a police board, nor Cesar’s lieutenant, but a Saviour of lost sinners. Its simple, sole, glorious mission is to bring sinners to Jesus by preaching the gospel to them with the Holy Ghost sent down from Heaven.”

And commenting upon this the Cedar County (Neb.) *Nonpareil* remarks:—

> “This has been our idea of true Christianity, and of the duty of the church. That is, to convert, to preach the gospel, and argue, and appeal to man’s better nature—rather than to say to the sinner, You must do this and you must not do that, and meddle with politics and pass laws in the attempt to compel people by force to be good.”

All of which is sound and in accordance with the principles advocated by the American Sentinel.

The *Christian Statesman* of May 16 has the following item:—

> “There is sufficient justification for a general movement of workingmen to recover their lost Sabbath, in the following words of Carroll D. Wright: ‘No man likes to work on Sunday; the only railroad men who favor Sunday work are those who don’t work themselves on that day.’ At the same time, while this would justify a general movement of the working classes, it will never bring it about. The only motive strong enough to preserve and maintain the Sabbath is the religious motive. The fear of God is the only sufficient defense for the rights of man!”

We doubt Mr. Carroll’s statement, though possibly he may voice the feelings of the majority of railroad men; but even if they all want to rest on Sunday that would not justify a law compelling other people to rest if they don’t want to. But the point to which we wished specially to call attention is the admission made in the latter part of the paragraph quoted, namely, that the religious motive is the only one strong enough to maintain Sunday rest. It has been most persistently urged that the movement in favor of Sunday laws was not from a religious but from a sanitary standpoint; now the *Statesman* candidly acknowledges that the religious motive is the only one strong enough to do the work. It follows that if the religious element is the stronger it must give its color to the whole thing, and so, after all the denials, the demand for Sunday laws is a demand for religious legislation.

A minister of the Christian Church writes from Winters, Cal., to a friend of the American Sentinel, as follows:—

Dear Sir: Your letter is before me. In reply, will say, first, I am opposed to civil enactment for the purpose of compelling obedience to religious rites, ceremonies, ordinances, or institutions. Such laws contravene the law of God and invade the rights of men. God requires a willing and personal obedience, not one made mandatory by civil enactment. Man is accountable to God alone for his religious faith and practice. I regard the efforts being put forth by the Sabbath Union as Gentile-Judaism gone mad. Such laws as they seek to have enacted would be subversive of every principle of individual religious liberty, and would outrage the consciences of Christian people who fail to understand that God made a mistake and meant the first day when he commanded all Israel to observe the seventh day as a Sabbath of rest.

I doubt the wisdom of a law compelling the people to rest one day in seven as a police measure, and when a civil enactment intervenes to compel all people to observe the first day of the week as a Sabbath such intervention is an outrage upon personal liberty. The right of candid investigation and independent inquiry in all matters pertaining to faith and morality are through such laws slaughtered by blind fanaticism, religious bigotry, and intolerance. Such a law would be an unwarranted assumption of power.

As a Disciple I do not feel it my duty to observe any day as a Sabbath. It seems to me, however, to be the climax of absurdity and religious ignorance for these first-day-of-the-week- Sabbath observers to base their authority upon the fourth command of the decalogue, which plainly made mandatory the observance of the seventh day. In all the Old Testament Scriptures no reference is made to the first day of the week as a Sabbath-day, and to use the fourth command of the decalogue to prove that the first day of the week is a Sabbath-day, or to enforce its observance as such, is about as logical as an essay on botany for the solution of a mathematical problem. While I do not indorse all of the religious views of the American Sentinel, I can but admire its ability, honesty, and devotion to personal liberty in religious faith and practice, and its able defense of such liberty.

I am, with great respect, your humble servant.

Sunday-law advocates claim that such legislation is no infringement upon the rights of those who observe the seventh-day Sabbath, as they are at perfect liberty to keep any day they choose. Suppose that we have a Monday law, instead of a Sunday law, would the first-day philanthropists think that it was no hardship on them to forego business on that day on account of their conscientious rest on Sunday? Indeed, they would not so admit. One of their strong arguments in favor of a law to compel all classes to close business on Sunday is, that he who conscientiously rests on Sunday cannot successfully compete with others who continue their business seven days. They protest against the financial disadvantage against which the Sunday man labors in resting while others work, but claim that it is no disadvantage to the seventh-day man to be required to do the same thing. The man who is foolish enough to keep the seventh day according to the fourth commandment, ought to be willing to pay tribute of one work day’s income for the privilege of obeying God—in this land of liberty! This is another specimen of National Reform consistency.

On another page we publish a letter from a Baptist minister of this State, which breathes true Baptist principles. Indeed, as we not long since told a prominent Baptist clergyman of this State, the principles for which the American Sentinel contends are those for which Roger Williams contended, and every consistent Baptist will be with us. We are sorry to know, however, that all Baptists are not consistent. Many forget the persecution which Baptists suffered for their religion in the early history of this country, and are willing, in turn, to become persecutors for conscience’ sake. A ease in point is called to mind by the reference made in this letter to the sermon preached by Rev. R. D. Clark, of Eureka, which was recently published in the Sentinel. Because of that sermon, Mr Clark has been compelled to resign his pastorate. But we rejoice to know that there are many, not only among the Baptists, but among all the denominations, who heartily indorse the work of the Sentinel.

Western civilization utterly repudiates the idea of paternal government, and denies the existence of any analogy between the family and the State.—*President George Washburn. *[161]
