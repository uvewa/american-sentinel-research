This question is answered in the affirmative by most Christians living in our glorious country. Let us see if the affirmation is based upon truth. How do those who hold that we are a Christian Nation prove, or attempt to prove, such to be a fact? Some would-be proofs for our national Christianity have recently come to our notice in the *Rocky Mountain News,* a leading political paper in this section of the country. Before giving his reasons why we are a Christian Nation, the editor of the *News* in the issue of April 11, by way of general remark, says: "It is singular that an intelligent person should question a proposition that is so palpably true." That proposition, however, is not so palpably true as the editor would imagine. "The truth is," the editor says a few sentences further onward, "that it (the first amendment to the Constitution of the United States) merely establishes an equality of rights among Christian denominations, and incidentally admits and tolerates unbelief." This sentence misrepresents the first amendment entirely; but even if the sentence contained the truth, does the fact, we ask, that the Nation in its Constitution establishes, and that *merely* establishes, an equality of rights among the various Christian denominations, constitute it a Christian Nation? No, no more than does the "incidental toleration of unbelief" constitute it an infidel Nation.

One of the "reasons" why we are a Christian Nation, according to the *News,* is the following: "The Nation was established by Christians and is [157] still mainly composed of the same class of beings." But an institution established by Christians is not necessarily a Christian institution; the church fair of the Roman Catholic Churches in Denver, which was mentioned in No. 15 of the *Witness, *was gotten up and was patronized by persons denominated Christians; but did that fact make it a Christian affair? Then it is not true that the Nation at the present time is mainly composed of Christians. Statistics serve to show that only one- third of the population of the country is professedly Christian. Another proof advanced for our being a Christian Nation is the fact, as the editor says, that the Christian religion was recognized in various conventions prior to the Continental Congress, also in that Congress, also in the Constitution, in so far as the latter has "the provision that precludes Congress from 'prohibiting the free exercise thereof.'" But recognizing the Christian religion in the manner in which the Constitution does, this does not make the respective person or Nation a Christian person or Nation. For how is it recognized? Is it recognized by the Nation in its Constitution by declaring it to be the religion of the Nation? No; the Christian religion is recognized by the Nation only in so far as in its Constitution it declares this religion to be one which the members of the Nation may believe, and the precepts of which they may practice. Then the Christian religion is not even definitely or separately mentioned, but all other religions are placed on the same plane with it, and as far as the Constitution is concerned are entitled to equal respect, belief, and practice in this country.

These proofs for our being a Christian Nation, it is evident, we trust, are unsound; let us throw them overboard. If this is all that can be adduced as proof that we are a Christian Nation, then the assertion may fearlessly be made that we are *not* a Christian Nation.

In order to set forth the truth of this proposition more plainly, it must continually be borne in mind what constitutes a nation. A nation is a mass of people living in a given country and governed according to given laws, which are in conformity with a certain so-called constitution. Now in order to determine whether a nation is monarchical, aristocratic, or democratic, reference must be had to the constitution of that nation, and not to the private opinions of its different members. For, granted that, in the present day, a majority of our people, which, however, we hope is not the case, were monarchical in their views and tendencies, would that make our Nation a monarchy? Not at all! But those people *could* make this Nation monarchical, provided they were sufficiently strong in numbers to have the Constitution altered according to their wishes, and actually had this done. But so long as that has not been accomplished, the Nation remains a democracy, in consequence of the Constitution declaring it such and actually constituting it such.

Likewise, if we wish to determine whether the United States *as a Nation* is a religious Nation, we must not ask, Are the majority of the people religious or not? but recourse must be had to the Constitution. Now is the United States a religious Nation? Yes, if the word religion is taken in its broadest sense; for the Constitution, indirectly at least, as we take it, recognizes a God, a supreme Being, for instance, in Art. II, Sec. 1, No. 9. But is the United States a Christian Nation? No; for nowhere in the Constitution can there be found one word that recognizes the Christian God and the Christian religion, nor that can be construed as recognizing them. So little does the Constitution even dream of doing this that it forbids it in its very first amendment, which is as follows: *"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; *or abridging the freedom of speech or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances."

In the *Rocky Mountain News* of March 25, of the present year, there is an article in which the following words occur pertaining to the Christian religion and the Constitution of the United States: "In a letter published in the *Sentinel,* December 5, 1789, addressed to the Presbyterians of New Hampshire and Massachusetts (who had complained of the omission of an acknowledgment of God in the Constitution) George Washington said that religion was left out of that document 'because it belongs to the churches and not to the State.' 'Religion,' said Madison, 'is not within the purview of human government.' Benjamin Franklin wrote, October 9, 1780: 'When a religion is good I conceive that it will support itself, and when it cannot support itself, and God does not care to support it, so that its professors are obliged to call for help of the civil power, it is a sign, I apprehend, of its being a bad one.' Justice Story said; 'It was deemed advisable to exclude from the National Government all power upon the subject. The Catholic and the Protestant, the Calvinist and the Armenian, the Jew and the infidel, may sit down to the common table of our national councils.' A treaty adopted between the United States and Tripoli, November 4, 1796, signed by George Washington, contains this sentiment: 'The Government of the United States is not in any sense founded on the Christian religion.'"

These sentiments express the Lutheran doctrine concerning Church and State. The Church and the State are two radically different institutions, each moving in a sphere peculiar to itself. Let each remain in its own sphere; let neither interfere with the affairs of the other. Both have a work to perform; let each perform the work appointed to itself.—*Rev. H. Raup, in Lutheran Witness, St. Louis, May 7, 1889.*
