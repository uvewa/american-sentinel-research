The *Christian Union* of May 9 notes the action of Vanderbilt in reducing Sunday travel on his railroads, and says: The thanks of the religious community are especially due to Mr. Cornelius Vanderbilt, whose persistent urgency in this matter has at length borne fruit." Why the thanks of the religious community? They tell us that this Sunday-rest movement is not a religious affair at all, but that it was started by the workingmen, and is solely in the interest of the workingmen. Then why should religious people feel specially thankful, since, according to Mr. Crafts, they only reluctantly took part in the crusade at the urgent request of the laboring classes? It doesn't require very much discernment to tell why the religious community alone are mentioned as feeling thankful. The religious (not necessarily Christian) community alone are interested in it. The majority of the laboring men are indifferent or opposed.
