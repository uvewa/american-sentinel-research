De Witt C. Davis, attorney-at-law in Texas, says:—

> "I have read the American Sentinel for two years, and the more I read it the better I am pleased with it. I am entirely with you in opposition to changing our United States Constitution so as to *turn Congress loose—*backed up by all the clergymen or the preachers of the Union—to legislate on religion and Sunday questions. When this shall be done, the 'Pandora's box' of American troubles will be opened. If the pious regard for Sunday and religion has to be enforced by law, then the liberty of conscience in such matters, granted to us by the Constitution, will be destroyed. Then whose conscience shall we obey? I send you a postal note for $1.00. Please send me the weekly American Sentinel for one year."

Rev. P. Raether, of Ohio, writes:—

> "Inclosed I send you $1.00, for which you will please send me your paper. I learned to know the Sentinel of late, and I like its manly, candid tone in opposing any movement subversive to the free institutions of our republic. "

J. R. Brooks, of Texas, says:—

> "The petition work as a remonstrance against the Blair bill meets great favor in the country. I have been taking signatures. Have filled and returned four petitions in a very short time. Gentlemen and ladies sign the petitions without hesitation. They are Catholics and all classes. The people here are generally opposed to the Blair bill *in toto.* While working up signatures I am often congratulated with expressions like these: 'Go ahead, you are doing a good work.' 'The Constitution is good enough as it is.' 'We are living in a free country and want it to remain so,' etc."

From the law office of S. P. Romans, of Deadwood, Dak., we received the following:—

> "Gentlemen: For some months past I have been receiving your paper from some friend who thought my ideas concurred with the American Sentinel. For many years I have been quite a searcher for Bible truths, but have failed to find the truth as expressed by the Catholic Church or her daughters. Hence I have looked in another direction, *i.* e., the Bible. I find the Sentinel is just right in its ideas of secular or governmental affairs. I herewith inclose postal note for $1.00, for which please send to my address the American Sentinel for one year, also fifty cents, for which send extra copies of your own selection for distribution in my town, and I will see that they are placed where they will do the most good, and bear fruit."

A lady in Auburn, Cal., writes:—

> "I am an American woman, and in favor of American institutions, American principles and patriotism, and strongly opposed to alien influences in politics and the control of our public institutions—*especially our schools—*and just as strongly to church influences in those places. Send me the American Sentinel."

Rev. C. F. W. Meyer, of Missouri, says:—

> "I fully indorse your views. I sincerely hope that your noble efforts will be successful in keeping Church and State *severely *separate."

B. Hillens, of Kansas, writes:—

> "I am heartily in sympathy with the principles which the Sentinel advocates, and always have been. I have loaned my papers to several persons, and solicited their subscriptions, and shall continue getting subscribers for it, believing it is calling loudly for something to be done in appreciation of the value of religious liberty which has caused others before us such sacrifice and labor that Heaven could grant this great boon to after generations. Send me what free reading you can and I will distribute it."

A lady in Alpena, Mich., sending in six yearly subscriptions to the American Sentinel, at $1.00 each, says:—

> "I wish our people would raise money to put the Sentinel in every Protestant minister's family in the United States. It would open the eyes of all who are now honest but blind in their work." [105]
