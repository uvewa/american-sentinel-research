A few weeks ago we stated that the Arkansas Legislature had passed a memorial asking Congress not to pass the Blair Sunday-Best bill. We are now informed that this was a mistake. We wondered at the time how so great a change could be effected in so short a time, but seeing the statement in two good Eastern papers, and no contradiction, we supposed it must be true. We are sorry to be obliged to make this correction, not on our own account, as the mistake was no fault of ours, but we are sorry to be obliged to take back the good opinion which we expressed concerning the Arkansas Legislature.
