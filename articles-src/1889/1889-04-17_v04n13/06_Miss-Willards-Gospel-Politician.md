In the notices of Miss Willard's forth-coming autobiography, she is mentioned as claiming to be a "gospel politician." That means that she favors spreading the gospel by political methods, which is, by voting upon it, and making laws concerning it. In other words, she is devoted to the union of Church and State. But that doesn't make us think that such a union ought to be consummated. The apostle Paul said that even an angel from Heaven should be cursed if he preached different gospel from that delivered by Christ.
