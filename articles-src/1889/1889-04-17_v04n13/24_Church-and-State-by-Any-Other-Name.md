As noticed elsewhere, the *Christian Statesman *says that "what with card-playing, Sunday newspaper reading, and using the Sunday trains for business and pleasures, you cannot tell the difference between the church and the world."

Which church does it mean? Is it the Reformed Presbyterian, or the Methodist, or the Baptist? Everybody will know at once that it has no reference to any sect, but to the great body of professed Christians. Now we hope, since it uses the word "church" in that sense,—the most common use of all,—that it will cease beating about the bush when we talk about the union of Church and State. It has always dodged the point by insisting that such union must necessarily be the selection and support of one sect by the State, and that it did not favor that. Of course not. But it favors State legislation in favor of all professed Christians; and since it classes these under the general head, "the church," why can it not come out squarely and acknowledge that it is in favor of Church and State? Will the *Statesman* please answer?
