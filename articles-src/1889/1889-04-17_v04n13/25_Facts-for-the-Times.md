> "Facts for the Times" is the name of a useful work for sale at this office. It is made up of extracts from ancient and modern writers bearing upon a wide range of Bible subjects. It is not designed to detract from the authority of the Bible in any way, but to show what good and great men of the past believed, or were compelled by force of evidence to admit, concerning some of the great doctrines of the Bible. It clearly shows that many of what are called "new doctrines" are old, and have been held by respected men of other generations. It also shows the difference between the religious teaching of to-day and that of previous times. Extracts and comments from different writers to the number of nearly one thousand are given on remarkable fulfillments of prophecy, difficult Scripture texts, natural phenomena, facts connected with our country's history, statistics of population, intemperance war, and crime, condition of the religious, political, and physical world, and many other subjects of interest. The book is also of assistance many times in helping the reader to come to correct conclusions on many important subjects, and to lead him to the "old paths" of truth. It contains nearly three hundred octavo pages, well bound in cloth. Price, post-paid, 50 cents. Address the Pacific Press, Oakland, Cal.
