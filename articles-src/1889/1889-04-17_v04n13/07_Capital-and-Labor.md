# Capital and Labor.

The fallacy which is common to almost all labor organizations, and which the leaders and “walking delegates” of these organizations generally do their utmost to propagate among workingmen, and that, too, for selfish purposes, consists in the assumption that there is a real conflict between the two classes represented by the terms “capital” and “labor.” The term “capital” means those who have an accumulated capital, and are engaged in some form of business that makes it necessary for them to become the employers of others, paying them wages for their labor. The term “labor” means those who, not having capital which they can invest in any branch of business, have nothing to sell but their labor, and support themselves and their families out of the wages paid to them by their employers. The one class want and need to buy labor, and the other class just as much want and need to sell labor. Both classes, so far from being arrayed against each other, are supplementary to each other and mutually dependent upon each other. Neither can get along without the other. There is no just occasion for any war between them any more than between the buyers and sellers of commodities. Their interests are not conflicting but coincident and mutually contributory.

What is the rate of compensation that capital ought to pay to labor? How much shall the seller of labor receive from the employer for the service rendered by the former to the latter? There is only one practical answer to this question; and that answer, in the long run, and as a general rule, will be more equitable than any other which it is possible to give, where buyers and sellers are left free to make their own bargains. The law of *supply* and *demand,* under free competition, will fix the price of labor as between buyers and sellers of labor, just as it fixes the price of all commodities that come into the market to be bought and sold. When the demand exceeds the supply of labor, wages will rise; and when the supply exceeds the demand, wages will just as naturally fall to a lower mark. When buyers compete with each other, prices necessarily advance; and when sellers compete with each other, they as necessarily go down. This has been the history of the world ever since men began to buy and sell; and it will continue to be its history through all time. The result is an average market price, which the buyer must pay and the seller must accept.

All the labor organizations that were ever gotten up by men cannot repeal this law, or put in its place any other law that would, on the whole, work better for the interests of human society, including all classes. Such organizations may for a short period force prices out of their natural course; but in the end they will come back again under the general law of supply and demand. Such has been the fact in the past, and we conclude that it will be so in the future.

The plain truth is, that capital and labor are naturally and necessarily co-operative and not antagonistical. They have common interests, and work together, and must work together. All that capital needs is a free market in which to buy, and all that labor needs is a free market in which to sell. Give to both a free market without any coercion or constraint on either side, and each in serving itself will, under the natural laws of trade, serve the others. “Walking delegates” and labor “strikes” are a very poor remedy for regulating the rate of wages. They produce far more harm than good, and are a general curse to the best interests of society.—*Independent, N. Y., Jan. 3, 1889.*

The following from the Chicago *Tribune *February 14 is an illustration of the unconscionable tyranny of the spirit of trades unionism:—

The brutality of trades unionism reached its climax in Brooklyn Tuesday when a walking delegate stopped a funeral procession because there was a “scab” cab in the line. The living have had to submit to considerable inconvenience in their affairs from time to time, to meet the requirements of these associations. It was scarcely to be expected that the dead would be kept above the earth until the orders of the walking delegate should be obeyed. But in the instance alluded, to the funeral halted and remained at a standstill until the offensive cab was driven away, and then the offices of humanity were permitted to proceed. It is incredible that any intelligent body of men approve of so brutal a business; and if the walking delegate who made so unseemly a disturbance is not removed from a post he has so discreditably filled, the reputation of his union ought to be settled with the people of Brooklyn. They should give it a thorough taste of its own medicine.

At the quarterly convention of the Alleghany County (Pa.) W. C. T. U., Mrs. Sarah E. Gemmill made a strong plea for National Reform, closing her speech as follows: “I ask you as Christian women to help amend the Constitution of our Nation, so that it will acknowledge God as the source of authority, Jesus as the Ruler, and the Bible as the standard by which all moral issues in the political world are to be decided.” [103-104]

Note.—No papers are sent by the publishers of the American Sentinel to people who have not subscribed for it. If the Sentinel comes to one who has not subscribed for it, he may know that it is sent him by some friend, and that he will not be called upon by the publishers to pay for the same.

The authorities of Baltimore forbade any Sunday parade on St. Patrick’s day, and also prevented Forepaugh’s circus from entering the city on that day.

The Committee on Criminal Jurisprudence in the Missouri Legislature, March 12, reported favorably a bill introduced by Mr. Moore, of Laclede, prohibiting the playing of base-ball on Sunday.

A bill is now before the Massachusetts Legislature to abolish Sunday towing, and it is said that a large majority of the tow-boat engineers of Boston are in favor of its passage. What puzzles us is why in the world they don’t stop towing on Sunday, if they don’t want to do it. If a large majority of Boston’s tow-boat engineers refused to work on Sunday, it is certain that very little towing would be done. It seems that they don’t want to stop towing on Sunday enough to stop without a law compelling them to stop.

A few weeks ago we stated that the Arkansas Legislature had passed a memorial asking Congress not to pass the Blair Sunday-Best bill. We are now informed that this was a mistake. We wondered at the time how so great a change could be effected in so short a time, but seeing the statement in two good Eastern papers, and no contradiction, we supposed it must be true. We are sorry to be obliged to make this correction, not on our own account, as the mistake was no fault of ours, but we are sorry to be obliged to take back the good opinion which we expressed concerning the Arkansas Legislature.

Says the *Christian Statesman* of March 21:—

> “Either the Sabbath must be redeemed, or the battle is lost. What with card playing, dancing, Sunday newspaper reading, and using the Sunday train for business and pleasure, you cannot tell the difference between the church and the world.”

Consequently it wants rigid Sunday laws enacted and enforced. That is, the State must pass laws to compel church-members, professed Christians, to live up to their profession, outwardly at least. But then those laws will bear equally upon church-members and the world, compelling all to rest on Sunday, so that there will be as little difference between the church and the world as there was before. Then the church will be a bright and shining light, made so by civil enactment; and the world will by the same power be made Christian. How easily the world may be converted—nominally.

The Chicago *Standard’s* Washington correspondent says: “The fact that the two great divisions of Christians, Protestants and Catholics, are substantially mutual in support of a national enactment making the Sabbath a day of rest to the whole people, and of religious observance, gives the subject an importance Congress can scarcely dare to disregard.” Such significant statements as this are quite common. Notice the admission that it is “Christian” union that is expected to be so powerful in behalf of Sunday that Congress will not *dare* disregard it. Notice also that “the Sabbath” is to be made for “the whole people” a day of rest “and of religious observance.” Such statements do not surprise us any, for we have known from the beginning what the Sunday-law people were after; but they serve to enable others to rate at their true value their assertions that “this movement is wholly in the interest of the workingman.”

Mr. Depew is quoted as saying that “nothing in nature or art goes to pieces so fast as a man in idleness,” and making the application to the proposition of the State of New York to keep its criminals in idleness, “with the certain result of greater moral degeneration.” Upon this, the *Moral and Scientific Companion,* published at Florence, A. T., very aptly comments as follows:

> “And yet the Sunday-law advocates propose to keep the entire population of the United States in idleness during the first day of every week. If this will not result in ‘greater moral degeneration’ and mischief making, then human nature must be wonderfully changed. When a man’s conscience tells him to sanctify the Sabbath, that conscience will lead him to reverence the time that belongs to his God; but when a man of worldly ideas is forced into idleness it is time to expect mischief.”

The *Christian Union* is an advocate of Sunday laws, and is opposed to the Sunday newspaper, yet it pricks some of the sophistical bubbles which Sunday-law zealots have blown for their own amusement, and for the beguilement of the unwary. It says that the objection to the Sunday newspaper “is not that it entails Sabbath work, for it does not entail as much work as the Monday newspaper; nor is it because it sets the newsboys at selling papers, for Sunday labor is no more demoralizing than Sunday loafing, and the newsboys do not attend worshiping assemblies on Sabbath morning in any very great numbers; nor is it because worshipers sometimes stay at home from church to read their Sunday paper, for it will do the ministry no harm to be subjected to a little healthful competition, and the church which depends for its congregation on the fact that they have nothing else to do than to come to church would better stir about and get some other and better dependence.” Good.

As noticed elsewhere, the *Christian Statesman *says that “what with card-playing, Sunday newspaper reading, and using the Sunday trains for business and pleasures, you cannot tell the difference between the church and the world.”

Which church does it mean? Is it the Reformed Presbyterian, or the Methodist, or the Baptist? Everybody will know at once that it has no reference to any sect, but to the great body of professed Christians. Now we hope, since it uses the word “church” in that sense,—the most common use of all,—that it will cease beating about the bush when we talk about the union of Church and State. It has always dodged the point by insisting that such union must necessarily be the selection and support of one sect by the State, and that it did not favor that. Of course not. But it favors State legislation in favor of all professed Christians; and since it classes these under the general head, “the church,” why can it not come out squarely and acknowledge that it is in favor of Church and State? Will the *Statesman* please answer?

> “Facts for the Times” is the name of a useful work for sale at this office. It is made up of extracts from ancient and modern writers bearing upon a wide range of Bible subjects. It is not designed to detract from the authority of the Bible In any way, but to show what good and great men of the past believed, or were compelled by force of evidence to admit, concerning some of the great doctrines of the Bible. It clearly shows that many of what are called “new doctrines” are old, and have been held by respected men of other generations. It also shows the difference between the religious teaching of to-day and that of previous times. Extracts and comments from different writers to the number of nearly one thousand are given on remarkable fulfillments of prophecy, difficult Scripture texts, natural phenomena, facts connected with our country’s history, statistics of population, intemperance war, and crime, condition of the religious, political, and physical world, and many other subjects of interest. The book is also of assistance many times in helping the reader to come to correct conclusions on many important subjects, and to lead him to the “old paths” of truth. It contains nearly three hundred octavo pages, well bound in cloth. Price, post-paid, 50 cents. Address the Pacific Press, Oakland, Cal.

De Witt C. Davis, attomey-at-law in Texas, says:—

> “I have read the American Sentinel for two years, and the more I read it the better I am pleased with it. I am entirely with you in opposition to changing our United States Constitution so as to *turn Congress loose—*backed up by all the clergymen or the preachers of the Union—to legislate on religion and Sunday questions. When this shall be done, the ‘Pandora’s box’ of American troubles will be opened. If the pious regard for Sunday and religion has to be enforced by law, then the liberty of conscience in such matters, granted to us by the Constitution, will be destroyed. Then whose conscience shall we obey? I send you a postal note for $1.00. Please send me the weekly American Sentinel for one year.”

Rev. P. Raether, of Ohio, writes:—

> “Inclosed I send you $1.00, for which you will please send me your paper. I learned to know the Sentinel of late, and I like its manly, candid tone in opposing any movement subversive to the free institutions of our republic. “

J. R. Brooks, of Texas, says:—

> “The petition work as a remonstrance against the Blair bill meets great favor in the country. I have been taking signatures. Have filled and returned four petitions in a very short time. Gentlemen and ladies sign the petitions without hesitation. They are Catholics and all classes. The people here are generally opposed to the Blair bill *in toto.* While working up signatures I am often congratulated with expressions like these: ‘Go ahead, you are doing a good work.’ ‘The Constitution is good enough as it is.’ ‘We are living in a free country and want it to remain so,’ etc.”

From the law office of S. P. Romans, of Deadwood, Dak., we received the following:—

> “Gentlemen: For some months past I have been receiving your paper from some friend who thought my ideas concurred with the American Sentinel. For many years I have been quite a searcher for Bible truths, but have failed to find the truth as expressed by the Catholic Church or her daughters. Hence I have looked in another direction, *i.* e., the Bible. I find the Sentinel is just right in its ideas of secular or governmental affairs. I herewith inclose postal note for $1.00, for which please send to my address the American Sentinel for one year, also fifty cents, for which send extra copies of your own selection for distribution in my town, and I will see that they are placed where they will do the most good, and bear fruit.”

A lady in Auburn, Cal., writes:—

> “I am an American woman, and in favor of American institutions, American principles and patriotism, and strongly opposed to alien influences in politics and the control of our public institutions—*especially our schools—*and just as strongly to church influences in those places. Send me the American Sentinel.”

Rev. C. F. W. Meyer, of Missouri, says:—

> “I fully indorse your views. I sincerely hope that your noble efforts will be successful in keeping Church and State *severely *separate.”

B. Hillens, of Kansas, writes:—

> “I am heartily in sympathy with the principles which the Sentinel advocates, and always have been. I have loaned my papers to several persons, and solicited their subscriptions, and shall continue getting subscribers for it, believing it is calling loudly for something to be done in appreciation of the value of religious liberty which has caused others before us such sacrifice and labor that Heaven could grant this great boon to after generations. Send me what free reading you can and I will distribute it.”

A lady in Alpena, Mich., sending in six yearly subscriptions to the American Sentinel, at $1.00 each, says:—

> “I wish our people would raise money to put the Sentinel in every Protestant minister’s family in the United States. It would open the eyes of all who are now honest but blind in their work.” [105]
