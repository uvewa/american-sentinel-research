The Chicago *Standard's* Washington correspondent says: "The fact that the two great divisions of Christians, Protestants and Catholics, are substantially mutual in support of a national enactment making the Sabbath a day of rest to the whole people, and of religious observance, gives the subject an importance Congress can scarcely dare to disregard." Such significant statements as this are quite common. Notice the admission that it is "Christian" union that is expected to be so powerful in behalf of Sunday that Congress will not *dare* disregard it. Notice also that "the Sabbath" is to be made for "the whole people" a day of rest "and of religious observance." Such statements do not surprise us any, for we have known from the beginning what the Sunday-law people were after; but they serve to enable others to rate at their true value their assertions that "this movement is wholly in the interest of the workingman."
