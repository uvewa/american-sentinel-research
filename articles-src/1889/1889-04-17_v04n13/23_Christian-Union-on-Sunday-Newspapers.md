The *Christian Union* is an advocate of Sunday laws, and is opposed to the Sunday newspaper, yet it pricks some of the sophistical bubbles which Sunday-law zealots have blown for their own amusement, and for the beguilement of the unwary. It says that the objection to the Sunday newspaper "is not that it entails Sabbath work, for it does not entail as much work as the Monday newspaper; nor is it because it sets the newsboys at selling papers, for Sunday labor is no more demoralizing than Sunday loafing, and the newsboys do not attend worshiping assemblies on Sabbath morning in any very great numbers; nor is it because worshipers sometimes stay at home from church to read their Sunday paper, for it will do the ministry no harm to be subjected to a little healthful competition, and the church which depends for its congregation on the fact that they have nothing else to do than to come to church would better stir about and get some other and better dependence." Good.
