The Key West (Florida) *Democrat* says that "what is now agitating the average Key West store keeper, to the exclusion of other matters, is the proposed enforcement of the Sunday law." It adds: "Without being fanatical upon the subject, we would unequivocally say that we are in favor of its enforcement without fear or favor," and says that the sheriff of the county pledges himself to enforce the law, and that the mayor and the marshal are also pledged to it. Thus we see that the Sunday question is coming to the front in all sections.
