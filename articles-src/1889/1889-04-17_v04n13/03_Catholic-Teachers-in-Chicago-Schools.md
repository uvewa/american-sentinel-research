A friend in Chicago writes as follows in a personal letter to the editor of the Sentinel:—

> "There cannot be too much vigilance or too much sounding forth of danger. I am told by a high-school girl that sixty-five teachers have been removed in this city within a few months, who were Protestants, and that sixty Catholics were among the teachers put in their places. If the Protestants try to manage schools on a religious basis, they will find themselves outwitted as well as outnumbered (in large cities) by the Romanist element. Yours for Americanism and undefiled religion."
