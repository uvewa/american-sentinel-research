The following from the Chicago *Tribune *February 14 is an illustration of the unconscionable tyranny of the spirit of trades unionism:—

The brutality of trades unionism reached its climax in Brooklyn Tuesday when a walking delegate stopped a funeral procession because there was a "scab" cab in the line. The living have had to submit to considerable inconvenience in their affairs from time to time, to meet the requirements of these associations. It was scarcely to be expected that the dead would be kept above the earth until the orders of the walking delegate should be obeyed. But in the instance alluded, to the funeral halted and remained at a standstill until the offensive cab was driven away, and then the offices of humanity were permitted to proceed. It is incredible that any intelligent body of men approve of so brutal a business; and if the walking delegate who made so unseemly a disturbance is not removed from a post he has so discreditably filled, the reputation of his union ought to be settled with the people of Brooklyn. They should give it a thorough taste of its own medicine.
