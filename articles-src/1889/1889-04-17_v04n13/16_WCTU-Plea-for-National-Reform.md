At the quarterly convention of the Alleghany County (Pa.) W. C. T. U., Mrs. Sarah E. Gemmill made a strong plea for National Reform, closing her speech as follows: "I ask you as Christian women to help amend the Constitution of our Nation, so that it will acknowledge God as the source of authority, Jesus as the Ruler, and the Bible as the standard by which all moral issues in the political world are to be decided." [103-104]
