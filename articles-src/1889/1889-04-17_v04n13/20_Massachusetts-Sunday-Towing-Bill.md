A bill is now before the Massachusetts Legislature to abolish Sunday towing, and it is said that a large majority of the tow-boat engineers of Boston are in favor of its passage. What puzzles us is why in the world they don't stop towing on Sunday, if they don't want to do it. If a large majority of Boston's tow-boat engineers refused to work on Sunday, it is certain that very little towing would be done. It seems that they don't want to stop towing on Sunday enough to stop without a law compelling them to stop.
