Says the *Christian Statesman* of March 21:—

> "Either the Sabbath must be redeemed, or the battle is lost. What with card playing, dancing, Sunday newspaper reading, and using the Sunday train for business and pleasure, you cannot tell the difference between the church and the world."

Consequently it wants rigid Sunday laws enacted and enforced. That is, the State must pass laws to compel church-members, professed Christians, to live up to their profession, outwardly at least. But then those laws will bear equally upon church-members and the world, compelling all to rest on Sunday, so that there will be as little difference between the church and the world as there was before. Then the church will be a bright and shining light, made so by civil enactment; and the world will by the same power be made Christian. How easily the world may be converted—nominally.
