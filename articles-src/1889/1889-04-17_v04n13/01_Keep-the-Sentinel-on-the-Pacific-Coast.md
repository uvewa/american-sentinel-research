Someone in Pennsylvania writes thus briefly to us: "You will greatly oblige me if you will keep the Sentinel on the Pacific Coast." This person is modest. He doesn't want to control the earth, but only that part of the United States east of the Rocky Mountains. We cannot oblige him, because there are too many thousands of people east of the mountains who want the American Sentinel to come to them.
