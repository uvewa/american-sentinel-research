The Tombstone (Arizona) *Epitaph* of March 9 says of the Sunday bill, which we have elsewhere mentioned:—

> "The Sunday-Rest bill has been laid to sleep for two years at least. The vote making the bill the special order for the evening was considered, and the bill passed in the council some days since was taken up in the House this afternoon, and killed by a vote of fourteen to nine. There were but few persons in the lobby at the time the bill was defeated, but the news spread rapidly through the town and was the general topic of conversation. It is generally understood that the Governor would have vetoed the bill had it passed."

The Omaha *Daily Bee* of March 17 contains an article by Mrs. Elizabeth Cady Stanton, on Sunday newspapers and amusements, the closing paragraphs of which are exceedingly pointed, as will be seen from the following reprint of them:—

> "I cannot see that setting type in order to provide some intellectual pabulum for a community is more of a desecration of the Sabbath than setting tables and cooking food for the family. To be consistent, those who insist on Sunday being a day of rest, should make it a season of fasting and selfdenial for themselves, and of freedom for their wives and servants from all manual labor. The dinner should be cooked on Saturday and served cold on Sunday with primitive simplicity. But the clergy as a class (to say nothing of most of the sons of Adam), are proverbial for their love of good eating, hence we hear very little from the pulpit as to the sin of good dinners on the 'Lord's day.'

> "According to what system of morals is it more sinful for Patrick to set type and read his paper, than for Bridget to cook a turkey and plum pudding and read nothing on Sunday?"
