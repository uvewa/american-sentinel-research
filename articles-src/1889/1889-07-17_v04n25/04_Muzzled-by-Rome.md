# Muzzled by Rome.

In a recent address before the Congregational Ministers’ Meeting in Boston, Professor Townsend, of Boston University, charged that the press of that city is muzzled by the influence of the Catholic Church. Said he:—

> “There is not one of the large newspapers of this city that has not been working almost constantly in the interests of Romanism during the several months of the late Protestant-Jesuit controversy. This conspiracy of the press of Boston to cheat the public of news and facts to which it is entitled is a reproach to our civilization, and deserves the derision and scorn of all honest men.”

Rev. Makepiece Trueworthy makes the same charge concerning Washington City, and not only so but of every city and indeed of the entire work of the Associated Press, and there is every reason to believe that this is true. Just what the people are going to do about it remains to be seen. Professor Townsend declared war against this state of affairs in the following vigorous manner:—

> “The sword has been drawn, the scabbard has been flung to the winds, the bridges have been torn down, and this controversy cannot come to an end until the hand of this foreign power no longer shall be felt pressing with its withering touch upon journalism and all the free institutions of this country, which are as dear as life itself to every true American citizen.” [197]

In view, however, of the fact that in many respects Protestants are advocating the very principles upon which Rome is acting, it does not seem probable that anything will come of the talk. So far as the schools are concerned, Roman Catholics and Protestants stand on substantially the same ground, each advocating that religion should be taught in the schools; the only difference of opinion between them being as to what religion. The Catholics claiming that the distinctive doctrines of their church should be taught, while of course Protestants wish to have that which they hold taught. It is to be feared that the contest will end in a compromise, utterly subversive of religious liberty. Indeed such a compromise has been already suggested in the interest of the Blair Educational Amendment bill.
