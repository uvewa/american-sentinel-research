# "Sweet Reasonableness."

In course of some remarks in the Missouri National Reform Convention, Mr. Crafts said:

> "With sweet reasonableness we should try to show these seventh-day people the mistake of their literalness with reference to the seventh day of the week."

Then he proceeded to tell how in going round the world in one direction a day is lost, and in going the other way a day is gained, consequently the reckoning has to be changed. And he gives this information just as though seventhday people had never heard of it before.

Now, it is a fact that seventh-day people have crossed the "day line" on many occasions, going both ways, and they find no such confusion as Mr. Crafts would warn them against. There are also Jews in every habitable quarter of the globe who keep the seventh day, and we have never heard of any confusion in the matter. This is accounted for on the ground that seventh-day people understand the situation and have sense enough to change their reckoning to agree with their geographical position.

Mr. Crafts cites an illustration to elucidate his position: Chaplain Crawford of the United States Navy, arriving at Samoa, found that the missionaries who first introduced Christianity there, had forgotten to change their reckoning when they crossed the line, and were keeping the "Christian Sabbath" (Sunday) on Saturday. He then makes a sweeping proposition, after this fashion, as quoted in M. A. Gault's letter to the *Christian Statesman:—*

> "As the Jews, Seventh-day Adventists and Seventhday Baptists form together but seven-tenths of one per cent, of the population, it might be well to stop the opposition to our Sunday laws by sending the rabbis and pastors of these literalists to Samoa by the route that would make their Saturday coincide with our Sabbath, as they would surely refuse to throw away any day in their literal devotion to a rigid succession, and then they could be celebrating the feast of creation on what they would call the seventh day of the week, on the same general rest-day that we should consider a feast both of creation and redemption, and called the first day of the week."

The "field secretary" cannot forego his characteristic slurs at minorities that happen to disagree with his schemes; nor can he disguise, if he would, his utter disregard for their rights of conscience. The foregoing is only a gentle hint of the National Reform idea of banishment of offenders to which other leaders in that cause have given more forcible utterance. But here is another clip from the speech on the occasion above referred to, of which Mr. Gault says "every word seemed to strike fire":—

> "The proposed National Sabbath-Rest law, at the utmost would not affect more than one thousand of these seventh-day people, as they cannot be in the mail and military service, and inter-State commerce, and yet keep Saturday, and the further jurisdiction of the law is only in the District of Columbia and the Territories, in which very few of them reside."

The "sweet reasonableness" of this assertion is better appreciated by comparison with some other National Reform claims. They have asserted over and over again that the States cannot enforce their Sunday laws because the Government, over which they have no control, persists in violating them; and the National law is wanted to make the State laws more effective. Again, when they desire to be particularly mild, they profess that it is only designed to give the postal and other Government employes their "much-needed rest." Under the first claim, how is it that it could only affect the seventh-day people in the Territories? Under the second proposition, how should it affect any seventh-day keepers at all, if they cannot be in the mail and military service, and inter- State commerce."

But why all this effort to make the public believe that only seventh-day people have occasion to be alarmed about their rights? It is simply a strained effort to deceive other people. It is designed to convey the idea that the whole question of Sunday laws and religious legislation in general is only a contest between the first and seventh day. If the National Reform manipulators could delude the masses with the idea that it is only a question of which day is the Sabbath that causes opposition to their schemes, they would naturally expect to have an easy victory. And so they would.

But when the people come to understand fully the avowed purpose to change that feature of our Government which recognizes that "Governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed," they will realize that the question as to what particular day they are compelled by human law to observe is of small consequence. Those who are fighting this battle against Church and State union are not contending on the specific day line, in any feature of the question; they are contending for freedom of conscience, not only in regard to the observance or non-observance of the Sabbath, but in regard to every other conviction. When the Reformers shall have secured for this country, the "ideal Sabbath of the Puritans," they will no doubt "go back to the provincial history of this country" for other concomitant fanaticisms, and then it will not make any difference upon which day they are enforced. Then it will be found out, if not before, that the "sweet reasonableness" of the delusions now sung in siren songs, were nothing else than sweet *deceivableness.*W. N. Glenn.
