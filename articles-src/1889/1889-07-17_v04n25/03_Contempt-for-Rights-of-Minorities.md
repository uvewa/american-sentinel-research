Mr. Crafts always speaks of minorities in the most contemptible manner. He never deigns to accord them any rights whatever—if they happen to be opposed to his Sunday Government scheme. On his own theory, he ought to stop his clamoring for legislation to bind the consciences of the majority, which he knows is against this tyrannical work. But this utter contempt for the rights of opponents, be they many or few, shows the character of the Government we shall have when the National Reformers shall have become successful.
