The *Washington Hatchet* of June 9, has a notice of an effort to enforce the Sunday law in Washington, D. C., in which this sentence occurs: "This hypocritical pretense of remembering the Sabbath-day to keep it holy by driving people into all sorts of excesses should be done away with at once." The idea is that people are compelled to rest on Sunday and they are forbidden to go to places of amusement, or rather the museums and other like places of public resort are closed upon that day; hence the people who find time hanging heavily upon their hands, seek pleasure in more doubtful places. It is certainly an evil to compel people to be idle, and then forbid them to engage in innocent recreation. We cannot think but that it is a mistake to make certain acts criminal upon one day which are perfectly legitimate and proper upon other days. The only proper basis for Sabbath observance is a conscientious regard for the law of God.
