The Kansas City ministers hesitate. When Mr. Crafts was in that city a few weeks ago, he appeared before the Ministers' Alliance and gave a detailed account of the workings of the National Reform Association in this country. The Sedalia *Gazette* says: "A motion was made to adopt measures to aid in carrying out the ideas of the association, and the motion carried, but was reconsidered after the reflection that it was well enough for the preachers to be individually interested in the movement, but not as a body."
