That "great credit" claimed for the Vanderbilt railroad system by its general passenger agent, for taking off its Sunday trains, gets another unwitting thrust in the house of its friends. This time it comes from District Secretary Rev. J. M. Foster, who says: "The railroad companies have been pushing their business seven days in the week until it has been overdone. The profits have been cut down until, from *mere mercenary considerations,* they are taking off their Sabbath freights. They can do the work in six days, and *save the extra expense."*
