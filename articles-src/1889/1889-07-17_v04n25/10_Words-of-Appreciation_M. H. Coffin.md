# Words of Appreciation.

The following letter speaks for itself, and is only one of many of a similar nature. It is seldom that we publish anything without the consent of the writer, but we trust that our Colorado friend will pardon this departure from our usual custom. The letter is so frank that we take it that the writer would be perfectly willing to have the public know his sentiments.

Editor American Sentinel, Oakland, Cal.—*My dear Sir and Brother:* I call you brother because you are a friend of liberty, and any friend of liberty is my friend and brother. For some months past a good friend at Boulder, Colorado, has sent me many copies of your paper, which I have perused with pleasure, until now I *want* it, for a time at least.

I am not a Christian of any sort, but I care not however much a person may believe in any religion so long as he is willing that his religion shall stand on its merits, without special favors from the law. You demonstrate the fact that you have faith in your religion, and are willing to have it take its chances with other beliefs. Good. I must also tell you that yours is the first and only Christian paper I ever read whose editors could apparently reason logically on matters pertaining to their religion. In this you seem to be an exception to the rule.

I am very thankful to my friend for putting this paper into my hands; for though I now take all the papers I can well read, I will *take* time to read the American Sentinel. Of the copies sent me I have read, I think, every word of the reading portions, which is something I seldom do in perusing a religious journal.

Inclosed please find $1.25, for which send me the American Sentinel one year and “Civil Government and Religion,” by A. T. Jones. I wish to show my appreciation even of a Christian journal, when worthy, as I deem yours to be. I trust you may long be spared to continue your work.

M. H. Coffin
