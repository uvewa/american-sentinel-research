# The Spirit of Intolerance.

At a State mass convention held in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in the interests of the American Sabbath Union, June 11, an incident occurred which well illustrates the spirit actuating these friends of Sunday legislation, and furnishes a prelude showing the intolerant manner in which they are disposed to deal with all those who differ with them on religious matters.

An attempt to organize a State branch of the association was being made, and the first article of its constitution was under consideration, which read, “The object of this association shall be to preserve the Christian Sabbath, or Lord’s day, as a day of rest and worship.” After it had been read, and the question was open for remarks, a gentleman rose in the audience and stated that in his judgment the article was good as far as it went, but he would like to see in it something a little more definite with reference to how far the matter should be carried, and in what manner it should be accomplished. In regard to this he would offer an amendment, viz.: “The object of this association shall be to preserve the Sabbath as a day of rest and worship; but in securing this object, only education, moral influence, and persuasion shall be employed, and the religious rights of all shall be guarded against compulsory law.”

The words had hardly died on the speaker’s lips, before W. F. Crafts, the renowned field secretary of the American Sabbath Union, sprang to his feet. “I would like to know what denomination this brother represents,” he asked excitedly.

> “The Seventh-day Adventists,” was the reply.

> “Just as I expected!” excitedly rejoined Mr. Crafts. “This convention is called as a State convention of those who represent the Christian Sabbath; and it is not in any sense for those who represent the Saturday Sabbath. It is so understood in all our conventions. These friends have no natural rights in a Christian Sabbath convention, except as hearers and reporters. In no part of the deliberations do they stand with us. They are not with us on the Christian Sabbath. . . . We are glad to have the Seventh-day people with us in our conventions. . . . The floor belongs to the friends of the Christian Sabbath.”
The chair ruled that the point was well taken, seemingly forgetting the fact that on the previous evening he had declared it to be a mass convention, in which all were at liberty to speak.

It is a well-known fact that the National Reform Party, to which the American Sabbath Union is auxiliary, class the Seventh-day people with the atheists, whom Dr. Jonathan Edwards, a Goliah in their army, said he would tolerate as he would a lunatic,—as long as he did not rave he would be willing to tolerate him. No doubt Mr. Crafts considered that this Adventist was raving, since his views did not accord with his own, and so thought that it would be to his best interest to use the power in his hands, and silence him.

A record of the event appeared in the Minneapolis *Evening Star,* under the heading, “Is this Christianity?” Well, indeed, may this secular paper ask the question. No wonder that those who make no profession of religion are astonished at the actions of these men who profess to be followers of the world’s Redeemer. It is not Christianity, nor is true Christianity responsible for it. But it does savor richly of the Dark Ages. If these men thus domineer now, what would they not do if their intolerant schemes had the support of the civil law? Percy T. Magan.
