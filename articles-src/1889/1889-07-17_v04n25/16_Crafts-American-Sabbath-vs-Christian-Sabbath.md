Before the Kansas City Ministers' Alliance, Dr. Crafts explained that his association was advocating an "American Sabbath," and by that he meant "a day of rest, rather than the Christian Sabbath." That plea of merely a day of rest, for the physical benefit of Government and railroad employes, etc., etc., is getting rather stale, in the face of his declaration before the Knights of Labor, that "a weekly day of rest has never been secured in any land except on the basis of religious obligation; take the religion out, and you take the rest out."
