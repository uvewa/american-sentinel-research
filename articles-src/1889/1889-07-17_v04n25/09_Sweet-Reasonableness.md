# Sweet Reasonableness.

In course of some remarks in the Missouri National Reform Convention, Mr. Crafts said:

> “With sweet reasonableness we should try to show these seventh-day people the mistake of their literalness with reference to the seventh day of the week.”

Then he proceeded to tell how in going round the world in one direction a day is lost, and in going the other way a day is gained, consequently the reckoning has to be changed. And he gives this information just as though seventhday people had never heard of it before.

Now, it is a fact that seventh-day people have crossed the “day line” on many occasions, going both ways, and they find no such confusion as Mr. Crafts would warn them against. There are also Jews in every habitable quarter of the globe who keep the seventh day, and we have never heard of any confusion in the matter. This is accounted for on the ground that seventh-day people understand the situation and have sense enough to change their reckoning to agree with their geographical position.

Mr. Crafts cites an illustration to elucidate his position: Chaplain Crawford of the United States Navy, arriving at Samoa, found that the missionaries who first introduced Christianity there, had forgotten to change their reckoning when they crossed the line, and were keeping the “Christian Sabbath” (Sunday) on Saturday. He then makes a sweeping proposition, after this fashion, as quoted in M. A. Gault’s letter to the *Christian Statesman:—*

> “As the Jews, Seventh-day Adventists and Seventhday Baptists form together but seven-tenths of one per cent, of the population, it might be well to stop the opposition to our Sunday laws by sending the rabbis and pastors of these literalists to Samoa by the route that would make their Saturday coincide with our Sabbath, as they would surely refuse to throw away any day in their literal devotion to a rigid succession, and then they could be celebrating the feast of creation on what they would call the seventh day of the week, on the same general rest-day that we should consider a feast both of creation and redemption, and called the first day of the week.”

The “field secretary” cannot forego his characteristic slurs at minorities that happen to disagree with his schemes; nor can he disguise, if he would, his utter disregard for their rights of conscience. The foregoing is only a gentle hint of the National Reform idea of banishment of offenders to which other leaders in that cause have given more forcible utterance. But here is another clip from the speech on the occasion above referred to, of which Mr. Gault says “every word seemed to strike fire”:—

> “The proposed National Sabbath-Rest law, at the utmost would not affect more than one thousand of these seventh-day people, as they cannot be in the mail and military service, and inter-State commerce, and yet keep Saturday, and the further jurisdiction of the law is only in the District of Columbia and the Territories, in which very few of them reside.”

The “sweet reasonableness” of this assertion is better appreciated by comparison with some other National Reform claims. They have asserted over and over again that the States cannot enforce their Sunday laws because the Government, over which they have no control, persists in violating them; and the National law is wanted to make the State laws more effective. Again, when they desire to be particularly mild, they profess that it is only designed to give the postal and other Government employes their “much-needed rest.” Under the first claim, how is it that it could only affect the seventh-day people in the Territories? Under the second proposition, how should it affect any seventh-day keepers at all, if they cannot be in the mail and military service, and inter- State commerce.”

But why all this effort to make the public believe that only seventh-day people have occasion to be alarmed about their rights? It is simply a strained effort to deceive other people. It is designed to convey the idea that the whole question of Sunday laws and religious legislation in general is only a contest between the first and seventh day. If the National Reform manipulators could delude the masses with the idea that it is only a question of which day is the Sabbath that causes opposition to their schemes, they would naturally expect to have an easy victory. And so they would.

But when the people come to understand fully the avowed purpose to change that feature of our Government which recognizes that “Governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed,” they will realize that the question as to what particular day they are compelled by human law to observe is of small consequence. Those who are fighting this battle against Church and State union are not contending on the specific day line, in any feature of the question; they are contending for freedom of conscience, not only in regard to the observance or non-observance of the Sabbath, but in regard to every other conviction. When the Reformers shall have secured for this country, the “ideal Sabbath of the Puritans,” they will no doubt “go back to the provincial history of this country” for other concomitant fanaticisms, and then it will not make any difference upon which day they are enforced. Then it will be found out, if not before, that the “sweet reasonableness” of the delusions now sung in siren songs, were nothing else than sweet *deceivableness.*W. N. Glenn.

Some person has sent us two copies of a tract entitled “Covenanterism, an Exposure of the Project to Put a Religious Creed into the Constitution of the United States,” etc.

The publication may be very good for aught we know, but we cannot speak with certainty as to its merits, not having read it, for the reason that the name of the author has been carefully removed from the copies. We treat anonymous publications in the same manner that we do anonymous letters, namely, consign them to the waste-basket. [199-200]

Note.—No papers are sent by the publishers of the American Sentinel to people who have not subscribed for it. If the Sentinel comes to one who has not subscribed for it, he may know that it is sent him by some friend, and that he will not be called upon by the publishers to pay for the same.

Before the Kansas City Ministers’ Alliance, Dr. Crafts explained that his association was advocating an “American Sabbath,” and by that he meant “a day of rest, rather than the Christian Sabbath.” That plea of merely a day of rest, for the physical benefit of Government and railroad employes, etc., etc., is getting rather stale, in the face of his declaration before the Knights of Labor, that “a weekly day of rest has never been secured in any land except on the basis of religious obligation; take the religion out, and you take the rest out.”

That “great credit” claimed for the Vanderbilt railroad system by its general passenger agent, for taking off its Sunday trains, gets another unwitting thrust in the house of its friends. This time it comes from District Secretary Rev. J. M. Foster, who says: “The railroad companies have been pushing their business seven days in the week until it has been overdone. The profits have been cut down until, from *mere mercenary considerations,* they are taking off their Sabbath freights. They can do the work in six days, and *save the extra expense.”*

According to Dr. Crafts, the Christian religion is not a religion. He argues that the Blair Constitutional Amendment bill proposes to forbid State Legislatures to set up an establishment of religion. This, he says, *strengthens* the Constitution in this respect, which now only forbids Congress to do so. The sophistry of the argument is shown in the fact that, while the first section does forbid the States to establish religion, the second section makes it the express duty of Congress to guarantee that each State shall do that very thing. The provision is for teaching the Christian religion in public schools, the most effectual way possible to “establish” it. To say that this is not establishing religion by the States, is to say that the Christian religion is not a religion.

The National Reform “image” is being pushed forward with unusual vigor the present year. Their financial receipts are said to be gaining; they are adding new features to their work, for the purpose of interesting a wider range of people, and altogether the Executive Committee express hopes for a brilliant future. Miss E. J. Crothers of New York, has been appointed special secretary to promote the formation of “National Reform Circles” of “King’s Daughters;” and Mrs. Mary A. Woodbridge of Ohio, a special secretary to present the cause of National Reform before the higher institutions of learning, in connection with a similar appointment she holds from the National W. C. T. U. In addition to these, special appointments of persons to look after almost every feature of such a work have been made. Perhaps that class of people who are opposed to this traitorous scheme, but still think “there is no danger,” will wake up by and by—when it is too late.

Cardinal Gibbons opposes prohibition, because he thinks it is inefficient, but he is a strenuous advocate of “a severe police Sunday law.” The *Voice* points out the inconsistency of his position, and says that “the prohibitory laws of Maine, Kansas, and Iowa are far better enforced than the Sunday laws of the non-prohibition States.” Then the *Voice* must agree with the American Sentinel, that prohibition, and not Sunday laws, is what temperance people should work for. Let this admission of the *Voice* be borne in mind. The advocates of Sunday laws would have it believed that these are the great and only temperance laws, and have condemned the American Sentinel because it advocates prohibition instead. Nevertheless the truth cannot be hidden, and there are many who will find it.

To anyone who knows anything about the army in time of peace, the pathetic appeals for the “Sunday rest of the soldier,” made by the apostles of National Reform, borders on the ludicrous. There is no place in the country where Sunday is as completely a do-nothing day as in a military garrison. The morning inspection is hardly as much as ordinary people do in dressing up for church, with the addition that an officer walks around the company, noting the appearance of arms and clothing, and then walks through the quarters to see that they are clean. The cleaning up is always done on Saturday. This morning inspection occupies about half an hour at most, and is over by nine o’clock. There is nothing more done until an hour before sunset, when there is a dress parade. There is none of the ordinary labor about the garrison done at all, not even prisoners being compelled to work. Guard duty of course goes on, but all not on detail that day have a day of absolute leisure. The evening parade is a check on those who are disposed to dissipate through the day; it compels them to be around before night, sober enough to go on parade, if they would avoid being disciplined. This class will rejoice at the abolishment of the Sunday parade.

The *Washington Hatchet* of June 9, has a notice of an effort to enforce the Sunday law in Washington, D. C., in which this sentence occurs: “This hypocritical pretense of remembering the Sabbath-day to keep it holy by driving people into all sorts of excesses should be done away with at once.” The idea is that people are compelled to rest on Sunday and they are forbidden to go to places of amusement, or rather the museums and other like places of public resort are closed upon that day; hence the people who find time hanging heavily upon their hands, seek pleasure in more doubtful places. It is certainly an evil to compel people to be idle, and then forbid them to engage in innocent recreation. We cannot think but that it is a mistake to make certain acts criminal upon one day which are perfectly legitimate and proper upon other days. The only proper basis for Sabbath observance is a conscientious regard for the law of God.

A number of Chicago ministers, with Bishop Fallows at their head, called upon the mayor of that city a few days since, to demand the Sundayclosing of barber shops and saloons. We can agree that saloons should be closed, not alone on Sunday but every day; but why barber shops are so particularly objectionable on Sunday we cannot imagine. We have never been in the habit of associating saloons and barber shops together, but perhaps there is a demoralizing element in shaving that we have overlooked. But, be this as it may, these Chicago ministers are terribly in earnest in their efforts to have both the barber shops and saloons closed. Speaking of their visit, one of the committee which called upon the mayor, said: “We did not tell him he must close the barber shops and saloons on Sunday, but we gave him to understand he would be remembered if he did not.” That is, they simply threatened him with political boycott if he did not yield to their demands. In this they showed that they were consistent National Reformers. The cardinal principle of National Reform is the cardinal principle of the Papacy, and the cardinal principle of the Papacy is to have every man do as certain leaders shall dictate.
