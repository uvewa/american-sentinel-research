According to Dr. Crafts, the Christian religion is not a religion. He argues that the Blair Constitutional Amendment bill proposes to forbid State Legislatures to set up an establishment of religion. This, he says, *strengthens* the Constitution in this respect, which now only forbids Congress to do so. The sophistry of the argument is shown in the fact that, while the first section does forbid the States to establish religion, the second section makes it the express duty of Congress to guarantee that each State shall do that very thing. The provision is for teaching the Christian religion in public schools, the most effectual way possible to "establish" it. To say that this is not establishing religion by the States, is to say that the Christian religion is not a religion.
