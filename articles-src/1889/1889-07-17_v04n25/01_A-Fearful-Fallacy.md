A fearful fallacy runs all through the "National Reform" movement— a fallacy that has lighted all the fires of persecution of the awful past. God save America from the fanaticism of these new leaders, who are again trying to unite Caesar and Christ. Our fathers builded wisely when they gave us a purely secular Constitution. Baptists should awake to the danger in the so-called "reform."— *C. E. W. Dobbs, in Journal and Messenger (Baptist), Cincinnati.*
