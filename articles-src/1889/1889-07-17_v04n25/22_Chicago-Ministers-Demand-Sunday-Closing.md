A number of Chicago ministers, with Bishop Fallows at their head, called upon the mayor of that city a few days since, to demand the Sundayclosing of barber shops and saloons. We can agree that saloons should be closed, not alone on Sunday but every day; but why barber shops are so particularly objectionable on Sunday we cannot imagine. We have never been in the habit of associating saloons and barber shops together, but perhaps there is a demoralizing element in shaving that we have overlooked. But, be this as it may, these Chicago ministers are terribly in earnest in their efforts to have both the barber shops and saloons closed. Speaking of their visit, one of the committee which called upon the mayor, said: "We did not tell him he must close the barber shops and saloons on Sunday, but we gave him to understand he would be remembered if he did not." That is, they simply threatened him with political boycott if he did not yield to their demands. In this they showed that they were consistent National Reformers. The cardinal principle of National Reform is the cardinal principle of the Papacy, and the cardinal principle of the Papacy is to have every man do as certain leaders shall dictate.
