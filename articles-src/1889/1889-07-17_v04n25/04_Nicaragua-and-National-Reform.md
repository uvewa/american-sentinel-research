Nicaragua is a National Reform country, that is, it is afflicted with a union of Church and State. But for a few years past a national reformation has been in progress, and the little republic, occupying a conspicuous place on the connecting link between the Americas, aspires to real civilization and real nationality. An enterprising spirit has been engendered among the people, and improvement is the order of the day. However, in the effort to rise to a higher rank among the Nations of earth, the Church and State incubus proves to be a real clog; and an effort to sever the unrepublican alliance is being made. We hope the effort will be successful. But what a contrast is here presented with the so-called National Reform sought in the United States! The leaders of the one are moving heaven and earth to drag this country into the same mire of church domination from which the other is striving to become extricated.
