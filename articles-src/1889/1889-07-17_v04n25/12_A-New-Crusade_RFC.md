# A New Crusade.

For a hundred years the people of the United States have enjoyed the benefits of the best civil Government that ever existed upon earth. With a Constitution securing the most perfect freedom, civil and religious, of any Nation under heaven, the progress and prosperity of our Nation are without an equal. The framers of our peerless Constitution were endued with wisdom to guard against the evils of oppressive Governments. They aimed to make religious persecution impossible under the Government; and therefore they did not establish any particular religion, but left all free to choose for themselves in this respect, and thus secure equal rights and equal protection to every good citizen.

They were not all infidel and irreligious. Many of them were men of prayer and Christian faith. But they were willing that others should enjoy the same freedom of choice which they desired for themselves. It was not an oversight that no one form of religion was preferred above another, and no religious test was to be applied as a qualification for citizenship or for office under the Government. They knew the pernicious results of religious legislation and a union of Church and State, both in the Old World and in the New. The persecutions of Baptists, Quakers, and others in the New England colonies had not faded from their memories. These well-known facts of history caused them to guard against the repetition of the like horrors, and form a Constitution which would make such results impossible. In reply to questions as to the design of the Constitution, from a committee of a Baptist society in Virginia, George Washington wrote, August 4, 1789, as follows:—

> "If I had the least idea of any difficulty resulting from the Constitution adopted by the convention of which I had the honor to be president when it was formed, so as to endanger the rights of any religious denomination, then I never should have attached my name to that instrument. If I had any idea that the general Government was so administered that the liberty of conscience was endangered, I pray you be assured that no man would be more willing than myself to revive and alter that part of it so as to avoid all religious persecution. You can, without doubt, remember that I have often expressed my opinion, that every man who conducts himself as a good citizen is accountable to God alone for his religious faith, and should be protected in worshiping God according to the dictates of his own conscience."

Such language does not show the venerable Washington to be "godless," but it does show that to avoid religious persecution in the future was the thought in the minds of those who formed our Constitution which led them to leave religion out, and institute a Government purely secular.

But near the close of the first century of unrivaled prosperity to our country under our peerless Constitution, certain political doctors of divinity, who would be doctors of our civil laws, have had the sagacity to discover, as they express it, that this Constitution is "godless," and for that reason needs a "religious amendment." They seem to imagine that God would be pleased to see his name inserted, and that Christ will be honored by being voted the ruler of a Nation, an overwhelming majority of which make no pretension to Christianity, and the most of those that do will not live up to their own creed without civil law to compel them. And the success of this movement, which they call National Reform, they fancy will result in a millennium of a converted world. They propose to make this a Christian Nation by amending the Constitution, and to make Christ the ruler by the votes of this heterogeneous people; and then the millennium will begin, and all the Nations will be converted, and beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks, and learn war no more.

Was there ever a fanaticism more senseless and wild? The "holy wars" to take the Holy Land from the infidel Turks seem sensible compared with it. R. F. Cottrell.
