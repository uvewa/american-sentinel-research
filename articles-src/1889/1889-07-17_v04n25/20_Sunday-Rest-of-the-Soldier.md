To anyone who knows anything about the army in time of peace, the pathetic appeals for the "Sunday rest of the soldier," made by the apostles of National Reform, borders on the ludicrous. There is no place in the country where Sunday is as completely a do-nothing day as in a military garrison. The morning inspection is hardly as much as ordinary people do in dressing up for church, with the addition that an officer walks around the company, noting the appearance of arms and clothing, and then walks through the quarters to see that they are clean. The cleaning up is always done on Saturday. This morning inspection occupies about half an hour at most, and is over by nine o'clock. There is nothing more done until an hour before sunset, when there is a dress parade. There is none of the ordinary labor about the garrison done at all, not even prisoners being compelled to work. Guard duty of course goes on, but all not on detail that day have a day of absolute leisure. The evening parade is a check on those who are disposed to dissipate through the day; it compels them to be around before night, sober enough to go on parade, if they would avoid being disciplined. This class will rejoice at the abolishment of the Sunday parade.
