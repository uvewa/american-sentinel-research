The National Reform "image" is being pushed forward with unusual vigor the present year. Their financial receipts are said to be gaining; they are adding new features to their work, for the purpose of interesting a wider range of people, and altogether the Executive Committee express hopes for a brilliant future. Miss E. J. Crothers of New York, has been appointed special secretary to promote the formation of "National Reform Circles" of "King's Daughters;" and Mrs. Mary A. Woodbridge of Ohio, a special secretary to present the cause of National Reform before the higher institutions of learning, in connection with a similar appointment she holds from the National W. C. T. U. In addition to these, special appointments of persons to look after almost every feature of such a work have been made. Perhaps that class of people who are opposed to this traitorous scheme, but still think "there is no danger," will wake up by and by—when it is too late.

Cardinal Gibbons opposes prohibition, because he thinks it is inefficient, but he is a strenuous advocate of "a severe police Sunday law." The *Voice* points out the inconsistency of his position, and says that "the prohibitory laws of Maine, Kansas, and Iowa are far better enforced than the Sunday laws of the non-prohibition States." Then the *Voice* must agree with the American Sentinel, that prohibition, and not Sunday laws, is what temperance people should work for. Let this admission of the *Voice* be borne in mind. The advocates of Sunday laws would have it believed that these are the great and only temperance laws, and have condemned the American Sentinel because it advocates prohibition instead. Nevertheless the truth cannot be hidden, and there are many who will find it.
