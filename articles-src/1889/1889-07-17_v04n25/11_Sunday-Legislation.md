# Sunday Legislation.

No doubt all are aware of the fact that the Sunday-Rest bill expired with the last session of Congress, and unless some effort is put forth to bring it into notice again it will become a dead letter. It is not probable, however, that a question in which so many thousands of people are interested will be suffered to pass into oblivion. And although disposed of for a time the sentiments embodied in this bill are so firmly established in the minds of its supporters that the principles it sets forth will not be allowed to be forgotten by the public. Either its resurrection or the creation of something similar will, undoubtedly, take place soon. . . .

The idea of Sunday legislation is steadily gaining ground, and the leaders in the movement are not in the least discouraged at the failure to secure the proposed law, but are energetically at work to accomplish their purpose. While their efforts to promote needed reforms touching public morality as affected by the liquor traffic, and the divorce law, and to secure a higher state of social purity, are commendable, the means by which they propose to secure such results, that is, by religious legislation, is entirely wrong. For while there are those, no doubt, connected with this movement who, viewing the evil and depravity in the world to-day as the results of these evils, desire to see a better state of things, and believe that this can the most speedily and effectually be accomplished by so changing our Constitution as to make religious training in our public schools compulsory, and the religious observance of Sunday obligatory upon all; while there are those who do really believe that such a law would prove a blessing and are conscientiously working to this end, there are others who, judging from their own statements, are not so conscientious in their efforts, but had they the power which such a law should give them, would use it to gratify their own selfish, bigoted ideas.

It has been experimentally proved, not only in foreign lands, but in our own country, that any law which places the consciences of men and women under civil authority is detrimental to the best interests of the State. Stop the sale of intoxicants! Close the saloons! not only on the first day, but on every day of the week. Make such laws as public morality demands, but leave religious matters entirely out of the question. Let man answer alone to his God for his religious belief or unbelief.—*Saginaw Courier.*
