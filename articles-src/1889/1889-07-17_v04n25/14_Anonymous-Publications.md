Some person has sent us two copies of a tract entitled "Covenanterism, an Exposure of the Project to Put a Religious Creed into the Constitution of the United States," etc.

The publication may be very good for aught we know, but we cannot speak with certainty as to its merits, not having read it, for the reason that the name of the author has been carefully removed from the copies. We treat anonymous publications in the same manner that we do anonymous letters, namely, consign them to the waste-basket.
