When Col. Elliott F. Shepard was chosen president of the American Sunday Union, he delivered an address, in which he referred to the object of the Union in these words: "We do not put this work on mere human reasoning, for all that can be overthrown by human reason; we rest it directly and only on the divine commandment." In this one sentence he logically gives away the whole theory of the Sunday movement. He admits, and truthfully too, that from the standpoint of human reason it can be overthrown. So that settles that feature of the work. And when he "rests it directly and only on the divine command," the position is even more easily overthrown; the commandment itself overthrows Sunday observance by making no reference to it whatever. Yet, after so frankly admitting its untenable nature, the colonel and his Union persist in thrusting their Sunday absurdity on the people.
