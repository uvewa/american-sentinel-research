The Detroit *Commercial Advertiser* of May 23, 1889, has the following editorial item in regard to National Reform methods, which we print entire, not because it presents anything new to the readers of the American Sentinel, but because it shows that the iniquities of these pseudo-reformers are known, and that their sins are finding them out. The *Advertiser* says:—

> "The National Religious Reform advocates, whose bill making religious education a constitutional proviso, and whose petition for a Sunday-observance law are being quietly pushed in preparation for a new move on Congress when it assembles, made an extraordinary announcement some months ago. It was asserted officially that over 14,000,000 signatures had been obtained to petitions for the movement, and the impression was created that that number of persons had affixed their signatures to these petitions. Such seemingly intense earnestness in behalf of the desired reform was astonishing both to the lukewarm indifferents and those who saw just reasons for opposing the movement. Some of the latter class having obtained over 30,000 signatures distinctly and intelligently affixed to the counter petition, made a quiet investigation to discover how the other side could accomplish so much in a little time. The result has been to expose a most deliberate misrepresentation of facts. Instead of 14,174,744 signatures, there are but 407 individual signatures, the remainder being *representative signatures by indorsements of bodies and meetings.* For instance, Cardinal Gibbons said the Catholic Church approved of the movement, and the 7,200,000 Catholics in this country were entered in bulk as signers of the petition. The annual conventions of the Methodist, Baptist, and Presbyterian Churches in the United States indorsed the reform, and 5,977,693 were added to the number of approvers. And so it went along, names piling up by the million, and not ten out of every thousand said to approve the petition, knew anything about its merits or effects if adopted. At this rate how soon will the right to petition become a forgotten privilege?"

We do not know from what source the *Commercial Advertiser* derives its information, but through a misprint, or otherwise, it misstates the number of signatures to the counter petition. Before the final adjournment of the last Congress the counter petition contained over 230,000 names of *bona fide* signers. We suspect that the *Advertiser* intended to give that number.

Our contemporary is also at error on one other point, namely, Cardinal Gibbons did not say that the Catholic Church approved of the movement. What he did say was, "I am happy to add my name." He spoke only for himself, and the multiplication of his name by 7,200,000 was a most unwarranted liberty. It was, however, in perfect keeping with National Reform methods.
