Dr. Browne, in the Pittsburg National Reform Convention of 1874, gave expression to the following sentiment:—

> "There is no more persistent man alive than the typical representative American office-seeker. Of that class, the most of those who have not yet found whether they are for Christ or not, or who are openly decrying this movement, are ready to be its firm friends as soon as they acquire wisdom to discern the signs of the times, and are assured of its speedy success. They may pull back now at the hind axle, or scotch the wheels of the car of progress; but when they see it move, they will quickly jump in to get front seats, and avow that they always thought it was a good thing."

That the doctor was about right in his calculation, there is no reason to doubt. On the contrary, we have evidence before us that the leaven is already working, as is shown by the following on the subject of "The Sunday Movement," in the Burlington, Vermont, *Independent* of May 31:—

> "This movement is everywhere gaining strength. In addition to what the great railroads of the country are doing, to which we called attention a week or two since, we may note another very powerful movement in the same direction. Mr. Proctor, from Vermont, Secretary of War, has issued (of course with sanction of President Harrison) an order relieving all United States soldiers from Sunday parade and duty of every kind in time of peace. Thus the movement seems to gain strength everywhere. We have not been ourselves a very great stickler for Sunday observances, but the more we see of the progress made in this direction, and the greater the prospect of a general and all but universal observance of the day, the stronger is our interest in that direction."

The editor of the *Independent* may not be an office-seeker, but he is apparently actuated by the same desire to be on the popular side; and as his interest grows stronger as the movement grows in popularity, he will probably yet become "a very great stickler for Sunday observance." As to Mr. Proctor, there is no doubt his order above noted was instigated by the strength of the Sunday movement.
