# Shall We Go Back?

Rev. W. D. Gray, secretary of the Sunday Reform Convention recently held at Sedalia, Missouri, gave expression to his views of national reform in the following characteristic language:—

> “To appeal to divine authority in our legislation would be to fundamentally change the law of our land, or the principle adopted by our fathers when they said that all Governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed. I for one do not believe that, as a political maxim. I do not believe that Governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed; and so the object of this movement is an effort to change that feature in our fundamental law. Jefferson was under the influence of French ideas when the Constitution was framed, and that had something to do with leaving God out of the Constitution. And I think that the provincial history of this country will compel us to come back to that, and recognize God in our Constitution. And I see in this reform a Providence teaching us the necessity of recognizing something else besides the will of the people as the basis of government.”

We have often logically traced the utterances of National Reformers to the point reached in the above sentiments, but they do not all so frankly and openly declare their intention to utterly overturn the primary principles of the republic. We have from the first recognized the National Reform movement as un-American, diametrically opposed to republican institutions; but they have endeavored to resent the charge, even in face of the fact that their every move sustained it. But now we have the public avowal from the Rev. secretary of a State convention, that “the object of this movement is an effort to change that feature in our fundamental law,”— that Governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed. Unless the National Reform Association, or its viceroy, the National Sabbath Association, publicly refute this annunciation of Rev. W. D. Gray, we shall deem that purpose as acknowledged and settled, and that our logical deductions to this end in the past will no longer be disputed.

*Therefore, the public may hereafter know that the so-called National Reform is a movement to establish a Government that will utterly ignore the consent of the governed; that it is avowedly “an effort to change that feature in our fundamental law.”*

Just now, however, the Reformers are moving heaven and earth to procure the consent of the governed to their traitorous scheme; or, rather, to make a show of having procured their consent to be ruthlessly shorn of their only protection against any measures that religious intolerance might conceive. They made a bold effort last winter to convince the United States Congress and the people at large that they already had the consent of the governed to the enactment of the Blair bills; and at the same time they were pushing to their utmost their principle of carrying out their designs without such consent. They represented millions of people, without even asking their consent, as petitioning Congress to enact those bills, when thousands of the same people had actually signed adverse petitions.

Mr. Gray thinks “that the provincial history of this country will compel us to go back to that, and recognize God in the Constitution.” Had he and his *confrères* lived during “the provincial history of this country,” and been obliged to swallow some of the medicine they are prescribing to-day, they might have seen its imaginary glories in a different light. Had they lived in Massachusetts, and been either Baptists or Quakers, they might have enjoyed the pleasures of imprisonment, banishment, whipping, or hanging, *without* the consent of the governed. And other colonies were conducted on the National Reform idea that “Governments derive their just powers” from the church, when men were fined and imprisoned for not attending church, and their property sold to pay the ministers’ tax. Whichever church gained the ascendency in any colony claimed the prerogative of manipulating the Government.

But if the Government does not derive its just powers from the consent of the governed, from whom do its just powers emanate?—Well, the National Reformers claim that it comes from God. By what means does God communicate his will to the Government?—Through the Bible. Who are the interpreters of the Bible?—The church, of course. Then in what relation does [182] that place the church and the Government?—It establishes the union of Church and State, with the Church as the supreme factor. This is the logical outcome of going back to “the provincial history of the country” for a criterion of government.

Considering the cost of throwing off that old provincial yoke, what American freeman is prepared to place himself under a similar policy? And what shall we say of a religious movement that seeks to relegate our free institutions into the meshes of such fanaticism and bigotry? It is clearly manifest that such a Constitution as the National Reformers would make, would have very little of godly principles attached to it, though the name were repeated in every sentence. When the people of this Nation consent to be governed without their consent, they will have sold themselves into an abject slavery from which they will never recover. But such is the condition into which the national deformers would lead us.
