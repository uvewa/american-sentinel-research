The Kings County Sunday Association of New York declares that "the delivery of icecream after ten o'clock Sunday morning has proven a source of annoyance to many sections of the city, and has disturbed public worship in many of our churches." It is really too bad that worship in the churches should be disturbed by such an iniquitous traffic as ice-cream dealing. Why do not the churches prosecute these men for disturbing their worship? New York has a law making it an offense against the public peace to disturb religious worship. Perhaps our question will be answered by studying the case a little further. It is of interest to know, and a proper subject of inquiry, just how it is that this disturbance in the churches is caused. We have the answer in full in the same paragraph in which the other statement is found. It is as follows

> "We regret to state that many church people absolutely ignore their duty in these premises, by requiring ice-cream to be delivered to them for their Sunday dinner. It is safe to say that many professedly Christian people require ice-cream dealers to keep their places of business open, and scores of employes to do work on Sunday, contrary to law, besides requiring the services of horses and wagons, merely to gratify a selfish appetite and serve mere personal gratification."

That explains how the worship is disturbed by the ice-cream dealers. The church-members must have their ice-cream for dinner. The dealers, therefore, are compelled to traverse the streets about church-time; and so worship in the church is grievously disturbed by the iniquitous traffic of the ungodly ice-cream dealers.

This fully explains why it is that these icecream dealers are not prosecuted for the disturbance of worship. The church-members insist on having their ice-cream for dinner, the dealers have to deliver it in time, and a prosecution in such a case for disturbance of worship, wouldn't wear a very good face in any court of *justice. *Consequently, under cover of the complaint of disturbance of worship, the church managers demand laws of the State by which they can prohibit the ice-cream traffic on Sunday, and thus secure the enforcement of church discipline—by which, in other words, they can compel the church-members not to create a disturbance of their own worship by getting ice-cream for their dinner!
