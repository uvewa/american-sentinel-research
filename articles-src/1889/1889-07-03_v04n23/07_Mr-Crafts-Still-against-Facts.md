The *Missionary Weekly* of May 9, published in Richmond, Va., contains a labored article from Wilbur F. Crafts, in which he says:—

> "Let it be understood once for all by your readers that neither Senator Blair nor the petitioners referred to are seeking to compel 'anyone to be religious ' The petitioners are simply asking for a supplement to the State Sunday laws to give Sunday rest, like that which most of us enjoy through State legislation, to those who are under the exclusive jurisdiction of Congress.

> "The Constitution protects the President in his right to Sunday rest by giving him ten days, exclusive of Sunday, to consider the bills sent to him for approval. The Sunday-Rest law simply calls for the extension of this presidential monopoly to all who are under the control of the general Government in this matter."

Of course all who are acquainted with the facts in the case will know that in writing thus Mr. Crafts has (to put it mildly) not stated the matter fairly. That which he and his co-laborers are seeking to accomplish must be determined, not by what they say but by what they do. The Sentinel has several times published the Sunday-Rest bill introduced by Senator Blair and indorsed by Mr. Crafts and the American Sabbath Union, and all who have read it know full well that when anyone says that its only object was to secure to Government employes the right to rest on Sunday he does not state [179] the truth. As reported in the *Lutheran Observer* of December 21, 1888, Mr. Crafts himself said of the Blair bill: "The bill which has been introduced makes Sunday the ideal Sabbath of the Puritans, which day shall be occupied only by worship;" and everybody who has read that bill knows that it was designed to stop *all* Sunday labor and business, works of "necessity and humanity" only excepted, in all places subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States, no matter by whom that labor might be performed. Under that bill, had it become a law, a private citizen could have been fined for digging potatoes, mending a wagon brake, plowing a field, or painting a church on Sunday, just as men have been fined under similar laws in some of the States, notably in Arkansas. And nobody knows this any better than does the field secretary of the so-called American Sabbath Union. It does seem that while professing so much regard for the law of God, and especially for the fourth commandment, Mr. Crafts should not entirely overlook the ninth precept of the decalogue.
