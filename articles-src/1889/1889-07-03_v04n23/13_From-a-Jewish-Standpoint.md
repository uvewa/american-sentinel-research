# From a Jewish Standpoint.

Rabbi Kranskopf, D. D., in an article in the *Jewish Times and Observer,* calls attention to the tendencies of the present time by giving instances of like cause and effect in the past. Following is an extract from his article:—

> “Religion is again clamoring for worldly power. It is forgetting that its mission is simply to support the hand of the State, by a scrupulous attending to its own duties, in its own legitimate sphere, and not to meddle with the State in the exercise of its function.

> “I am not an alarmist, and yet when, in a republican Government like ours, which guarantees liberty of conscience and freedom of worship to every man, such signs of religious interference with the duties of the State are beginning to manifest themselves, there is indeed reason for alarm. Religion has grown tired of being simply the coadjutor to the State. It is striving for the supremacy, and that spirit is inimical to civilization. It has been attempted before, and with grievous consequences. Collect all the misery which despotism and corruption have inflicted upon individuals and nations; measure, if you can, the flood of tears that was shed for a miserable existence, for crushed fortunes, for disappointed hopes; and still even this aggregate of misery will not be able to give you a conception of all the sufferings that were endured by human kind during the supremacy of religion over the temporal power.
> “Ask for the date of that age when a deep black cloud of appalling ignorance rested over the people; when the intellect lay fettered; when the industries were paralyzed; when the word “liberty” was not to be found in the vocabulary of the people; when the physical sciences were persecuted as being incompatible with revealed truth; when all researches were prohibited, under the severest punishment, as being pernicious to piety; when the grossest superstitions were forced upon the people; when blind credulity and unquestioning belief were made the first articles of their creed; when the most repulsive corruptions prevailed even within the church itself; when even the clergy was void of every sting of conscience, drunken, lost in sensuality, rioting in open immorality, trafficking with religion for the purpose of enlarging their opportunities for debauchery,— and the answer will be, All this prevailed during that age in which religion was the sole mistress of the people.”
The only freedom which deserves the name is of pursuing our own good in our own way, so long as we do not attempt to deprive others of theirs, or impede their efforts to attain it. Each is the proper guardian of his own health, whether bodily, or mental, or spiritual. Mankind are greater gainers by suffering each other to live as seems good to themselves than by compelling each to live as seems good to the rest.—*John Stuart Mill. *[183-184]

Note.—No papers are sent by the publishers of the American Sentinel to people who have not subscribed for it. If the Sentinel comes to one who has not subscribed for it, he may know that it is sent him by some friend, and that he will not be called upon by the publishers to pay for the same.

When Col. Elliott F. Shepard was chosen president of the American Sunday Union, he delivered an address, in which he referred to the object of the Union in these words: “We do not put this work on mere human reasoning, for all that can be overthrown by human reason; we rest it directly and only on the divine commandment.” In this one sentence he logically gives away the whole theory of the Sunday movement. He admits, and truthfully too, that from the standpoint of human reason it can be overthrown. So that settles that feature of the work. And when he “rests it directly and only on the divine command,” the position is even more easily overthrown; the commandment itself overthrows Sunday observance by making no reference to it whatever. Yet, after so frankly admitting its untenable nature, the colonel and his Union persist in thrusting their Sunday absurdity on the people.

The *Nebraska Citizen,* after referring to the recent shameful persecution of certain individuals in Milton County, Georgia, because they were observers of the seventh-day Sabbath, says:—

> “Why not petition Congress and the Senate to pass the Blair Educational bill, and then make such procedures as the above, a thing general over the country?”

We are glad that some of our exchanges, at least, are discerning enough to foresee the consequences which would logically result if Senator Blair’s educational schemes were ever to be carried into effect. People who claim to see nothing out of place in such measures as these would perhaps see nothing out of place in any religious legislation; but one thing is sure: let such measures as these prevail, and liberty in anything more than in name will cease to be a factor in our Government. Then the way will be opened to make such procedures as the *Citizen* refers to—yea, and others of even more oppressive nature—things which will indeed be “general over the country.”

In a recent sermon preached in Los Angeles, this State, Dr. Cantine (Methodist) said:—

> “Now, the question is, How shall we observe the Sabbath? The Sunday bill has attracted more attention, and appealed to more people, than any other question of the times. Now, I propose to state my position squarely as in favor of the absolute enforcement of this bill. The question of Sunday trains, Sunday theaters, and Sunday excursions and amusements, must be discussed and settled. . . .

> “Shall we legislate against Sabbath breaking?— Yes, both in the State and in the Nation. You can’t legislate men into thinking right, but you can coerce them into obeying the law. You can’t make them love the Sabbath by law, but you can keep them from violating it, and you can enforce it as a day of rest and peace. Men must be educated into love for the day, and respect for it, and for the divine command for its observance. It is coming. The movement is gaining headway. It is plain to all thinking men that if something is not done soon, Sunday will become a general holiday and observed by only a few. The time for a reform is at hand, and Legislatures have begun to take cognizance of the situation and pass measures for preserving the law and the order and the sacredness of the day.”
The report of the sermon which we saw does not say what bill the gentleman was talking about, but we assume that it was the Blair Sunday-Rest bill; but be that as it may, the language quoted marks him as a genuine National Reformer, except in this, that he has not yet learned that the demand for Sunday laws must professedly be made not on religious but on economic and sanitary grounds. But Mr. Crafts is expected to visit this coast shortly, and we suppose that his Los Angeles disciple will then learn the way of National Reformers more perfectly.

And still the work of securing “signatures” to the petition for a national Sunday law goes bravely forward. We have received from Southern California a copy of a paper entitled *The White Ribbon,* which contains, in a report of a meeting of the W. C. T. U., the following paragraph:—

> “The petition for the Sabbath law was sent to *the ministers of all denominations, to be signed by the proper officials on behalf of the church.* Many hearty responses were received, and earnest wishes given for our success.”

This simply means that all the ministers have been asked to have a few officers of their several churches sign the petition in behalf of the entire church membership; then these petitions will be presented to Congress as representing so many thousands or tens of thousands of people, perhaps a majority of whom have never seen or even heard of the petition which they are supposed to have signed. But perhaps it is only fitting that Sunday, which is itself only a counterfeit, should be maintained by fraud.

The Detroit *Commercial Advertiser* of May 23, 1889, has the following editorial item in regard to National Reform methods, which we print entire, not because it presents anything new to the readers of the American Sentinel, but because it shows that the iniquities of these pseudo-reformers are known, and that their sins are finding them out. The *Advertiser* says:—

> “The National Religious Reform advocates, whose bill making religious education a constitutional proviso, and whose petition for a Sunday-observance law are being quietly pushed in preparation for a new move on Congress when it assembles, made an extraordinary announcement some months ago. It was asserted officially that over 14,000,000 signatures had been obtained to petitions for the movement, and the impression was created that that number of persons had affixed their signatures to these petitions. Such seemingly intense earnestness in behalf of the desired reform was astonishing both to the lukewarm indifferents and those who saw just reasons for opposing the movement. Some of the latter class having obtained over 30,000 signatures distinctly and intelligently affixed to the counter petition, made a quiet investigation to discover how the other side could accomplish so much in a little time. The result has been to expose a most deliberate misrepresentation of facts. Instead of 14,174,744 signatures, there are but 407 individual signatures, the remainder being *representative signatures by indorsements of bodies and meetings.* For instance, Cardinal Gibbons said the Catholic Church approved of the movement, and the 7,200,000 Catholics in this country were entered in bulk as signers of the petition. The annual conventions of the Methodist, Baptist, and Presbyterian Churches in the United States indorsed the reform, and 5,977,693 were added to the number of approvers. And so it went along, names piling up by the million, and not ten out of every thousand said to approve the petition, knew anything about its merits or effects if adopted. At this rate how soon will the right to petition become a forgotten privilege?”

We do not know from what source the *Commercial Advertiser* derives its information, but through a misprint, or otherwise, it misstates the number of signatures to the counter petition. Before the final adjournment of the last Congress the counter petition contained over 230,000 names of *bona fide* signers. We suspect that the *Advertiser* intended to give that number.

Our contemporary is also at error on one other point, namely, Cardinal Gibbons did not say that the Catholic Church approved of the movement. What he did say was, “I am happy to add my name.” He spoke only for himself, and the multiplication of his name by 7,200,000 was a most unwarranted liberty. It was, however, in perfect keeping with National Reform methods.
