In a recent sermon preached in Los Angeles, this State, Dr. Cantine (Methodist) said:—

> "Now, the question is, How shall we observe the Sabbath? The Sunday bill has attracted more attention, and appealed to more people, than any other question of the times. Now, I propose to state my position squarely as in favor of the absolute enforcement of this bill. The question of Sunday trains, Sunday theaters, and Sunday excursions and amusements, must be discussed and settled. . . .

> "Shall we legislate against Sabbath breaking?— Yes, both in the State and in the Nation. You can't legislate men into thinking right, but you can coerce them into obeying the law. You can't make them love the Sabbath by law, but you can keep them from violating it, and you can enforce it as a day of rest and peace. Men must be educated into love for the day, and respect for it, and for the divine command for its observance. It is coming. The movement is gaining headway. It is plain to all thinking men that if something is not done soon, Sunday will become a general holiday and observed by only a few. The time for a reform is at hand, and Legislatures have begun to take cognizance of the situation and pass measures for preserving the law and the order and the sacredness of the day."

The report of the sermon which we saw does not say what bill the gentleman was talking about, but we assume that it was the Blair Sunday-Rest bill; but be that as it may, the language quoted marks him as a genuine National Reformer, except in this, that he has not yet learned that the demand for Sunday laws must professedly be made not on religious but on economic and sanitary grounds. But Mr. Crafts is expected to visit this coast shortly, and we suppose that his Los Angeles disciple will then learn the way of National Reformers more perfectly.
