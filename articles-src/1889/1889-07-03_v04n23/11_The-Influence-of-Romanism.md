The title of a recent article by Rev. Makepiece Trueworthy, D. D., of Washington, D. C., published in the *Occident* of May 29, is, "Rome on the Tiber and Washington on the Potomac," in which he gives some alarming facts relative to the influence of Romanism in this country, and especially in the capital city. He says:—

> "Within twenty-four hours after the confirmation of President Harrison's cabinet a cablegram was made public to the effect that the Pope was satisfied with the Cabinet, and that information had been given the Vatican that under Harrison's administration the relations between the United States and the Holy See would be of the most cordial character."

Then, commenting on this fact, Mr. Trueworthy further says:—

> "We fail to see what a change of the national administration in America has to do with any opinion, favorable or otherwise, with the Pope, except it be that that functionary, true to his canon law, considers the Catholic Church a political organization."

We also fail to see what difference it ought to make. We believe it always has been true that the Church of Rome has been granted absolute liberty in this country; this is admitted by Romanists themselves, and was so stated by Cardinal Gibbons when in Rome only a year or two since; and that certainly is all that the Catholic Church, or any other church, has a right to ask of this or any other administration. Why the Pope should be assured so promptly that the present administration would be friendly to Rome, is more than we can conceive. Has there ever been an administration in this country unfriendly to the Church of Rome? And why should such an assurance be given to Rome more than to any other church? We certainly think that any administration giving such a pledge is guilty of a great mistake.

No church should be recognized by this Government as such. It is enough that the Constitution and laws be administered as they now stand. Perhaps the giving of this guarantee was no worse, however, nor more at variance with the spirit of our institutions, than was the action of the last administration in sending a revenue cutter to meet the Papal dignitaries sent from Rome to invest Cardinal Gibbons with the insignia of his office as prince of the Roman hierarchy. But be this as it may, they both show a dangerous drift in this Government. We do not imagine, however, that either President Cleveland or President Harrison personally feels so exceedingly friendly toward Rome. Their courtesy is due rather to the force of circumstances. Perhaps our meaning will be better understood by the following fact, as set forth in the article above referred to:—

> "The Boston Committee of One Hundred sent three careful men to this city upon an important mission. With bated breath they reported a discovery. That reported discovery has been discovered to be true. They reported that in this city no item of news relative to Catholic interests is put onto the wire by the associated press without first being submitted to a Roman Catholic official for inspection."

This is certainly significant, and when we come to consider the fact that what is true of Washington in this respect is probably true of most other cities in the land, in fact, of the whole business of the associated press, we can easily see that no administration can afford, from a political standpoint, to antagonize the Church of Rome, or even to be indifferent to the powerful influence which it exerts in American politics. There can scarcely be a doubt that it was the Catholic vote which defeated Mr. Blaine four years ago last fall, and it is probably true that no man could be elected President who should in any way antagonize the interests of the Roman Catholic Church.

Mr. Trueworthy says that he thinks "there are symptoms of a change which will be a compliment to the manly independence of our officials." But certainly the facts which he states do not give any good ground for much hope in that direction. Continuing, he says:—

> "In the recent past there were thousands of department clerks who understood that their retention in office depended upon a Catholic tithing system. They know that priestly pressure could remove them at any time. In one of the departments there always appeared, upon the first and fifteenth of each month, the female agents of the Roman hierarchy to collect money from the clerks. They went from room to room, but a few brave men denounced this, and now they may be found at the outer door, and hundreds who are not Catholics find it to their interest to feed the spacious man of Rome. A lady department clerk told me a year ago the history of her political service, during which service she had monthly paid the Catholic Church a tax upon her privilege to work for the Government, and when she offended a priest she lost her position. Some who refuse to contribute monthly to that church, at the doors of Government buildings, find their names sent to the heads of departments, and that means dismissal. From my west window, which opens towards the Potomac, my eye falls upon the flag which waves from the top of one of the leading Government bureaus. It is well established that clerks go and come at that bureau at the bidding of a priest.

> "During the first weeks of the present administration a priest attached to one of the leading Catholic Churches of the city hung day after day about the White House, for the purpose of personally soliciting an appointment, which was clearly seen to have been in the interest of a Catholic political measure.
> "All of the hospitals, except one, in the District of Columbia are under Catholic management. They were established by congressional action, and by the appropriation of the money of the people of the United States."

Contemplating this influence, we are led to ask, If they do such things in a green tree, what will they not do in a dry? And what may we not expect to see should the National Reform program be carried out, and the Constitution amended something after the fashion proposed by Senator Blair? Disguise the fact as we may, all Protestant churches combined have not as much political influence in the United States to-day as [181] is exercised by the Church of Rome, not because Rome outnumbers the Protestants, but because of its perfect organization. Protestants are divided between the several parties, and it is practically impossible to unite them in any one party, but the Catholic vote can be given almost solid for one party or the other, as the interests of the church may demand. It is because of this fact that Rome is a standing menace to our free institutions.

With the exception, perhaps, of the Mormon Church, which, however, is so small that it cuts no figure in national politics, no other single church is so well organized, and at the same time no other church presents the same religio-political phase as does the Roman Catholic. As a general rule, Protestants owe their highest political allegiance to the Government, while Catholics owe their highest allegiance to the Pope of Rome, and are under the entire control of a corrupt and scheming priesthood. It is the boast of Catholics in many sections of our country that they have it in their power to defeat any man for office. It is also their boast that they control the press, and it is undoubtedly their design to control the Government. This, of course, would be impossible were Protestants united in opposing them, but with the National Reformers ready to make "repeated advances," even though they suffer "some rebuffs," and to compromise and yield point after point, in order to gain the co-operation of the Catholic Church in securing Sunday laws, and other legislation of the same character, what may we not expect even in this country?
