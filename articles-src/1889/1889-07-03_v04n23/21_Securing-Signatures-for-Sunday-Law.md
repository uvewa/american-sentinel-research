And still the work of securing "signatures" to the petition for a national Sunday law goes bravely forward. We have received from Southern California a copy of a paper entitled *The White Ribbon,* which contains, in a report of a meeting of the W. C. T. U., the following paragraph:—

> "The petition for the Sabbath law was sent to *the ministers of all denominations, to be signed by the proper officials on behalf of the church.* Many hearty responses were received, and earnest wishes given for our success."

This simply means that all the ministers have been asked to have a few officers of their several churches sign the petition in behalf of the entire church membership; then these petitions will be presented to Congress as representing so many thousands or tens of thousands of people, perhaps a majority of whom have never seen or even heard of the petition which they are supposed to have signed. But perhaps it is only fitting that Sunday, which is itself only a counterfeit, should be maintained by fraud.
