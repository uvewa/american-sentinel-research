Rabbi Kranskopf, D. D., in an article in the *Jewish Times and Observer,* calls attention to the tendencies of the present time by giving instances of like cause and effect in the past. Following is an extract from his article:—

> "Religion is again clamoring for worldly power. It is forgetting that its mission is simply to support the hand of the State, by a scrupulous attending to its own duties, in its own legitimate sphere, and not to meddle with the State in the exercise of its function.

> "I am not an alarmist, and yet when, in a republican Government like ours, which guarantees liberty of conscience and freedom of worship to every man, such signs of religious interference with the duties of the State are beginning to manifest themselves, there is indeed reason for alarm. Religion has grown tired of being simply the coadjutor to the State. It is striving for the supremacy, and that spirit is inimical to civilization. It has been attempted before, and with grievous consequences. Collect all the misery which despotism and corruption have inflicted upon individuals and nations; measure, if you can, the flood of tears that was shed for a miserable existence, for crushed fortunes, for disappointed hopes; and still even this aggregate of misery will not be able to give you a conception of all the sufferings that were endured by human kind during the supremacy of religion over the temporal power.
> "Ask for the date of that age when a deep black cloud of appalling ignorance rested over the people; when the intellect lay fettered; when the industries were paralyzed; when the word "liberty" was not to be found in the vocabulary of the people; when the physical sciences were persecuted as being incompatible with revealed truth; when all researches were prohibited, under the severest punishment, as being pernicious to piety; when the grossest superstitions were forced upon the people; when blind credulity and unquestioning belief were made the first articles of their creed; when the most repulsive corruptions prevailed even within the church itself; when even the clergy was void of every sting of conscience, drunken, lost in sensuality, rioting in open immorality, trafficking with religion for the purpose of enlarging their opportunities for debauchery,— and the answer will be, All this prevailed during that age in which religion was the sole mistress of the people."

The only freedom which deserves the name is of pursuing our own good in our own way, so long as we do not attempt to deprive others of theirs, or impede their efforts to attain it. Each is the proper guardian of his own health, whether bodily, or mental, or spiritual. Mankind are greater gainers by suffering each other to live as seems good to themselves than by compelling each to live as seems good to the rest.—*John Stuart Mill. *[183-184]
