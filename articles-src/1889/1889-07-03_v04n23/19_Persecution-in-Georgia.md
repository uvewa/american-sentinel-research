The *Nebraska Citizen,* after referring to the recent shameful persecution of certain individuals in Milton County, Georgia, because they were observers of the seventh-day Sabbath, says:—

> "Why not petition Congress and the Senate to pass the Blair Educational bill, and then make such procedures as the above, a thing general over the country?"

We are glad that some of our exchanges, at least, are discerning enough to foresee the consequences which would logically result if Senator Blair's educational schemes were ever to be carried into effect. People who claim to see nothing out of place in such measures as these would perhaps see nothing out of place in any religious legislation; but one thing is sure: let such measures as these prevail, and liberty in anything more than in name will cease to be a factor in our Government. Then the way will be opened to make such procedures as the *Citizen* refers to—yea, and others of even more oppressive nature—things which will indeed be "general over the country."
