They have organized an auxiliary to the American Sabbath Union in Missouri. It is styled the "Missouri Sabbath Association." The organization was effected at the Sabbath Observance Convention recently held at Sedalia. Article 1 of the constitution says: "The object of this association shall be to preserve the Christian Sabbath, or Lord's day, as a day of rest and worship."

Of course the usual asseverations were made in the convention that it was not a religious but a civil Sabbath that is sought; but they could not forego the declaration that it is to be a day of worship. Notwithstanding their stereotyped claims to the contrary, this design always comes to the surface in every move the National Reformers make. The fact is, that is the main point, and their small sheep-skin is far too short at both ends to cover so large a wolf.

The hostility of the convention to civil and religious liberty was manifested when a gentleman (Elder R. C. Porter), who had been invited to participate in the proceedings, offered the following resolution:—

Whereas, The principle of equality of rights as set forth in the Declaration of Independence, and incorporated in the Constitution of the United States, by securing to all citizens equal protection of the laws, and as is expressed by our Saviour in the golden rule, is the only true principle of civil and religious liberty; and,

Whereas, The rights of conscience of a minority are as sacred as those of the majority, and should be equally respected; therefore,

*Resolved,* That it is the object of this association that the principle of equality of rights, both civil and religious, guaranteed to all citizens by our Constitution as it now stands, should be maintained; and that we will strenuously oppose any movement that will endanger the rights of conscience of any citizen, or deprive them of equal protection of the laws of the State of Missouri or of the United States.

It was moved by the author, and seconded by Elder D. S. Donnell, that this resolution be substituted for article 1 of the constitution, quoted above.

Rev. W. D. Gray, secretary of the convention, then said: "Mr. Chairman, I move you that the resolution be laid on the table." The motion was carried. [180]

*The Chairman— "*Now, Brother Porter, what do you want done with this paper? Do you want this made a part of the records of this convention?"

*Elder Porter*— "I would leave that to the pleasure of the convention."

*The Chairman*—"But I want to know your wish."

*Elder Porter*— "I would prefer to have it made a part of the records of the convention."

*A Member*— "Mr. President, I think it ought to be recognized as having been introduced and acted upon."

*The Chairman*— "If there are no objections, this is—"

*Mr. Stephens*—"I would like to inquire if it is customary to record the papers that are lost and tabled."

*The Chairman*—"We have not adopted any set rules for our government."

*B. F. Boiler*—"It don't signify that this is lost by simply tabling it; it can be taken from the table at any time of the convention. And it cannot be left out of the record of the proceedings without a vote of the convention."

*Mr. Stephens*—"My remark before was misunderstood by Mr. Boiler. Is it customary to record any paper to show that such a paper was presented by such a party, and tabled; the paper, of course, kept on file?"

*The Chairman*—"Well, that was what I was getting at; and it is the decision of the chair that this paper, as it is written, shall be a part of the records of the convention, and that this paper was offered by Brother Porter, and was laid on the table."

*Bev. J. A. Morrow*—"I do not think it would be discourtesy to ask the privilege to return this paper to the parties. It is certainly known to them that this movement is directly, positively, and explicitly in opposition to the whole thing. And I would move you that we return it to the parties."

*The Chairman*—"And that the paper be not made a part of the record of the convention?"

*Mr. Morrow*—"Yes, sir."

*Elder Porter*— "I would like to ask this question. I do not know as I get the idea of the gentleman correctly, in making the motion to return this paper. Does he mean to say that he is opposed to the expression of equality of rights and the principles of the Christian religion as set forth in this resolution? Is that the idea of the gentleman in making the motion?"

*Bev. T. H. Tatlow*—"I think, Mr. Chairman, there is a confusion of ideas, and that there is a mistake on the part of Brother Porter in presenting this. The Sabbath was made for man; so is civil government made for man—"

*W*. *D. Gray*—"I rise to a point of order."

*The Chairman*— "I think I shall be able to maintain order in the convention."

*Mr. Tatlow*—"And the civil ruler is God's minister to man for good. The Sabbath has two sides, and these two sides are the religious side and the secular side. It is not an interference with the equality of rights."

*Mr. Morrow*—"The one who made the motion to refer the resolution back to the author, replied to the question of Brother Porter as follows: 'As long as the resolution lies on the table it may be called up at any time.' And the thought has occurred to my mind that this would be the only safe course for the convention to pursue and not really be discourteous to anybody. That motion, by the words of the parties, by the object and aim as they have explicitly and most publicly and persistently made known in this convention, is directly opposed to the object of this movement. And I do not think that anyone can be imposed upon by it. I am in favor of free speeches in this convention all the way through, but I am not in favor of allowing this resolution to lie on the table, liable to be brought up at any time."

The motion of Mr. Morrow was then seconded, and the chairman then said, "The motion is to return this paper to the author." The motion prevailed with almost a unanimous vote.

That such an association would adopt that resolution as section 1 of its constitution, could not have been expected; but the utter rejection of it as being "directly, positively, and explicitly" opposed to the work of the association, and the almost unanimous refusal even to table it, lest it should be brought up at some other time, shows the un-American character of the whole movement. That such a body should aid in the construction of even an *"American* Sabbath" is surprising.
