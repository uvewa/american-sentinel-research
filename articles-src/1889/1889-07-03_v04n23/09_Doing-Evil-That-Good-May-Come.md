# Doing Evil That Good May Come.

The Rev. Wilbur F. Crafts, D. D., a prominent worker in the cause of so-called National Reform, while referring some time since to the petitions which were being circulated for signatures against the religious legislation provided for by the now defunct Blair Sunday-Rest bill, took occasion to remark that said petitions were so worded as to give the “false impression” that the National Reformers were “asking for a law to promote the religious observance of the Sabbath,” whereas, he said, they “were seeking only protection for Sunday rest and worship.” Inasmuch as religion is defined to be any “system of faith and worship,” it follows, from the lucid explanation of Mr. Crafts, that the difference between the religious observance of the Sunday sabbath and what he and his co-reformers are seeking, is about as great as the difference between tweedledee and tweedledum.

As has been repeatedly shown, there is nothing false whatever in a single statement of the counterpetition. It was designed to open the eyes of the people, and their representatives in Congress, to the fact that religious legislation was being called for by National Reformers, and that if their plea was granted, grave danger menaced the republican institutions of this country. This point, however, is seized upon by Mr. Crafts as being one which is designed to convey a “false impression.” Were there the remotest probability that the reverend gentleman would take it, the advice might be suggested that “those who live in glass houses should not throw stones.” It is improbable, however, that anything by way of advice would have much effect upon him in this matter. A man who would deliberately make the statement, from both pulpit and press, that a petition calling for a National Sunday law had obtained 14,000,000 signatures, when in point of fact only 407 names were attached to it, would have sufficient self-assurance to do almost anything. He would, doubtless, even sanction the various subterfuges used to obtain the re-indorsement at different times and places of many of these individuals who were already numbered in the petition, and yet whose indorsements, made in many cases without their knowledge, were again and again counted as new names to the original petition. All these and other questionable measures were resorted to by Dr. Crafts and his associates. Some names were used as many as five times, while thousands of persons were represented as favoring the movement who in reality were directly opposed to it, and had actually signed the counter petition. Such work as this should make the National Reform Association feel that it has secured a craftsman who is in every way worthy of the work in which he is engaged. Truly the accusation of laboring to create “false impressions” comes with poor grace from any National Reformer, but peculiarly so under these circumstances from the Rev. Wilbur F. Crafts, D. D.

A marked feature among National Reformers seems to be their apparent inability to adopt truthful and upright methods of dealing with the questions to which they have committed themselves. Their entire work evidences a chronic failing in this direction, and the more thoroughly an individual becomes saturated with the principles of National Reform, the more perceptibly does this failing manifest itself. And the work of Mr. Crafts seems to afford no exception to this rule.

The proclivity for falsehood developed by the Romish Church in its early history was perfectly wonderful, if the statements of historians are to be credited. It was not only a well-known maxim among the Catholic Fathers that falsehoods were valuable auxiliaries to the truth, but it was a custom expressly defended and maintained by them that it was right to perform evil deeds that so-called good results might be accomplished. Whether this is the reason or not for such actions as have just been referred to on the part of National Reformers, it is a fact that when men have certain objects to be gained they naturally expect to resort to such methods as have gained similar results in times past. And in this connection there is certainly a striking similarity between the methods of the National Reform Association and its illustrious prototype, the Papacy. J. W. Scoles.
