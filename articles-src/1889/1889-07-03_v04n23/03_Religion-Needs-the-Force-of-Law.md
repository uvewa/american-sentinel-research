In a recent debate in Parliament on a bill to disestablish the State Church in Wales, and thus no longer compel people to support churches and church service in which they do not believe, one of the speakers said:—

> "Religion needs the force of law to compel people to believe and obey. In America people are running wild for want of it." .

All we can say on this is that it must be a poor kind of religion which can command attention and obedience only through the "force of law." How much real piety would there be in such obedience as this?—None whatever. Who would be glorified by it?—Not God surely, for he desires willing service. Any other kind is not acceptable to him. Possibly those zealots who voted down the bill above referred to thought they were conferring honor upon God by enforcing so- called religion upon the people, but we doubt it. All such work as this is done by men for the purpose of honoring and glorifying themselves more than anything else. And we would remark in regard to people running wild in America for want of such religion as this, the National Reformers seem to be almost running wild to get such religion as this recognized by our Government, but this is all the "wildness" we have noticed in this direction. And we hope it will be a long time before good citizens will become so forgetful of the principles of true government as to join hands with them.
