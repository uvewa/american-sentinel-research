A Chicago clergyman preached a sermon recently on "Sunday Base-ball," from which we get the following:—

> "To play base-ball on Sunday leads to every sin under heaven. Did Daniel Webster play ball on Sunday? Did he read the Sunday newspapers? —No. He staid at home and read his Bible. Think of it! If Sunday base-ball had been played in Webster's time perhaps Webster would have been dragged into it. How that great man would have deteriorated if he had played baseball. He would have sunk into oblivion."

To which the *Evening News* makes the subjoined reply:—

> "We have no desire to defend the playing of base-ball on Sunday. It is a reprehensible practice at best, and as practiced by the Kansas City nine it is disappointing as well. But somehow the method employed by this Chicago parson to demonstrate the impropriety of Sunday base-ball is not altogether satisfactory. We hate bad logic as much as the reverend gentleman abhors false doctrine, heresy, and schism, and with all due respect for the cloth, his argument smacks of bad logic.

> "Daniel Webster never played ball on Sunday, therefore base-ball on Sunday is the acme of wickedness. Well, let's carry the argument to its logical conclusion. Webster never willingly paid his debts, therefore the paying of debts leads to evil. Webster had a prejudice against going to bed sober, *ergo* sobriety is the bane of human existence."
