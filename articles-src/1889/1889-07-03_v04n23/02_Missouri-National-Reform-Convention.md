The Missouri National Reform Convention, recently held at Sedalia, did not come up to the expectations of its friends in point of attendance. We are told by one who was present that a program had been circulated extensively throughout the State, announcing several leading ministers of the State to deliver addresses before the convention, only about one-half of whom were present. Arrangements had been made to hold the evening sessions in three churches in the city, but the Cumberland Presbyterian Church proved ample for the accommodation of the whole.
