# The Sunday Law: How It Will Affect American Institutions.

Those who plead for laws to protect the “American Sabbath,” evidently use this term in order to appeal to the patriotism of others who are justly proud of our country, and who have a jealous regard for the American institutions. But how will the enforcement by law of an institution that was venerable before this continent was thought of, affect those principles of liberty and equality which are distinctively American?

First, in order to make a national Sunday law effective the instrument called the American Constitution must be so amended as to allow laws to be enforced which will not only discriminate in favor of the religious opinions of one class, but at the same time abridge the religious rights of another, and the *inalienable rights of all.* For as Sunday is without dispute a religious institution, any effort to enforce its observance by law is a blow aimed directly at one of the fundamental principles of our Government, namely, *religious liberty,* that principle to which, more than any other, we are indebted for our country’s greatness; that principle which has enabled sixty millions of people of almost every shade of religious opinion to dwell on the same soil in united self-government.

Second, there is in this country an enterprising and rapidly-increasing people who not only insist on using their own discretion in regard to the observance of days, but who claim that there is no divine warrant for the observance of the first day of the week as holy time; that the Sunday institution is un-American, un-Christian, and unholy. They consider it their duty to propagate their doctrine to the world; thus, by precept and example, others are influenced to disregard Sunday and Sunday laws; but he who influences others to violate the civil law becomes a party to crime; in fact, a ring-leader. Hence, in order to make Sunday laws effective laws must be passed which will make criminals of virtuous and law- abiding citizens, and abolish that boasted institution of civil liberty, *“freedom of speech.”*

But the end is not yet. The subject will be discussed by the secular and religious press. Books, pamphlets, and tracts already flood the country, and will continue to be published, which denounce all legislation on religious questions, and which also give arguments against the Sunday itself. In order to make the Sunday law effective this must be prohibited by law. Another valued American institution must step aside, and soon the *freedom of the press* will be a thing of the past.

But the matter will not end here; the arguments contained in the printed matter already in circulation, bristling as they are with scriptural and historical facts, will be a constant menace to the “American Sabbath,” until this literature is *gathered together and burned.* But still men will read and ponder and obey the teachings of that Book of all books, which is the foundation of their faith, until that too is taken from them and given to the flames. In fact, in order successfully to force any religious form, institution, or rite, upon this Nation of freemen, our freedom must be abolished, our Constitution shattered, and our whole social and political fabric overturned.

American citizens, fellow-countrymen, are you ready to forge the shackles for your own enslavement? Are you ready to unite with conspirators against our Government? If so, use your influence in favor of the Sunday law. If not, fight it with all your might.E. P. Dexter.
