During the recent session of the National Reform Convention in Sedalia, Missouri, Mrs. Kate L. Shaw, State superintendent of the W. C. T. U., sprung the question as to why the Sunday law of that State is not enforced. Dr. Brooks, of Kansas City, endeavored to give some reasons, and first of all he said: "The Christian people of this country do not raise such a protest as to compel the officers to enforce the law; if the preachers would speak out on this question I believe these officials would be more faithful than they are."

Now why don't the preachers speak out? That question can easily be answered for them: The law doesn't reach the class that the preachers really want to get at.

The reason the Missouri law is not enforced can be gathered from the experience of Arkansas. The law in that State was not enforced until the clause exempting those who kept the seventh-day Sabbath was repealed. But no sooner was that action secured than the preachers began to "speak out," and the officials were "more faithful"—not, however, in closing up saloons, or Sunday theaters, or stopping base-ball games, but in seeking out quiet seventh-day keepers who pursued their rural vocations on Sunday, miles away from any public place. And when the exemption was restored, the execution of the law ceased, and its friends are now "speaking out" loudly, not for the enforcement of the law on the rowdy elements of society, but for the repeal of that exemption. They aim to work energetically to that end for the next two years, until the next session of the Legislature, and in the meantime they make no effort to have the law enforced.

So in Missouri, Dr. Brooks said that twenty thousand people attended a Sunday base-ball game in Kansas City, "and the shouts and yells of that vast concourse of people shook the air from center to circumference of that city; there was no spot in Kansas City where you could not hear them." Yet the officers did not stop it, nor did the preachers—not even the Rev. D. D. speaker himself—"speak out" to enter a complaint and have the disgraceful proceeding shut off. So it is plain that the saloons, and the hoodlum games, are not the game that the Sunday-law people want. They will stumble right over that and not even attempt to catch it.

But it is safe to predict that if the exemption clause of the Missouri Sunday law were repealed, the preachers, and especially Dr. Brooks, would "speak out" in thunder tones, and the officers would suddenly become "more faithful" in hunting up those who should rest and worship on the seventh day, and then on Sunday engage in the noisy occupation of painting the back part of a house or digging potatoes.W.
