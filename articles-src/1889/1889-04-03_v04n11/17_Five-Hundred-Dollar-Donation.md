A letter containing a draft for $500 to be used in placing the American Sentinel before leading men of intelligence, was one of the items of our mail last week. To say that we appreciate such items would be a mild statement. In this instance the gift shows the more devotion to the cause which the Sentinel advocates, because the man was disabled in the war, and the money is part of a back pension that he received. How many others are there who have similar devotion to the cause?
