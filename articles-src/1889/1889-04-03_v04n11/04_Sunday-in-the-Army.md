# Sunday in the Army.

About this time, as the almanacs say, look out for a jubilee among National Reformers, the members of the American Sunday Union, etc. The reason for this prediction is found in the following special dispatch from Washington, to the San Francisco *Examiner* of March 16:—

> “Secretary Proctor is an advocate of the Sunday- Rest law, as will soon be demonstrated by the appearance of an order from the War Department abolishing the Sunday dress parades at all army posts throughout the country.

> “This subject has been agitated in the annual reports of army officials for years, but none of Mr. Proctor’s predecessors have seen fit to direct the change. General Sheridan was opposed to the abolition, which probably accounts for nothing having been done in late years.
> “The present Commanding General, however, believes that only absolutely necessary work should be done in the army on Sunday, and has strongly indorsed a recent report of the Inspector-General of the army recommending the abolition of the dress parade and all other unnecessary work on the Sabbath.
> “Those papers are now before Secretary Proctor, and, although he has not yet acted, he has remarked his hearty approval of the proposition.”
Thus the “workingman” is gradually getting his rights. The Sunday law is declared to be absolutely necessary in order that laboring men may have an opportunity to improve their minds. One clause specifies the very thing which the Secretary of War is said to be about to do, and probably in nothing else could the fallacy of Sunday-law argument be more plainly demonstrated. If there is anybody who has an opportunity to improve his mind if he chooses to, it is the soldier in time of peace. There cannot be the excuse in his case that he is overworked. Neither can a violated conscience be urged as making a Sunday law necessary; for (1) the instances are exceedingly rare in which a soldier cares anything more for Sunday than for any other day; and (2) in such instances he can easily make arrangement so that he will not have to work on Sunday. We know a man who was converted while in the regular army, and became convinced that the seventh day of the week is the Sabbath. He was conscientious, and during the sixteen months that remained of his term of service, he was able to rest on the seventh day. If this could be done, surely it could be done in the case of one who wished to keep Sunday.

The desire for a Sunday law, so far as the army is concerned, is not because of any special love for the soldier, nor to relieve his conscience, but simply to gratify the feelings of those who, because they keep Sunday, are determined that everybody else shall. The *Examiner* closes an editorial comment on the proposed order, in the following ironical vein:—

> “It is well known that soldiers look forward through the week to the opportunity to enjoy the ministrations of the chaplain, and then to sit [85] quietly in some secluded sea-side garden, meditating upon the teachings they have received. The dress parade brings a jarring earthly element into a day that they desire to devote to other things.

> “Secretary Proctor will be gratefully remembered by the defenders of their country when their sabbaths are freed from the intrusion of work, and hearts and heads are swelling with spirituous emotions.”
This first application of the proposed Sunday law shows that the abettors thereof care not how much a man may, by his enforced idleness, be thrown into evil associations. All sins are in their eyes of less magnitude than working on Sunday; and rest on Sunday, even though it be as a result of compulsion, is considered as about all that a man needs to fit him for Heaven. We shall doubtless now have a Christian army.
