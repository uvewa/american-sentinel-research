# Is It Not Church and State?

The following editorial from the Catholic Mirror of February 16 no doubt expresses the sentiments of Catholics as well as of those Protestants who are clamoring for religious legislation:—

> “The Catholics of this country are decidedly opposed to a union of Church and State. That is the reason they object to the arrogant attempt of Protestants to mould the social and educational life of the country on sectarian lines. It is all very well for the sects to divert public attention from their own plans by raising a hue and cry about the tendency of the Catholic Church to gobble up everything, but the attempt is too thin. Its transparency is becoming more apparent every day to reasonable minds outside of the church.”

But what is this “union of Church and State” to which Catholics are opposed? It is revealed in the second sentence. They object to the moulding of “the social and educational life of the country on sectarian lines;” that is, they object to making any denomination the State church— unless (for history past and present proves the fact) the State church is the Roman Catholic. Of course, they know that there is no present prospect of that church becoming the State church; therefore they can pose as liberalists, and talk of freedom of conscience. But Spain and Ecuador and Mexico prove that Rome does desire a union of the Catholic Church and State. And no sect is wielding a more powerful influence in politics to-day than that of Rome. Her liberal utterances are but blinds to her eternally-sought object,— the control of all power, and the extermination of all heretics.

Many Protestants are standing just where Rome does. If Reformed Presbyterians could reasonably hope that their church could be made the State church, is it to be considered a moment that they would not labor earnestly for that object? Would it not likewise be the same with the greater part of the Lutheran and Protestant Episcopal Churches? The course pursued by these churches on the Continent and in England proves that they would zealously labor to make their church the State church.

But neither these, nor any other Protestant denomination, hope for anything of this kind. It can be safely said that no one denomination will ever become the State church of our Federal Government. Knowing this, these political Protestants say with Roman Catholics, We do not believe in a union of Church and State. But by this they always mean a union of one church, or denomination, with the State. But what do they believe? They believe (and are working for that purpose) in uniting the various so-called branches of the Christian church, by which they mean the great and popular bodies of Christendom, on doctrines which are considered essential and common to all. These essential doctrines will be, in their minds, the essentials of Christianity, or the Christian religion, and these churches which hold to, and unite upon, these essentials will be held by these bodies to constitute the Christian church.

By their united power and influence they can mould politics at their will. These essentials will become embodied in statute law, and thus will be formed the union of the so-called Christian church and State—just as much a union of Church and State as though it was one church connected with the State, and a thousand times more productive of evil, because more powerful. But such a combination would never be productive of good; for Christianity never needed the aid of State laws; they have always proved a curse to her pure and holy doctrines.M. C. W.

## The Abiding Sabbath and the Lord’s Day.

THE $500 and $1,000 PRIZE ESSAYS.

A REVIEW.

The above is the title of a pamphlet recently issued. In its pages the author reviews the two most recent and without doubt the best contributions to the defense of Sunday, popularly called the “Lord’s Day.” The first of these essays was written by Rev. George Elliott, and took the $500” Fletcher Prize,” offered by the trustees of Dartmouth College for the best essay on the “Perpetual Obligation of the Lord’s Day.”

The other essay was written by A. E. Waffle, M. A., and was awarded a $1,000 prize by the Committee of Publication of the American Sunday-school Union.

We state thus definitely the source of the essays reviewed that all may see their importance. Certainly if there was any argument in favor of Sunday, we should expect to find it in these prize essays. Elder Jones in his *Review* takes up their arguments and assertions, and shows very plainly how several times the authors have *proved what they did not want to prove* at all—namely: The Seventh-day Sabbath is still as binding on all as when the law was given.

This *Review* will be read with interest and profit by all, and those who have friends that are interested in the Sabbath Question should see that one of these pamphlets is placed in their hands.

WORDS OF APPROBATION.

Elder R. A. Underwood, President Ohio Conference, says:—

> “The ‘Abiding Sabbath ’ should find its way to every home in the land. It certainly will have a wide circulation. May God bless it on its mission. The quotations from Mr. Elliott’s essays set forth the divine origin of the Sabbath, its object, universality, and inseparable relation to the moral law of ten commandments, of which it is a part, and its binding obligation upon all mankind; also the clear distinction between the Sabbath and the ceremonial rites, or laws, in words of sublime, convincing power. Yet he, like all who feel it their duty to prop up the Sunday-sabbath with the fourth commandment, contradists his own position. Elder Jones has made a clean-cut, sound argument.”

Elder J. N. Loughborough, President California Conference, says:—

> “I have just completed a careful reading of Elder Jones’ Review. In this he attacks the main pillars of their argument for a Sunday-sabbath, and at the same time he gives an epitome of the argument for the true Bible Sabbath. He shows clearly that notwithstanding all the efforts of the $500 and $1,000 essay men to establish Sunday as the Sabbath, it stands, according tp their own admissions, without any Scripture command, or any divine warrant. This Review clearly shows what is the true ‘Abiding Sabbath,’ the day of God’s own appointment. This book of Elder Jones’ should have a very wide circulation, and be read by all.”

## “Fathers of the Catholic Church.”

—By Eld. E. J. Waggoner.—

HISTORY • REPEATS • ITSELF

Because human nature is the same in all ages of the world. Hence he who would know how to avoid error in the future must know how errors have developed in the past. The “Fathers of the Catholic Church” ’ shows the condition of the heathen world at the time of Christ, briefly states the principles of ancient heathen philosophy, which was largely responsible for the immorality of that time, and shows how the adoption of these principles by prominent men in the church, and the incautious lowering of the standard of pure Christianity to accommodate the heathen element, developed the Papacy, which was simply a new phase of Paganism. It shows that by the time of Constantine every phase of the Papacy was fully developed, and was only waiting for supreme power. The chapter on

—Sun •  Worship • and • Sunday—

Is alone worth the price of the book.

The chapter on “The Apostolic Church” consists largely of Quotations from Scripture, showing that grave errors both of faith and practice existed in the church even in the days of the apostles, so that the early existence of a practice proves nothing as to its correctness.

Then a chapter is devoted to each of the Fathers, and to his writings. The Sunday argument, so far as it is drawn from the Fathers, is completely demolished by the citation of other testimony from them in favor of some of the grossest evils of the Catholic Church.

Lastly, several chapters are devoted to “The Great Apostasy,” in which are traced the logical results of the teachings of the Fathers.

—Everybody • Should • Have • this • Book—

As all are constantly meeting quotations from the Fathers in behalf of Sunday. In these cases it is only necessary to show that the same Fathers believed in purgatory and prayers for the dead, to nullify their testimony.

The book is printed on fine tinted paper, neatly bound in cloth, with gilt side stamp, and contains 392 pages.

Note.—No papers are sent by the publishers of the American Sentinel to people who have not subscribed for it. If the Sentinel comes to one who has not subscribed for it, he may know that it is sent him by some friend, and that he will not be called upon by the publishers to pay for the same.

A letter containing a draft for $500 to be used in placing the American Sentinel before leading men of intelligence, was one of the items of our mail last week. To say that we appreciate such items would be a mild statement. In this instance the gift shows the more devotion to the cause which the Sentinel advocates, because the man was disabled in the war, and the money is part of a back pension that he received. How many others are there who have similar devotion to the cause?

On the first page of “Sunday Laws and Sunday Liberty,” a document published by the New York Sabbath Committee, occurs the following paragraph:—

> “Our Sunday laws grew out of the observance of the Lord’s day, which the earliest colonists brought with them to these shores, and which was deeply rooted in their religious convictions.”

Exactly; and thus the very argument upon which the Sunday-law people depend most, to prove that Sunday is an American, and therefore a civil, institution, shows that it is un-American and wholly religious. Sunday laws are laws respecting an establishment of religion, and they are nothing else. Thus the Blair Sunday-Rest bill is in direct opposition to the first amendment to the Constitution.
