The *Capital Commonwealth* (Topeka, Kansas) prints the Blair Educational Amendment, and makes some very judicious comments thereon. Following are the first and last paragraphs of its comment, which we believe all our readers will say are eminently sensible:—

> "Without considering the first question which a lawyer would ask about the construction of these four sections—how it would be possible to prevent the establishment of a religion and at the same time require the establishment and maintenance of a system of common schools in which a religion shall be taught—the great question of the people is, Shall we have a national religion?"

> "It will not do. Religion is sacred to its professors; but let them enjoy what they desire in this matter, and employ teachers of good character in the public schools; then public morality will not suffer, and the people will take care of the principles of the Christian religion. There must not be a national religion in this country."
