## The Abiding Sabbath and the Lord's Day.

THE $500 and $1,000 PRIZE ESSAYS.

A REVIEW.

The above is the title of a pamphlet recently issued. In its pages the author reviews the two most recent and without doubt the best contributions to the defense of Sunday, popularly called the "Lord's Day." The first of these essays was written by Rev. George Elliott, and took the $500 "Fletcher Prize," offered by the trustees of Dartmouth College for the best essay on the "Perpetual Obligation of the Lord's Day."

The other essay was written by A. E. Waffle, M. A., and was awarded a $1,000 prize by the Committee of Publication of the American Sunday-school Union.

We state thus definitely the source of the essays reviewed that all may see their importance. Certainly if there was any argument in favor of Sunday, we should expect to find it in these prize essays. Elder Jones in his *Review* takes up their arguments and assertions, and shows very plainly how several times the authors have *proved what they did not want to prove* at all—namely: The Seventh-day Sabbath is still as binding on all as when the law was given.

This *Review* will be read with interest and profit by all, and those who have friends that are interested in the Sabbath Question should see that one of these pamphlets is placed in their hands.

WORDS OF APPROBATION.

Elder R. A. Underwood, President Ohio Conference, says:—

> "The 'Abiding Sabbath' should find its way to every home in the land. It certainly will have a wide circulation. May God bless it on its mission. The quotations from Mr. Elliott's essays set forth the divine origin of the Sabbath, its object, universality, and inseparable relation to the moral law of ten commandments, of which it is a part, and its binding obligation upon all mankind; also the clear distinction between the Sabbath and the ceremonial rites, or laws, in words of sublime, convincing power. Yet he, like all who feel it their duty to prop up the Sunday-sabbath with the fourth commandment, contradicts his own position. Elder Jones has made a clean-cut, sound argument."

Elder J. N. Loughborough, President California Conference, says:—

> "I have just completed a careful reading of Elder Jones' Review. In this he attacks the main pillars of their argument for a Sunday-sabbath, and at the same time he gives an epitome of the argument for the true Bible Sabbath. He shows clearly that notwithstanding all the efforts of the $500 and $1,000 essay men to establish Sunday as the Sabbath, it stands, according to their own admissions, without any Scripture command, or any divine warrant. This Review clearly shows what is the true 'Abiding Sabbath,' the day of God's own appointment. This book of Elder Jones' should have a very wide circulation, and be read by all."
