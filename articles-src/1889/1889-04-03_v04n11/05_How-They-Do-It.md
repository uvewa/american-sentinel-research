# How They Do It.

Not long ago Mr. Crafts appeared before the Federation of Labor, in Washington, D. C., and urged that body to indorse the Sunday-Rest bill. An ex-president of the association said, in the presence of the writer, that Mr. Crafts told them that if they would by vote indorse the measure, that would give him the privilege of adding 15,000 names to the petitions already then secured in its behalf.

This Federation of Labor is composed of delegates from about thirty local trades unions in the district, which the secretary said aggregated a little over 9,000 tradesmen. Yet Mr. Crafts’ conscience was elastic enough to permit him to swell that number on his petitions to 15,000 simply by the vote of about fifty delegates, not one of whom was authorized to represent the sentiment of his fellow-tradesmen on that subject. This is a sample, however, of how many of the 6,000,000 names recently presented to Congress by that party were obtained. Why not do a really wholesale job while one is about it, and just send to Congress a petition with 60,000,000 names attached, and so close up the work at one stroke? You smile. But that would be just about as consistent as the way they are now doing, and a great deal cheaper and quicker. J. O. C.
