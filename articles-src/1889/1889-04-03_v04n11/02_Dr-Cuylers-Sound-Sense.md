Dr. T. L. Cuyler wrote lately to the New York *Voice* these words of sound sense:—

> "While I applaud the zeal and honor, the sturdy convictions of my temperance brethren in the third party, I cannot ally myself with you, for three very strong reasons: 1. Long observation has taught me that wherever and whenever Prohibition has been successfully enacted, it has *not* been by a separate, distinct temperance party. 2. I am conscientiously opposed to your proposal to burden woman with the trust, duties, and responsibilities of the ballot and of civil office. 3. As the president of a nonpartisan society for the promotion of both total abstinence and the suppression of the liquor traffic, I do not feel at liberty to identify myself with any partisan organization."
