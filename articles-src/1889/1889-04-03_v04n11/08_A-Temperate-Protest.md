# A Temperate Protest.

The following protest was adopted by unanimous vote of a large congregation assembled in Aurora, Ill, February 3. It is temperate in its language, and we do not see how anybody can dissent from its statements without convicting himself of bigotry:—

*To the Hon. Senate and House of Representatives of the U. S. Congress—*

The rights of conscience are inherent, inalienable, above and beyond all compacts and statutes. They are not and cannot be subjects of legislation. The right of free thought, speech, and action on all subjects of belief, limited only by the same right in others, is absolute in every intelligent being. Any abridgement of that right, followed to its logical sequences, will destroy society itself. The great and only object of government is the enforcement, not the abridgement, of personal rights.

Religion has only to do with man’s conscience. It is entirely beyond the jurisdiction of the State. It does not belong to the State to fix and enforce penal sanctions for the violation of laws and obligations, which it did not and cannot create, or for which no authority is conferred. The powers of the United States Government are purely secular. The Constitution prohibits expressly the right to pass any law respecting the establishment of any form of religion.

We, the citizens, assembled in mass-meeting at Aurora Turner Hall, in Chicago, therefore most earnestly enter our protest against the passage of the law entitled, “A bill to secure to the people the enjoyment of the first day of the week, commonly known as the Lord’s day, as a day of rest, and to promote its observance as a day of religious worship,” and against the adoption of an amendment to the Constitution, which compels each State to provide for the education of all children of the age from 6 to 16 years, in the several branches of science, in virtue, morality, and in the principles of the “Christian religion,” both of which bills have been introduced in the Senate of the United States by Senator Blair, of New Hampshire; because these bills establish a certain form of religion, by selecting and enforcing the religious observance of a particular day, and because they prescribe the “Christian religion” as the standard of virtue, morality, and popular education. This would be a clear case of the exercise of powers not conferred by the Constitution to either House of our National Legislature.
