# The Papacy in Canada.

Reference has been made in these columns to the arrogance of Cardinal Tashchereau in demanding a seat by the side of the throne at the opening of the Canadian Parliament. But this is only a part of his ways. A dispatch from Quebec to the New York Times, dated February 2, says:—

> "The influence which the Church of Rome has acquired over the Legislature of this province would astonish an outsider. The simplest measure is not sure of becoming law unless the Government can certify that it has received the sanction of Cardinal Tashchereau."

The dispatch says that on Wednesday, the 30th of January, in three cases bills were presented to the Legislature with the assurance that the bills had received the sanction of the Cardinal, and even in the case of an act providing for the registration of births, marriages, and deaths, which had repeatedly been asked for by the Board of Health of the province, when the act was proposed the Government took the pains to announce that it had been approved by the Cardinal and his bishop.

Further, the account says:—	.

> "It was proposed to come to the assistance of the farmers whose grain had been destroyed by the wet weather of last fall, and the Premier promised that if a committee was formed, with the Cardinal for chairman, to distribute the funds, the Government would contribute liberally. The church in its turn sometimes treats the Government in a cavalier style. The Premier last year wished to compromise with the Jesuits, who have always been his staunch supporters, on their claim to be compensated for the estates of the order which had been confiscated by the imperial Government, when the order died out in 1800. He proposed to give them $400,000, which they were ready to accept, but the Cardinal intervened, and claimed the money on behalf of the Catholic universities on the ground that the order of Jesus had been excommunicated by the Pope, and had died out, and that the Jesuits of to-day were not their legal heirs.

> "Finally the Legislature paid over $400,000 to the order of the Pope, to be distributed as he saw fit. The bill was sanctioned by the Dominion Government a few days ago, and the Premier telegraphed the fact to Cardinal Simeoni, asking him at the same time what distribution the Pope proposed to make. An answer was received to the effect that the Provincial Government would be notified through the proper channel."

Since this dispatch was published we have seen it stated that a strong demand was being made upon the Canadian Parliament to have it reverse its action in paying this $400,000. But how is it going to do that without the Cardinal's approval? And assuredly the Cardinal would never approve such a thing as that. More than this! If it should do it without the Cardinal's approval the Pope has the money, and the Canadian Parliament may vote till doom's day that it will not pay it, and it will amount to nothing. The Pope has the money; and that is the last that the Canadian Parliament or the Canadians will ever see of it.
