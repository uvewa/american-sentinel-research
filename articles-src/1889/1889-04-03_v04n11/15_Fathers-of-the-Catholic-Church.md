## "Fathers of the Catholic Church."

—By Eld. E. J. Waggoner.—

HISTORY • REPEATS • ITSELF

Because human nature is the same in all ages of the world. Hence he who would know how to avoid error in the future must know how errors have developed in the past. The "Fathers of the Catholic Church" ' shows the condition of the heathen world at the time of Christ, briefly states the principles of ancient heathen philosophy, which was largely responsible for the immorality of that time, and shows how the adoption of these principles by prominent men in the church, and the incautious lowering of the standard of pure Christianity to accommodate the heathen element, developed the Papacy, which was simply a new phase of Paganism. It shows that by the time of Constantine every phase of the Papacy was fully developed, and was only waiting for supreme power. The chapter on

—Sun •  Worship • and • Sunday—

Is alone worth the price of the book.

The chapter on "The Apostolic Church" consists largely of Quotations from Scripture, showing that grave errors both of faith and practice existed in the church even in the days of the apostles, so that the early existence of a practice proves nothing as to its correctness.

Then a chapter is devoted to each of the Fathers, and to his writings. The Sunday argument, so far as it is drawn from the Fathers, is completely demolished by the citation of other testimony from them in favor of some of the grossest evils of the Catholic Church.

Lastly, several chapters are devoted to "The Great Apostasy," in which are traced the logical results of the teachings of the Fathers.

—Everybody • Should • Have • this • Book—

As all are constantly meeting quotations from the Fathers in behalf of Sunday. In these cases it is only necessary to show that the same Fathers believed in purgatory and prayers for the dead, to nullify their testimony.

The book is printed on fine tinted paper, neatly bound in cloth, with gilt side stamp, and contains 392 pages.
