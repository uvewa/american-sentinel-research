# Civil Government and Religion.

That the two have nothing to do with each other, except for each to leave the other alone to do its own work in its own way, and that any interference of the one with the other invariably leads to bad results, is what is clearly shown in a pamphlet of 176 pages, with the above title, written by Alonzo T. Jones, of the American Sentinel. The little book is the outgrowth of several lectures delivered in Minneapolis, in October, 1888. Much interest was awakened by the lectures at the time, and many requests were made for them to be furnished in such shape that they could be studied. Accordingly they were written out from the short-hand notes, revised and expanded, and the result is something that will well repay careful study. Following is the complete tables of contents:—

Chapter 1.—What is Due to God, and What to Cesar?—Moral Law and Civil Law Compared—Sin and Crime Defined—God the only Moral Governor—The Principle Expressed by Christ is the Principle Embodied in the American Constitution.

Chapter 2.—The Powers that Be.—An Exposition of Romans 13:1 by Examples from Holy Writ—How Earthly Governments are Ordained of God—The Powers of Rulers Limited by the Will of the People.

Chapter 3.—The Gospel of Liberty.— The Roman Religion Exalted the Power of the State—The Rites of the Roman Worship—Martyrs to Roman Power.

Chapter 4.—The Religious Attack upon the United States Constitution, and Those Who Are Making It.—Proposed Amendment to the Constitution, Respecting the Establishment of Religion and Free Public Schools—Its Fallacy Exposed—Quotations from National Reformers—What They Want to See in Our Government.

Chapter 5.—Religious Legislation.—The Proposed Religious Amendment to the Constitution—The Amendment Arraigned—What Would Be the Result of Its Becoming a Law—The Amendment Unconstitutional and Antichristian.

Chapter 6.—The Sunday Law Movement in the Fourth Century, and its Parallel in the Nineteenth.—The Development of the Papacy—The Papacy a False Theocracy—Constantine’s Sunday Law—The Church Secures the Aid of the State to Enforce It—Resulted in the Inquisition—The Present Demand for a Theocracy—The Power of the State Sought for the Support of Religion—What Will be Sacrificed to Secure It.

Chapter 7.—The Workings of a Sunday Law.—The Arkansas Cases—The Supreme Court Decision—Repeal of the Law—Some Facts Worthy of Notice in the Arkansas Indictment.

In four appendices are given some statements of prominent citizens of Arkansas in regard to the workings of the Arkansas Sunday law; the Blair bill, with the changes desired by the American Sabbath Union; the Declaration of Independence; and the Constitution of the United States.

From the above it will be seen that the book is packed full of live matter, and that it covers a wide range of thought. Those who wish to become intelligent in regard to the working of so-called National Reform, should secure this book. It is absolutely unanswerable, and no National Reformer will ever attempt to answer it. If one should, he would find in chapter 7—”The Workings of a Sunday Law”—something that would puzzle him to explain away. We commend that chapter in particular to those who are inclined to plead or apologize for Sunday laws of any kind whatever. This chapter is no fancy sketch, but is simply a presentation of hard facts which may be verified by the court records.

Get the book and read it, and see that each one of your friends has a copy. Price, 25 cents. Address, American Sentinel, Oakland, Cal., or 43 Bond Street, N. Y.

The *Pearl of Days* says:—

> “The first section of a freight train on the Pennsylvania Railroad, stopped at the east end of the Raritan River Bridge, in New Brunswick, N. J., Sunday morning, February 24, when the second section crashed into it. One engine, a caboose, and seven cars were wrecked. The cars were burned, with their contents, of general merchandise. The pecuniary loss is heavy. Sunday trains are not remunerative in any case. When will railroad officers awake to the fact?”

What nonsense! The American Sabbath Union must be hard pressed for argument. One not acquainted with facts, would gather from that that Sunday railroad trains are invariably wrecked, and would naturally infer that railroad trains are exempt from accident on other days than Sunday. Railroad accidents are never remunerative, but they are no more liable to occur one day in the week than another. Even granting that the Lord has a special regard for Sunday, the Sunday folks should know that he doesn’t settle up his accounts once a week. Sunday railroad trains are as remunerative as those of any other day.
