The *Pearl of Days* says:—

> "The first section of a freight train on the Pennsylvania Railroad, stopped at the east end of the Raritan River Bridge, in New Brunswick, N. J., Sunday morning, February 24, when the second section crashed into it. One engine, a caboose, and seven cars were wrecked. The cars were burned, with their contents, of general merchandise. The pecuniary loss is heavy. Sunday trains are not remunerative in any case. When will railroad officers awake to the fact?"

What nonsense! The American Sabbath Union must be hard pressed for argument. One not acquainted with facts, would gather from that that Sunday railroad trains are invariably wrecked, and would naturally infer that railroad trains are exempt from accident on other days than Sunday. Railroad accidents are never remunerative, but they are no more liable to occur one day in the week than another. Even granting that the Lord has a special regard for Sunday, the Sunday folks should know that he doesn't settle up his accounts once a week. Sunday railroad trains are as remunerative as those of any other day.
