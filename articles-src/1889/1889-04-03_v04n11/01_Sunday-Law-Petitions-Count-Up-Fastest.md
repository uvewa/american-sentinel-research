The Woman's Christian Temperance department of the *Weekly Signal*, Otsego, Mich., in giving practical directions from Mrs. Bateham in regard to the Sunday-law petitions, says: "Signatures are most valuable, but indorsements count up fastest." Yes; that is true, as the indorsement of 240 can be made to "count up" 240,000, and the indorsement of one can be made to "count up" 7,200,000, and when 407 individual signatures "count up" 14,174,744, it is certain that that kind of petitions counts up faster than individual signatures. Yes, by all means, work for indorsements rather than individual signatures, for they count up much faster.
