# Washington and Constitutional Religious Liberty.

The following extract from the “History of the Great Republic” (pp. 528, 529), by Jesse T. Peck, D. D., is sent us by a friend:—

> “The Constitution of the United States was adopted in 1787. Immediately thereafter (March, 1788) the Virginia Baptist General Committee took up the question for discussion, whether the new Federal Constitution, which had now lately made its appearance in public, made sufficient provision for the secure enjoyment of religious liberty. After full investigation, it was unanimously agreed that it did *not*. The committee then consulted with Mr. Madison as to what could be done in the case, who recommended them to address General Washington upon the subject. They also sought the co-operation of the Baptists in the other States of the Union, and sent out Elder John Leland as their representative, who secured their cordial co-operation. The sixth article in the new Constitution read: ‘No religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States.’ In August, 1789, the Baptists sent a well-digested and formal address to Washington on the subject, by a delegation from their body. He pronounced their position right, and the next month he carried through Congress this amendment: ‘Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.’ This is a part of our present Constitution. The correspondence on that occasion is worthy of the men whom it immortalizes on both sides. The Baptists said to Washington: ‘When the Constitution first made its appearance in Virginia, we, as a society, had unusual strugglings of mind, fearing that the liberty of conscience, dearer to us than property or life, was not sufficiently secured. Perhaps our jealousies were heightened by the usage we received in Virginia under the royal Government, when mobs, fines, bonds and prisons were our frequent repast.’ To which the President replied: ‘If I could have entertained the slightest apprehension that the Constitution framed by the convention, when I had the honor to preside, might possibly endanger the religious rights of any ecclesiastical society, certainly I would never have placed my signature to it, and if I could now conceive that the general Government might ever be so administered as to render the liberty of conscience insecure, I beg you will be persuaded that no one would be more zealous than myself to establish effectual barriers against the horrors of spiritual tyranny and every species of religious persecution.”
