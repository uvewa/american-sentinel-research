On the first page of "Sunday Laws and Sunday Liberty," a document published by the New York Sabbath Committee, occurs the following paragraph:—

> "Our Sunday laws grew out of the observance of the Lord's day, which the earliest colonists brought with them to these shores, and which was deeply rooted in their religious convictions."

Exactly; and thus the very argument upon which the Sunday-law people depend most, to prove that Sunday is an American, and therefore a civil, institution, shows that it is un-American and wholly religious. Sunday laws are laws respecting an establishment of religion, and they are nothing else. Thus the Blair Sunday-Rest bill is in direct opposition to the first amendment to the Constitution.
