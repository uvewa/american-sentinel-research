# Is It Not Church and State?

The following editorial from the Catholic Mirror of February 16 no doubt expresses the sentiments of Catholics as well as of those Protestants who are clamoring for religious legislation:—

> "The Catholics of this country are decidedly opposed to a union of Church and State. That is the reason they object to the arrogant attempt of Protestants to mould the social and educational life of the country on sectarian lines. It is all very well for the sects to divert public attention from their own plans by raising a hue and cry about the tendency of the Catholic Church to gobble up everything, but the attempt is too thin. Its transparency is becoming more apparent every day to reasonable minds outside of the church."

But what is this "union of Church and State" to which Catholics are opposed? It is revealed in the second sentence. They object to the moulding of "the social and educational life of the country on sectarian lines;" that is, they object to making any denomination the State church— unless (for history past and present proves the fact) the State church is the Roman Catholic. Of course, they know that there is no present prospect of that church becoming the State church; therefore they can pose as liberalists, and talk of freedom of conscience. But Spain and Ecuador and Mexico prove that Rome does desire a union of the Catholic Church and State. And no sect is wielding a more powerful influence in politics to-day than that of Rome. Her liberal utterances are but blinds to her eternally-sought object,— the control of all power, and the extermination of all heretics.

Many Protestants are standing just where Rome does. If Reformed Presbyterians could reasonably hope that their church could be made the State church, is it to be considered a moment that they would not labor earnestly for that object? Would it not likewise be the same with the greater part of the Lutheran and Protestant Episcopal Churches? The course pursued by these churches on the Continent and in England proves that they would zealously labor to make their church the State church.

But neither these, nor any other Protestant denomination, hope for anything of this kind. It can be safely said that no one denomination will ever become the State church of our Federal Government. Knowing this, these political Protestants say with Roman Catholics, We do not believe in a union of Church and State. But by this they always mean a union of one church, or denomination, with the State. But what do they believe? They believe (and are working for that purpose) in uniting the various so-called branches of the Christian church, by which they mean the great and popular bodies of Christendom, on doctrines which are considered essential and common to all. These essential doctrines will be, in their minds, the essentials of Christianity, or the Christian religion, and these churches which hold to, and unite upon, these essentials will be held by these bodies to constitute the Christian church.

By their united power and influence they can mould politics at their will. These essentials will become embodied in statute law, and thus will be formed the union of the so-called Christian church and State—just as much a union of Church and State as though it was one church connected with the State, and a thousand times more productive of evil, because more powerful. But such a combination would never be productive of good; for Christianity never needed the aid of State laws; they have always proved a curse to her pure and holy doctrines.M. C. W.
