The National Reform Association, not content with the alliance of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, is mustering the women on its own account. It has a "special secretary of the National Reform Association", Mrs. E. J. Crothers, of New York, "for the formation of National Reform Circles" of women called "King's Daughters." The purpose of the organization "is to disseminate National Reform literature and to raise money for the cause." Woman was first in the transgression, and we are afraid she is going to be the last. It is too bad.
