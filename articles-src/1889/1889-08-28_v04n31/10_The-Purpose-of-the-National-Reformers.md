# The Purpose of the National Reformers.

According to the report of Secretary Wylie; of the National Reform Association, Miss Anna Shaw in her argument before the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union, of Steuben County, Indiana, claimed that the safety of the republic in point of Sunday observance, National Reform, temperance reform, etc., depends upon granting the elective franchise to women. The claim is supported by Secretary Wylie, who closes his letter with the following:—

> “The address carried conviction to many hearts. Some who have resisted every argument they have heretofore heard, yielded to the invincible logic of Miss Shaw. The whole address, as well as other exercises, was leavened with Bible truth as to civil government.

> “Delegates were appointed to attend the National Reform Convention in Pittsburg, in April. Among the resolutions passed was one on the Sabbath question endorsing the Blair ‘Sunday-Rest bill.’”
In the light of the foregoing, it is evident that the W. C. T. U. of that locality are thoroughly committed to the religio-political schemes of the National Reformers.

The intolerance of the National Reform movement is set forth in a letter from another secretary—Foster—of the National Reform Association, in the issue of the *Christian Statesman* of March 14. Referring to a lecture given by himself at the Kentucky State University, Louisville, Secretary Foster said:—

> “An opportunity was given to ask questions. A student asked: ‘Would not the enactment of a national Sabbath law oppress the conscience of those who keep the seventh day?’ It was answered: ‘We have Sabbath laws already in every State in the Union, with the exception of California. We would not think of abolishing these laws because a few brethren object. Now what we want is to have the Nation fall into line with the States.’”

This is putting it rather delicately. “We would not think of abolishing these laws because a few brethren object.” Translated into trenchant English, this means *we would coerce the minority into obedience to State and National Sunday laws, without regard to their conscientious scruples.* All right, brethren; if you think that to be the spirit of the gospel, push your efforts and compel the government of the United States to support them, if you can. We shall continue to obey Jehovah, to protest against your injustice, and to leave the result with Him who ruleth among the nations of men. Judging by the history of the past, He has much larger resources wherewith to defend truth and righteousness than the National Reform Association and the American Congress combined. We wish all the advocates of Sunday laws were as honest as some of them are in avowing their real purpose. We respect one who openly declares that he should think himself to be serving God by disregarding our rights, more than we can respect one who insists that he has no intention of doing this, but continues to urge those steps which must do it, if successful. If a man aims at the spot where you stand, and “has shoot in his eye,” you know what to expect; if he seeks to “shoot around the corner,” you know what he would be glad to do if he dared.—*The Light of Home, Seventh-day Baptist, Alfred Centre, N. Y.*
