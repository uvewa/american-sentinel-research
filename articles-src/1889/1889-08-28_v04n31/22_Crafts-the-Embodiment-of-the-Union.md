Sunday night, August 4, in the United Presbyterian Church of San Francisco, Dr. A. J. Nelson said that "Dr. Crafts is the originator and inspiration and embodiment of the American Sabbath Union." This explains why the Sentinel has had to mention Mr. Crafts so often. We did not like to do it because, to those who do not understand the whole matter, it appears as though the Sentinel was making this a personal contest. But we are not. The Sentinel is opposing the whole Sunday-law movement, in whatever form it appears, and the American Sabbath Union in particular, and as that organization is embodied in Mr. Crafts, we are compelled, in the nature of the case, to mention his name a good deal. But let no one think that it is a personal matter. However, as Mr. Crafts "is the originator, and inspiration, and embodiment of the American Sabbath Union," it will be proper henceforth for us to refer to him under the title of the American Sabbath Union.
