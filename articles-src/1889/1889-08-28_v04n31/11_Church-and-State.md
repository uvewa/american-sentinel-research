# Church and State.

The whole mission of the church of God is to preach the gospel. Its career lies within the kingdoms of earth, but it is not of them. When the policy of the nations is such as to give the church free scope in its work, the church does not become an appendage to the State, but rather uses this liberty to preach the gospel. When her work is opposed, and she is persecuted by the world, she may petition or remonstrate against being hampered in her mission. But whether this avail or not, she must go onward faithfully in her great work.

The work of the State (whatever form it assumes) is to supervise the life of citizens, and to legislate and enforce those things which are necessary for upholding right and punishing crime. They are both ordained of God. The two must never be confounded. Our Master said, “Render therefore unto Cesar the things which are Cesar’s; and unto God the things which are God’s.

And yet the church does shed down upon the arena of civil life a benediction. It by grace qualifies its members to be honest, sober-minded citizens, and sends them forth as such. But she can have nothing to do with politics. She can have no relation of mutual support established between herself and the State.

The State has in all ages tried to bribe and guide the church, that it might secure control through her of the members. Let us see. In the Southern States the negro Baptist preachers, and perhaps others, are very ignorant, very venal, and have great control over their people. In nearly all sections of the South, in closely contested elections, the effort is made to bribe the preacher and through him control the congregation. This effort is largely successful. . . . The church is prostituted, for money, from its high mission, to be the servant of corrupt political partisans.

The English prelatical church, and other established churches receiving from the civil power protection and support and honor, pay it back in loyal protestations and service. The church serves the State as its master. Note the loyality of the Anglican Church to the Stuarts. Note the Toryism of the Episcopalians during the Revolutionary War.

Several of the Protestant churches of this country have voluntarily sold themselves, or bestowed their church influence to the furtherance of some political issue. And various denominations, protesting their loyality to the present government, have sought, by way of return, to shape its policy. They memorialize it about how to treat the Mormons, prohibition, Knights of Labor, etc. Of course this is apart from the proper work of the church. The church teaches her members to be good citizens, but she has nothing to do with dogmatizing about forms of government or questions of civil policy. Whenever she has done so she has blundered, and her shame has sooner or later become manifest.

But chiefly the Romish Church has sold herself to the governments of earth. It is her policy in every land. Through her priests she controls her people. Everywhere she traffics with the civil power, to enhance her ecclesiastical prerogatives. In the United States she sells her votes to the party that is most subservient, and that gives the largest returns in the way of money and influence. In Ireland she, so far as she dares, throws her influence with the Home Rule party, to maintain her power over them. In Germany she sells her influence to despotic Bismarck, that she may increase the influence of her bishops. Such is her policy. Everywhere, for her own advancement, she bargains and traffics with the powers of the world. And it is to that shameless and persistent policy that she owes her worldly grandeur and power. And now, these facts being notorious, let us consider them in the light of the following statements:—

1. Such a policy is, so far as it is pursued, betrayal of the gospel. There is but one work that God has imposed on the church. There is but one Master that is tolerated. There is but one motive controlling all service.

2. If a church is zealous of worldly honor it must lose in spiritual power. Grand edifices, parade of wealth, political power, the suffrage of the influential, may appeal to the people of earth, but the church that seeks these things and boasts of them is turned away from God’s service, and is become shorn of spiritual power. It can no longer do its great work singly.

3. The world honors in word, and fawns upon, the church that it uses. But in its secret heart it despises such a church. Note how politicians treat politely and deferentially the negro preachers, and yet when their backs are turned sneer at them for their venality. Note how the secular press respectfully and gravely records the Romish parades and ceremonies, and yet read between the lines the contempt felt for Romanism as a spiritual religion.

From all which we gather the injunction that the church keep itself unspotted from the world rejecting its bribes, refusing its yoke.—R*ev. J. A. Scolt, Jr., in Christian at Work, 1887. *[247-248]

Governments have it not in their power to do their subjects the least service as to their religious beliefs and mode of worship. On the contrary, whenever the civil magistrate interposes his authority in matters of religion, otherwise than in keeping the peace amongst all religious parties, you may trace every step he has taken by the mischievous effects his interposition has produced.” *—Burgh.*

Note.—No papers are sent by the publishers of the American Sentinel to people who have not subscribed for it. If the Sentinel comes to one who has not subscribed for it, he may know that it is sent him by some friend, and that he will not be called upon by the publishers to pay for the same.

We are thankful to the friends who have sent us newspapers, clippings, etc., giving items of interest in the work to which the Sentinel is devoted. All such favors are fully appreciated.

To our contributors and correspondents we would say, If your matter does not appear immediately do not conclude that it is not wanted. We do the best we can with all, though some may have to wait a while.

The district secretary of the American Sabbath Union for the California district is Rev. A. J. Nelson, D. D. He says that “Dr. Crafts is the inspiration of the American Sabbath Union.” We think that that is correct, and we have thought so ever since that Union was formed. We are satisfied that that is just as *high* a source as any from which the inspiration of that movement ever can come.

The National Reform Association, not content with the alliance of the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union, is mustering the women on its own account. It has a “special secretary of the National Reform Association”, Mrs. E. J. Crothers, of New York, “for the formation of National Reform Circles” of women called “King’s Daughters.” The purpose of the organization “is to disseminate National Reform literature and to raise money for the cause.” Woman was first in the transgression, and we are afraid she is going to be the last. It is too bad.

Sunday night, August 4, in the United Presbyterian Church of San Francisco, Dr. A. J. Nelson said that “Dr. Crafts is the originator and inspiration and embodiment of the American Sabbath Union.” This explains why the Sentinel has had to mention Mr. Crafts so often. We did not like to do it because, to those who do not understand the whole matter, it appears as though the Sentinel was making this a personal contest. But we are not. The Sentinel is opposing the whole Sunday-law movement, in whatever form it appears, and the American Sabbath Union in particular, and as that organization is embodied in Mr. Crafts, we are compelled, in the nature of the case, to mention his name a good deal. But let no one think that it is a personal matter. However, as Mr. Crafts “is the originator, and inspiration, and embodiment of the American Sabbath Union,” it will be proper henceforth for us to refer to him under the title of the American Sabbath Union.

The American Sabbath Union says that xt is the business of the law to make all occupations safe for those of easy virtue. This was said in an argument in behalf of the Sunday law. This argues that they haven’t conscience enough to do what they think to be right so long as there is money to be made in doing what they think is wrong, so that government must step in and establish a law, taking away all opportunity to do what they think to be wrong so they can all do what they think is right. Plainly expressed the argument is that those people haven’t conscience enough to do what they think is right, therefore there must be an enactment of law which will enable them to do it without conscience. In other words they want the civil law to supply the place of conscience. And then the Union declaims against the absence of such that “it debauches conscience!” The debauchery of conscience is in the system that they seek to have established.

To illustrate the distinction between the civil and religious sabbath, and how the church insists upon the religious sabbath, while the State enforces the civil, the American Sabbath Union tells how a farmer set up in his watermelon patch a warning, saying: “Boys, don’t steal these melons for they are green, and God sees you.” The field secretary of the Union says that this illustrates how the church forbids Sabbath work because God sees them, while the State only forbids it because it is unhealthy.

But now, here comes Mr. Gault, a district secretary of the Union, and says that in that warning:—

> “That farmer appealed to divine authority. He gave the boys to understand that they must not steal melons not only because it injured them, but because God saw them; and in that way he reached their consciences. Well, that simple idea of the farmer expresses the philosophy that underlies this whole question. I believe that government can reach the consciences of the people.’ ’

Now when these people get the National Sunday law, and by that succeed in making effective the State Sunday laws, which of these views it is that will be carried into effect can be fully known beforehand from the known character of the men who are conducting the cause, as well as from the discussion of the subject by those men themselves. It will then be found that the unhealthy part of the melon-stealing has faded entirely from view in the overwhelming importance of the fact that—the *preachers* see you.

The *Telegraph,* of Dubuque, Iowa, gives in its issue of May 3, 1889, the following excellent reasons for opposing the National Reform movement:—

1. It would be a union of Church and State.

2. Such a union, as shown by existing Old World governments, is not favorable to physical, mental, or spiritual progress.

3. Our Constitution as it is, has for the past hundred years worked better than any constitution that any other earthly government has ever had.

4. It would destroy political liberty, and work such confusion in the religious world as to endanger Christianity itself.

5. Religious belief would become a test for office, which would breed a race of hypocrites.

6. All the reforms which the association regard as necessary, can be accomplished without resorting to the dangerous measures which they propose.

7. The government affords every protection to all classes for the propagation of their religious views, and with this encouragement, with the good wishes of even nou-church members, with theological schools constantly graduating preachers, the clergy should be able to create a moral public sentiment, without endangering the public school system, and menacing evil to all that every patriot holds dear.

The *Telegraph* concludes its article thus:—

> “That an association composed mainly of ministers should appeal to the law to effect by force, reforms which should come as the fruition of moral suasion, is virtually a confession that the pulpit is losing its virility and influence. What the causes of this loss are, the ministers themselves are best able to tell. It is probably chiefly due to the fact that they don’t preach as much Christianity as they should.”

Scotland is noted as a Sunday-keeping country. It has strict laws in regard to Sunday observance, and they are probably more rigidly enforced than in any other country in the world. Yet, in his evidence before the British House of Commons, a few years ago, Sheriff Allison, of Glasgow, a gentleman who may fairly be presumed to know something on the subject, said:—

> “I am sure there are eighty thousand people in Glasgow who are just as completely heathens to all intents and purposes as the Hottentots of Africa. Of course, they have all heard there is a God; but as to any practical operation of the influence of religion upon their minds, they never go to church, or to any place where moral and religious instruction is carried on. I should think there are ten thousand men in Glasgow who get drunk on Saturday night—who are drunk all Sunday, and are in a state of intoxication, or half-intoxication, all Monday, and go to work on Tuesday. ... I am decidedly of opinion that the overstrained observance of Sunday in Scotland has perhaps a more prejudicial than beneficial effect in manufacturing towns. ... I think that the observance of the Sunday in Catholic countries on the Continent is much more conducive to benefit than the strict observance of it in Scotland.”

This is only another evidence showing that there is more wickedness under Sunday laws than without them.

The Missouri Sabbath Convention was held to promote the interest of the movement for a national Sunday law, and a State Union was organized auxiliary to the National, to carry forward the work. The ideas expressed in that convention by the representative men of it, it is certainly fair to presume, show what is the object of at least that part of a movement for national Sunday laws. Rev. Thomas H. Tatlow read the first, and indeed the principal, paper of the convention, in which he said:—

> “The Sabbath was made for man, that thereby he may secure to himself, out of every week, one day’s fellowship with God, by meditating on his word, by worshiping in his sanctuary, and by individually entering into his presence, the doors being shut.”

We have no fault to find with that. It is very well expressed. What we object to is the effort that these men make to secure such a thing as that by civil law. We object also to their claim that such an institution as that can be called a civil Sabbath, or that laws for its observance should be enforced upon civil basis. Such things never can be. [249]
