To illustrate the distinction between the civil and religious sabbath, and how the church insists upon the religious sabbath, while the State enforces the civil, the American Sabbath Union tells how a farmer set up in his watermelon patch a warning, saying: "Boys, don't steal these melons for they are green, and God sees you." The field secretary of the Union says that this illustrates how the church forbids Sabbath work because God sees them, while the State only forbids it because it is unhealthy.

But now, here comes Mr. Gault, a district secretary of the Union, and says that in that warning:—

> "That farmer appealed to divine authority. He gave the boys to understand that they must not steal melons not only because it injured them, but because God saw them; and in that way he reached their consciences. Well, that simple idea of the farmer expresses the philosophy that underlies this whole question. I believe that government can reach the consciences of the people.' '

Now when these people get the National Sunday law, and by that succeed in making effective the State Sunday laws, which of these views it is that will be carried into effect can be fully known beforehand from the known character of the men who are conducting the cause, as well as from the discussion of the subject by those men themselves. It will then be found that the unhealthy part of the melon-stealing has faded entirely from view in the overwhelming importance of the fact that—the *preachers* see you.
