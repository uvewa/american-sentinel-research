# Are Governments Holy?

The *Christian Statesman* of June 20 speaks of "God's holy ordinance of civil government, and the sacred office of the magistrate, who is the *minister of God."* It would be gratifying to have someone tell us where in the Bible they find anything about the "holy ordinance of civil government." But they ask, "Are not the powers that be ordained by God?" Yes, but that does not prove that they are holy. Everything that comes from God is not holy. The trees of the forest and beasts of the field came from God; but they are not holy. God ordained and established the earth, yet it is not holy. God said to Moses, "Put off thy shoes from off thy feet; for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground." If the whole earth were "holy ground," there would be no meaning in these words. The Sabbath is a holy day, but the fact that God made the day was not sufficient to make it holy. A special act of sanctification was required. God calls the Sabbath holy, but he does not call civil governments holy.

In the twenty-second chapter of Ezekiel, God speaks about a certain class of people that "put no difference between the holy and profane." This text proves three facts. First, that there are some things which are holy, and some things which are profane, or secular; second, that there is a difference between them; and, third, that there would be people who were unable to appreciate this difference.

It will be seen by the twenty-sixth verse that Sabbath breaking is the sin referred to. Those who use the Sabbath like a secular, or civil, day "put no difference between the holy and profane." The Sabbath is a holy day; all the other days are profane days. This does not mean that there is anything sinful about them, but simply that God has never sanctified them as he did the Sabbath. The only sin in this connection comes from treating a holy or sanctified thing as though it were common, profane, or secular; that is, as though it had never been sanctified. Everything is profane, or secular, that God has not sanctified. He has sanctified the church, but he has never sanctified civil government.

Our National Reform friends are now ready with another question, namely, "Is not the civil magistrate the minister of God?" To this we reply, Yes, but that does not prove that either they or their office is sacred. We have proved that not everything which belongs to God or proceeds from him is sacred. "The earth is the Lord's, and the fullness thereof," yet only such parts of the earth have been sacred as God has seen fit to sanctify by special acts upon extraordinary occasions. There is nothing in the word "minister" to show that persons bearing that title must necessarly be sanctified. If they are to engage in a religious work, they should be sanctified, because profane hands must not officiate in sacred things; but if their work is profane, or secular, no such special sanctification is required *for that work.*

Now, what is the work of these magistrates, or ministers of God? Is this work religious or secular, sacred or profane? Rom. 13:6 reads: "For for this cause pay ye tribute also; for they are God's ministers, attending continually upon this very thing." Is it possible that there are men who can distinguish no difference, so far as sanctity is concerned, between the work of collecting taxes and that, for example, of baptizing converted sinners. If so, then they "put no difference between the sacred and the profane."

> "But this minister of God is also a 'revenger to execute wrath?" Very well; is there anything particularly religious about the work of hanging a man? Is this work of the revenger, the execution of criminals, any part of the work of the gospel of Christ! Not at all. In the realm of moral and religious government, God declares, "Vengeance is mine; I will repay." Again, "Ye have heard that it hath been said, an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth; but I say unto you that ye resist not evil; but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek turn to him the other also."

The work of destroying men's lives, or inflicting bodily suffering is not religious work. Christ never did it nor ordered it to be done. He came not to destroy men's lives, but to save them. Nor is it done by intelligent people for a religious object. The sole end of civil government is the protection of society.

National Reformers seem to think that if they can succeed in blotting out the distinction between the holy and the profane, they will make everything holy. But they will not. God has made some things holy, and other things he has purposely left without this attribute.

Whosoever undertakes to improve upon God's plans, exalts himself above God. In this, National Reformers show themselves true children of the Papacy. Of those who "put no difference between the holy and profane," God says, that instead of making profane things holy, they "have profaned mine holy things. . . and I am profaned among them." Thus the result is just the opposite of that which they profess to seek.A Delos Westcott.
