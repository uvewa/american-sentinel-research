The *Prohibition Journal,* of Iowa, is having an interesting discussion in its columns upon the relationship that should exist between the Prohibition party and the National Reform movement. One correspondent was making some telling points against the National Reformers and their religious legislation schemes, and a National Reform Prohibitionist made complaint to the *Journal *that religious issues should not be brought into the columns of a prohibition organ. But the *Journal *declares that it is a very important question, and one that ought to be settled at once. Whether the Prohibition party is to be an ally of the National Reform Association, or whether it is to bold strictly to prohibition, and this, without any question as to the religious tenets, it says: "There was an evident tendency to incorporate in the party certain religious theories akin to those entertained by the National Reform Association. These came near being accepted at the Cedar Rapids convention," and "the same have since appeared in the Ringgold County Prohibition platform, and other evidences were not lacking that the party was heading in the direction of religious legislation." It declares that an Adventist's vote for prohibition counts as much as a Wesleyan's or a Baptist's or a Presbyterian's. The *Journal* is right. Let it keep prohibition clear of religious legislation, and then it will be upon the proper basis.
