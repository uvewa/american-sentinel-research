The Missouri Sabbath Convention was held to promote the interest of the movement for a national Sunday law, and a State Union was organized auxiliary to the National, to carry forward the work. The ideas expressed in that convention by the representative men of it, it is certainly fair to presume, show what is the object of at least that part of a movement for national Sunday laws. Rev. Thomas H. Tatlow read the first, and indeed the principal, paper of the convention, in which he said:—

> "The Sabbath was made for man, that thereby he may secure to himself, out of every week, one day's fellowship with God, by meditating on his word, by worshiping in his sanctuary, and by individually entering into his presence, the doors being shut."

We have no fault to find with that. It is very well expressed. What we object to is the effort that these men make to secure such a thing as that by civil law. We object also to their claim that such an institution as that can be called a civil Sabbath, or that laws for its observance should be enforced upon civil basis. Such things never can be.
