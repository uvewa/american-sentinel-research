Scotland is noted as a Sunday-keeping country. It has strict laws in regard to Sunday observance, and they are probably more rigidly enforced than in any other country in the world. Yet, in his evidence before the British House of Commons, a few years ago, Sheriff Allison, of Glasgow, a gentleman who may fairly be presumed to know something on the subject, said:—

> "I am sure there are eighty thousand people in Glasgow who are just as completely heathens to all intents and purposes as the Hottentots of Africa. Of course, they have all heard there is a God; but as to any practical operation of the influence of religion upon their minds, they never go to church, or to any place where moral and religious instruction is carried on. I should think there are ten thousand men in Glasgow who get drunk on Saturday night—who are drunk all Sunday, and are in a state of intoxication, or half-intoxication, all Monday, and go to work on Tuesday. ... I am decidedly of opinion that the overstrained observance of Sunday in Scotland has perhaps a more prejudicial than beneficial effect in manufacturing towns. ... I think that the observance of the Sunday in Catholic countries on the Continent is much more conducive to benefit than the strict observance of it in Scotland."

This is only another evidence showing that there is more wickedness under Sunday laws than without them.
