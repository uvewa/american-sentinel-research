# Elder Crafts’s Surprise Party.

Elder Crafts must not take it to heart because he found himself in an unexpected minority in his own meeting, nor conclude that Oakland is against Sunday observance because he did not find that unanimity which a speaker seems to regard as his right. He can console himself by the reflection that he was preaching to the unconverted, and lay this flattering unction to his soul that were it not for his persuasive powers the vote against him might have been larger. Everywhere there are opportunities to preach to the converted, but the trouble is to induce the others to come and hear, and therefore Elder Crafts may be congratulated on the broad field which he has discovered in (to him) so unexpected a manner. The Seventh-day Adventists are a sturdy folk, always ready to stand up and be counted, and quite able to give and take hard knocks, as perhaps Mr. Crafts will discover before he gets through with them. We shall watch his progress with interest and shall be glad to chronicle any conversions he may make, standing ready the while to perform the same office for the other side.

When we say that, in our opinion, Oakland favors Sunday observance, we mean that we believe the people stand ready to make the first day of the week a day of rest, but we do not think there is any large body of our citizens which favor the enforcement of a Puritan Sabbath. A rational observance of Sunday is to be desired on grounds of public policy, and so far as these grounds go, the people of Oakland will, no doubt, favor the embodiment of restrictions in the shape of law. Beyond that it is a matter of private judgment, and neither Elder Crafts nor any other man will be suffered to abridge the liberty of conscience of a free people. We observe that Elder Crafts, like the Prohibitionists, calls on Christianity in support of his case, but he must be aware there are a dozen sects in perfectly good Christian standing, all of which hold views which diverge very widely from his on this question. This we say on the assumption, which we believe to be justified by his remarks, that he would stop all work and play of whatsoever sort on Sunday.

Nay, there is some division even among the shepherds of Mr. Crafts’s own special fold on this matter. The Rev. II. A. Cleveland, an eminent Presbyterian divine, preaching in Indianapolis recently, from the text, “Therefore, said some of the Pharisees, this man is not of God because he keepeth not the Sabbath-day; others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them,” said, among other things:—

> “Many people in this city are dying of overwork, the pressure of cares, and indoor habits. If they may not play baseball or see it played because a convention forbids it, what may they do that will take them into the fields and unharness them from their burdens and drudgeries? Against such games there is no word spoken in the New Testament. Paul had witnessed many games not so healthful as our great American game, and makes frequent mention of what he saw as illustrations of the Christian truths he urged. It is no objection to baseball as a game because men gamble in its issues. Men gamble in wheat and corn and flour, in stocks and human labor; but bread is good, and we shall keep on eating it without respect to those who gamble in it. I have played hundreds of games of baseball myself, and devoutly regarded them as means of grace. There is health in exercise and in the laughing summer fields. That is a defective piety that has not health behind it.

> “Let those in our midst who are noisy and bitter in their denunciations of baseball as a game provide our pale and weary clerks with recreations and amusements that are as inexpensive, as pleasurable and as healthful. Until they do this their silence is wiser than their speech.”
If we are in error in attributing to Mr. Crafts views which he does not hold, we shall be glad to offer him a means of explanation within reasonable space, but we hope that he will not again say that the cry of “personal liberty” comes from a foreign land. An American, a citizen of a government founded in civil and religious freedom, a standing protest against the despotisms of older countries, should not acknowledge such a sentiment. We fear that we shall not chronicle many converts for Brother Crafts if he begins by saying hard things. Gently, brother, gently.— *Oakland Daily Tribune, August 7, 1889.*
