The district secretary of the American Sabbath Union for the California district is Rev. A. J. Nelson, D. D. He says that "Dr. Crafts is the inspiration of the American Sabbath Union." We think that that is correct, and we have thought so ever since that Union was formed. We are satisfied that that is just as *high* a source as any from which the inspiration of that movement ever can come.
