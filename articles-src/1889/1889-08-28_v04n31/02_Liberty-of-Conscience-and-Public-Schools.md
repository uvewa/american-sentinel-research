In order that liberty of conscience may remain inviolate, as intended by our Constitution builders, there must be an absolute separation of Church and State, religion and public schools; and in order to guide the public school system onward to the fulfillment of the mission that called it into existence, it is necessary to keep the public schools free from religious influences, from theological disputes and sectarian teachings. The fatality of mixing up religion with popular education is well illustrated by the present condition of Germany, where atheism and infidelity exist to a larger degree than in any other civilized country. Nothing can work so great a hardship as to cram into the minds of children religious opinions opposed to their home training —opinions, perhaps, which they have been taught to regard as fatal to eternal salvation. The only one that will be pleased at this is the teacher who is spreading on earth the dogma of some particular creed. Religious instruction in the public school means a gradual retrogression to the union of Church and State, and this union means a tyrannical government and a corrupt priesthood. It has been so in all ages, and we are not so superior to our ancestors that we may thrust our hands into the fire and escape without being burned. Religious instruction ought not to be ignored, but the home and church are the places wherein both precept and example will be most effective; but if liberty of conscience is valued at all, keep religion away from public schools. *—Oregonian.*
