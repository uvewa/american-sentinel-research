# The Secret of the Movement.

One point worthy of note in the late report of the secretary of the Kings County (N. Y.) Sabbath Association is the matter of closing art galleries on Sunday. It will be remembered that it is persistently urged by the friends of Sunday legislation, that Sunday laws are for the purpose of securing to the working people a day of rest. But in his report the worthy secretary of the Kings County Sabbath Association strongly deprecated the idea of opening art galleries on Sunday, and said:—

> “The patrons of art are the better educated and more cultivated of any community. Their tastes and aspirations are more refined. They take advantage of all reasonable opportunity to cultivate their tastes in this direction. It is this class of people who patronize art exhibitions. They attend them whenever and wherever they are held. They enjoy them at any and all times. Art exhibitions on Sunday simply prove an additional facility to enjoy this taste. Sunday exhibitions refine them no more. They would be no more gross without them. The people of depraved, gross appetites do not attend them. They absolutely fail in exerting a refining influence upon these classes in the community. They cannot therefore be endorsed on this account.”

The conclusion arrived at by the gentlemen is, that art exhibitions should not be open on Sunday; which is only to say that “the people of depraved, gross appetites”—which is the description he gives of the working people—and those who are not able to attend such exhibitions on other days, shall not be privileged to attend them at all. Sunday is about the only day in the week upon which thousands of people can have an opportunity of going to such places, and it is far from being true that all these people are “depraved” and “gross.” Many of them are quite as refined in their tastes as those who are more highly favored by fortune, and as far as physical rest is concerned, it would certainly do them quite as much good to attend an art exhibition occasionally as to spend Sunday in any other way; which only shows that it is the religious, and not simply a secular, observance of the day which is demanded by the Kings County Sabbath Association. The secret of the whole movement is that these people regard Sunday as a sacred day, and they are determined to compel others to at least act as though it were sacred whether they so regard it or not.—*Signs of the Times.*
