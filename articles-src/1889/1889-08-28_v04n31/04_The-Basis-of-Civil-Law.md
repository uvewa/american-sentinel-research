# The Basis of Civil Law.

Rev. J. M. Foster, one of the district secretaries of the National Reform Association, has an article in the *Christian Statesman* of July 25, in which, referring to an article which appeared in this paper some weeks since, he says:—

> “The writer flatly denies that ‘the State is the keeper of both tables of the decalogue,’ and that ‘the ten commandments are the basis of moral legislation.’ He assumes the secular theory of government, and practically accepts Jefferson’s notion that ‘government is the watch-dog lying at our door to guard our property.’ He should rub his eyes and look up. That theory is dead and buried long ago. There is only one theory accepted among political philosophers now: ‘There is no power but of God; the powers that be are ordained of God.’”

> “The writer” did and does still flatly deny that the State is the keeper of any part of the decalogue, as such. And neither are the ten commandments the basis of moral legislation, in the sense in which Mr. Foster uses the term. Properly speaking, there is no such thing as moral legislation, and there can be no such thing, for the reason that God is the only moral governor and his law the only moral law. All human laws are civil laws, and human governments punish offenders not for immorality, but for incivility.
> “The law of God forbids adultery, so does the law of the State,” say they who are of Mr. Foster’s way of thinking, and imagine that this proves that the former is the basis of the latter; but they forget that there is one important difference, namely, that the law of God takes cognizance of and forbids the lustful look and the impure thought, while the human law takes cognizance of and forbids only the uncivil act. In one sense, and in one sense only, is the divine law the basis of the human, namely, in this: that we learn from it something of the duties which, as men, we owe to one another. But even in this sense, it is the divine law written in the very nature of man, rather than the law of revelation, which forms this basis. This is shown by the fact that tribes and nations utterly ignorant of revelation have in all ages had among themselves laws for the protection of life and property, etc. In no other sense can Mr. Foster’s proposition be admitted without making men judges of the divine law and clothing them with power to enforce it. If the State is the keeper or custodian of the decalogue, or any part of it, as such, it follows that the State interprets and enforces the decalogue; and what is that but for the State to assume the place of God, and attempt to exercise the power of God. Mr. Foster’s logic would make the State simply the agent to carry out the mandates of those who should be selected to interpret the law of God, just as, in the palmiest days of the Papacy, the State was the minister to execute vengeance on all whom the church as the expounder of the word of God adjudged to be heretics.
The assertion which Mr. Foster makes that there is only one theory accepted among political philosophers now, namely, “There is no power but of God; the powers that be are ordained of God,” in the sense in which he understands the apostles’ words, is to say that National Reformers are the only political philosophers. This the writer is not ready to admit; nor is it true, as the gentleman’s language implies, that there is a general repudiation of the words of the Declaration of Independence: “Governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed.” In the true sense, both the Scripture declaration that “there is no power but of God; the powers that be are ordained of God,” and the Declaration of Independence perfectly agree, but as interpreted by National Reformers and by those who hold to the divine right of kings, they are opposed to each other; hence Mr. Foster’s opposition to Jefferson’s theory of government. His reference to the idea that, “government is a watch-dog lying at our door to guard our property,” is noteworthy only as showing that he, in company with other National Reformers, takes issue with the Declaration of Independence, which being written by Jefferson, was the embodiment of his views of civil government. The idea that the proper function of civil government is the protection of the rights of man, is not “dead and buried long ago,” nor will it be until this government, instead of being a free republic, becomes a religious despotism. But that this is what the National Reformers desire, is plainly shown by such utterances as that of Mr. Foster and that of Rev. Mr. Gray in the recent so-called Sabbath convention at Sedalia, Mo. That gentleman’s language has been frequently quoted in the American Sentinel, but it will bear repeating again because everybody ought to know just what the National Reform Association and the American Sabbath Union have in view. Referring to the work of the latter association, Mr. Gray said: —

> “I do not believe that governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed, and so the object of this movement is an effort to change that feature in our fundamental law.”

This shows that their object is the complete subversion of the principles of government which have prevailed in this country, and to which we are indebted for the best and freest government on earth. Certainly there is nothing in such views to recommend them to those who love liberty, either civil or religious. C. P. Bollman.

The *Prohibition Journal,* of Iowa, is having an interesting discussion in its columns upon the relationship that should exist between the Prohibition party and the National Reform movement. One correspondent was making some telling points against the National Reformers and their religious legislation schemes, and a National Reform Prohibitionist made complaint to the *Journal *that religious issues should not be brought into the columns of a prohibition organ. But the *Journal *declares that it is a very important question, and one that ought to be settled at once. Whether the Prohibition party is to be an ally of the National Reform Association, or whether it is to bold strictly to prohibition, and this, without any question as to the religious tenets, it says: “There was an evident tendency to incorporate in the party certain religious theories akin to those entertained by the National Reform Association. These came near being accepted at the Cedar Rapids convention,” and “the same have since appeared in the Ringgold County Prohibition platform, and other evidences were not lacking that the party was heading in the direction of religious legislation.” It declares that an Adventist’s vote for prohibition counts as much as a Wesleyan’s or a Baptist’s or a Presbyterian’s. The *Journal* is right. Let it keep prohibition clear of religious legislation, and then it will be upon the proper basis.
