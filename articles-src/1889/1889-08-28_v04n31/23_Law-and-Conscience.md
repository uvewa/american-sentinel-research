The American Sabbath Union says that it is the business of the law to make all occupations safe for those of easy virtue. This was said in an argument in behalf of the Sunday law. This argues that they haven't conscience enough to do what they think to be right so long as there is money to be made in doing what they think is wrong, so that government must step in and establish a law, taking away all opportunity to do what they think to be wrong so they can all do what they think is right. Plainly expressed the argument is that those people haven't conscience enough to do what they think is right, therefore there must be an enactment of law which will enable them to do it without conscience. In other words they want the civil law to supply the place of conscience. And then the Union declaims against the absence of such that "it debauches conscience!" The debauchery of conscience is in the system that they seek to have established.
