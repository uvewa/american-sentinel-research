The district secretary of the Des Moines, Omaha, and Denver districts of the American Sabbath Union's organization is Rev. M. A. Gault. What he shall say their object is, is authoritative because he is one of the principal officials. What then, is the object of the movement to secure a national Sunday law? In the Missouri State convention, he said:—

> "Now we take the ground that government should compel divine authority on this question. Government should say to the people, you must keep the Sabbath, and have the Sabbath rest secured to all classes not merely because it is good for you, but because God says so. Because there is a divine appointment behind the question."

That is definite, and to the point. Being official, it can be relied on, as the ground upon which the National Sunday-law movement rests.
