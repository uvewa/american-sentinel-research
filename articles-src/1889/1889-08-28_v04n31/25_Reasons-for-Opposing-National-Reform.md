The *Telegraph,* of Dubuque, Iowa, gives in its issue of May 3, 1889, the following excellent reasons for opposing the National Reform movement:—

1. It would be a union of Church and State.

2. Such a union, as shown by existing Old World governments, is not favorable to physical, mental, or spiritual progress.

3. Our Constitution as it is, has for the past hundred years worked better than any constitution that any other earthly government has ever had.

4. It would destroy political liberty, and work such confusion in the religious world as to endanger Christianity itself.

5. Religious belief would become a test for office, which would breed a race of hypocrites.

6. All the reforms which the association regard as necessary, can be accomplished without resorting to the dangerous measures which they propose.

7. The government affords every protection to all classes for the propagation of their religious views, and with this encouragement, with the good wishes of even nou-church members, with theological schools constantly graduating preachers, the clergy should be able to create a moral public sentiment, without endangering the public school system, and menacing evil to all that every patriot holds dear.

The *Telegraph* concludes its article thus:—

> "That an association composed mainly of ministers should appeal to the law to effect by force, reforms which should come as the fruition of moral suasion, is virtually a confession that the pulpit is losing its virility and influence. What the causes of this loss are, the ministers themselves are best able to tell. It is probably chiefly due to the fact that they don't preach as much Christianity as they should."
