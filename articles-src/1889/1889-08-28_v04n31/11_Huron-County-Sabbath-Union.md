We learn from the Norwalk (Illinois) *Chronicle* of July 4, that on the previous Friday a mass meeting was held by some of the citizens of Huron County, that State, for the purpose of organizing "a County Sabbath Union." Among the resolutions adopted on this occasion was one endorsing the American Sabbath Union and its purposes *"so far as now made known."* Just how much the saving clause was intended to cover, we do not know. Perhaps those who drew up the resolution can see no harm in passing Sunday laws, but are not prepared to endorse that with which the so-called Sabbath Union is charged, namely, of laboring to accomplish the same purpose as the National Reform Association. But did they but know it, the passage of Sunday laws is a long step in that direction.

Another resolution adopted by this convention was as follows:—

> "That we approve and commend the passage of the Blair Sunday-Rest bill, . . . and we especially commend the amendment suggested in the committee of the Senate, the exception from its provisions of all who conscientiously keep Saturday or any other day as Sabbath."

The committee did not apparently see anything incongruous in the idea of making a difference on account of religion. Why should those who keep some other day be exempted from the provisions of the law, if, as is so presistently urged, it is simply a sanitary measure? The very fact that they are willing to grant an exemption on account of religious scruples shows that it is a religious measure. The trouble with the whole business is, that Sunday is a religious institution and it is useless to try to disguise the fact or to make it appear that legislation in regard to it is not religious legislation.

Again, they propose to except those who "conscientiously" keep any other day. How do they expect to know when it is conscientiously done? Shall the civil courts decide cases of conscience?
