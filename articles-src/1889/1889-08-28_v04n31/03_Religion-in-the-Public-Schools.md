# Religion in the Public Schools.

The discussion of a very old question has sprung again into public notice. The onslaught of the Boston School Board against a text-book in history is chiefly responsible for the present interchange of warring opinions. Reading the Bible in schools forms no part of the controversy. Deeper questions are at stake touching upon actual instruction in morals or religion as a part of public-school training.

Whatever one’s opinions may be the question is, and always has been, invested with peculiar difficulties and surpassing interest. Man’s usefulness as a citizen depends upon his character as a man. This, in turn, depends upon his education, and the State in educating for citizenship has no right to neglect that which will insure sound moral character. Hence it is claimed by many religious teachers that there is no way out of it but to teach religion in the schools. This, we apprehend, is a fair statement of the case as regards those who would have the Bible read in school, and who would add specific religious instruction to the public-school curriculum.

But there are various grave objections to carrying out such a scheme. Among the pupils to be educated at the expense of the State are the Protestant, the Catholic, and the Jew. Each of these groups looks upon different portions of the Scriptures as the Bible, and there is no common ground where all could meet, except in the Douay translation of the Mosaic Scriptures, and this [243] would be as little satisfactory to the Jew and Protestant as the old English Bible would be to the Jew and Catholic. Further than this, religious instruction of a certain prescribed form is a matter of conscience with each of these groups, and the whole scheme is inexpedient except upon a basis of dogmatic authority repugnant to the spirit and letter of the Constitution.

We believe that the inculcation of sound morals is an essential part of public education, but, like the sentiment of patriotism, they are rather a result of example than of direct instruction. A teacher of sound character and correct habits of life inspires the same in his pupils; while a teacher of the opposite character cannot do so by any amount of dogmatic instruction. Indeed, in Europe and America those schools are most worthless for the practical ends of education where an authoritative attempt is made to impress religious instruction.—*Baltimore Herald.*
