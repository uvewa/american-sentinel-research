# That Sunday Saloon.

There is sufficient agitation going on at present over the subject of saloons to make one think it quite an important question. And it is undoubtedly true, speaking in general terms, that the subject is an important one. At present, however, the principal interest seems to center in the Sunday phase of the question. The zealots who are engineering the National Reform craft, some time ago discovered a powerful ally in the shape of the temperance sentiment, and consequently they steered directly for the respective headquarters of the Prohibition party and the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union, in order that the ardent Sunday partisans in these organizations might get on board, which they did with such amazing spryness as to make it appear that they had been waiting some time for the privilege. Since then these united forces have decided that the saloon is a menace to our free institutions (on Sunday), that our government is in danger from this source (on Sunday), and that this peril which threatens us (on Sunday) must be promptly met and summarily stopped (on Sunday). Truly what a terribly awful thing this *Sunday* saloon is, anyway; and what a peaceable, moral, and altogether lovely and legitimate institution it suddenly becomes from Monday morning to Saturday night!

Seriously, we do not like to see the intelligence of the American people insulted by such arguments as are made nowadays in behalf of this [246] question. “Half a loaf is better than no loaf at all, so we had better get the saloons closed on Sunday than not have them closed at all,” etc. Well! and so the temperance party is going to compromise with the saloon element, is it? And if the bad, wicked Sunday saloon will just consent to go out of business, the good, moral, six- day saloon, will be allowed to continue, and the temperance people will pat it on the back and generally encourage it, eh?

This is undoubtedly what such an argument means, if it means anything, for the same power that can close the saloons on Sunday can close them every other day in the week, as they deserve to be; and all this talk about “half a loaf,” etc., is simply saying that half a loaf is all they want on this question.

As long as the Sunday saloon is classed with Sunday newspapers, Sunday base-ball, etc., people naturally consider that it is legitimate on other days. And why not? Base-ball, newspapers, etc., are legitimate, certainly, and whenever the saloon is classed in with such things, people necessarily conclude that, apart from Sunday, the saloon is just as honest as any of these things mentioned.

The saloon should certainly be opposed, and the whole of the accursed traffic connected with it should be wiped out forever; but, let our opposition be based upon the consistent grounds that the saloon is pernicious in its work and effects, not only on Sunday, but upon every other day of the week as well.J. W. Scoles.
