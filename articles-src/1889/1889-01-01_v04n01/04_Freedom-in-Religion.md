# Freedom in Religion.

One fatal mistake which has contributed to support the throne of Intolerance, is to suppose that people may be made religious by force; that torturing and mangling the body may benefit the soul. To me it appears much more self-evident that if a man has not a religion of his own choice, he can have none at all. A man may be constrained to dissemble what he really is, and to affect to be what he is not; but he cannot be compelled to be a servant of God. Children in religion ought to know that God is the happy God, and that he does not admit of a miserable and slavish service; that he is a spirit, and requires to be worshiped in spirit and in truth. Whether worshiping in truth signify worshiping in sincerity, or in the simplicity of the gospel, in distinction from the complicated forms of the law, is immaterial; the human spirit, and all that can be of service to it, in the adoration of the divine Spirit, is equally beyond the sphere of violence.

To employ force in propagating religion, or maintaining it where it has been propagated, is to offer it a dishonorable and pernicious service. To attempt compelling a man to become [4] religious is itself a piece of irreligion, and the absurdity of such an attempt is as flagrant as the iniquity of it. The timid may be compelled to a feigned assumption of what they neither understand nor approve; but the judgment, the conscience, and the affections, the abodes of religion or its opposite, are not within the reach of compulsion; error and vice have retreats from which nothing but truth and grace can banish them. The conduct of the religious despot is preposterous and infamous; his machinations and efforts tend to the extinction of all which is free, noble, and ingenuous in man, and to the production of those pests to society, suspicion, servility, deceit, and hypocrisy. Even supposing the principles and tendency of a religion to be good, the imposition of it by force is adapted to produce effects the contrary of itself. But any religion which is founded in truth, and which has an intrinsic power of improving our nature and condition, must have an intrinsic hostility to bribery and compulsion. Christianity spread and triumphed, not by the physical or numerical strength of its ministers, but by pureness, by knowledge, by long-suffering, by kindness, by the Holy Ghost, by love unfeigned, by the word of truth, by the power of God, and by the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the left. The acts of faith and obedience to which the gospel calls us, are a reasonable service, to which we are to be drawn by the mercies of God, and not driven by the terrors of men.—*Clarke’s History of Intolerance.*
