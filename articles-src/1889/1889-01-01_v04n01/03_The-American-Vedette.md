The *American Vedette* complains of a passage in the August Sentinel upon National Reform in the South. Well, Brother *Vedette, *we humbly make our apology for all in that which reflects upon the South. We said more than we should have said. We beg pardon. The Sentinel never intends to be sectional in anything; but American and National, with a big N, in all things. The *Vedette* thinks that the basis of our remarks on that occasion was owing to "some noodle in Georgia or North Carolina, probably some experimental immigrant from the North, or some of our uneasy cranks who are never satisfied." The person who made the statement is Doctor Fitzgerald, of Nashville, editor of the *Advocate, *a religious paper there, and a man of more than either local or State reputation; and he spoke for the South and pledged the South  to National Reform, when he said that upon which we based our item. Yet we confess we wandered somewhat from the text. Again we ask forgiveness, and we promise to stick to the text next time. We do indeed hope that the South will repudiate all efforts to swing her into the line of the National Reform wickedness.
