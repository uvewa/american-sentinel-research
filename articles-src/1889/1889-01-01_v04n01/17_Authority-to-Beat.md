One of our Hibernian police was taking in a refractory prisoner, whom he had pounded until he was out of breath, and then attempted to reason with him as follows: "It is not becuse I hates you I bates you, but because I have the authority to do so."—*Life.*

The above note is commended to the attention of those who call themselves National Reformers, who profess that if they only get the power they will not harm a single individual who conscientiously differs with them. No doubt they are sincere in their asseverations; at least we are willing to give them credit for being sincere. But they seem to have as little knowledge of human nature as they have of the gospel. The Irishman "clothed with a little brief authority," was a different man from the Irishman with no power at all. We prefer to keep the club out of the hands of the National Reformers, both because we know how power affects even those with the best of intentions, and because, from the spirit that many of them have already shown toward "dissenters," we feel sure that they could not say, with the Irishman, "It is not because I hates you I bates you."
