At the last meeting of the Monday Congregational Club, in San Francisco, one of the ministers read a paper entitled, "Why the Masses Do Not Attend the Churches." Among the principal reasons he cited "the unfortunate circumstance of our having no Sunday law." "People," said he, "go to saloons, and engage in gambling and lottery schemes, instead of going to church."

The gentleman doubtless revealed more than he intended to. He showed clearly the one real object of all -Sunday legislation, namely, to fill up the empty churches. Men may talk as much as they please about Sunday laws being mere "police regulations," intended for the physical good of the people; but we well know, what they cannot always keep concealed, that they are for no other purpose than to compel people to listen to preaching which has lost its power to draw them. They assure us that they have no idea of compelling anybody to keep Sunday, or to attend church against his will; but their assertion is not in harmony with reason. Does anybody need to be told that when they have passed a Sunday law in order to fill up their empty churches, they will enforce not only the letter but the spirit of that law, and compel attendance on church service, when it is not done voluntarily? We trow not.

This matter of Sunday laws is now a live issue. In many State Legislatures, as well as in Congress, organized and persistent efforts will be made this winter to secure the passage of such laws; and the friends of religious freedom should be on the alert.
