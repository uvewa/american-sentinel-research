Some people seem to think that the reason why the Roman Catholic Church is dangerous is because of its false doctrines, and that its advances politically should be repelled on this ground. A greater mistake could not be made. The only danger from Catholicism is in its having political power at all. It was this that made it Catholic in the first place, and corrupted its doctrines. Let the great churches of this country "come together harmoniously and issue their edict," to be obeyed by the legislative powers, as Mr. Sam Small desires, and we should have a condition of things as bad as when Papal Rome ruled Europe. Their doctrines and professions might be as pure as that of the apostles, but that would not lessen the ill effects of their combining to direct legislation. Their doctrines would soon be corrupt enough to suit the enemy of all righteousness, and we should have an American Catholic Church. Let it be understood and remembered that a church exercising civil power is what constitutes the Papacy, no matter what nor where the church is. [9]
