# A National Reform Ally.

One of the notices recently posted up by the infamous association known as White Caps, read as follows: "God hates liars and perjurers and adulterers. The White Cappers are the Lord's chosen people to wreak his vengeance on the wicked and the unjust."

The National Reformers have in this band of midnight marauders a strong ally. The principles of the White Caps are identical with those of the National Reform Association. Both parties think that they are specially chosen of God to execute his laws, and to preserve morality. There is no difference except in their methods of work, and that is a minor matter. The White Caps have just as much reason to suppose that the Lord has called them to the work of purifying this Nation as the National Reformers have to imagine that they are the ones to conquer the world to Christ, and then to make him King over it. If the Lord calls people to a work he also tells them how to do it, so that National Reformers have no occasion to condemn the other party. As a matter or fact, neither party has any just conception whatever of God or his Government, or they would not think themselves capable of acting as his deputies in administering it. "For it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord."
