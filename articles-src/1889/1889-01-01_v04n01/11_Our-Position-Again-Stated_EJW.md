# Our Position Again Stated.

There has just come to our notice a circular letter designed to arouse those whom it reaches, to oppose Sunday legislation. It has evidently been used by the one who got it up, to introduce the American Sentinel; but the Sentinel feels constrained to utter its most emphatic disapproval of the argument used. After mentioning the National Reform Association, and its allies, the Prohibition party and the Woman's (Political) Christian Temperance Union, the writer says:—

> "The above statements clearly show how these three bodies of active workers are rapidly making their cause one, and while we are made glad to see the cause of temperance advancing, it saddens us to see this Sunday movement brought into it. If Sunday sanctity were established by divine authority, it would be different. But since it is a usurper, and has only the authority of man for its establishment, we must raise our voice against it, and call the attention of all to the fact that God asks no one to do such a work as is proposed for Sunday."

We wish to say for the Sentinel that it would make no difference if the Sunday were sanctioned by divine authority in the plainest terms. The Sentinel is opposed to legislation upon matters of religion, no matter how well established those matters may be by divine authority. Such legislation is wrong, it is wicked. It is directly opposed to the spirit of the gospel, and to that rule which says, "Whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you, do ye even so to them." We know full well that Sunday observance has no sanction in the Bible, but our opposition to Sunday laws does not rest upon that basis.

We believe in one God, the Creator of the heavens and the earth. We believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, the divine Word that was made flesh and dwelt among us, "who was delivered for our offenses, and was raised again for our justification." * We believe in baptism "for the remission of sins," and in the sacrament of the Lord's Supper, by which believers may "show the Lord's death till he come." We hold these truths in common with the great body of professed Christians, and they are most clearly revealed in the inspired Scriptures; but we would resist with all our might any attempt to enforce the belief or practice of these truths upon unwilling men. The more we love these truths, the more strenuously would we oppose any legislation in regard to them, because we do not desire to see them profaned, and because we do not like to see men made hypocrites.

There is no professed Christian who would for a moment sanction such a thing as the dragging of an infidel into the church, and compelling him to join in the celebration of the communion. Some churches admit only those of their own belief, and none think of asking any who do not love the Lord Jesus Christ. But it is just as proper to legislate in behalf of one religious custom as for another. Indeed, if the principle of religious legislation be admitted at all, it must be applied to everything; so that, if the religious observance of Sunday should be enforced, the observance of the Lord's Supper ought likewise to be enforced. Mr. Cook says that "the privilege of rest for each is the law of rest for all." Just as consistently might it be said, "The privilege of communion for each is the law of communion for all," and so make a law requiring everybody to join in the celebration of the Lord's Supper.

It seems as though anybody could see that if civil Governments have a duty in respect to one religious institution, they have the same duty in regard to all; and it seems, also, that all might see the inconsistency and the wickedness of such legislation. It always has, and always will, lead to endless persecution and the manufacture of hypocrites. The Lord does not ask men to help him in the administration of his laws. He says, "Render therefore unto Cesar the things which are Cesar's, and unto God the things that are God's." The Spirit of the Lord is the only power that can make men truly religious. The civil power can only make them (in some instances) act as if they were religious. But when men are truly religious they will act so; and when they are not, it is no credit to them, and is not desired by the Lord, that they should act as if they were. E. J. W. [8]
