We send this number of the Sentinel to several thousand people who are not subscribers. To such we say, Read it carefully, and see if you have not a duty in the matter of helping to circulate it, and thus warn your friends of dangers of which they may be entirely unconscious. The Sentinel ought to have a regular list of a quarter of a million before the close of this volume.
