# Our Position Again Stated.

There has just come to our notice a circular letter designed to arouse those whom it reaches, to oppose Sunday legislation. It has evidently been used by the one who got it up, to introduce the American Sentinel; but the Sentinel feels constrained to utter its most emphatic disapproval of the argument used. After mentioning the National Reform Association, and its allies, the Prohibition party and the Woman’s (Political) Christian Temperance Union, the writer says:—

> “The above statements clearly show how these three bodies of active workers are rapidly making their cause one, and while we are made glad to see the cause of temperance advancing, it saddens us to see this Sunday movement brought into it. If Sunday sanctity were established by divine authority, it would be different. But since it is a usurper, and has only the authority of man for its establishment, we must raise our voice against it, and call the attention of all to the fact that God asks no one to do such a work as is proposed for Sunday.”

We wish to say for the Sentinel that it would make no difference if the Sunday were sanctioned by divine authority in the plainest terms. The Sentinel is opposed to legislation upon matters of religion, no matter how well established those matters may be by divine authority. Such legislation is wrong, it is wicked. It is directly opposed to the spirit of the gospel, and to that rule which says, “Whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you, do ye even so to them.” We know full well that Sunday observance has no sanction in the Bible, but our opposition to Sunday laws does not rest upon that basis.

We believe in one God, the Creator of the heavens and the earth. We believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, the divine Word that was made flesh and dwelt among us, “who was delivered for our offenses, and was raised again for our justification.” * We believe in baptism “for the remission of sins,” and in the sacrament of the Lord’s Supper, by which believers may “show the Lord’s death till he come.” We hold these truths in common with the great body of professed Christians, and they are most clearly revealed in the inspired Scriptures; but we would resist with all our might any attempt to enforce the belief or practice of these truths upon unwilling men. The more we love these truths, the more strenuously would we oppose any legislation in regard to them, because we do not desire to see them profaned, and because we do not like to see men made hypocrites.

There is no professed Christian who would for a moment sanction such a thing as the dragging of an infidel into the church, and compelling him to join in the celebration of the communion. Some churches admit only those of their own belief, and none think of asking any who do not love the Lord Jesus Christ. But it is just as proper to legislate in behalf of one religious custom as for another. Indeed, if the principle of religious legislation be admitted at all, it must be applied to everything; so that, if the religious observance of Sunday should be enforced, the observance of the Lord’s Supper ought likewise to be enforced. Mr. Cook says that “the privilege of rest for each is the law of rest for all.” Just as consistently might it be said, “The privilege of communion for each is the law of communion for all,” and so make a law requiring everybody to join in the celebration of the Lord’s Supper.

It seems as though anybody could see that if civil Governments have a duty in respect to one religious institution, they have the same duty in regard to all; and it seems, also, that all might see the inconsistency and the wickedness of such legislation. It always has, and always will, lead to endless persecution and the manufacture of hypocrites. The Lord does not ask men to help him in the administration of his laws. He says, “Render therefore unto Cesar the things which are Cesar’s, and unto God the things that are God’s.” The Spirit of the Lord is the only power that can make men truly religious. The civil power can only make them (in some instances) act as if they were religious. But when men are truly religious they will act so; and when they are not, it is no credit to them, and is not desired by the Lord, that they should act as if they were. E. J. W. [8]

Enough live, interesting matter for another number of the Sentinel has been crowded out of this issue by matter that had to go in. The pressure upon our columns makes us begin to think that some change will have to be made sometime. We hope it may come soon in the shape of more frequent publication.

We send this number of the Sentinel to several thousand people who are not subscribers. To such we say, Read it carefully, and see if you have not a duty in the matter of helping to circulate it, and thus warn your friends of dangers of which they may be entirely unconscious. The Sentinel ought to have a regular list of a quarter of a million before the close of this volume.

The theological faculty of the University of Giessen has conferred on Prince Bismarck the title of Doctor of Divinity! Just what moved them to do this we do not know, but we imagine that it was because they are tinctured with the National Reform idea that men may go up to the polls to worship God. When politics and religion are one, we can see no incongruity in making every statesman a Doctor of Divinity.

The members of the “National Sabbath Union,” with true National Reform generosity, made General Harrison one of the vice-presidents of their association, at the late meeting in Washington. Of course Mr. Harrison didn’t know anything about the transaction, but that made no difference. Honors are easy among those people, and they willingly bestow them upon both living and dead. Unlike Shakespeare, they think that there is a great deal in a name.

With this issue the American Sentinel begins its fourth volume. It has been prospered in the three years that it has been published, beyond our most sanguine expectations, and has the brightest prospects for the future. No one who is not watching the movement of things can have any real conception of the wide field open before the Sentinel, and of the necessity for it. New phases of the National Reform work are constantly developing, and the Sentinel intends to keep its eye upon them all and continue to sound the alarm.

One of our Hibernian police was taking in a refractory prisoner, whom he had pounded until he was out of breath, and then attempted to reason with him as follows: “It is not becuse I hates you I bates you, but because I have the authority to do so.”—*Life.*

The above note is commended to the attention of those who call themselves National Reformers, who profess that if they only get the power they will not harm a single individual who conscientiously differs with them. No doubt they are sincere in their asseverations; at least we are willing to give them credit for being sincere. But they seem to have as little knowledge of human nature as they have of the gospel. The Irishman “clothed with a little brief authority,” was a different man from the Irishman with no power at all. We prefer to keep the club out of the hands of the National Reformers, both because we know how power affects even those with the best of intentions, and because, from the spirit that many of them have already shown toward “dissenters,” we feel sure that they could not say, with the Irishman, “It is not because I hates you I bates you.”

The *Christian Nation* kindly informs us that the Sentinel would not oppose National Reform principles “if it understood them.” The fact is, though, that we *do* understand them. And that is why we are so much opposed to the whole National Reform scheme. Those who do *not* understand its principles are the ones who do *not* oppose National Reform. Everybody who understands it is opposed to it; and the better they understand it the more decidedly are they opposed to it.

Another evidence, or rather admission, that all Sunday legislation is religious legislation, is found in the remarks of Dr. Goodwin, of Chicago, in presenting to the ministers’ meeting the resolutions prepared by Dr. Herrick Johnson in regard to Sunday newspapers and Sunday observance. The Doctor said that “to strike at the Christian Sabbath is to strike at the very corner-stone of all our Christian institutions.” Therefore a law in favor of Sunday, the so-called Christian Sabbath, is a law in favor of the Christian religion; and since no open law breaker can hope to be elected to public office, it follows that the enactment of Sunday laws is squarely opposed to that part of the Constitution of the United States which says that no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States.

The *Christian Nation* that was issued the day before Thanksgiving said that for the first time in the history of the day the Catholics would join in the observance of Thanksgiving. It adds: “Official circulars were sent out to this effect, and of course it was not done without the knowledge and consent of the Pope. This event is worth considering. What does it mean?”

It is indeed worth considering; but few of those who consider it will realize what it means. It means a coming together of Protestant and Catholic. It means that the time is fast approaching when the Catholic Church will be generally considered as the true church of Christ, and the honored mother of the Protestant churches of Christendom. It means, in short, the approach of the time when there will be no Protestant churches, except perhaps in name, and when it will be thought heretical to speak against the Catholic Church, and when the Reformation will be called a burst of fanaticism.

At the last meeting of the Monday Congregational Club, in San Francisco, one of the ministers read a paper entitled, “Why the Masses Do Not Attend the Churches.” Among the principal reasons he cited “the unfortunate circumstance of our having no Sunday law.” “People,” said he, “go to saloons, and engage in gambling and lottery schemes, instead of going to church.”

The gentleman doubtless revealed more than he intended to. He showed clearly the one real object of all -Sunday legislation, namely, to fill up the empty churches. Men may talk as much as they please about Sunday laws being mere “police regulations,” intended for the physical good of the people; but we well know, what they cannot always keep concealed, that they are for no other purpose than to compel people to listen to preaching which has lost its power to draw them. They assure us that they have no idea of compelling anybody to keep Sunday, or to attend church against his will; but their assertion is not in harmony with reason. Does anybody need to be told that when they have passed a Sunday law in order to fill up their empty churches, they will enforce not only the letter but the spirit of that law, and compel attendance on church service, when it is not done voluntarily? We trow not.

This matter of Sunday laws is now a live issue. In many State Legislatures, as well as in Congress, organized and persistent efforts will be made this winter to secure the passage of such laws; and the friends of religious freedom should be on the alert.

Some people seem to think that the reason why the Roman Catholic Church is dangerous is because of its false doctrines, and that its advances politically should be repelled on this ground. A greater mistake could not be made. The only danger from Catholicism is in its having political power at all. It was this that made it Catholic in the first place, and corrupted its doctrines. Let the great churches of this country “come together harmoniously and issue their edict,” to be obeyed by the legislative powers, as Mr. Sam Small desires, and we should have a condition of things as bad as when Papal Rome ruled Europe. Their doctrines and professions might be as pure as that of the apostles, but that would not lessen the ill effects of their combining to direct legislation. Their doctrines would soon be corrupt enough to suit the enemy of all righteousness, and we should have an American Catholic Church. Let it be understood and remembered that a church exercising civil power is what constitutes the Papacy, no matter what nor where the church is. [9]
