The members of the "National Sabbath Union," with true National Reform generosity, made General Harrison one of the vice-presidents of their association, at the late meeting in Washington. Of course Mr. Harrison didn't know anything about the transaction, but that made no difference. Honors are easy among those people, and they willingly bestow them upon both living and dead. Unlike Shakespeare, they think that there is a great deal in a name.
