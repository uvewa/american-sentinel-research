With this issue the American Sentinel begins its fourth volume. It has been prospered in the three years that it has been published, beyond our most sanguine expectations, and has the brightest prospects for the future. No one who is not watching the movement of things can have any real conception of the wide field open before the Sentinel, and of the necessity for it. New phases of the National Reform work are constantly developing, and the Sentinel intends to keep its eye upon them all and continue to sound the alarm.
