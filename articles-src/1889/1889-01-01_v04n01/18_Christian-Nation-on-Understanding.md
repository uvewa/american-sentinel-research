The *Christian Nation* kindly informs us that the Sentinel would not oppose National Reform principles "if it understood them." The fact is, though, that we *do* understand them. And that is why we are so much opposed to the whole National Reform scheme. Those who do *not* understand its principles are the ones who do *not* oppose National Reform. Everybody who understands it is opposed to it; and the better they understand it the more decidedly are they opposed to it.
