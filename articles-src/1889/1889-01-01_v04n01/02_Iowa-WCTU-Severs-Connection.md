The Iowa Woman's Christian Temperance Union, to its everlasting honor, has severed all connection with *the political* workings of the National Woman's Christian Temperance Union, and has given to the National Union the name of "The National Woman's *Political* Temperance Union." We heartily approve the action of the Iowa Union, and hope that the good work may go on until the National Woman's Political-Christian Temperance Union is destroyed or else the National Woman's Christian Temperance Union is brought to the point where it will do Christian work in a Christian way, and not in a political way.
