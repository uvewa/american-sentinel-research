# Sunday-Law Arguments.

Liberty of rest for each demands a law of rest for all." This is a favorite proposition among Sunday-law advocates. They tell us it is impossible for a part of the people to keep Sunday properly while the rest are pursuing their regular avocations, or indulging in pleasures and amusements.

That is to say, the Almighty has fixed things in such a way that it is impossible for one person to be a true Christian unless everybody else will be a Christian at the same time. [6] And, as there has never been a time when all the people were Christians, and never will be in this world, therefore it is certain that there never were, and never will be, any Christians, and hence nobody can be saved.

This is the logic of religious legislation. But is it true that God has so arranged matters that one man's virtue or piety depends upon that of some other man, so that he cannot serve God acceptably unless the other man does the same? Those who are clamoring for Sunday laws say, "Yes;" the apostle Paul says, "Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us. For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord."

It is wonderful how great authorities will differ. Let National Reformers explain the cause.A. Delos Wescott.
