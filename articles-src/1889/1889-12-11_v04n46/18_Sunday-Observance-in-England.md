It is stated that the question of Sunday observance is one which disturbs the clergy of England even more than it does the ministry of any other country. In some places the clergymen themselves, it is said, have, in order to secure some sort of respect for the day, inaugurated Sunday cricket clubs, the only restriction being that as soon as the church bells ring the players shall leave the game and attend to their religious duties. An effort is also being made to encourage the opening of museums and picture galleries on Sunday. The position is taken that "it is better to provide some innocent amusement than to allow the men to idle about the streets and otherwise pass the Sabbath in vicious idleness." And this is only another evidence that the only proper basis for Sabbath observance is a conscientious regard for the divine law.
