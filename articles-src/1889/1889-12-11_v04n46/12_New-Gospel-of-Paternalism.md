# New Gospel of Paternalism.

Boston's latest intellectual movement has taken the form of advanced Socialism, under the inspiration of "Looking Backward," a novel by Mr. Edward Ballamy, and it is not unlikely that the public discussion of the book in that city will win for it that which the criticism of Mr. Gladstone achieved for "Robert Elsmere," namely, a wide circle of thoughtful readers.

Without the stimulus given by Col. T. W. Higginson, the Rev. M. J. Savage, Mr. William D. Howells, the Rev. Dr. Edward Everett Hale, and others, representing the advanced culture of New England, the book would be valued for whatever literary merit it possessed; the ideas of social revolution of which it is an exponent would not either be entertained or discussed. But when eminent men approve these theories, establish societies for the promulgation of the ideas, and publish a magazine to extend them, it becomes necessary to examine the theories and see whether or not they stand the test of logical expediency.

The theories taught by Mr. Bellamy's book are: No man shall be better than his neighbor. All who are able to work shall be provided with labor best suited to their capacity, and the proceeds of this toil to be so divided that there shall be equality of income. All competition is to be abolished; individualism is to be suppressed; every citizen shall attend public school until the age of 21; every man shall work until he reaches the age of 40, after which he must be pensioned. There will be no crime, poverty, legislation, or politicians. These and other projects of like nature the author seeks to teach. The whole question is summed up by Colonel Higginson, who says: "Modern life demands organized business action. There are two great organizations, either one of which can manage it, organized capital or organized government. If this be the real alternative there is certainly an increasing number of people who would prefer to trust the government."

This form of Socialism is purely a figment of the imagination. It has no practical worth, and if it could be made to permeate our system would be dangerous to the welfare of society. If the question as to what should control business enterprise should ever be narrowed down between corporation and government, the former would be the more universally preferred. In all the history of railroad legislation it has been incontestibly demonstrated that the government cannot manage railways successfully and honestly, whereas, under the form of corporate co-operation the greatest material triumphs of the age have been achieved. The State has all it can do to transact properly its present functions. Railroads, telegraphy, farming, and merchandise should never be managed by the government, and as long as the republic lasts never will be so controlled.

But this theory of reducing all men to equal condition, can it be made to apply practically to our American life? To begin, what is the reason of our rapid national development? The simplest answer that can be given is, The incentive held forth to individual industry, the rewards to be gained and the power to be attained through the medium of these rewards. Even if the law of compulsory education could be enforced so that each individual was possessed of equal educational advantages, the law of nature reveals the fact that some would profit, and others derive little benefit, therefrom. Some would be intelligent and others would be more or less fools. Some would lead and others would follow. Some would work and others play, and in a generation or less some would beg and others steal. The theory must not only give all men an equal start, but it must be so fortified as to keep them so, and therein is shown the utter futility of the idea, and that which is intended to cause more equality in the world would work the greatest injustice that righteous men have ever suffered. The intellectual and moral giant would be doomed to the same life as his mental and moral inferior, and deprived of those superior advantages to which he is entitled by every principle of natural equity. The end of it all would be the reduction of mankind to the level of the commonplace; the incentive to human effort would be removed, and society, if obedient to the decrees of the new dispensation, would sink into monotonous stagnancy and drift into the dark age of a twentieth century.—*Oregonian, July 30, 1889.*
