In a recent communication to the *Christian Nation,* M. A. Gault says: "Our strongest ally in Christian reform is the W. C. T. U." By "Christian reform" Mr. Gault means, of course, his pet scheme of so-called National Reform, and he certainly states a sad fact when he says that the W. C. T. U. is its strongest ally. These enthusiastic but misguided women are doing all in their power —and their influence is not to be despised—to forward the movement the avowed purpose of which is to change that feature of our Constitution which accords with the idea that governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed, that, as they say, they may make Christ this world's King. But as they can do that only in name, and as men will rule in the name of Christ, but without his guidance, it follows that should they succeed they would have at best only a man-made theocracy, a veritable image of the Papacy, and the deeds of the Papacy it would do.
