# Poor, "Hampered" Rome.

In its issue of November 3, the *Catholic Review* says:—

> "In this land which makes liberty of conscience its fundamental principle, we are hampered in the practice of our religion more than are Catholics in England and her colonies, although there the faith of the nation is professedly hostile to ours."

What do Romanists mean by being "hampered"? Because the government does not support its parochial schools, Rome is hampered! Until the government declares in favor of the "freedom" (temporal power) of the pope, that church will deem itself hampered. In short, until the government is entirely moulded by the influence of the church, the latter will no doubt feel very much hampered. Here is a specimen wail from the *Review:—*

> "We are obliged to pay double taxes for the education of our children. Our priests are excluded from many of the prisons and reformatories, and are admitted to others only under restrictions that are galling and unjust. We have no proper appointment of chaplains among the Indian tribes, although many of these wards of the nation profess our faith and could easily be reduced to useful citizenship under its benign influences."

The following item especially must be accomplished before Rome is content, and this end gained will soon appease all other grievances:—

> "The Pope must be free! The power he wields is too vast for its free exercise to be permitted by any earthly ruler to whom he may be subject. The united public opinion of the world is probably the means God will use to restore the liberty of his vicar. And the public opinion of America leads and directs that of the earth."

The fact sentence explains why the pathetic appeal is made through a great Catholic gathering on the eve of a new session of Congress.

But Rome should take courage; surely everything is rapidly tending toward her desired end. Protestant bodies of almost every shade are moving to open the way for religious legislation, which, when once inaugurated, will open wide the door for Rome to step in and take the helm. The National Reform Association, backed in its various enterprises by nearly every denomination, is asking the Catholics to help it in establishing church domination in the government, and in such a way as will give Rome the balance of power; politicians in high political station are hobnobbing with Roman dignitaries at every favorable opportunity; and from whatever standpoint the view may be taken, the outlook is favorable to the progress of papal influence. If the Catholic Church is any less hampered in England and her colonies than in this country, the Church of England and the British lion itself must be well-nigh overcome by the "imprisoned" Leo of Rome.
