The *Christian Commonwealth* of July 25 relates that the Moslem preacher of Liverpool publicly rebuked the Prince of Wales for teaching the Shah of Persia to gamble. He had never known the vice till it was taught him by a so-called Christian prince. The above journal says:

> "It seems to us extremely disgraceful that just at the time when the Church of England is waking up to the enormity of this vice, and is becoming sensible of the extent of its spread, the future head of that church should be teaching a Mohammedan how to add another vice to the list of those which he habitually practices."

And this shows the beauty of an established religion. According to law the Prince of Wales, should he become king of England, would he the head of the Established Church; but law can never make Christians.—*Signs of the Times.*
