# The Sunday Newspaper.

Christian and thinking men have expressed much anxiety concerning the influence of the Sunday newspapers on the morals and religious sentiments of the community and the increase of Sabbath-breaking. The marvelous growth of this department of journalism is worthy of attention. Many of the prosperous city dailies issue Sunday numbers. And what is remarkable, the Sunday issue is the largest in size and circulation. They also put into this issue the productions of their best writers. It is said that they pay higher rates per column than for articles in their week-day issues. Thus they make the Sunday paper the most attractive.

The *Baltimore American* has ordinarily only six or eight pages on any other day; but on Sunday it has twelve and sometimes sixteen pages. So the New York *Tribune* is sent forth on Sunday with a larger amount of matter than on any other morning. The *Philadelphia Press* of last Sunday is before me, with three large sheets, or twelve pages (eighteen by twenty-four inches), of carefully written articles on all variety of subjects. The same can be said of the Sunday papers generally in all the great cities of the country. The publishers exercise great care to secure the choicest productions of the pens of the most popular writers. They pay in proportion to the literary excellence or attractiveness of the contributions. They gather news from all parts of the world, and from all the departments of human interest, to enrich the Sunday issue. What an amount of choice and entertaining reading is thus put into a single number! Take, for example, the copy of the *Philadelphia Press* of last Sunday. There we have a graphic description of the king, or khedive, of Egypt, with his gorgeous palaces, his kingdom, his family, his home life, his ability as a statesman, written by one of the best-known and popular writers of the day. Then we look farther, and find much of an entertaining and instructive character about Russia, India, Africa, Germany, England, with its statesmen—the political bodies of that country, the political situation of Europe, full accounts from every part of our own country, literature, art, society, amusements of all kinds, from the best concerts and dramatic performances to the low base-ball and horse-race and prize-fight, with cheap illustrations and pictures. The New York Sunday issues are of the same character, as are those also of the great cities of the West.

Why do the shrewd publishers put so much money and so much brain work and journalistic excellence into their Sunday papers? The answer is a simple one: It pays. That number secures the largest number of readers and buyers. Their circulation, from twenty thousand up to fifty thousand, stimulates this enterprise. There is more newspaper reading by those who buy secular papers on Sunday morning than on any other day of the week. There is a public demand for the ablest Sunday newspaper, and hence the supply. The universal laws of business create this journal. While the demand continues, the supply will be forthcoming. No clamor against it by lovers of Sabbath consecration, no rebukes from the pulpit, no condemnation by the religious press, can stop it so long as the public calls for it. It is indeed to be regretted that hundreds of thousands in the cities of the country spend the sacred hours of the Lord's day in such reading, instead of public and private worship. Lament it as we may, we cannot ignore the fact. I have not the statistics at hand, but it may be assumed that one hundred thousand men in New York, and a proportionate number in other cities, read the Sunday papers.

To what extent is the Sabbath violated?—Not largely in the work of getting out the paper Most of the composition and press-work, and perhaps nearly all the writing, is done before midnight on Saturday. Some type-setting and much press-work is done after midnight. The work done in the printing office on Sunday is chiefly for the Monday issue. Those who get their Sunday paper by mail on Monday morning, and then read it, do not break the Sabbath. So that this sin of Sunday desecration is confined chiefly to the newsboys who distribute the paper, and those who read it on Sunday. But these Sabbath-breakers are a great multitude.

The evil cannot be abated by preaching against it. The thunders of the pulpit don't reach the ears of men who sit in their easy-chairs poring over the fascinating columns of the *Press* or *Tribune,* nor do the scoring editorials of the religious press. Can journalism supplant the secular Sunday paper by offering something better adapted to the day and equally entertaining?—This is hopeless. No religious journal can afford to pay the high prices for their contributions. And if the publishers had the money to engage the ablest pens, the subjects would necessarily be moral and less exciting. Religious papers could not fill their columns with gorgeous descriptions of all worldly affairs, society notes, theaters, concerts, horse-races, base-ball contests, and all exhibitions of rowdyism and vice. Even those papers that have the widest circulation and largest revenue, like the *Independent* and the *Advance,* cannot compete financially, or in entertaining matter, with the Sunday issues of the great city dailies.

All that can be done is to instill an increasing reverence for the Lord's day in the minds of the children and young of the church and the country. This is the work of Sunday-schools and catechetical classes. Until a generation shall arise with a deeper sense of the sacredness of our Christian Sabbath than our present American people, the Sunday newspaper will flourish and be a power in the land in moulding public sentiment.—*G. D., in Lutheran Observer, August 10, 1889.*
