Referring to the expressed willingness of the Roman Catholics to "come together with nonCatholics and shape civil legislation for public good," and to "seek an alliance with non-Catholics for proper Sunday observance," the *Times* of this city says: "It is a splendid omen for society at large that such good policy exists." And again: "It is a sign of the times worthy of note, this position of so powerful a religious body. Christians are now more nearly hand in hand in this matter than they have ever been before."

Indeed, "it is a sign of the times worthy of note," a most significant sign, but one which forebodes, not good, but evil to our free institutions. We fully believe with the Senate Committee of 1828, that "extensive religious combinations to effect a political object are always dangerous."

> "All religious despotisms," said the committee, "commence by combination and influence, and when that influence begins to operate upon the political institutions of a country, the civil power soon bends under it; and the catastrophe of other nations furnishes an awful warning of the consequences."

We have in this country a powerful Protestant element, so called, who boldly demand an amendment to our national Constitution which they confess would disfranchise every logically consistent infidel. And not only so but the Encyclical of Pope Leo XIII. published in 1885 makes it the duty of all Catholics to "make themselves felt as active elements in daily political life in the countries where they live. They must penetrate wherever possible in the administration of civil affairs; must constantly exert the utmost vigilance and energy to prevent the usage of liberty from going beyond the limits fixed by God's law. All Catholics should do all in their power to cause the constitutions of States and legislation to be modeled to the principles of the true church."

This simply means that Protestants and Romanists are working together to accomplish the overthrow of religious liberty in our beloved country. The danger is a grave one, and it is the more grave because of the fancied security and blindness of the people, lulled into indifference as they are by a time-serving secular press which fears to antagonize Rome, and by a bigoted religious press which sees in this movement worldly prosperity for the church.
