# Stand by the Constitution.

It is to the credit of our national Constitution that the Sunday observer is protected in his worship on the first day of the week; that the Sabbatarian is protected in his worship on the seventh day; and that the conscience of the nonobserver is protected in his seven days' toil. The fact is here recognized that the man who conducts himself on a proper civil basis is a good citizen, irrespective of his religious views, which are deemed inalienable rights that cannot be appropriated or trifled with.

Through the wise principle that protects all religions alike, the unhappy scenes that have attended State religions in the past are averted, and America has become the marvel of nations—the home of the persecuted refugee driven to our shores by the despotic power of the foreign church.

Considering to what is due our prosperity as a nation, considering the grave lessons taught us by those powers that have suffered from religious dictation, it becomes us to guard with jealous severity against a repetition in our fair land of the disgraceful alliance, and to check at once those movements that threaten to destroy the recognition now given to the rights of conscience.

Individually we all have the right to persuade others to embrace our acting interpretation of divine ethics, but, happily, no authority to compel their adoption. Were it otherwise, man's highest feelings would become the slave of chance, the foot-ball of politicians. Then were the Catholics to rule, we must become, outwardly, Mariolaters; were the Hebrews to outvote us and claim their rights, we must renounce Christianity; were the race of Tong San to find a majority, we must all turn to Confucius; and so on, we must change our conscience to suit the popular creed, under pain and penalty of statutory judgment.

Religious motives should arise from voluntary recognition of the claims of the supreme power from an invisible source. It is the height of presumption for any civil tribunal to raise up an arbitrary standard to judge whether we are loyal to the mighty will of Jehovah, to whom the interference of puny earthly dictation becomes a foolhardy failure. Trouble is brewing on that question—the aspiring church is becoming restless and aggressive—a stormy time of religious frenzy and bloodshed is close at our doors, yet the drowsy occupants sleep on, unwilling to heed the tempest that will soon get beyond human control.—*Moral and Scientific Companion.*
