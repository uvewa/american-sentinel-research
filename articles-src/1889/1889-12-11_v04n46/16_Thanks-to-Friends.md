We desire to thank our many friends who have so kindly sent us marked copies of papers containing articles of special interest to us. Of course it sometimes happens that we can make no direct use of the matter sent, but even when that is the case it may be suggestive of some point which should be noticed. Some of the matter sent us has been very useful and we trust that our friends will still remember us. Please mark the articles which you wish us to notice.
