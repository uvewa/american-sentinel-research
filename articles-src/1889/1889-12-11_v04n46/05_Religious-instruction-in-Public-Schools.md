# Religious instruction in Public Schools.

The following from “Romanism *versus* the Public School System,” a book written by Daniel Dorchester, D.D., and published by the Methodist Book Concern, Phillips & Hunt, New York, although directed especially against the teaching of Catholic doctrine in the public schools, applies equally well to Protestant teaching. We bespeak for it a careful reading:—

The provisions of the National and State Constitutions are such that the matter of religious exercises in the public schools is restricted within very narrow limits, specific instruction being ruled out.

The Constitution of the United States says:—

> “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.”

Massachusetts says: “No subject shall be hurt, molested, or restrained in his person, liberty, or estate, for worshiping God in the manner most agreeable to the dictates of his own conscience, or for his religious profession or sentiment.”

Its Bill of Rights says also: “All religious sects and denominations demeaning themselves peaceably and as good citizens of the commonwealth, shall be equally under the protection of the law; and no subordination of any one sect or denomination to another shall ever be established by law.”

A statute, in the same spirit, forbids the introduction of any text-book “favoring the tenet of any particular sect of Christians.” These are in harmony with the act of the people which, in 1833, finally destroyed the power of towns or the State to tax the people for the support of churches.

## An Able Discussion.

Said Rev. A. H. Quint, D.D. (*Congregationalist,* July 26, 1888), after quoting the foregoing:—

> “These provisions declare a perfect equality of religious denominations, that no one shall be put in power by law, and that no tenet of any sect shall be favored. This necessarily rules out of the schools religious instruction, if it is consistently carried out. A Romanist cannot impose his tenets upon a Protestant child, and a Protestant teacher cannot impose his tenets upon a Catholic child. A Baptist teacher cannot teach immersion, and a Congregational teacher cannot teach endless punishment. Whether we like this or not, it is he fact. No ‘common law’ even, no theory of some unwritten power in the State, can override the constitutional fetters which the American Revolution produced. No clearer authority is needed than that of Judge Story, in his opinion in the great Girard will case, where he declares this new limitation, and where he says, of the equality stated in the Pennsylvania Bill of Rights (like others), that ‘the language must have been intended to extend equally to all sects, whether they believe in Christianity or not, whether they were Jews or infidels.’

> “It is the spirit of American government for the State to select and pay, from public taxes, ministers of the gospel to preach even sound doctrine, however much it might be for the public good. On the same principle, it is not for the State to employ schoolteachers at the expense of the tax-payers to teach the gospel of Christ to children; and any religion less than that is not worth fighting over.
> “It has been said that the State has inherent right and duty to determine what the education of children shall be. There is much truth in this, but it needs very careful limitations. Did the Protestant world approve when the Catholic authorities in Italy (if I remember), seizing from his parents the Jewish boy Mortara, educated him in the Romanist faith? The truth is, the State must insist, for its own existence and welfare in a republic, on the instruction of children in all needed branches, and for the diffusion of general intelligence as against ignorance. This grand idea demands the school system; but let it stop when it interferes with religious faiths.”
From these premises Dr. Quint reasons very conclusively that—

> “Any satisfactory religious instruction in public schools is absolutely impracticable, and we may as well acknowledge it. An avowedly secular system is far better for religion than a formal sham. We cannot teach the distinctive tenets of any Christian denomination. Then, without tenets, what is there to teach? Our own churches cannot consent to the Romanist papal authority as a tenet on one hand, nor to the denial of Christ’s divinity on the other; and neither of these will leave the field to us, nor to all the denominations combined who hold the ‘doctrines commonly called evangelical.’ There is no possible common ground. Eliminate all except what all hold in common—Romanist, Protestant, indifferent, Jew, freethinker—and the remainder. Are majorities to rule? There is nothing more dangerous than majorities unfettered by constitutions.

> “It may be said that we have the Bible read in schools. A law of. 855 required it, and a law of 1880 forbade any ‘note or comment,’ and excused from it all pupils whose parents objected to it. How much Bible is that? One teacher reads of Moses in the bulrushes and of David and Goliath; and another reads colorless psalms. Suppose the law be changed, and note and comment be made lawful—whose doctrine is to be taught by the teacher to our children?
> “No. The safest way, the wisest way, is to secularize the schools. It is simply asserting the American principle, that no church or anti-church shall use for its own purpose the public schools maintained by the taxation of the people. It makes them no more irreligious than a State blacksmith shop would be. It would teach the ordinary branches at the public expense, and leave religious teaching to parents, where God himself placed it. God established the family; men established the public-school system.
> “It must not be understood that secularizing the schools excludes teaching and training in the moral virtues. These lie at the basis of all beliefs or no beliefs. They enter necessarily into the government of every school, and the dailv intercourse of one pupil with all other pupils. They cannot by any possibility be put out of sight. They are proper subjects of direct instruction. The Massachusetts Constitution, which prohibits so plainly the tenets of every sect and denomination, expressly directs all teachers to ‘inculcate the principles of humanity and general benevolence, public and private charity, industry and frugality, honesty, and punctuality in their dealings; sincerity, good-humor, and all social affections and generous sentiments among the people.’ Nor is there any doubt that this subject should be emphasized even farther than it now is.”
It is plain that if all classes are to use the public school there must be no specific religious instruction. It cannot be imparted consistently with the American system of government. If religious instruction is given, it will be almost certain to savor of some particular sect; and moneys raised by taxation upon the whole people cannot be rightfully used for that purpose. Religious education must be taught elsewhere—in the church and the home. Neither the State, nor the church, nor the home singly, can do the whole. work, the complete work, of education.

The following from the *Christian Union* of December 12 will throw light upon the editorial elsewhere quoted from the *Catholic News,* and is worth reading on its own account at this time when there is a movement to give the church the chief control of the public schools:—

> “If it be true, as currently reported, that the Roman Catholic hierarchy, represented by such influential dignitaries as Bishops Ireland and Riordan, and even Cardinal Gibbons, are resisting the appointment of General Morgan as Indian commissioner and Dr. Dorchester as superintendent of Indian schools, on the ground that these gentlemen are hostile to the Roman Catholic Church, and are removing from office Roman Catholic appointees, the fact furnishes another argument against the anomalous system which has grown up in the Indian Bureau of *quasi*-partnership between the federal government and the churches in the work of education. It makes little difference in their bearing on that system whether the charges are true or false. If they are true, that an Indian commissioner can by virtue of his office work against a particular denomination is a serious objection to the system; if they are false, the fact that he can be subjected to groundless suspicions and false accusations in the faithful discharge of his duty, and that church influence can be brought to bear for the retention in office of incompetent officials, is an equally conclusive objection to the system. The contract school system is impaled on either horn of this dilemma. That system has grown up naturally, and cannot, probably, be abolished at a blow without serious injury; but the fact that it introduces sectarian strife in political administration should be of itself enough to make our Congress resolve to provide, at the earliest possible moment, in lieu of it, a system of education wholly under federal control and maintained at federal expense, leaving the churches independent of the State, and disentangled from all alliances with it, to do their religious work without either help or hindrance from the national government.”

> “A few years ago,” says the *Press and Horticulturist,* of Riverside, this State, “we fought a hard fight to prevent the abrogation of the State Sunday law, largely, it is true, because it gave us the only State restriction of the liquor traffic which we had. It was lost, mainly through the failure of radical temperance people to see the practical value of the law as a temperance measure, and no party can afford to champion its restoration, in view of that experience.”
Probably the reason why “radical temperance people” failed “to see the value” of the California Sunday law “as a temperance measure,” was that it had no value in that direction. And yet with characteristic consistency, some of those same “radical temperance people” accuse us of being in league not only with the saloons, but with every other evil, because we oppose Sunday laws.

A State Sunday convention was held in Cleveland, O., December 16 and 17, by the Cleveland Ministers’ Union and the Ohio Sabbath Union. It is significant that in the program Mrs. Bateham’s address was preceded by an address by the editor of the *Catholic Universe,* on “Roman Catholic Co-operation in the Sunday-Rest Movement.”

A Washington dispatch of December 4 says:—

> “Senator Cockrell to-day presented a memorial of citizens of Ralls and Pike Counties, Missouri, remonstrating against the passage of any bill for the observance of Sunday or any other religious institution or rite, and also against any amendment to the Constitution providing for religious instruction in the public schools. It prays that the government be kept strictly secular, and that Church and State be entirely separate.”

Those Missouri people give evidence of a just conception of what civil government should be.

To enforce upon men the laws of Christian morality is nothing else than an attempt to compel them to be Christians, and does in fact compel them to be hypocrites. It will be seen at once that this will be but to invade the rights of conscience, and this, one of the vice-presidents of the National Reform Association declares, civil power has the right to do. Rev. David Gregg, D.D., now pastor of Park Street Church, Boston, a vice-president of the National Reform Association, plainly declared in the *Christian Statesman* of June 5, 1884, that the civil power “has the right to command the consciences of men.”

> “Every sin, secret or public, against God, is a sin against our country, and is high treason against the State.”—*Christian Statesman, August 9, 1888.*

Every sin, whether “secret or public,” being “high treason” against the State, the State must punish it, even secret sin. But how shall the State discover secret sins except by an Inquisition? This again confirms the logic of the theocratical theory of earthly government—that the Inquisition is the inevitable consequence. And so far as the National Reformers are concerned, it is certain that they are ready to use the power which they are doing their best to secure.

A call has been issued for a conference on “the Christian Principles of Civil Government,” to be held in Cincinnati, January 21, 22, 1890. The call states that it is the imperative duty of Christians and patriots to “band themselves together to banish vice and immorality from our land.” It also says that the enemy is coming in like a flood, and that “it is high time to lift up a standard against him.” Our Bible says that when the enemy comes in like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him; but National Reformers arrogate to themselves, and to civil law, the offices and power of the Spirit of God. The call is issued by a large number of ministers, and the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union will co-operate. Among the subjects to be discussed are “The Limitations of Personal Liberty,” “The Civil Sabbath,” “The Sunday Newspaper,” “The Sabbath Movement in Cincinnati,” “The Sabbath and the Laboring Man,” “The Place of the Bible in Civil Laws,” “The Moral Legislation Needed in Ohio,” and “The Moral Accountability of Nations.”

The effort to secure a national Sunday law which will result in the revival of the methods of the Inquisition, is gaining strength. Although the Blair Sunday-Rest bill died with the last Congress, the work of circulating Sunday-law petitions has been pushed with redoubled energy. The advocates of the movement are more thoroughly organized than ever, and opposition has tended only to make them more determined and more unscrupulous, although more discreet in their methods. If the present Congress does not witness the passage of a Sunday bill more stringent, yet more plausibly worded, than that introduced by Senator Blair, it will not be from lack of determination on the part of the National Reform Association, the American Sabbath Union, and allied organizations.

In the *Christian at Work’s* report of the late meeting of the Evangelical Alliance, we find the following:—

> “Beginning with the first great need of the city, ‘religious awakening,’ Professor Ely, in a most admirably classified address, spoke at length on what he called a ‘Renaissance of Nationalism.’ ‘The government,’ he said, ‘is a God-given agency for which we must work, and through which we must work, if ever we are to regenerate mankind. Of all the work that has been done, of all that can be done, for the elevation of humanity, the most successful work is legislative work.’”

This is a speech to fill the heart of the National Reformer with delight. The *Christian Nation* has told about *suppressing wickedness by law,* and now we are told about *regenerating humanity by law.* What use such folks have for the Bible we cannot see, for it knows of no means of regeneration except the Spirit of God. And yet National Reformers call themselves Christian, and their work a Christian reform!

Senator Blair is on hand with his little grist of bills for Congress. On the 9th inst., he introduced a bill “to secure to the people the privileges of rest and religious worship, free from disturbance by others, on the first day of the week.” We quote from the newspaper report. It will be noticed that this bill was introduced the same day that the American Sabbath Union met in its first annual convention in New York. It is fair to suppose that the bill which Mr. Blair introduced is one which had received the approval of his employers, and that they will lobby for it without any mental reservation. If the above quotation gives the substance of the bill, it is a most hypocritical fraud; for there is not a man who does not know that in this country every man has the privilege of resting and worshiping on the first day of the week if he wishes to. Mr. Blair seems to be thoroughly imbued with the medieval idea that government is only for the majority.

The Rev. Dr. Dorchester, from whose book, “Romanism *versus* the Public-School System,” we have quoted at length elsewhere in this paper, says (p. 227) that if all classes are to use the public schools, several conditions must be observed, among which he cites the following:—

> “There must be no religious instruction in them. If attempted it will be likely to savor of some particular sect. To attempt it would be inconsistent with the American system of government, and perilous to the successful administration of the school system. A purely secular basis is the only basis on which all citizens can unite. Then no one’s doctrines are assailed or slurred. There is abundant opportunity for parents, Sunday-schools, and churches, to look after the religious education, the public school occupying only about one-sixth of the hours of the year. The public school can succeed only on a completely nonsectarian absolutely secular basis. On any other plan it is doomed.”

According to this, and it cannot be denied, Senator Blair, although the professed friend of education, is working for the overthrow of our public-school system. This is a fact, although he is doubtless sincere in his work. The country has less to fear from plotting Jesuits than from professed Protestant National Reformers.

In the Elgin Convention, November 8, 1887, Dr Mandeville said on the subject of Sunday laws:—

> “When the church of God awakes and does its duty on one side, and the State on the other, we shall have no further trouble in this matter.”

Yes, we remember how it was before when the Church and the State were united. The gentle Albigenses in Southern France greatly disturbed the church. But the church was wide-awake, for Innocent III. was pope. Philip Augustus was king of France; and the church awoke the State with the cry, “Up, most Christian king! up, and aid us in our work of vengeance!” And thus, with the energy of the pope on one side, and of Philip on the other, the soldiers of Philip marched down upon the Albigenses, and swept them from the earth. And as “the church did its duty on one side and the State on the other,” there was no further trouble in that matter.
