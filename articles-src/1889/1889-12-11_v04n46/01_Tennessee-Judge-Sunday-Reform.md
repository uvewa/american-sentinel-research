A Tennessee judge has arrived at the conclusion that no statute is absolute while it stands unrepealed, and has therefore instructed the grand jury of his court to "indict all persons who publicly express infidel sentiments." This is an illustration of what may be expected if the "National Sunday Reformers" should ever secure a grip upon the reins of government.—*Leadville Argus*
