The *Lutheran Witness* of November 7 gives the facts relative to the conviction, in Forsyth County, Ga., of Mr. Conklin, for cutting a little wood on Sunday, and then makes this sage (?) remark:—

> "Evidently the State law of Georgia prohibits Sunday work, else we could in no way see the fairness of such a conviction."

It is also evident that the *Witness* lacks the courage of its convictions, else it "could in no way see the fairness [or justice at least] of such a conviction" whether "the State law of Georgia prohibits Sunday work" or not. The law is simply an unjust, wicked, and antichristian law. If the fact of there being a State law against Sunday labor justifies the conviction of Mr. Conklin, then the fact of the existence of laws against heresy would justify all the persecutions of the Dark Ages. Is the *Witness* ready to admit that Luther ought to have been burned?
