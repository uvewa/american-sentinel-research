Some of the good people of Riverside, Cal., want Sunday horse-racing and theatricals prohibited in that city. But the *Press and Horticulturist* of that place says:—

> "In the nineteen years of Riverside's existence we have never known a case of Sabbath horse-racing or theatricals here. We see no indications that such things are desired, and therefore no need of a law prohibiting them."

Possibly some of the good people of that city think that if they could only get an ordinance against horse-racing and theatricals it would be broad enough to cover some other things, which, however, public opinion does not just at present condemn sufficiently to outlaw them even on Sunday. Sunday laws are very elastic and erratic sometimes; for instance, in Arkansas a law framed for the ostensible purpose of shutting up saloons never interfered with the saloons at all, but fined and imprisoned several conscientious, God-fearing, Seventh-day Christians, who, in country places, followed their usual quiet occupations on Sunday after having observed the seventh day. Is something of the same sort wanted in Riverside?
