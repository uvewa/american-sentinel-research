# Stealing the Lord's Day.

If a man has lost valuable property by a thief, the loser is the first to complain, and the first to seek redress. Now those in favor of a Sunday law, say that Sunday is the Lord's day; that the laboring classes, pleasure-seekers, etc., are stealing it for their own advantage and gratification, and they want a law to make them stop it.

If Sunday is the Lord's day, and people are stealing the Lord's property, why not let the Lord be first to complain and seek redress? To hear those who favor a Sunday law tell how people who appropriate the day to worldly interests ought to be made to desist, or how those who keep another day ought to be ostracised, one would think that *their* property had been stolen instead of the Lord's. They seem to forget God is able to care for his own property. But where has the Lord expressed his incapability for so doing, and commissioned civil government to protect his Sabbath by civil law? He has authorized civil government to protect life and property from persons of evil intent; but he has nowhere empowered it to punish its subjects for the non-performance of a duty that they owe to God.

He who uses the Sabbath to advance his selfish interests is stealing God's time, but is committing no crime against his neighbor or the government; therefore none but God has a right to punish him.E. Hilliard.
