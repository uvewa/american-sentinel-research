**PRESIDENT HARRISON** and Vice-President Morton, and several members of the cabinet, were present, October 13, at a banquet given in honor of the dedication of the new Catholic university at Washington. The President's health was drunk standing; Mr. Blaine was applauded, and then all hands cheered Cardinal Gibbons' toast, "The Hierarchy of the United States." *Free Thought* states the foregoing facts and then adds: "We should have two objections to indorsing a toast of that kind. In the first place, the United States is not a hierarchy, which is a government of the priesthood; and in the second place, if it were a hierarchy, a patriotic American should lament instead of rejoicing over the fact." The criticism is just, though it is not likely that it was intended to imply that the United States is a hierarchy, but only that a hierarchy exists in the United States. That, however, does not mend matters much. The Roman hierarchy in the United States is an enemy to several institutions which ought to be dear to every loyal heart, and the President and his cabinet were out of place on the occasion.
