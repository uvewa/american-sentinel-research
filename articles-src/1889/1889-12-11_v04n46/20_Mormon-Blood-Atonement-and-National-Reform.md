In giving testimony before the United States Court in Salt Lake City, November 18, Charles W. Penrose, a prominent Mormon, denied that the president of the church ever ordered the killing of any man for apostasy, and said he understood the doctrine of blood atonement to mean that when a man had committed murder or adultery he should be killed, that is, the murderer should be turned over to the civil law. The church had not authority to kill a man for adultery, but he believed when the law of God was fully established the penalty should be death. It is evident from this that the Mormons are consistent National Reformers. Of course that which they wish to see enforced by the civil authorities is not the law of God as others view it, but that which they themselves understand to be the law of God. But the principle is the same in either case, for if the State had the right to enforce the law of God, it would have to decide what that law is, and that decision would be liable to change as courts and majorities changed. A fine theory, truly! But it is National Reform doctrine, pure and simple.
