It is not necessary in order to have a union of Church and State that a particular church or sect should be recognized by the civil law, to the exclusion of others. Nor is it necessary that the Church should be supported by the State. The great and popular churches are agreed in what they term "essentials." They unitedly demand that the government shall crystallize their interpretation of the divine will into statute law. If through their combined influence it is done, the Church dictates, the State accepts; the Church interprets, the State enforces that interpretation by law. It is a union of Church and State, as all must admit.
