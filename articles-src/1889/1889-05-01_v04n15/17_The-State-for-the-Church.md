At the Ohio Sabbath Convention, the Rev. James Brand, D. D., read a paper entitled, "To What Extent are the Christians of Ohio Responsible for Existing Sabbath Desecration?" Of this paper the Rev. J. M. Foster, in his report in the *Christian Statesman* of March 7, gives the following summary:—

> "He arraigned the church for conniving at Sabbath desecration on the part of her members. They buy and read the Sunday newspaper. They are drivers and conductors on street-cars. They are stockholders in Sabbath-breaking corporations, and they make their purchases at the grocery on the Sabbath. There is no difference between this and any other kind of secular employment. It is a breach of the fourth commandment. The church should discipline her members for these breaches of God's law. Until the church is willing to keep the law herself, she cannot have power in the world."

This last statement is very true. When the church does not live up to her own profession she loses power; and it is only when she thus loses power that she asks the civil authorities to re-in- force her waning strength. Whenever the church asks the State to come to her aid, it is a confession that the power of godliness has gone or is fast going from her, and that only the form remains.

And this brings us to the main thought suggested by the paragraph just quoted, and that is, that when the church asks the State to legislate in behalf of Sunday, it asks the State to do its work for it. Dr. Brand admits that church members are primarily responsible for the great amount of Sunday desecration, and yet asks the State to put a stop to it. He says that church members are engaged in all sorts of business on Sunday, and that it is the duty of the church to discipline those members; and therefore when Sunday laws are asked for, to stop those persons from doing Sunday work, the State is simply asked to enforce church discipline. Let anyone deny it who can. This is exactly in harmony with the idea put forth by Mr. Foster in 1884, that "the State and its sphere exist for the sake of, and to serve the interests of, the church." And this shows that the sum and substance of so-called National Reform work is the enactment and enforcement of Sunday laws. When they have been secured, then the church will without doubt have other work for the State to do, namely, to see that all the people attend church. It will surely follow.
