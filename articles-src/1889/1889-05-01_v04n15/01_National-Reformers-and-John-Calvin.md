The Rev. J. M. Foster, of National Reform fame, recently lectured in Indianapolis, and the *Sentinel* of that city said of him that "he seemed to be the incarnation of John Calvin." Mr. Foster felt wonderfully tickled at this, regarding it as a compliment, and said: "We do not object to that. It is no reflection on the sentiments advanced." Without saying anything against the honesty of John Calvin, there is no question but that he was as violent a persecutor as any agent of the Inquisition ever was. Intolerance of the religious opinions of others was a part of his creed and practice. National Reformers in taking him as their patron saint only show the nature of their movement.
