# A Frantic Appeal.

The *Denver Times* of March 12 contains a specimen of the lengths to which certain religionists wish to have this country go, and of the recklessness of their assertions in trying to make Church and State union seem necessary. One H. Martyn Hart, who is called “Dean Hart,” and is said to be running a parochial school in that city, although whether Episcopalian or Roman Catholic we do not know, has an article in which, by a skillful manipulation of figures, he demonstrates that “w*e* have gradually sunk” into a “fearful condition of immorality.” By putting the population of the State at about one-half what it actually is, and by multiplying by three the number of persons now in prison, no matter how trivial their offense, he arrives at the absurd conjecture that the criminal record of Colorado is worse than that of the Bowery in New York or the Seven Dials in London. Now see what he gives as the cause of this state of affairs, and his remedy for it:—

> “Now, sir, I have no hesitation in saying that the public-school system is alone to blame for this shameful condition of morality. The maudlin sentimentality which in its silly ignorance cries out against ‘Bible teaching,’ has had its cry, and we now demand that the other side shall be heard.

> “Why, sir, if this goes in for ten more years, the whole of the generation will be in prison! Let the ten commandments be a daily part of the school curriculum. There is no denominationalism in them. And even if there were, I would rather have my child in the Methodist society than in the Reformatory at Golden. And Father Carr will tell you the same.
> “But this pernicious nonsense of teaching morals through history, opening schools with ‘extracts’ from standard American authors, must cease, and cease at once. Let the children recite the ten commandments, and let them be taught out of some short text-book the extended meaning of those condensed sentences.
> “Let the motives for keeping the commandments be instilled in them,—the blessing which righteousness brings to this life, and the sure and certain judgment which awaits the unrepentant offender at the Judgment bar of the great King.
> “Away with the twaddle of the ignoramuses. I believe they call themselves ‘agnostics.’ They have had their way long enough; now let sense and self-respect prevail, lest we all become criminals together.”
That is to say that the public-school system is worse than nothing; that its tendency is to produce criminals at a greater rate than the slums of the large cities, where there are no schools. If National Reformers want people of sense to indorse their project of religious teaching by the State, they would do well to suppress such wild calculators as H. Martyn Hart. His mode of reckoning, and his conclusion that in ten years the whole generation will be in prison, is like Mark Twain’s humorous calculation by which he demonstrated, from the shortening of the Mississippi River by cut-offs, that in the next century the river would have shrunk so much that Cairo and New Orleans would be one city.

Let the children be taught the ten commandments, says Mr. Hart. “There is no denominationalism in them,” says he. No; neither is there any denominationalism in the Bible, yet a good many denominations profess to find authority in it for all their conflicting views; and no man can teach the Bible without giving it the mould of his opinions. Now we believe in the Bible, and the ten commandments; we think it would be a grand thing if everybody would study them; but we do not think that enforced study of them, even if only correct ideas were taught, would be of any value. When the State says that a man has no right to choose for himself by whose opinions of the Bible he will be influenced, it says that he shall not hold his own opinions. For the State to give Bible instruction in its schools, especially out of some short text-book giving “the extended meaning of those short sentences” of the ten commandments, would be to say that no person has a right to study the Bible for himself. Are the American people ready for a despotism which shall attempt to control their thoughts?

We make our appeal to Christian people—to those who revere the Bible. We claim that they are the ones who should be the most interested in keeping Church and State separate—in keeping the Bible from being the plaything of politicians, and religion from being a thing of compulsion. If they do not want to see the Bible banished from the homes, as it was in the Dark Ages, then let them take a decided stand against the pretended teaching of it in the public schools.
