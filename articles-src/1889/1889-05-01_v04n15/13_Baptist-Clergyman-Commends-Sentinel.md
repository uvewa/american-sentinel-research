A Baptist clergyman in the East, in writing to renew his subscription for the American Sentinel, says: "I most heartily commend the stand you have taken with reference to National Reform and Sunday legislation. You are right." He shows his appreciation in a practical way, too, by sending five dollars, with directions that the remainder, after paying for Sentinel subscription, "Civil Government and Religion," and *Sentinel Library,* be used to extend the circulation of the paper.
