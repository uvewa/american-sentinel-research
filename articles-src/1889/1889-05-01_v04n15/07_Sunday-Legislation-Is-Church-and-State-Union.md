The following is a sermon which was delivered, March 24, by Rev. R. D. Clark, pastor of the Baptist Church at Eureka, Cal. So highly was it appreciated that, by special request, he repeated it two weeks later, April 7, in Russ Hall in that city. We recommend it to the careful perusal of all into whose hands this number of the Sentinel may fall, as a candid statement of facts, by one who cannot be accused of being prejudiced against the Sunday sabbath:—

The efforts which are now being pushed, to secure national legislation in favor of Sunday observance, mark an important era in the history of the Sabbath question. Let no one be deceived in regard to this movement, for it strikes directly at the foundations on which our republic rests. Everyone who is familiar with the history of this country, is not ignorant of the struggles through which the colonies passed in securing liberty from ecclesiastical oppression, a separation between Church and State, and the right of every individual to worship God according to the dictates of one's own conscience. Whatever legislation may be inaugurated, looking towards compelling men to observe any religious requirement, is a union of Church and State, and will only result in untold evil.

This Sabbath question is one which involves the fundamental rights of the individual conscience, the constitutional rights of each inhabitant of these United States, as well as the constitutional rights of each State under the national compact. Of course, there is a growing tendency on the part of a great mass of our people to disregard Sunday as a sacred day, and in this State, as you all know, the law in regard to Sunday has been set aside altogether.

To remedy this state of things, an effort is being made to introduce national legislation, which shall not simply supplement State and municipal legislation, but which shall compel a strict abstinence from secular labor or business in all places and departments, which are under the direct control of Congress, including inter- State commerce. The radical and revolutionary character of this movement, and the possible results which may spring from it, are not understood. They cannot be appreciated at a glance. There is involved in this question an unconstitutional centralization of power and dictatorship on the part of the national Government. There is a direct, though concealed, purpose in this movement to accomplish a practical union of Church and State. This movement is directly opposed to the republican doctrine of religious liberty, and the scriptural doctrine of freedom of conscience.

Here is the title of the bill: "A bill to secure to the people of these United States the enjoyment of the first day of the week, commonly known as 'the Lord's day,' as a day of rest, and to promote its observance as a day of religious worship." The closing section of the bill declares that local legislation of States and municipalities "shall be construed, so far as possible, to secure to the whole people rest from toil during the first day of the week, their mental and moral culture, and the religious observance of the Sabbath-day."

Resting from secular business and labor has been the specific method of sanctifying the Sabbath. It is claimed that the Lord's day cannot be observed religiously as it ought, unless men do rest from their secular affairs. It is further claimed by the advocates of this bill, that if any are enabled to rest thus religiously, all must rest. Therefore, they seek such legislation as will compel all to rest, whether they conscientiously desire to do so on religious grounds or not, in order that those who desire to rest religiously may thus rest. There is, therefore, no meaning in the expression, "Lord's day," as a day of rest, except from the standpoint of religion. Anyone can see, with no very great insight into the future, that such legislation would give the National Government a supervision and dictatorship over all decisions which might be called for under local legislation, requiring local authorities to so construe existing legislation as to secure the religious observance of the first day of the week. The advocates of this bill are so intent on its passage that they have sought the aid of the Roman Catholics. In seeking the aid of the Romanists to support this Sunday legislation, Protestants are helping to put themselves and the American nation into the hands of the Papal hierarchy. To obtain control of civil government through national legislation, has been the life-long policy of the Papal power. Having thus, like the camel, gotten partly inside the tent, Romanism would not fail to push its work [116] along, educational and otherwise. The end of such a beginning would not be far away.

But, suppose this Blair Sunday bill becomes a law, men will be compelled to observe the day as a day of rest, whether they wish to or not. What are Adventists and Seventh-day Baptists and Jews going to do? Simply be compelled, contrary to the dictates of their own consciences, to observe a day that they do not regard as sacred; and, further, they and others will be compelled to attend church somewhere, whether they wish to or not. Isn't that persecution? Isn't that going back to colonial times, when men were fined and imprisoned for non-attendance at public worship? Suppose a man has no more regard for Sunday than for any other day, and thinks he has a perfect right to spend the day as he pleases, provided he does not interfere with others in their observance of it, would it be right for them to compel him to observe the day in accordance with their views of its proper observance? Suppose he is a laboring man, and is compelled to toil six days in the week, when there is work, and he has an invalid wife, and he thinks when Sunday comes he cannot do better than to take his wife out into the country, to see the green fields and enjoy the pure country air, and thus give to her a little longer lease of life, and I should say to him, "See here; the law forbids your going on excursions on Sunday, or hitching up and driving your horse, simply for purposes of recreation." Suppose he should say: "This is a free country, and I have a right to do as I please on Sunday, provided I don't interfere with the happiness of anybody else." And I should answer: "But our new Sunday law forbids your doing anything that will disturb the quiet of the Sabbath." He would say: "What do I care about your Sabbath? I don't believe in your Sabbath, and why should my liberty be judged by another man's conscience?" But I answer: "The law compels you to observe the Sabbath, to gratify my sense of the sacredness of the day." Then he would answer, "Your Sunday law is unconstitutional." In September, 1779, Congress proposed that immortal first amendment to the Constitution, which, it is hoped, will never be set aside. It reads as follows: "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press, or of the right of the people, peaceably to assemble and petition the Government for a redress of grievances."

Thus religious liberty was planted in our national Constitution. But this was not brought about, remember, until long years of persecution had been endured by Baptists, Quakers, and others, at the hands of those denominations in different colonies that had secured for themselves authority from the "mother country" to "lord it over God's heritage," and compel everyone to conform to their church authority. Shall these United States, after more than a hundred years of progress in religious liberty, go back to those bigoted times, under which our forefathers groaned, and from which they so nobly struggled to be released? God forbid! The colony of Massachusetts was settled by the Puritans, in 1630, but, before they landed, the "Court of Assistants" passed the law connecting Church and State. The colony in Connecticut was settled by the Puritans, who also united Church and State. The colony in Virginia was settled by Episcopalians, or members from the Church of England. They also united Church and State. Those of Massachusetts and Connecticut were Congregationalists. Ministers were to be supported by taxation. When anyone of any other denomination refused to pay the tax imposed on them for the support of the State Church and its ministers, he was fined, imprisoned, whipped, or banished, and after being banished, if he returned, he was hung.

Many instances are on record of such persecution in early colonial times. For fifty years in the Colony of Massachusetts no man could vote for his rulers unless he was a communicant in their churches. Roger Williams, a Baptist, was banished from Salem, in 1636, and his persecutors, fearing he would establish another colony, determined to send him back to England; but he, getting wind of their intentions, fled and took up his abode among the Indians, and for more than a year remained among them, learning their language and preaching the gospel to them, and it was through him that the Massachusetts Colony was saved from utter extermination at the hands of the cruel savages.

On July 20, 1651, Obadiah Holmes, John Clark, and John Crandall, Baptist ministers from Newport, R. I., were arrested near Lynn, Mass., while preaching on the Sabbath, taken by the officers to the parish church in the afternoon, sent to Bristol jail, and subsequently fined; Mr. Holmes, £30 ($150); Mr. Clark, £20 ($100); and Mr. Crandall, £5 ($25). The fines of Clark and Crandall were after a while paid, but Mr. Holmes was kept in Boston jail till September, when he was tied to the whipping-post and publicly whipped. His clothes were stripped off, and thirty lashes sank into his naked flesh, the executioner striking with all his might, spitting upon his hands three times, so that he might do his utmost. The flesh of Mr. Holmes was so torn and cut that for weeks afterward he could only rest upon his hands and knees, even in his bed. Two men who came up and shook hands with Mr. Holmes after his whipping, John Hazel and John Spur, one not saying a word, and the other saying, "Blessed be the Lord," were fined and imprisoned for the act.

In October, 1658, a law was passed in Boston to banish Quakers on pain of death.

On October 27, 1659, William Robinson and Marmaduke Stevenson were hanged in Boston, for returning after banishment, because they were Quakers. In 1660 and 1661 two more, a woman and a man, were hung for a like crime. In 1635 President Dunster, of Cambridge College, preached a sermon in which he declared that he found no scriptural authority for infant baptism, and for this doctrine he was removed from the presidency. This sermon awakened inquiry, and, in 1665, Thomas Gould, of Charleston, refused to have his baby baptized, because he believed it to be unscriptural. For this they censured him in their church, and punished him in their courts for more than seven years. The Congregationalists of England strongly protested against these persecutions in Massachusetts. They said in a letter to Captain Oliver, dated March 25, 1669: "Now must we force our interpretations upon others, Pope-like? How do you cast a reproach upon us who are Congregational in England, and furnish our adversaries with weapons against us? We blush, and are filled with shame and confusion of face, when we hear of these things."

In March, 1729, in Rehoboath, twenty-eight Baptists, two Quakers, and two Episcopalians were sent to Bristol jail for refusing to pay the parish minister's tax. In Connecticut every town was required to support an orthodox minister, or be indicted by the grand jury and suffer penalties.

In 1744 John and Ebenezer Cleveland were expelled from Yale College for attending another church in vacation.

In 1747, at Hartford, three ministers were imprisoned for preaching without the consent of the parish minister, one four months, one five, and one eleven months.

At Archfield, Conn., in 1770, 398 acres of land, belonging to Baptists, were seized and sold to pay the minister's tax. In vain for three years they sought relief from the Legislature, and finally they appealed to the king and council and got the law disannulled.

In Virginia, under the establishment of the Episcopal Church, laws of the severest character were enacted against the Quakers and others. In 1661-62 a fine of fifty pounds of tobacco was imposed for every failure to attend the parish church on Sunday, unless necessarily confined to home, and £20 sterling ($100) for each month's absence of a dissente or nonconformist from the established church. They imposed a fine of a ton of tobacco for neglecting to have an infant baptized. Men and women were indicted and fined for not attending church. Some Baptist ministers were arrested and imprisoned as vagrants, some were pulled down from the stands on which they were preaching, and insulted and whipped, while many were imprisoned for preaching the gospel not according to the established church.

A national Constitution for the United States was adopted in 1787. Its provisions were satisfactory, so far as they went, but many felt that religious liberty was not sufficiently guarded.

The Baptist General Committee of Virginia, in 1788, expressed their disapproval of this important omission, and after consultation with James Madison, this committee, in August, 1789, wrote to General Washington, then President of the United States, saying they feared that liberty of conscience, dearer to them than property or life, was not sufficiently guarded.

Washington gave a kind and encouraging reply. I will give a few extracts from his reply: "I have often expressed my sentiments that every man conducting himself as a good citizen, and being accountable to God alone for his religious opinions, ought to be protected in worshiping God according to the dictates of his own conscience. . . While I recollect with satisfaction that the religious society of which you are members have been throughout America uniformly and almost unanimously the firm friends to civil liberty, and the persevering promoters of our glorious revelation, I cannot hesitate to believe that they will be the faithful supporters of a free, yet efficient, general Government. Under this pleasing expectation I rejoice to assure them that they may rely on my best wishes and endeavors to advance their prosperity. . . . In the meantime be assured, gentlemen, that I entertain a proper sense of your present supplications to God for my temporal and eternal happiness. ... I am, gentlemen, your most obedient servant, George Washington."

I have quoted these examples from colonial times to show you what will be the result in this country again if we attempt to compel Sunday observance by national law. [117]

The persecution through which our forefathers passed opened their eyes to the dangers threatened by the union of Church and State, and hence the solicitude they manifested, who had suffered most at the hands of the established church, to see that the Constitution guaranteed religious liberty to all.

There will be no limit to religious intolerance if once you succeed in uniting Church and State. But what is our country coming to, ask these advocates of Sunday legislation, if we thus allow the people to do as they please on Sunday? I know not. But what are we going to do as Christians? they ask. Simply do our duty in preaching the gospel, and in setting a good example, will increase a strong public sentiment in favor of righteousness and sobriety. To attempt to compel men to observe Sunday and attend church, is to try to advance the kingdom of Christ by the sword, which the dear Master condemned, saying: "My kingdom is not of this world; if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight." And when Peter seized the sword and struck in his Master's defense, he said: "Put up thy sword into the sheath, for all they that take the sword, shall perish with the sword."

How long think you would it be in this country, if a law were enacted to enforce Sunday observance and the attendance of religious worship in the house of God, before blood would begin to flow? There would be no end to revolution and rebellion by and by. Our country would be torn to pieces by factions, and these factions would get into power, and Christians would be persecuted to the death.

Before you vote to incorporate a Sunday law into the Constitution of these United States, read the history of the past on this point of the union of Church and State, and then oppose any such measure by all the power that you, as free men, can wield. As a nation, we are not ready to take a step backward a hundred years. We are not ready to place our liberties into the hands of any church or combination of churches, under the name of the "American Sabbath Union." The Lord deliver us from all laws that tend in any way to bind the consciences of men. Baptists and others worked too hard in the early formation of our grand old Constitution to now surrender the whole thing into the hands of those who, like Uzzah, put forth their hand to steady the ark of God. When a nation does that, like Uzzah, it will perish.

God's cause is not dependent on the legislation of any Government to keep it from ruin.

The Sabbath and its sacredness are not dependent on the secular arm to make its observance binding on the consciences of men. Compulsion never did and never will bring men into harmony with God and his laws. Such harmony, if secured at all, must begin in the heart, implanted by the Spirit of God, and men must act willingly from love to God, or there can be no obedience.

Liberty of conscience, and liberty of action in matters of religion, is the birthright of every American, and has been guaranteed under the Constitution of our glorious republic. Let us not surrender that birthright through fear that the country, by Sunday desecration, will go to ruin. If Christians do their duty in the family, the society, and the church of which they are members, there need be no fear for the welfare and safety of our country.
