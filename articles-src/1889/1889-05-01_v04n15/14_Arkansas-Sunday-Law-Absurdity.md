The second section of the proposed Arkansas Sunday law reads as follows: "Every apprentice or servant compelled to labor on Sunday shall be deemed a separate offense of the master." This seems rather hard on both servants and masters. Why the servant should be deemed an offense of the master, is not clear to our mind. If it means that the master is to be held accountable, why should the servant be deemed an offense at all? Is this action simply a covert way of declaring that servants are a nuisance? We give it up; but it is evident that the man who supports only a small establishment cannot have so many offenses as the one who has a large household. We have heard that there are some ministers in the Arkansas Legislature, but is there not a school-teacher among the lot? It is evident that it doesn't need a very high grade of intelligence to make a law good enough to persecute by.
