# “Principles of the Christian Religion” According to the National Reformers.

When the Blair Amendment was introduced into the Congress of the United States, the National Reformers said it was just the thing they wanted, just what they had been working for for years; that they would “begin without delay the circulation of petitions (to be furnished in proper form by the association), and let an opportunity be given, in all parts of the country, to make up a roll of petitions so great that it would require a procession of wheelbarrows to trundle the mighty mass into the presence of the representatives of the Nation, into the House of Congress.”

The questions naturally arise to an observer: Why has the National Reform Association always been so persistent in pushing such movements? Why do they so much want the Blair Amendment to pass? What part of it is it they so very much favor? is it the educational part, or some other part?

These questions are all answered, to my mind, by J. C. K. Milligan in the *Christian Statesman *of July 26, 1888. He says: “True, the pending amendment has its chief value in one phrase, ‘the Christian religion.’”

Mr. Milligan says that because it will enforce the teaching of the Christian religion, that makes it truly valuable. Then of course without that it has no true value. Now can you answer the question, “Why do they so much want the amendment passed?”

What does it mean if the proposed amendment should be adopted? It simply means that a set of rules will have to be culled out, by somebody, and called the “principles of the Christian religion.” In other words, the principles of the Christian religion will have to be defined. I could teach the principles of Ingersoll as the principles of the Christian religion, and the law could not stop me, if it did not define the principles of the Christian religion.

Some think this kind of reasoning is carrying the matter a point too far, for they say, “Everyone knows what the principles of the Christian religion are.” I doubt the statement very much; but to save argument we simply submit the words of the father of the bill. Senator Blair says: “I believe that a text-book of instruction in the principles of virtue, morality, and of the Christian religion, can be prepared for use in the public schools by a joint effort of those who represent every branch of the Christian church, both Protestant and Catholic, and also those who are not actively associated with either.” This he said in a letter to the secretary of the National Reform Association. Now if a text-book is to be made, I should like to ask, Will not those things which are to be put into the text-book have to be defined before they go into the book, or will the amendmentists accept anything, whatever it may be, as the principles of the Christian religion? To ask such a question is to answer it. And since they will have to be defined, how will it be done?—”By a joint effort of those who represent every branch of the Christian church, both Protestant and Catholic, and also those who are not actively associated with either.” It will be quite a mongrel will it not?

But since National Reformers are the ones who work up sentiment, and try to get such laws passed, they, of course, will be represented as fully as any other body of the Christian church [115] in this council which is to decide what the principles of the Christian religion are. Since they ask the privilege of doing this (defining the Christian religion), it is only fair to ask the question, What have these principles which you would define as the principles of the Christian religion, led you to do? what kind of spirit have they led you to manifest? We will let their own words answer these questions.

The *Christian Statesman* of October 2, 1884, says: “Enforce upon all that come among us the laws of Christian morality.” How long would a person have to be “enforced” to obey the laws of Christian morality before he would say, “The love of Christ constraineth me”? By this very act of enforcing Christian morality they are trying to do something which will drive people farther away from Christ instead of drawing them closer. That is one flaw in their principles of the Christian religion.

In the *Christian Statesman* of November 1, 1883, Mr. Coleman says: “To be perfectly plain, I believe that the existence of a Christian Constitution would disfranchise every logically consistent infidel.” Remember, that with National Reformers all who oppose their views are infidels. Isn’t that pretty hard? Webster defines “disfranchise” as follows: “To deprive of the rights and privileges of a free citizen.” One of the rights of every citizen, in this country, is the right to worship God, or not to worship God, according to the dictates of his own conscience. Another right is to be protected; another to vote; another to hold property, etc.

So Mr. Coleman would take away such rights as these; take away all rights to freedom, as a free citizen; all rights to be protected; all rights to worship God according to your own idea, etc., etc.

It looks very much like just making a man a vagabond on the face of the earth, does it not? And why should all this be done? Simply because you don’t believe as Mr. Coleman does.

How would you like such principles as these taught to your children? Yet this seems to be National Reform religion.

In the *Statesman* of May 21, 1885, the Rev. E. B. Graham says: “We might say in all justice, if the opposers of the Bible do not like our government, and its Christian features, let them go to some wild, desolate land, and in the name of the devil, and for the sake of the devil, subdue it, and set up a government of their own on infidel and atheistic ideas, and then, if they can stand it, stay there until they die.” What kind of Christianity is that?

Just because a man does not agree with you in religious views, send him straight to the devil. Does that sound much as if that man’s “Christian principles” had led him just where he ought to be to teach others? It does seem to me that he has been led just where he would be likely to recommend some carnal power to enforce his ideas of the Christian principles. Does his talk sound very much like the gospel in its simplicity when it went forth “conquering and to conquer”? The principles of the Christian religion have been legislated upon far too much by worldly powers already, Mr. Graham. That is the reason it does not go forth “conquering and to conquer,” as much as it used to. But there is another point in Mr. Graham’s remark. It is this: he speaks his sentiments in “all justice.” That is the National Reform idea of justice. Again: The Rev. Jonathan Edwards said in a speech in New York City in February, 1873:—

> “What are the rights of the atheist? I would tolerate him as I would tolerate a poor lunatic; for in my view his mind is scarcely sound. So long as he does not rave, so long as he is not dangerous, I would tolerate him. I would tolerate him as I would tolerate a conspirator.”

Mr. Edwards takes pains to explain the term “atheist.” He simply makes out that all who are opposed to this movement, which he is working to forward, are atheists. Please notice this: it is possible for an atheist to rave. It is possible for a Seventh-day Baptist to rave. It is possible for a Seventh-day Adventist to rave. How may they do it? Simply by speaking their convictions. If they do this they are to be tolerated as conspirators, and, of course, trotted off to jail. Again, Mr. Edwards says: “Yes, to this extent I would tolerate the atheist, but no more. Why should I? The atheist does not tolerate me. He does not smile either in pity or in scorn upon my faith.” Mr. Edwards has spoken too plainly to be misunderstood this time any way. If he has not taught the doctrine, which, if expressed in words, would be, Love those who love you; hate those who hate you; curse those who curse you; and anything of like import you have a mind to add, then I don’t know the meaning of plain English.

Again, Mr. Edwards says: *“Tolerate atheism, sir, there is nothing out of hell that I would not as soon tolerate.”*

There you have it all in a nutshell. That can not be misinterpreted. If there is nothing out of hell as bad as an atheist (atheist, deist, Jew, Seventh-day Baptist, and Seventh-day Adventist), then it is plain that he would be closer to his place if he was sent to hell; and that is not all, Mr. Edwards manifests a spirit to send him there, if he can.

Well, friends, how do you like the National Reform version of the “principles of the Christian religion”? You have a few of them before you, decide if you like them or not. C. Emmerson.
