In the *Christian Statesman* of April 4, the Rev. J. M. Foster has a report, in which he says: "Everything that can be said in favor of the Sunday paper may be urged in behalf of an open saloon. And until the church is ready to banish the Sunday paper she cannot close the saloon. The men who issue the Sunday paper, like the men who open the saloon, are fugitives from justice. They ought to be in the penitentiary, for they are law breakers." We have not yet heard of any newspaper proprietor who was a fugitive from justice. But passing by that rhetorical flourish, look at the position which Mr. Foster takes. It is no worse in his eyes to run a saloon on Sunday than to run a newspaper. Thus, just as we have often claimed, Sunday legislation is anti-temperance legislation. The saloon and the newspaper are placed by it on the same level. If it is just as bad to print a newspaper on Sunday as it is to open a saloon on that day, then it must be just as correct to run a saloon on Monday as it is to issue a newspaper on that day. We repeat it: Sunday laws are laws to make legitimate the selling of whisky.

A dispatch from Washington, dated April 10, says: "There has been so much agitation of the proposition to abolish Sunday dress parades in the army that before action is taken upon it by President Harrison it will be made a subject of discussion by the Cabinet. Secretary Proctor several days ago recommended to the President that Sunday dress parades be abolished, but so many army officers entered objections that the order was not acted upon immediately, and is now to receive Cabinet consideration." Thus the Sun- day-law advocates meet with another rebuff in their efforts to inflict strict Sunday observance upon the people. They claim to be laboring in behalf of the workingmen, but the workingmen protest; then they want to help the poor soldier, but the soldier insists that he doesn't need any such help. The Sunday-law people will soon be obliged to throw off the mask, and declare plainly that they want the Sunday strictly observed simply because it suits their notions, and if the working-people don't want it they must yield anyway.
