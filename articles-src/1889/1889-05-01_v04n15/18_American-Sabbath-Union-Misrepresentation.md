The American Sabbath Union publishes each month a small tract in the interest of Sunday legislation. The January "Document" contains brief extracts from the hearing before the Senate Committee on Education and Labor, and the March "Document" refers to this in these words:—

> "The January "Document" of the American Sabbath Union shows that both Professor Jones [A. T. J.] and Dr. Lewis, and also the champions of the Jews and infidels, admit all that the friends of the Sunday-Rest law generally claim—the right of the Government to make Sunday laws for the public good; denying what the friends of the Sunday-Rest bill also deny, that the Government should compel a religious observance of the day."

We wish to say that so far as the above relates to A. T. Jones, it is absolutely false, as anybody can see who reads the report of the hearing before the Senate Committee, and as all readers of the American Sentinel can testify. The editors of the Sentinel have always opposed Sunday laws, no matter what pretext was given for their passage, and have denied the right of the State to say when men shall rest. We protest against this unfair attempt to make it appear that there is no point in any of the opposition to the schemes of political ecclesiastics. [121]
