The Williamston, Mich., *Enterprise* prints an article on the Blair bill which closes up with the following pertinent comment and anecdote:—

> "All efforts to make mankind religious, or even moral, on the theory that by removing the opportunity you cure the desire, have been failures, *flat failures.* No man made good by law, by lack of opportunity, has any manhood worth the name, and the effort to accomplish such a result reminds me of the story of Elder Knapp's convert. Elder Knapp was a very successful revivalist, and on one occasion he was walking along the street of a city when he was accosted by a drunken man, who clasped his hand warmly, saying, 'Why, how do you do, Elder Knapp?' The Elder, in surprise that a stranger, more especially one maudlin with liquor, should speak to him, drew back, saying, 'I don't know you, sir.' 'What, not know me, Elder? Why, you converted me last winter,' said the man. The Elder buttoned his coat closely, starting on with the remark, 'You look like one of my poor human jobs. The Almighty didn't have any hand in it.' So any man made good or religious by force of law, hasn't got any depth of root on which to develop a crop worth harvesting."
