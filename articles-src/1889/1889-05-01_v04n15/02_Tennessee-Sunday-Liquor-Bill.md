The *Pearl of Days* says that "a bill making it a misdemeanor to sell wine, ale, or beer on Sunday, has passed both Houses in the Legislature of Tennessee."

This bill might properly be named a bill making it a righteous act to sell wine, ale, or beer on the last six days of the week. Misdemeanor is misbehavior. A misdemeanor is an evil action, since misdemeanor in general is evil conduct. So the bill in general declares that it is wrong to sell liquor on Sunday. The fact that the time is limited to Sunday says, as plainly as language can say it, that it is not wrong to sell liquor outside of that limit. It is a common thing for Sunday-law zealots to say that everyone who does not favor their schemes is in league with the saloons; but we should like to see how the supporters of the Tennessee Sunday bill can make it appear that they are not deliberately contracting with the liquor sellers to legalize their business and make it respectable six days in every week.
