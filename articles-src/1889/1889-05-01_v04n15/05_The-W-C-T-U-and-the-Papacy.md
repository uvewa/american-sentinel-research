# The W. C. T. U. and the Papacy.

Some time ago Miss Willard replied to an open letter addressed to her by Mrs. Lucinda B. Chandler, of Chicago. The letter was concerning the religio-political tendency of the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union, and Mrs. Chandler, deeming the points not met by Miss Willard, wrote a rejoinder, and sent it to the New York *Independent,* in which Miss Willard’s letter was published. That paper refused the rejoinder, which was afterwards published in the *Labor Enquirer.* Following is a portion of the letter to Miss Willard:—

Dear Sister and Friend: In your letter replying to mine, published in another sheet, I recognize what was already my conviction, that you are working from an ideal that is in your own life an absorbing motive power, and that the practical measures you propose in politics are recommended from a mistaken standpoint. Were the membership of Christian churches, of all shades of belief, Catholic and Protestant, as thoroughly devoted to practical righteousness, and as sincerely consecrated to human welfare, as yourself, the statement made at the annual convention at Nashville, and given in the open letter in the *Independent,* would be in order simply as a rallying call to faithful souls, an inspiration to zeal, and void of anything implying danger.

But that resolution does not represent the meaning and animus of the resolutions to which I referred in my first open letter, written before the Nashville convention.

The Vermont State W. C. T. U. led, in the following resolution: “That we believe Christ as the author and head of government should be recognized in all political platforms, and by all societies, and we will rejoice to see the day in which a political party distinctly gives such recognition.”

The New York convention “recommended to the W. C. T. U. of this State that they make urgent request of all political parties to this end.” Five other States fell into line with identical resolutions, and Ohio added a resolution “heartily approving the aims of the National Reform Association.”

The aim of the National Reform Association being to amend the United States Constitution by [118] the “recognition of God as the head of this Nation,” and, as distinctly stated by Secretary Weir, that the “party” that acknowledges the authority of God in civil government, pledges itself to plainly this: “God being the source of governmental power, and the ruler (?) who uses it being therefore his minister, that they will choose for every office only such as fear God,” such amendment of the Constitution, and such tests in partisan politics, would not only in effect repeal Article VI, clause 3, of the United States Constistitution, but would revolutionize Americanism backwards.

Secretary Weir also wrote to the *Christian Statesman* (before the Nashville convention), as follows: “I am convinced the thing to do is to appeal for aid in carrying our Lord’s cause through in the Prohibition party, to the National W. C. T. U.”

> “The Prohibition party cannot do without their aid, and knows it. It is the attitude of the W. C. T. U. that is compelling the unwilling leaders of the party to indorse woman suffrage. ... If they insist on the clear, frank, full recognition of Christ’s authority and law, we shall get it.”

Does Mr. Weir mean that if the W. C. T. U. “declares its solemn purpose to help forward the universal reign of Christ in the customs of society and the laws of the land, not in form, but in fact, not ecclesiastically, but really,” and does not propose to aid the National Reformers in abrogating a fundamental principle of Americanism by putting religious tests into political platforms, and undermining religious liberty as now guaranteed by the Constitution,—does Mr. Weir mean that “we shall get,” what is needed to secure that result, by the aid of the W. C. T. U.?

The verdict of history, and down to the religious persecutions of witches and Quakers through civil power, in this country is on the side of maintaining the wise provision of the Constitution of the United States: “But no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States.”

And here let me repeat somewhat of my first letter:—

> “It was the spirit of truth Jesus promised to his followers. The spirit of truth is the almighty, saving, redeeming power by and through which all humanity must be made whole.

> “Religious test as qualification for civic service would not develop a spirit of truth. If the Christian church cannot win the respect and allegiance of individuals, and of the people, by the evidences in its membership of superior goodness, justice, truth-loving and righteous dealing, it fails of proving itself the light of the world, and has no ground rightly to assume a leadership in civic or national affairs, much less to endeavor to destroy the foundation on which our civic institutions are built.”
Miss Willard “believes the Catholic Church is growing more liberal than is generally supposed, and that it can no more regain its temporal power than medieval ignorance, superstition, and abject servitude to kings and popes can be restored.”

Undoubtedly the atmosphere of American liberty has greatly circumscribed the veneration for popery and superstition. Undoubtedly there are large numbers in the Catholic Church who will not recognize the authority of the Pope in political matters. But why are the members of that church commanded by the Pope to remove their children from the free public school? Why are they being taught, or to be taught, “an abridged course of religious instruction, apologetic, dogmatic, and moral,” that “the civil laws of Christendom are binding on conscience so long as they are conformable to the rights of the Catholic Church?”

Why are the children of Catholics taught that “rationalism, or rather atheism of the State, consists in the exclusion from the civil government of all religious influence, above all that of the true religion of the Church of Jesus Christ (the Roman Catholic Church, of course), or, in other words, the separation of the State from the church, absolute independence of the State with regard to the church, which means oppression of the church by the State.”

If the power and prestige of popery and the Romish hierarchy is so emasculated that it can be passed by with a wave of the hand as an insignificant factor in future possibilities, political and religious, why is it that the civil powers of the world are for the most part in direct relations with the Vatican? Why do fifteen different Governments treat diplomatically with this mortal man who claims to be God’s vicegerent on earth?

Why has the Christian Government of England felt called upon to establish relations with Leo? Why did Grover Cleveland feel called upon to send a jubilee greeting to the Pope at Rome? He had the same right to send an offering as any other individual, to be sure, but as the presiding officer of this Nation it conveyed to the Pope a much greater significance than had it come from citizen Cleveland merely.

And why did Mr. Cleveland desire to send a “testimonial of the veneration for your august person” to the poor old man who complains of being a “prisoner,” though possessed of royal power? Was it possibly because he was the “religious head of 225,000,000 who form the larger part of modern democracy”?

There is no evidence that the Romish hierarchy is losing ground as a political power, but the contrary. There has been no withdrawal, or abrogation, of the following claims of a Papal encyclical, as quoted by Rev. Josiah Strong, in *Our Country:—*

> “XIX. The Romish Church has a right to exercise its authority without any limits set to it by the civil power.”

> “XXVII. The Pope and the priests ought to have dominion over the temporal affairs.”
> “XXX. The Romish Church and her ecclesiastics have a right to immunity from civil law.”
> “XLII. In case of conflict between the ecclesiastical and civil powers, the ecclesiastical powers ought to prevail.”
Bishop O’Connor is quoted by the same author as saying: “Religious liberty is merely endured until the opposition can be carried into effect without peril to the Catholic world.”

> “Religious liberty, in the sense of a liberty possessed by every man to choose his religion, is one of the most wicked delusions ever foisted upon this age by the father of deceit.” “It is neither more nor less than falsehood. No man has a right to choose his religion.”

> “The Catholic who says the church is not intolerant belies the sacred spouse of Christ.” Every cardinal, archbishop, and bishop in the Catholic Church takes an oath of allegiance to the Pope in which occur the following words: “Heretics, schismatics, and rebels to our said Lord (the Pope) or his aforesaid successors, I will to my utmost persecute and oppose.”
That “America is the hope of Rome,” as declared by the Pope, cannot be doubted by anyone who has followed closely the history of Romanism, the wary proceeding of the church on this continent, its accumulation of wealth, its persistent effort to prepare for a final attitude of antagonism to our free-school system. The Romish Church everywhere on this globe is a unit; no such unity elsewhere exists. Its ultimate aim, boldly announced and diligently worked for, is temporal power. Will the National Reformers and the W. C. T. U., as the ally of that party, work to remove the chief barrier under our Government, the constitutional guarantee of liberty of conscience, by and through which this foe to liberty can be held in check? It is true, as Rev. J. H. Warren, of California, says: “They blow no trumpets, are sparing of statistics, but are at work night and day to break down the constitutions of the country, beginning with the public schools. As surely as we live, so surely will the conflict come, and it will be a hard one.”

Lafayette, himself a Romanist, said: “If ever the liberties of the American people are destroyed, they will fall by the hands of the Romish clergy.”

Neither against the craftiness of Romanism or the devasting greed of mammon will the ballot of woman achieve fraternization unless it can avail to help this Nation do works meet for repentance. The workingmen are far nearer the spirit of the New Testament than are the ruling forces of Wall Street, of a robbing and oppressive financial system, and a commercial system that is making our institutions and Government a plutocracy.

> “But religion is an affair of the heart.” Yes, dear sister, it is “with the heart man believeth unto righteousness.” Politics certainly cannot be reckoned in that domain. When, if ever, civic affairs are controlled by the heart, they will no longer be political. Then why resort to the sphere of craftiness, of fierce antagonisms and mean ambitions, of crooked expenditures, political platforms, and partisan contentions, to proclaim that “Christ is the author and head of government.”

It is an attempt for which Jesus of Nazareth set no precedent, by precept or example. He proclaimed his kingdom to be a spiritual kingdom. Proclaiming the gospel of peace and good-will as a sentiment in political platforms will be but sounding brass and tinkling cymbal.

The *Lutheran Observer* says that “the law of the Sabbath belongs both to God and to Cesar.” We would like to know where it obtained its information, and what part of it belongs to God, and what to Cesar. We know of no law of the Sabbath, except that found in the decalogue; certainly there is no other with which God has anything to do. Did God and Cesar go into partnership in giving that law? The question needs no answer; God was the sole giver of the law from Sinai, and that contains the only Sabbath law that he ever gave. How, then, did Cesar get any claim upon it? Simply by fraud. Cesar has of right no more to do with the Sabbath than with the ordering of the angels in Heaven. To say that because he claims it we are in duty bound to recognize that claim, in order to comply with the divine command to “render unto Cesar the things that be Cesar’s,” is equivalent to saying that every usurper’s claim should be regarded as valid. The fact that a man has his hands on a thing is no proof that he owns it. Instead of acknowledging his claim, we say, “Hands off.” [119-120]

Note.—No papers are sent by the publishers of the American Sentinel to people who have not subscribed for it. If the Sentinel comes to one who has not subscribed for it, he may know that it is sent him by some friend, and that he will not be called upon by the publishers to pay for the same.

It was announced, at the time the Sentinel was changed to a weekly, that this volume would consist of forty-eight numbers. In order to make the volume end with the year, a paper must be omitted twice before the close of the year, and the first of these omissions will be next week.

A Baptist clergyman in the East, in writing to renew his subscription for the American Sentinel, says: “I most heartily commend the stand you have taken with reference to National Reform and Sunday legislation. You are right.” He shows his appreciation in a practical way, too, by sending five dollars, with directions that the remainder, after paying for Sentinel subscription, “Civil Government and Religion,” and *Sentinel Library,* be used to extend the circulation of the paper.

The second section of the proposed Arkansas Sunday law reads as follows: “Every apprentice or servant compelled to labor on Sunday shall be deemed a separate offense of the master.” This seems rather hard on both servants and masters. Why the servant should be deemed an offense of the master, is not clear to our mind. If it means that the master is to be held accountable, why should the servant be deemed an offense at all? Is this action simply a covert way of declaring that servants are a nuisance? We give it up; but it is evident that the man who supports only a small establishment cannot have so many offenses as the one who has a large household. We have heard that there are some ministers in the Arkansas Legislature, but is there not a school-teacher among the lot? It is evident that it doesn’t need a very high grade of intelligence to make a law good enough to persecute by.

In the *Christian Statesman* of April 4, the Rev. J. M. Foster has a report, in which he says: “Everything that can be said in favor of the Sunday paper may be urged in behalf of an open saloon. And until the church is ready to banish the Sunday paper she cannot close the saloon. The men who issue the Sunday paper, like the men who open the saloon, are fugitives from justice. They ought to be in the penitentiary, for they are law breakers.” We have not yet heard of any newspaper proprietor who was a fugitive from justice. But passing by that rhetorical flourish, look at the position which Mr. Foster takes. It is no worse in his eyes to run a saloon on Sunday than to run a newspaper. Thus, just as we have often claimed, Sunday legislation is anti-temperance legislation. The saloon and the newspaper are placed by it on the same level. If it is just as bad to print a newspaper on Sunday as it is to open a saloon on that day, then it must be just as correct to run a saloon on Monday as it is to issue a newspaper on that day. We repeat it: Sunday laws are laws to make legitimate the selling of whisky.

A dispatch from Washington, dated April 10, says: “There has been so much agitation of the proposition to abolish Sunday dress parades in the army that before action is taken upon it by President Harrison it will be made a subject of discussion by the Cabinet. Secretary Proctor several days ago recommended to the President that Sunday dress parades be abolished, but so many army officers entered objections that the order was not acted upon immediately, and is now to receive Cabinet consideration.” Thus the Sun- day-law advocates meet with another rebuff in their efforts to inflict strict Sunday observance upon the people. They claim to be laboring in behalf of the workingmen, but the workingmen protest; then they want to help the poor soldier, but the soldier insists that he doesn’t need any such help. The Sunday-law people will soon be obliged to throw off the mask, and declare plainly that they want the Sunday strictly observed simply because it suits their notions, and if the working-people don’t want it they must yield anyway.

The Williamston, Mich., *Enterprise* prints an article on the Blair bill which closes up with the following pertinent comment and anecdote:—

> “All efforts to make mankind religious, or even moral, on the theory that by removing the opportunity you cure the desire, have been failures, *flat failures.* No man made good by law, by lack of opportunity, has any manhood worth the name, and the effort to accomplish such a result reminds me of the story of Elder Knapp’s convert. Elder Knapp was a very successful revivalist, and on one occasion he was walking along the street of a city when he was accosted by a drunken man, who clasped his hand warmly, saying, ‘Why, how do you do, Elder Knapp?’ The Elder, in surprise that a stranger, more especially one maudlin with liquor, should speak to him, drew back, saying, ‘I don’t know you, sir.’ ‘What, not know me, Elder? Why, you converted me last winter,’ said the man. The Elder buttoned his coat closely, starting on with the remark, ‘You look like one of my poor human jobs. The Almighty didn’t have any hand in it.’ So any man made good or religious by force of law, hasn’t got any depth of root on which to develop a crop worth harvesting.”
