The leaders in the matter of Sunday legislation are very fond of classing all opponents of their schemes as infidels and atheists. They will have hard work, however, to maintain the Pharisaic position which they have assumed, so long as eminent clergymen of various denominations continue to preach sermons against the Blair bills and Sunday legislation in general. On Sunday, March 24, the Rev. M. D. Shutter, of the Church of the Redeemer, Minneapolis, preached a sermon on "Religion and the State," dwelling for the most part on the Blair Sunday bill. He said:—

> "I am opposed to this measure, because any attempt to promote by legislation the observance of any day as a day of religious worship is no part of the function of the State. A State may simply act on grounds of general public welfare. It may require cessation from labor one day a week, if, in the judgment of legislators, this is necessary for the public benefit; but it may not require this cessation on any particular day, because that is regarded by any part of the people as a holy day, or for the purpose of promoting the observance of such a day as a day of 'religious worship.' For the State to proceed upon the basis that such a thing is demanded by the law of God, is to establish the principle that the State has a right to determine what are the laws of God. The Sabbath is in debate even among Christians. The action contemplated in the Blair bill makes the State a partner in a religious controversy, and forces it to a decision against one set of claimants and in favor of the other. Its decision must then be enforced, and this is persecution. The principle itself is the one that lies at the bottom of a union of Church and State. Let Christian people translate the truths and doctrines of Christianity into their lives, and not into the statutes. Conversions are not produced by law. We had a trial of the very thing to which this bill would lead, in the early days of this country, when each colony was dominated by a religious sect. We have gotten away from that condition. Let us take no backward steps!"
