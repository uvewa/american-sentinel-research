The *Lutheran Observer* says that "the law of the Sabbath belongs both to God and to Cesar." We would like to know where it obtained its information, and what part of it belongs to God, and what to Cesar. We know of no law of the Sabbath, except that found in the decalogue; certainly there is no other with which God has anything to do. Did God and Cesar go into partnership in giving that law? The question needs no answer; God was the sole giver of the law from Sinai, and that contains the only Sabbath law that he ever gave. How, then, did Cesar get any claim upon it? Simply by fraud. Cesar has of right no more to do with the Sabbath than with the ordering of the angels in Heaven. To say that because he claims it we are in duty bound to recognize that claim, in order to comply with the divine command to "render unto Cesar the things that be Cesar's," is equivalent to saying that every usurper's claim should be regarded as valid. The fact that a man has his hands on a thing is no proof that he owns it. Instead of acknowledging his claim, we say, "Hands off." [119-120]
