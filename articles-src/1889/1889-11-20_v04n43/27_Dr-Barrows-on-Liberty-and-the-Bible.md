The following is from Dr. Barrows' thanksgiving service in the October number of the *Treasury.* It does not well accord with some of the ideas advanced by that school of religionists who think that our nation's Constitution is infidel because it is secular. Dr. Barrows says:—

> "The eloquent voice of the Honorable William C. P. Breckinridge, of Kentucky, has shown us that liberty is the child of that interpretation of the Bible which became general with the Protestant Reformation. We may say with truth that 'free America was born of the Bible.' From the Bible came the simpler forms of self-government, in town and church, that have gone with our civilization in its westward march. . . Hence came also the separation of Church and State, and the soul liberty which Roger Williams learned from Him who said, 'My kingdom is not of this world.' From the Bible came, as Edward Everett declared, 'the better elements of our national institutions.' It was an echo from the Scriptures which Jefferson sounded in the great Declaration. From the Bible came the moral forces that carried through our first Revolution, and which have withstood the castings of corruption in succeeding years. From the same source have sprung the moral reformations that have preserved our nationality and our freedom. 'The American republic is of heavenly birth.'"
