A correspondent of the *Jewish Voice,* St. Louis, Mo., writes as follows to that paper:—

> "Not long ago your correspondent saw in one of the daily newspapers an account of the arrest of several Jews for not keeping their stores closed on Sunday. These same men had rested the day preceding. What shall we say to this? There is no one more devoted to his country, no one who has less prejudice and more regard for the opinions of his fellow-men, than the writer. Yet this deed approaches his sense of the unjust, and arouses as much of a feeling of resentment as dare be found in the heart of a Jew, and he still be called a Jew in the sight of God. Is there any nation which has representatives in the United States who are more peaceable than the Jews? Is there any nation that causes less annoyance to the government?—None! If you ask why, we answer, Because the turbulent spirit has been conquered by years of cruel persecution. They love the Constitution of the United States. Why?—Because it is founded on the one which their great Lawgiver framed for them. Still, in this very country, that has the statue of liberty at the entrance of the harbor of its most densely populated city, freedom of thought, of action, is forbidden; aye, more than that, *punished* by law; it is true, not by the rack or the stocks, but by a *refined* mode suitable to the age."
