# "A Jolly Election of a Clergyman."

The following from the London *Telegraph* shows something of what we may expect in this country when National Reformers shall have been successful in foisting upon a free people a corrupt church establishment, or, as they put it, a "union of religion and the State":—

> "The election of a clergyman for the Church of St. John, Deritend, Birmingham, by the householders of the hamlets of Deritend and Bordesley, took place on Saturday. The Church of St. John is now of the value of £450 per annum, and in a few years the income will be enormously increased, owing to the falling in of leases. Since the fourteenth century the chaplains, as they are termed, of St. John have always been elected by the householders, the deed prescribing that each person having a hearth should be entitled to vote; so that the franchise is similar to that of a municipal election, including women voters. The last election took place in 1870, and the present vacancy was created by the retirement of the then successful candidate.

> "The election, being by open voting, took place amid unusual excitement, and as the Corrupt Practices Act does not apply, it is said that a large amount of treating took place. Mr. West, being a total abstainer, received the support of the temperance party, while Mr. Sneath, having declared that he saw no harm in a man having a glass of beer, was actively supported by the publicans and brewers. Betting took place on an extensive scale.
> "The public-houses, especially in Deritend, were crowded throughout the day. It is said that the drinking and rowdyism were nothing to what were to be seen at the election of nineteen years ago. But the scenes in Deritend were shocking, even apart from the fact that the occasion was one associated with religion.
> "One of the features of the election was the wearing of party colors, Mr. West's friends sporting yellow ribbons and rosettes, and Mr. Sneath's bright red. There was a profuse display, too, of election literature. The placards on Mr. Sneath's vehicles were for the most part exhortations to the electors not to be deluded by any 'state of the poll ' that might be issued during the day—a warning that was unnecessary, seeing that both candidates adhered to the agreement not to increase the excitement by any such means. Underneath was this:—
> "'Poll early, men, for Sneath the bold,
> For he'll be neither bought nor sold.'
> "Mr. Sneath was also freely billed as 'the-friend of the poor,' and spoken of in various couplets of indifferent rhyme and meter, as 'good old Charlie.' Mr. West's friends delighted in describing him as the 'choice of the congregation,' while, as a set-off to Mr. Sneath's claim to be the 'friend of the poor,' they issued a bill stating that 'Mr. West will not purchase votes, nor bribe, nor give beer, nor promise rewards; but if elected, he will do his duty to both rich and poor.' Another effort of theirs resulted in the following appeal: 'Q*uestion*—Will free Britons give their money to force a tyrant king on an unwilling people? Will the electors of Deritend and Bordesley give their votes to force a rejected minister on an unwilling people? Ten thousand voices answer, "No! no! no!" Vote for West, the congregation's choice.'" *—London Telegraph.*
