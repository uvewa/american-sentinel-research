The *American Citizen* says that "people should remember that it was the official organ of the Roman Catholic Church, called *The Rambler, *which said:—

> "'Religious liberty, in the sense of a liberty possessed by every man to choose his own religion, is one of the most wicked delusions ever foisted upon this age by the father of all deceit.'"

People should also remember that this is substantially what the National Reformers say. The only real difference between many so-called Protestants and the papists is in the kind of religion to be adopted or fostered by the State. About the only question between them is, Shall it be your religion or my religion?
