Rev. N. R. Johnston, a correspondent of the *Christian Statesman,* thinks "a Christian people [should] scatter away all iniquity by constitutional or statute law." Iniquity is sin; therefore he must think that sin can be scattered away by civil law! We would like to know of a single instance where it has been done. The Scriptures teach that only the power of God can take away sin, that only the grace of God can forgive sin, and that only the Spirit of God can so renew the human mind that it will not love sin. Had Mr. Johnston only lived before Christ, possibly the Son of God need not have died, and sin might have been abolished by civil law!
