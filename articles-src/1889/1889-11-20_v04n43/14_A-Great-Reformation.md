# "A Great Reformation."

Dr. Bothwell, of the Chase Street Congregational Church, West Oakland, delivered a lecture, October 27, on Pope Gregory VII., or, "Rome's Most Successful Attempt at Universal Dominion." In the report in the *Morning Times* occurs the following extract:—

> "Gregory effected a great reformation during his reign, effecting the celibacy of the clergy, and taking away the benefice of the kings by elevating the spiritual above the temporal power, compelling the greatest emperor of his time, Henry IV., to humble before him. He accomplished this because he excelled other men in brain power, in knowledge, in zeal and singleness of purpose, and in his grasp of the mighty basic principles of the Redeemer's kingdom. Christian people should, therefore, be content with no ordinary attainments, and with the full inspiration from God they should be able to accomplish much; and to enjoy the vastness of his kingdom all should make the fullest preparation."

Mr. Bothwell is an ardent Sunday-law advocate. This is the apology for this notice of the utterance above quoted. The fact is pertinent in connection with such a sentiment, as showing the general tendency of that class of religionists to sympathize with the Catholic ideas of the church's relation to the State. There is no doubt of the facts asserted in regard to Gregory's aggressiveness, and also of his success in securing the domination of the church over the State. It may be fairly admitted that Gregory was actuated by a zeal for the reformation of the church, of which it certainly stood in much need in his day, and that his motive was not altogether a power-seeking one. There is no doubt that this was his idea of reformation.

But to characterize the things here specified by the lecturer as "a great Reformation," looks like an almost desperate attempt on the part of a Protestant minister to apologize for the domineering policy of the Papacy as regards its attitude toward the secular power. It would seem that Protestant aspirants for ecclesiastical domination in secular affairs, seeing their cause is so palpably papal in its nature, feel constrained to indorse almost anything coming from Rome in order to make a show of consistency.

When a married Protestant minister will hold up before his congregation, and before the public, the idea that "effecting the celibacy of the clergy" was "a great reformation," it certainly appears as though there was some pressing necessity for presenting papal dogmas in a favorable light. And is not the same conclusion doubly assured when the same estimate is placed upon the act of "taking away the benefice of the kings by elevating the spiritual above the temporal power?" And what shall we say when in the same strain he parades these extreme assumptions of the Papacy as "the mighty basic principles of the Redeemer's kingdom"?

Yet this man, only a few weeks ago, when advocating a Sunday law, utterly disclaimed being in favor of a union of Church and State. Can anyone read the extract from his lecture here quoted without the conviction that the Doctor has certainly changed his mind? Well, if he does not favor the *union* of Church and State, it is because he believes in "elevating the spiritual above the temporal power" so high that the latter will have nothing to say whatever, and the church will have "universal dominion."
