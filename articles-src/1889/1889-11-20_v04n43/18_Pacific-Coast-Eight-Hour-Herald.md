The *Pacific Coast Eight-Hour Herald,* Vol. 1, No. 1, is upon our table. It is the organ of the Pacific Coast Eight-hour League. It is a bright paper, ably edited, and will, no doubt, exert a powerful influence in favor of shorter hours of labor. The *Herald* is a four-page monthly, published at 834 Howard Street, San Francisco. Subscription price, 50 cents per year.
