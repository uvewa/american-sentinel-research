# "Salt-Christians."

Under the above caption, Mr. Geo. R. Scott, in the New York *Weekly Witness* of October 9, 1889, comments somewhat on the corruptions of the Democratic and Republican parties, after which he proceeds to eulogize the Prohibition party, and says: "The Prohibition party has a claim on salt-Christians that they cannot ignore. It proposed to make this country better religiously as well as politically."

Such a panegyric falls as an iceberg upon every man who prizes the precious boon of liberty. It stands as one more witness to the Sentinel's repeated statements, that the Prohibition party has a religious phase, and explains why the Sentinel opposes one feature of the work of this party. It is not because it dissents from the good principles of prohibition, but because it is opposed to incorporating it with the unholy principles of religious legislation. If this is the avowed work of the Prohibition party, as it unquestionably is, every "salt-Christian" is in duty bound to oppose its work thus far. It is just and equitable that the Prohibition party improve the moral status of politics if they can. This is within their sphere of action, as it pertains to this world. But religion is not of this world. Jesus Christ is its divine originator, and no other power is at liberty to dictate a form of worship. Jesus said, "My kingdom is not of this world," and it does not enter into the province of any earthly power to sit as the arbiter of Christian ethics, invade the synagogues of the land, and dictate to the worshiper a code of tenets for them to follow. To do so is to blasphemously assume the prerogative of God. Yet this is what is proposed by the Prohibition party, the American Sabbath Union, National Reform Association, and the Woman's Christian Temperance Union. They propose by the power of civil laws to enforce, regardless of anybody's conscience, certain religious observances. This will multiply hypocrites, but not Christians.

Religiously, every man should be left free to act for himself, be he Christian, Jew, Mohammedan, or infidel. His conscience and liberties are sacred, and it is contrary to every Christian principle to lay any restriction in these matters upon him. Any and all attempts to do so are subversive to Christianity, and but tend to a union of Church and State, and leave behind them a dark trail of persecution, as did Rome during the Dark Ages. George B. Thompson.
