The *Statesman* (Chicago), more bold than its fellows, in an editorial in its September number says:—

> "The open sale of liquors on Sunday is doubtless a serious evil, as is its sale on all days; but the question at issue is not the sale of an injurious article, nor the presence in the market of a pernicious traffic. The question which has been before the Chicago public for some years is the Sunday slavery, resulting to many thousands of her citizens through an utter disregard of all Sunday laws by some of her citizens. The fight is not specifically against the saloon, but against unlawful Sunday toil and traffic of every sort."

Thus it appears, as we have often said, that the real object of Sunday closing is the exaltation of Sunday rather than the promotion of temperance and the restriction of the liquor traffic. Now let us hear no more of this hypocritical cant about Sunday prohibition of rum-selling when the saloons are allowed free course on the other six days and till midnight on Saturday.
