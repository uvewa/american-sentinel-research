The American Sabbath Union is an extensive religious combination to effect a political object, and is, therefore, according to the words of Hou. Richard M. Johnson, dangerous. In 1828-29, Congress was asked to suspend the carrying of the mails upon Sunday. The matter was referred to the committee on post-offices and post-roads, of which Mr. Johnson was chairman, who reported adversely. One of their reasons was as follows:—

> "Extensive religious combinations to effect a political object are, in the opinion of the committee, always dangerous. This first effort of the kind calls for the establishment of a principle which, in the opinion of the committee, would lay the foundation for dangerous innovations upon the spirit of the Constitution, and upon the religious rights of the citizen. If admitted, it may be justly apprehended that the future measures of the government will be strongly marked, if not eventually controlled, by the same influence. All religious despotisms commence by combination and influence, and when that influence begins to operate upon the political institutions of a country, the civil power soon bends under it; and the catastrophe of other nations furnishes an awful warning of the consequences."

These words were true sixty years ago, and they are just as true to-day. Therefore, let all who love liberty beware of the American Sabbath Union and its work.
