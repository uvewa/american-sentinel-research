The President's Thanksgiving proclamation is peculiar in that it says "that the people of our country, ceasing from the cares and labor of their working-days, shall assemble in their respective places of worship and give thanks to God, who has prospered us on our way," etc. This reminds us of the idea which has been expressed— we cannot now recall the words—that that which is at first given only as advice comes in time to have the force of positive command. Of course it was not the purpose of the President to command anybody to observe Thanksgiving, but the language which he has used is suggestive of the tendency toward official supervision of religious matters. We know of no greater farce, however, than our American Thanksgiving, and they who suppose that God is honored by a day set apart to gormandizing have a very low conception of Deity.
