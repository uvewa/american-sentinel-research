In Peru the only church recognized by the government is the "Holy Catholic Church." There is a Protestant church at Lima and another at Callao; but no building for Protestant worship is allowed to be in sight from the street; it must be within such walls as will give no public indication of a place of worship. This is the same sort of toleration which the American Sabbath Union proposes to grant to those who do not agree with them as to the obligation to keep Sunday religiously; they will kindly permit them to do private work on Sunday in out-of-the-way places, behind walls and shutters.
