Mr. Gladstone wrote a letter to the late so-called Sabbath Congress in Paris advocating Sunday observance and laws for its enforcement, but he evidently wants such statutes not for himself but for the common herd. This is shown by the fact that on the Sunday preceding the congress Mr. Gladstone, who was in Paris, after attending church in the morning, drove with a party of friends in the Bois-de-Boulogne, and in the evening visited the great exposition. Referring to this fact, the Paris correspondent of the New York *Observer* says:—

> "From a Frenchman's standpoint, this would not be thought out of the way, but his English and American admirers would hardly think it in keeping with his letter read before the congress."
