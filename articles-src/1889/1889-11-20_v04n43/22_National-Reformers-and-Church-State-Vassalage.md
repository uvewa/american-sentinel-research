The National Reformers do not want a union of Church and State. Oh, no, they are bitterly opposed to anything of that sort! What they do want may be inferred, however, from the following from an article by Rev. J. M. Foster, one of the district secretaries, in the Christian *Cynosure* of October 17. Mr. Foster says:—

> "According to the Scriptures, the State and its sphere exist for the sake of, and to serve the interests of, the church. The true State will have a wise reference to the church's interests in all its legislative, executive, and judicial proceedings. . . . The expenses of the church, in carrying on her public aggressive work, it (the State) meets in whole, or in part, out of the public treasury. Thus the church is protected and exalted by the State."

This makes it clear that it is not union but vassalage which National Reformers want; the State to be the vassal. No wonder they wish to change that feature of our fundamental law which accords with the idea that governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed. They know that the "governed" in this country will never willingly submit to their wicked schemes.
