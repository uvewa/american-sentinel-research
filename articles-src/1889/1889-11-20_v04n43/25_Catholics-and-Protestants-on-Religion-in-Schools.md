The *Christian Cynosure* says:—

> "However Protestants may voice their fears of Jesuit aggression and intrigue, they are unlikely to use too vigorous language when the leading Romanist papers, like the *Catholic Review,* can speak of the patrons of the American public school and of the school fund in such terms as these: 'Catholics will not make war on the public school, because they believe in admitting the State to a limited share in educating the children; because they know that half the millions of America are pagans who desire a pagan training for their children; and because they are certain that the public schools, in their present state, are suitable for these people. Believing that the State should take an interest in education, but knowing that the State school, admirably suited for pagans, is not the school for Catholic or Protestant children, they are bound to build up a Catholic branch of the public-school system, where children will be educated as Catholics at the expense of the State.'"

And, pray, why not, we would like to ask, if it is the province of the State to teach religion at all? So far as the matter of teaching religion in the schools is concerned, Catholics and Protestants of the *Cynosure* type are at one: they both want religion taught in the public schools and at public expense, the only difference being that each party demands that their religion shall be that which shall be taught.
