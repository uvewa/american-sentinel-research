# He Don’t Belong.

When the field secretary of the American Sabbath Union was “swinging round the circle” last summer, he gave two addresses at Fresno, Cal. Among other questions sent up for him to answer at one of his public meetings, was this one, “Do you indorse the principles of the National Reform Association?” The evasive answer came with readiness, “I don’t belong to that party.” After a somewhat lengthy and rambling talk he said, “I am not ashamed of it.” Then it seems he doesn’t “belong” but has a “warm side” for it. His sympathies are for it and with it. Does he sustain the same relation to it as he does to the Knights of Labor? At their general assembly last year at Indianapolis, he told them that he was so closely in “accord” with their “principles” that he had almost decided to become a Knight himself. He said if he did not it would be because he believed he could “advance” their “principles better as an outside ally.”

Dr. Crafts gets apparently much “worked up” when anything coming from National Reform sources is brought to bear upon his work. He immediately repudiates it. It is almost pitiful to notice how much pain the galling imputation gives him. He don’t belong, it isn’t his purpose, etc., yet he’s “not ashamed of it.” Can he “advance” its “principles better as an outside ally”? Can he do it more service where he is, just as he can help the Knights more by not belonging to them?

Now let us look at one or two of the principal results wished for, which spring from National Reform principles. The words about to be presented are not those of obscure and indifferent men, but those of leading and zealous advocates:

> “Constitutional laws punish for false money, weights, and measures, and, of course, Congress establishes a standard for money, weights, and measures. So Congress must establish a standard of religion,” etc.—*Dr. Blanchard, in Pittsburg National Reform Convention in 1874.*

> “It is the duty of the State, as such, to enter into alliance with the church of Christ, and to profess, adhere to, defend, and maintain, the true religion.” *—Secretary J. M. Foster, in Christian Statesman, 1884.*
> “To be perfectly plain, I believe that the existence of a Christian Constitution would disfranchise every logically consistent infidel.”—*Secretary* *W. J. Coleman, in Christian Statesman, Nov. 1, 1883.*
> “Of course a government organized on a basis embracing Christianity could not, with propriety, intrust those with office who are hostile to its characteristic faith. And none of this class have any right to claim that they should be legally eligible to office with those who are *bona-fide* citizens.”—*Christian Nation, September 15, 1886, National Reform organ, New York City.*
Secretary Foster, in speaking of the National Reformed State, says:—

> “The expenses of the church in carrying on her aggressive work, it [the State] meets in whole or in part out of the public treasury.”—*Christian Statesman, March, 1884.*

Lastly:—

> “But shall we take—is it right to take-public money to teach principles, enforce laws, and introduce customs to which many members of the community are opposed?—Most certainly. The gospel from its very nature is aggressive, contemplates the rectification of corrupt, disorderly, and degraded human nature, casts down every high thing that would exalt itself against the knowledge of God, and brings every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ.”—*Wm. Somerville, in Christian Nation, July 7 and 14, 1886.*

Here we have a few things—quite a small crop —growing out of National Reform principles, viz.: 1. Congress to establish a standard of religion. 2. The State to enter into alliance with the Church—Church and State union. 3. Disfranchising infidels, which means everybody “hostile” to the National Reform idea of Christianity. 4. “None of this class” to be treated as *“bonafide* citizens.” 5. Providing public money to carry on “the aggressive work” of the church, the preachers to be fed out of the “public crib.” 6. It is right to so use the public funds, because the gospel is “aggressive” and “casts down” everything that would “exalt” itself against it. In other words, nothing must stand in the way of the National Reform *regime,* not even the United States treasury, and Dr. Crafts is “not ashamed” of such principles!N. J. Bowers.
