Conspicuous among the many excellent educational institutions of the Pacific Coast, is the San Francisco Business College. The president, Niel S. Phelps, is one of the finest educators in the State, and indeed the names of the Faculty are a sufficient guarantee of the excellence of the instruction given. The college paper, *San Francisco Business College Journal,* is one of the brightest and best we have ever seen, and any of our readers contemplating a business course should send for a specimen copy, and thus learn more about the college which it represents.
