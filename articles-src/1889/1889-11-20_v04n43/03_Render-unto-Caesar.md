In the *Journal* of August 10, M. A. G., under the heading, "Morals in Politics," says: "In our government Cæsar represents the people, and among the things we are to render unto Cæsar is one day's rest in seven."

Matt. 22:20, 21: "And he said unto them, Whose is this image and superscription? They say unto him, Cæsar's. Then saith he unto them, Render therefore unto Cæsar the things which are Cæsar's and unto God the things that are God's." Here Christ forever separates Church and State. Look at the Sabbath: "Whose is this image and superscription?" Does the commandment read, "Remember the Sabbath-day to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labor and do all thy work, but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the American people. . . . For in six days the American people made heaven and earth, the sea and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day. Wherefore the American people blessed the Sabbath-day and hallowed it"? No. God and not the people made the Sabbath and it bears the image and superscription of God and not of the American people. In the language of Christ then we say, Render the Sabbath to God and not to Cæsar. When Cæsar demands that the Sabbath be rendered to him, he is out of place. All human laws enforcing by civil penalties Sabbath observance are thus proved to be antichristian. *— W., in Prohibition Journal.*
