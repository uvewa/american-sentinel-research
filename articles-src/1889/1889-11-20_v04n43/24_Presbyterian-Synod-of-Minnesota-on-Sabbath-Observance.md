The Presbyterian Synod of Minnesota, at its recent meeting in Minneapolis, adopted the following report of the committee on better Sabbath observance:—

> "1. That the synod of Minnesota gives the American Sabbath Union, national, State, district, and local, most hearty indorsement and support.

> "2. That our pastors, stated supplies, and elders representing vacant churches, be requested to urge the immediate organization of local unions in their respective communities, and that they hold themselves in readiness to superintend the local interests of Sabbath reform, including the formation of a citizens' committee on Sabbath closing, and the circulating of petitions requesting the enactment and enforcement of Sunday-Rest laws.
> "3. That the members of our churches be urged to co-operate in all proper measures for the furtherance of the cause of Sabbath observance, and that they be particularly urged to give official indorsement to petitions presented by pastors, stated supplies, or elders."

This shows the drift of sentiment among the majority of popular religionists; it is not toward more consistent living on their own part, but toward laws compelling those who are out of the church to observe church institutions.
