The *Christian Nation* says:—

> "One of the greatest hindrances in the way of National Reform is the false idea of civil government— the theory so largely carried into practice in all national affairs, that civil government is a mere secular institution."

Yes, that is true. That is the theory of the American Constitution. It is the American theory, and being so it is indeed a great hindrance to National Reform. If this government had been started with a constitution pledging the government to things of another world, and to the affairs of men's souls instead of their bodies, then it would never have been any hindrance in the way of the National Reform scheme of government. But then it would not have been a civil government at all. It would have been a religious government, and only a part of the machinery of the church. But, fortunately for the people, our fathers considered that the church ought to be able to do its own work without the aid of governmental power, and that the government could better do its legitimate work without any of the meddling interference of the church managers. Therefore they forbade the National Legislature to have anything to do with religion, or another world, or with men's souls. And this is the great hindrance to National Reform! Yes, that is true, and therefore, nothing could more clearly show that the National Reform movement is essentially un-American and subversive of the liberties guaranteed in the United States Constitution. And every American and every man in America who loves American principles ought to be uncompromisingly opposed to it, as the American Sentinel is.
