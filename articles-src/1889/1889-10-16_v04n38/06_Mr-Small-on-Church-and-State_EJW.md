# Mr. Small on Church and State.

Under the heading, "No Steps Backward," the *Voice,* in its issue of August 8, had the following:—

In a recent issue of *The Voice,* we called attention to some very foolish things uttered by the American Sentinel, a paper published at Oakland, Cal., which devotes itself to getting up religious bugaboos. It made the childish statement that "work done for party Prohibition is work done to promote the union of Church and State, and to bind the citizens of the United States in a worse slavery than was ever suffered by the negroes;" and then, in reply to our article showing just where the Prohibition party stood, it said:—

> *"The Voice* says it has 'never heard of a prominent Prohibitionist who favored the union of Church and State.' Now Mr. Sam. Small is a prominent Prohibitionist—one of the most prominent of Prohibitionists in fact. He was secretary of the National Prohibition Convention of 1888, and he publicly declared this in Kansas City in January of that year:—

> "'I want to see the day come when the church shall be the arbiter of all legislation, State, national, and municipal; when the great churches of the country can come together harmoniously and issue their edict, and the legislative powers will respect it and enact it into laws.'
> "If that would not be a union of Church and State, will *The Voice* please tell us what would be? If that would not be a union of Church and State, then there never has been and never can be any such thing as a union of Church and State. Such a thing as that, therefore, being a union of Church and State, and Mr. Sam. Small being a prominent Prohibitionist, it is proved that there is at least one prominent Prohibitionist who favors a union of Church and State."
Thinking Mr. Small the most competent person to speak for Mr. Small, we inclosed the article to him and asked him to state his opinions on the union of Church and State, which he does as follows:—

> *"To The Voice*—The representation of the American Sentinel that I favor a union of Church and State is wholly an invention of the enemy. The extract he quotes from a partial report of a sermon I preached in Kansas City in January, 1888, is sufficiently correct to mislead; not exact enough, however, to convey the thought which I clearly expressed and which, at the time, secured the approval of an audience of thousands, the large majority of which was not made up of 'third party' prohibitionists. If the American Sentinel desires to do me and the Prohibition party justice, I can repeat my thoughts as clearly now as I did on the occasion in question.

> "The quotation from my sermon should read as follows:—
> "'I want to see the day come in the history of our country when the voice of the church of Christ will be heard and respected upon all vital, moral issues. I shall ever hope for and patiently expect the day when legislation, State, national, and municipal, will be projected in harmony with the eternal principle of justice and righteousness, revealed by Christ and proclaimed by his church. Happy will be the day when "righteousness exalts the nation," when sin is no longer the reproach of our people; when the harmonious judgment of the people of God in America upon the issues of temperance, purity, and uprightness shall be received with respect and enacted into laws; when this people, who owe so much to the divine favor, will have no more fellowship with the "throne of iniquity," "which frameth mischief by a law," and that continually!'
> "I hold that the above expressions are in perfect harmony with the principles of the National Prohibition party, as expressed in its preamble and platform. There is in them no warrant for any sane man to pronounce me an advocate of the 'union of Church and State.' The charge is a device of desperation to compass an argument against the Prohibition party. At the same time it is a fraud upon the readers of the American Sentinel, or a queer confession of the idiocy of its constituency.
"Yours truly, Sam. W. Small."

If any person's superstitious fears have been wrought upon by stories of the spooks of the Dark Ages, he may rest assured that the Prohibition party isn't going to revive any of them. The wheels of civilization don't turn backward.

The extract referred to was published in the Sentinel a long time ago. It was taken from a religious paper, one that could have no interest in misquoting Mr. Small, therefore we were warranted in supposing that it was correct. The Sentinel has never knowingly misrepresented a single person.

But in this case we are happy to learn from Mr. Small's own version that the Sentinel did not do him any injustice. While he did not use the exact words that were attributed to him in the report which the Sentinel quoted, he did use language which conveys all that we drew from what we supposed were the exact words. Said he, "I want to see the day come in the history of our country when the voice of the church of Christ will be heard and respected upon all vital moral issues." Mr. Small will not deny that his idea was that the voice of the church should be heard and respected not simply by men as individuals, but by men as grouped together in political parties, and by men as statesmen, judges, etc. Now we say that when that time does come, we shall have a union of Church and State as surely as such a thing ever existed. It will simply be the church dictating, and we say the church has no right to be heard and respected by political parties as such. In the darkest of the Dark Ages, when Church and State union was at its height, the case was simply that the voice of the church was heard and respected [299] by the State. The church dictated the policy of the State.

Bishop Vincent says most emphatically that the church makes a great mistake when it seeks to secure worldly position and to influence temporal power. Said he, "All the church wants is spiritual power, and the only influence it has any right to have is the influence it may have with individuals as individuals." Mr. Small is doubtless perfectly sincere and honest in his disavowal of any union of Church and State. It would seem that he simply wants the church to assume its rightful prerogative. That is all that Cardinal Woolsey or Pope Hildebrand ever desired. The great trouble with them was that they were mistaken in regard to the church's rightful position. That is the trouble with Mr. Small. We see no reason, after a careful reading of Mr. Small's own statement of his position in his sermon, to withdraw our statement that he is really in favor of a union of Church and State.

And this charge is no device of desperation to compass an argument against the Prohibition party. The Sentinel has no fight with the Prohibition party upon its prohibition principles. We have to do simply with those Prohibitionists who, like Mr. Small, would use the Prohibition party as a religious machine. We are thankful to know that there are many in the party who have no sympathy with any such movement.

As to Mr. Small's insinuation against the readers of the American Sentinel, we have only to say that they number many thousands in every part of the United States, consisting chiefly of professional men, doctors, lawyers, judges, members of State Legislatures, ministers of the gospel, as well as laboring men; and Mr. Small will not enhance his own popularity by wholesale charges of idiocy against our country's best citizens.

As to the statement of the *Voice,* that the American Sentinel spends its time in getting up religious bugaboos, we will only say that there is no need for us to work in that line so long as the *Voice,* while professedly working for prohibition, actually makes that secondary to religious legislation. The Sentinel lays no claim to being an inventor; it simply exposes the inventions of others.E. J. W.
