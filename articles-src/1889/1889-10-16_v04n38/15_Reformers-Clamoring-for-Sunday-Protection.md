The self-styled reformers are clamoring for a national law protecting Sunday, but the bill they present contradicts their pretensions, for it by no means provides for protection but *enforcement. *What a curious thing it would be for a streetcar company, for instance, to vigorously call on the municipal authorities to protect their cars from riotous mobs and then to present a bill compelling those people to ride on that line! There is just as much sense to it.—*Moral and Scientific Companion.*
