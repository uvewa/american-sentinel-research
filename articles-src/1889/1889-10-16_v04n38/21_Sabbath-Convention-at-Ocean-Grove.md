In the *Christian Statesman,* August 22, there is a report of a Sabbath convention at Ocean Grove held by the New Jersey Sabbath Union, which is an auxiliary of the American Sabbath Union. Rev. J. H. Knowles, general secretary of the American Sabbath Union, was chairman of the convention. Representatives were present from the Philadelphia Sabbath Association, and the King's and the Queen's County Sabbath Observance Societies of New York, and the Law and Order Leagues of Trenton, and Newark, New Jersey. Rev. Dr. Kynett, of Philadelphia, was one of the speakers, and said:—

> "The American Sabbath is a religious institution. It is a day of rest, but not of recreation. The American Christian Sabbath lays the obligation on the conscience, as it is a day of religious rest."

And yet they will call legislation in behalf of that institution *civil* legislation! The enforcement of the observance of such an institution as that, they call the observance only of the *civil *Sunday. They may call it all these things, and whatever else they please, but their calling it so will not make it so. The fact is that the Sunday institution is ecclesiastical only, and any legislation looking to its observance is only ecclesiastical legislation, and the enforcement of an ecclesiastical institution. And it is wicked.
