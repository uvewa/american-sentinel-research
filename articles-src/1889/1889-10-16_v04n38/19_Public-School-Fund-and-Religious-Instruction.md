Here is a proposition which we submit to the candid consideration of all men, upon the question of religious instruction or the use of the Bible in the public schools: The public school fund is drawn from the whole people, without discrimination or preference, and with no reference whatever to any question as to either religion or the Bible. Therefore the same fund should be used and applied for the benefit of the whole people *as it is raised,* without discrimination or preference. As the money is raised without reference to those who believe in the Bible or religious instruction, so it should be expended and used. If the money when raised is to be applied according to the dictation and according to the religious wishes of those who believe in the Bible and religious instruction, then justice demands that the money shall be raised by taxation only upon those persons. The conclusion is that justice will never allow religious exercises or religious instruction in the public schools.
