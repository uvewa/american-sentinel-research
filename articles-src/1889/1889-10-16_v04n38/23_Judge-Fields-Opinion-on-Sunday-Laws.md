In the Sunday campaign that has of late been carried on in California, Judge Stephen J. Field's opinion of 1859 has been made to do duty for all that its indorsers think it is worth. If it were to be made to do duty for only what it is worth, it would not amount to much; but when for what its indorsers *think* it is worth then it amounts to a good deal. One statement from it was used in the Los Angeles Sunday Convention by a lawyer to the effect that the object of Sunday laws "is not to protect those who can rest at their pleasure, but to afford rest to those who need it and who from the conditions of society could not otherwise obtain it."

No Sunday law that ever was made was enacted with any such object. The only object that has ever been in the enactment of Sunday laws is religious. The very law which Judge Field was discussing in this opinion had respect to religion as such, for it distinctly named "the Christian Sabbath." The very law in support of which this opinion is quoted distinctly declares its object to be to protect the Lord's day as a day of rest and *religious* worship. And the petition which they would support by the opinion not only asks for legislation in behalf of religion but for the enforced *"religious* observance" of a day. The object of Sunday laws never has been to protect anybody, but in almost every case to compel everybody. It never has been to protect anybody's rest, but to compel everybody to rest. It never has been to protect the religious observances of the people, but to compel people who are not religious to conform to the religious opinions of those who profess to be religious.
