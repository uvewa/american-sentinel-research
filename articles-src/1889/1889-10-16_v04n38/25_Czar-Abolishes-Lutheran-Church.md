The czar of all the Russias has become displeased with the Lutheran Church and has issued a ukase abolishing it throughout his dominions. All his imperial majesty lias to do with the greatest institutions is to forbid their existence and they are abolished. Churches are amenable to royal displeasure, and Russia cannot even have a religion if the czar feels hostile to it. While the Greek Church is the popular religion of Russia the Lutherans are the great body of Christians throughout Northern Europe, as that church is recognized in Germany and all the Scandinavian countries. The Lutherans form the most consistent body of Christians in all the Old World countries, and yet the czar abolishes them as easily as one could say "Jack Robinson." It is to be hoped that his royal highness will go a little slow in his despotic rulings, or he may abolish things divine and otherwise. He might try his hand on the evil one and see if he can get away with him. If Satan is abolished in Russia the Muscovites can get along comfortably without the churches. As there are only three millions of Lutherans in Russia, the czar can abolish them if the Nihilists don't succeed first in abolishing the czar.— *Oregonian.* [305]
