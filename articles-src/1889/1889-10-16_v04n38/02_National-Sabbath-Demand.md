There is a constant demand by a certain class of the American community for what they call a "National Sabbath," and they base their demand on the idea that the laboring man needs one day of rest in seven. The fact that the laboring man is accorded his "day of rest" is sufficient proof that the Sabbatarian is demanding a national day of rest for a special purpose. This purpose, as the outside observer understands the question, is to compel the unbeliever to enter, on one day of the week, some place of worship in which he does not believe. The attempt to set apart any one day, by law, as a day of rest or religious observance, will not be tolerated in a country comprising so many citizens of differing opinions, and the attempt to force such a law upon the people is not only absurd but savoring of bigotry. The Sabbath of the Jew and the Sabbath of the Seventh-day Adventist is as binding a religious conviction as is the Sabbath of the Christian, and it would be utterly foolish to attempt to force every man to observe the latter day even as a day of rest. When the laboring man wants his day of rest he will demand it, and when he demands it he will get it.— *Oakland Morning Times, Sept. 20.*
