Rev. I. N. Hays, D. D., in *Christian Statesman *of May 9, 1889, says, according to the high decree of heaven the church and the commonwealth are co-ordinate departments of society, yoked together for the lifting up of our fallen humanity to a higher level and a grander destiny, and it is only when religion breathes her benediction on the State and the State throws her protecting arms around the church, that each can best fulfill its appointed mission. And yet the National Reformers are opposed (?) to a union of Church and State!—W., *in Prohibition Journal.*
