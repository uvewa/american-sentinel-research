It is urged by the advocates of Sunday legislation that such laws are necessary to prevent the day from being wholly devoured by greed. But that this is not true is shown by facts stated by Rev. W. F. Crafts, in his book, "The Sabbath for Man," page 53. Referring to Sunday, he says:—

> "The Sabbath is now marked in the French Code only by the unimportant by-laws that make it a *dies non* in judicial proceedings, and by a few other very indirect recognitions; but while the Sabbath laws have diminished in the last fifteen years, Sunday trade has also diminished. The earliest note of this change that we find is in the New York *Times* of June 8, 1869, and is as follows: 'A very profound and wonderful reform has just been begun in Paris. The principal shops, including those of nearly all linen drapers, hosiers, silk mercers, and venders of ready-made apparel, will henceforth close on Sundays. The merchants have taken this step of their own accord, and the employes appeal to the goodwill of the public to aid them in making the measure general.'"

If Sunday rest can become more general in France without a Sunday law, why can it not be maintained in this country without such a law?
