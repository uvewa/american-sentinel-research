The "Sunday-rest civil Sabbath" by legal compulsion *a la* old Blue Laws of Connecticut enacted about 1650, is quite a scheme, but the hard-worked young men of San Diego seem to take their Sunday rests in a very active way out at Recreation Park. Some of their neighbors object, but we have never yet known any of the base-ball boys object to their opponents either going to church or to bed for rest on Sunday. Let the boys shut out gambling, intoxicants, unbecoming language, and undue noises, from their park; and let the church folks shut out gambling fairs, intoxicating-wine sacraments, "dress parades," from their sanctuaries; and shut out from their hearts, especially, that uncharitableness that cannot allow others what they claim for themselves,—the right to do as they please so long as they commit no offense against the laws of the land; and both parties will be the better for it.—*Silver Gate, September 14.*
