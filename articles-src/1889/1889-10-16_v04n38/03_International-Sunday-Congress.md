The agitation in favor of compulsory Sunday keeping is by no means confined to this country, but is becoming worldwide. Even in Hongkong, China, in Japan, and India, something has been done to educate public sentiment up to the point of demanding general Sunday rest. An international Congress on the subject has just been held in Paris. M. Leon Say, a French senator, is president of this Congress, and delegates were present from all the countries of continental Europe, and from England and America. Letters were read from President Harrison and Mr. Gladstone. The following extract from a recent dispatch concerning the Congress is significant:—

> "The hygienic and social aspects of the Sabbath alone are considered at this Congress, the religious view of the day not entering at present into the discussions, however strongly they may influence many, and indeed most, of the delegates."

It is safe to say that it is the religious aspect of the question which forms the real basis of the movement, but as public sentiment everywhere is against legislation on religious questions, this motive is disguised, and Sunday laws are demanded by ecclesiastics (and the demand comes from few others) for so-called Sabbath legislation on "hygienic" and "sanitary" grounds.
