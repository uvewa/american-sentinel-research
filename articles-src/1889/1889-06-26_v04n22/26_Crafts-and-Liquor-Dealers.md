Rev. W. F. Crafts, in criticising Christians who oppose the National Reform movement, says: "It is a strange thing that men professing the name of Christ can see themselves mixing in with liquor dealers." But he is willing to unite with the Catholics, as a body, and everyone knows that saloon keeping and liquor selling generally is a common business among the adherents of that church. When his party counted Cardinal Gibbons's name as good for 7,200,000 Catholics, they knew very well that thousands upon thousands in that combination were liquor dealers. And when the American Sabbath Union was formed, Mr. Crafts being an active leader in the association, it was claimed to be a movement in which "Christians and infidels, saints and sinners" could unite for the promotion of Sabbath reform.
