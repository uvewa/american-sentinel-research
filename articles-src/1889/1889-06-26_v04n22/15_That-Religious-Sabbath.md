# That Religious Sabbath.

It is officially announced that “Rev. Wilbur F. Crafts, field secretary of the American Sabbath Union, is planning to visit every State and Territory (except some of those recently visited) before the end of the year, to promote the observance of both the religious and the civil Sabbath, by sermons, lectures, and especially by organizing State and county and city Sabbath associations, or preparing the way for such organizations.”

This should put an end to the oft-repeated declaration of the Reformers that all they want is a *civil* Sabbath. Here is the open official announcement that the field secretary will visit all parts of the country to “promote the observance” of the *religious* Sabbath also. It also appears that they have not given up the idea of *promoting *their ideal Sabbath. When the Sunday-Rest bill was first introduced, it was a bill to “promote” the observance of the first day of the week as a day of religious worship; but the promoters had that word changed to “protect,” for the purpose of blinding those who might think that to promote would imply aggressive action. The official announcement proves what we said at the time, that the intent of the measure, and its effect if passed, would not be mitigated in the least by that verbal change. [175-176]

Note.—No papers are sent by the publishers of the American Sentinel to people who have not subscribed for it. If the Sentinel comes to one who has not subscribed for it, he may know that it is sent him by some friend, and that he will not be called upon by the publishers to pay for the same.

Important matter pertaining to the Kings County (N. Y.) Sabbath Association, and also to the Missouri Sabbath Observance Convention, is unavoidably crowded out of this issue. Further reference to the proceedings of these bodies will appear in succeeding numbers.

The Kings County Sunday Association, New York, says: “From the ranks of the idlers the criminal classes are recruited.” This is true; it cannot be disputed for a moment; but that association exists for the sole purpose of securing the enactment of laws enforcing idleness regularly one whole day out of every week in the year. Now put this and that together: The Sunday Association proposes by law to enforce idleness. “From the ranks of the idlers the criminal classes are recruited.” Therefore, the Sunday Association multiplies recruits for the criminal classes.

Let them escape the logic if they can.

The persistence of the advocates of a religious amendment to the Constitution is manifested in the fact that the field secretary of the National Reform Association expects to visit every State and Territory before the end of the year. His object in making this tour is to organize State, county, and city Sunday associations, and thus prepare the public mind for a vigorous appeal to Congress in behalf of a National Sunday law. Will the opponents of such legislation take steps to offset his nefarious work? or will they let their liberties *go* by default? If you wish to be fortified against his inconsistent fulminations, subscribe for the American Sentinel, which is strictly devoted to the defense of our American institutions, and the work of exposing the vagaries of National Reform.

In one of the late issues of the *Christian Cynosure,* of Chicago, it refers to the American Sentinel as “a small paper whose special object is to antagonize the National Reform Assocition and every effort to secure the sanctity of the Sabbath-day.”

To the first part of this statement we yield an unqualified assent. Inasmuch as the National Reform Association is seeking to debase religion by bringing it down on a level with common politics, we do antagonize it. We are glad the *Cynosure* at last begins to recognize the fact. If such an unholy alliance is to be formed, and if the so- called church of God is determined to prostitute herself to the service of the world in return for the paltry power she hopes to receive thereby, we want it distinctly understood that she can find no encouragement to such a course in the columns of the American Sentinel. Not that we are opposed to religion; far from it; our position is from a religious standpoint, but because we know from the past workings of such experiments that the inevitable result is always detrimental to the best interests of both Church and State. Religion and politics never yet made a successful mixture, and it is because we desire to see this glorious republic continue its administration under the pure principles of true liberty and justice to all its citizens that we antagonize National Reform. And as long as the National Reform Association is opposed to these principles, as the published sentiments of its leaders show it to be, just so long we shall endeavor to antagonize it.

And if by the efforts “to secure the sanctity of the Sabbath-day,” the *Cynosure* means the wicked scheme of the National Reformers to coerce the consciences of men and compel them by power of civil law to regard Sunday as a sacred institution, and to refrain from labor on that day whether they believe in it or not, then we want to say that it is the object of the American Sentinel to antagonize just such work as that. And our antagonism would be just as radical if such an effort were made by any other body, or concerning any other day. We are opposed to all such work, because it is wrong, and only wrong, first, last, and all the time.

Rev. W. F. Crafts, in criticising Christians who oppose the National Reform movement, says: “It is a strange thing that men professing the name of Christ can see themselves mixing in with liquor dealers.” But he is willing to unite with the Catholics, as a body, and everyone knows that saloon keeping and liquor selling generally is a common business among the adherents of that church. When his party counted Cardinal Gibbons’s name as good for 7,200,000 Catholics, they knew very well that thousands upon thousands in that combination were liquor dealers. And when the American Sabbath Union was formed, Mr. Crafts being an active leader in the association, it was claimed to be a movement in which “Christians and infidels, saints and sinners” could unite for the promotion of Sabbath reform.

The tender, loving spirit which actuates some of our National Reform friends is well exemplified in the following from *Fire and Hammer,* a so-called religious paper published in Los Angeles, this State:—

> “We have received a circular from the American Sentinel Publishing Company, Oakland, Cal., wishing us to use our influence to break down the Christian Sabbath, and to prevent the passage of the national law against secular work, and turning our Christian Sabbath into the infidel continental Sabbath of France, with no definite time set apart for the learning about God or morals. Our private opinion of the Sentinel and its sentiments is, that it is one of the most damnable sheets ever published. . . .

> “We take notice of your circular, Mr. Sentinel, by these few well-considered-for-years sentiments; and hereby set our hand and seal, that we consider your form of infidelity to be one of the worst, if not the worst, that the devil has hatched out in sulphurdom for centuries. There is not an infidel or saloon keeper in the land but hugs your delusion of devils as Satan will you except you repent.”
We are sorry to soil the columns of the American Sentinel with language of this kind, but it seems necessary in order to give our readers a proper idea of the true spirit of National Reform. “Michael the Archangel, when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of Moses, durst not bring against him a railing accusation, but said, The Lord rebuke thee;” but this professed Christian editor does not stop short of profanity in the railing accusation which he brings against us, simply because we insist that the State has no right to pass laws requiring the observance of a religious institution.

We do not know what the *Fire and Hammer *means by saying that “it has received a circular from the American Sentinel Publishing Company.” In the first place, there is no such publishing company; and in the second place, no such circular as described has ever been sent out by anyone connected with this office, nor by anyone else to our knowledge. We suppose that the venom of the editor has got the better of his desire, if he has any, to tell the truth. It matters not to us what his private opinion is of the Sentinel nor of its sentiments. Nor are we to blame if there are saloon keepers in the land with a sufficient sense of justice to appreciate the arguments which we use. We have certainly never said anything in the Sentinel that we do not believe is perfectly consistent with true Christianity, and here we shall continue to stand; we cannot do otherwise.

The theological attainments of Mr. Elliott F. Shepard, president of the American Sunday-law Union, are not by any means limited to the Sunday question. It takes in such profound questions as the celebration of Easter, the reasons for it, the meaning of it, etc. For instance, his paper of April 20, in an editorial on Easter Sunday, says:—

> “What is the particular event which Easter Sunday is supposed to commemorate? It is this—nothing more, nothing less—that on this particular day, one thousand eight hundred and eighty-nine years ago, Jesus Christ, after having been crucified and having lain in the grave for three days, rose triumphant from the dead.”

One thousand eight hundred and eighty-nine years ago! Hardly. Jesus Christ was only about four years old at that time. He was not crucified when he was four years old, and did not have a chance to rise from the dead 1889 years ago.

The sum of this whole matter is this—”nothing more, nothing less,”—either Mr. Shepard had better take to studying his Bible, or else quit writing or speaking on any Bible subject.
