The Kings County Sunday Association, New York, says: "From the ranks of the idlers the criminal classes are recruited." This is true; it cannot be disputed for a moment; but that association exists for the sole purpose of securing the enactment of laws enforcing idleness regularly one whole day out of every week in the year. Now put this and that together: The Sunday Association proposes by law to enforce idleness. "From the ranks of the idlers the criminal classes are recruited." Therefore, the Sunday Association multiplies recruits for the criminal classes.

Let them escape the logic if they can.
