In one of the late issues of the *Christian Cynosure,* of Chicago, it refers to the American Sentinel as "a small paper whose special object is to antagonize the National Reform Association and every effort to secure the sanctity of the Sabbath-day."

To the first part of this statement we yield an unqualified assent. Inasmuch as the National Reform Association is seeking to debase religion by bringing it down on a level with common politics, we do antagonize it. We are glad the *Cynosure* at last begins to recognize the fact. If such an unholy alliance is to be formed, and if the so- called church of God is determined to prostitute herself to the service of the world in return for the paltry power she hopes to receive thereby, we want it distinctly understood that she can find no encouragement to such a course in the columns of the American Sentinel. Not that we are opposed to religion; far from it; our position is from a religious standpoint, but because we know from the past workings of such experiments that the inevitable result is always detrimental to the best interests of both Church and State. Religion and politics never yet made a successful mixture, and it is because we desire to see this glorious republic continue its administration under the pure principles of true liberty and justice to all its citizens that we antagonize National Reform. And as long as the National Reform Association is opposed to these principles, as the published sentiments of its leaders show it to be, just so long we shall endeavor to antagonize it.

And if by the efforts "to secure the sanctity of the Sabbath-day," the *Cynosure* means the wicked scheme of the National Reformers to coerce the consciences of men and compel them by power of civil law to regard Sunday as a sacred institution, and to refrain from labor on that day whether they believe in it or not, then we want to say that it is the object of the American Sentinel to antagonize just such work as that. And our antagonism would be just as radical if such an effort were made by any other body, or concerning any other day. We are opposed to all such work, because it is wrong, and only wrong, first, last, and all the time.
