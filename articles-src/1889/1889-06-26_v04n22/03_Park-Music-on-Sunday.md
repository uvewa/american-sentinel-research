Another despairing cry that arose from the Kings County, N. Y., Sunday Association was as follows:—

> "By the conjoint efforts of the Common Council and Park Commissioners, we are advised that music will be provided in Prospect Park on Sunday afternoons during June, July, and August; perhaps they will be dubbed sacred concerts, to make them more palatable. . . . That if established here, they will be the means of depopulating the churches and Sunday- schools, there can be no doubt."

Well, well, well! Can it be possible that the churches and Sunday-schools are held together by so frail a tenure, and rest upon so capricious a basis, that they will be depopulated by music Sunday afternoon in the parks?—It must be so; else this great association would not in public convention have confessed it to be so. But what a confession!
