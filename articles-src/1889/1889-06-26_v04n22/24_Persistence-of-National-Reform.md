The persistence of the advocates of a religious amendment to the Constitution is manifested in the fact that the field secretary of the National Reform Association expects to visit every State and Territory before the end of the year. His object in making this tour is to organize State, county, and city Sunday associations, and thus prepare the public mind for a vigorous appeal to Congress in behalf of a National Sunday law. Will the opponents of such legislation take steps to offset his nefarious work? or will they let their liberties *go* by default? If you wish to be fortified against his inconsistent fulminations, subscribe for the American Sentinel, which is strictly devoted to the defense of our American institutions, and the work of exposing the vagaries of National Reform.
