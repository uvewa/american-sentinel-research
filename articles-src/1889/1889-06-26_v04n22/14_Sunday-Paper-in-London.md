# Sunday Paper in London.

The appearance of the London edition of the New York *Herald,* one issue of which is published on Sunday morning, calls forth a letter from a correspondent of the London *Times* vigorously protesting against the innovation, and appealing to the leaders of English journalism to resolutely set their faces against it. The cause assigned for this protest is that all those connected with papers which issue an edition on Sunday will be compelled to work on that day, and thus be deprived of observing it as a day of rest.

Evidently the *Times* correspondent doesn’t know anything about the work of a daily newspaper office, for such work is done during the day and night before the date of issue. The work of the Sunday morning paper is always done on Saturday and Saturday night, and the employes have an opportunity to rest on Sunday. On the other hand, those who work on a Monday morning paper must necessarily work on Sunday. The London papers all issue a Monday morning edition, the work for which is all done on Sunday. So the innocent correspondent of the *Times* need not hope that the “leaders of English journalism will resolutely set their faces” against a Sunday morning paper. He had better begin his missionary work to prevent the desecration of Sunday with the English journals.—*San Diego Union and Daily Bee, May 15, 1889.*
