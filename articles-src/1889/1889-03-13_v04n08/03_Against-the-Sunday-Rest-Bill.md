# Against the Sunday-Rest Bill.

The San Francisco *Examiner* of February 22 contained the following dispatch sent from Washington the day before:—

> “In the House of Representatives, Representative O’Donnell, presented to-day an enormous petition against the Sunday-Rest bill, which bears the signatures of 230,000 Seventh-day Adventists, in all parts of the country.”

That humble body known as Seventh-day Adventists must wonder how it has grown in one year from 25,000 to 230,000; for the last Year Book of that denomination gave its membership [59] at 25,841 in the United States. The *Examiner *reporter has given them more than 200,000 members that do not belong to them.

But the *Examiner* is not entirely wrong, for a great number of petitions against the Sunday-Rest bill have been presented to Congress. Over 250,- 000 signatures have been secured; and the fact that there are not more than one-tenth of that number of Seventh-day Adventists in the United States, shows that the opposition to Sunday laws is not sectarian. It shows that there are many people in this country who believe in civil and religious liberty.

Another thing should be remembered in this connection, and that is, that none of the signatures to the petitions are by proxy, nor are they what are known among Sunday-law advocates as “representative signatures.” Every signature on those petitions represents an individual. More than this, every signature indicates that some adult person has with his own hand signed the remonstrance.

Of the more than 250,000 signatures that have been obtained, more than 36,000 have been obtained in California. We know one man who has secured the signatures of more than 1,300 *voters* in a single California town of about 7,000 inhabitants. It may be added that there are not fifty Seventh-day Adventists in that town, counting women and children.

But there are more than 250,000 adults who are opposed to the Sunday-Rest bill. In many places no effort whatever has been made to secure signatures to the petition against it, and nothing whatever was done until within the last three months.* The records show that nothing like this number of individual signatures has been secured for the petitions in favor of the bill.
