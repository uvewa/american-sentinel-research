# What Does It Mean?

What means the introduction of a Sunday bill and a resolution for a change of the Constitution by Senator Blair, so as to secure certain religious observances, and the first and second reading of that bill in the Senate without a dissenting vote?

What means the petition favoring the passage of the bill circulated in our streets and the presentation of the names of 5,000,000 petitioners by the National Reform Association, the Evangelical Alliance, and the W. C. T. U., for the enactment of those laws?

What means the invitation to the Catholic Church, by the National Reform League, to cooperate in these measures?

What means the command of Pope Leo XIII., that all Catholics should do all in their power to cause the constitutions of States and legislation to be modeled on the principle of the true church?

What means Cardinal Gibbons, a prominent Catholic, being taken as an exponent of 7,200,000 Catholics in favor of the proposed measures?

Does it not mean a gigantic conspiracy to revolutionize our Government, and in its stead to establish a theocracy, or ecclesiastical Government?—*Alexandria (Minn.), Post.*
