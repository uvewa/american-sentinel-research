# Sunday Legislation in Illinois.

A bill was introduced in the House of the Illinois Legislature January 25, which is another evidence of the drift toward enforcing religious beliefs by civil law. Notwithstanding the fact that the constitution of Illinois provides for the "free exercise and enjoyment of religious professions and worship, without discrimination," these apostles of church and State want to compel, contrary to the supreme law of the State, the observance of a religious institution. Following are the first two sections of the bill:—

> "Section 1. *Be it enacted by the people of the State of Illinois, represented in the General* *Assembly, *That whoever shall keep open on Sunday any shop, store, factory, or other public place, for the manufacture, or preparation, or packing, or sale, or other disposition of any goods, wares, or merchandise, except as in this act expressly provided, shall be deemed guilty of a high misdemeanor, and upon conviction thereof shall be fined in a sum not less than fifty, nor more than five hundred dollars, for each offense, and shall be committed to the common jail, till the fines and costs are paid.

> "Section 2. Whoever shall procure, or permit to be employed in any secular business on Sunday in any of the places mentioned in section 1 of this act, any clerk, workman, or other person, except as in this act expressly permitted, shall be deemed guilty of a like misdemeanor, and shall suffer the like penalty as is prescribed in the foregoing section."

These sections prohibit only a certain class of labor. However, the mover of the bill says privately that it does not cover all they want. But if they make the bill too sweeping on the start, they fear it will be defeated; and he thinks that half a loaf is better than no bread. This will prove a stepping-stone toward getting stronger legislation in the future in favor of Sunday. True to the watchword of Sunday-law advocates, the standard of the ideal Puritan Sunday is erected in the background, and they try to lead us on cautiously, step by step, till we shall be hemmed in on all sides, and the only thing allowable on Sunday will be to go to church to listen to the lengthy disquisition of some prosy divine. But even as an initiatory measure, on the class the bill touches, it imposes a fine that would soon use up a small fortune. The author of the bill frankly stated to me that it was intended to protect the religious interests of Sunday. It seems strange to hear men talk of imposing such fines if we refuse to observe in sacred style a dogma of disputed origin in the Christian church. Think of it! from fifty to five hundred dollars! Would it not be well before making such laws in favor of what lie thinks to be the Christian religion, to examine the records to see if the Author of the Christian religion would be in harmony with such action?

According to these sections of the bill, the offender "shall be deemed guilty of *high* misdemeanor." The criminal code of the Illinois statutes divides offenses into "felonies," "misdemeanors," and "infamous crimes," but I do not find anything referring "to *high* misdemeanor." In view of the fact that this is only a "stepping-stone" to the legislation they want in favor of Sunday, I suppose it was deemed unwise to call a violation of this act either "felony" or "infamous crimes." And yet the simple term of "misdemeanor" in the statutes is not strong enough, so the term "high misdemeanor" must be used. The "Library of Universal Knowledge" defines "h*igh* misdemeanor" as "an offense short of, but closely bordering on, treason." And in the Articles of Confederation between the original thirteen States (Art. 4) we have the expression, "If any person guilty of or charged with treason, felony, or other high misdemeanor," etc., thus associating "high misdemeanor" with treason and felony. Fellow-citizens, are we ready to be classed with those guilty of the infamous crime of *treason* just because we choose to dissent from the idea of observing a religious institution, no matter whether we are conscientious about it or not? God does not in the Christian dispensation delegate to anyone the authority to inflict temporal punishment on the violators of his law. Would it not be well for these would-be defenders of the Christian religion to be more moderate in their proposed enactments? The third section is as follows:—

> "Section 3. This act shall not apply to the printing or circulation of newspapers, nor to the sale of medicine, nor to the delivery of milk, nor to the running of railroad or street-cars, or other means for the necessary transportation of the people for all lawful purposes, nor to the circulation of proper books, tracts, or papers, nor to any other work of necessity or charity. In case of any question whether any particular work be a work of necessity or charity, any person may apply to any court having equity jurisdiction, to enjoin the same, and upon such application the question aforesaid shall be determined."

This section very graciously exempts newspaper men, druggists, milkmen, and railroad and street-cars, because, as the father of the bill says, they do not care to have the opposition of these industries at present. After they get the bill passed, they will be able to use it as a lever to get stricter legislation, and stop everything on Sunday. But the worst feature of this section is the loose way in which it leaves works of "necessity or charity." The bill says that "in case of any question whether any particular work be a work of necessity or charity, any person may apply to any court having equity jurisdiction, to enjoin the same, and upon such application the question aforesaid shall be determined." We are here informed that there really are works of necessity and charity. But the only way to find out "in case of any question whether any particular work be a work of necessity or charity" is to go ahead, do the work, and be subject to the caprice of *any person* who wishes to "apply to any court having equity jurisdiction, to enjoin the same," and by a suit at law have the matter determined. Our statutes should be so framed that we may know what is lawful and what is not, without first having to do some deed and be "enjoined," and have a lawsuit in order to ascertain what the law is. Such a law would be expected from a tyrant, but is not becoming to a free people. An article in the special edition of the October Sentinel, entitled, "The Savor of Tyranny," is to the point here, and we request all our readers who have not a copy of the paper to send and get it. The article is well worth reading and rereading. The bill continues:— [62]

> "Section 4. In addition to the penalties in this act provided, the several remedies hereinafter specified may be had, for any offense described in this act. A fine not exceeding $200 may be recovered in a common suit, before a justice of the peace or police magistrate commenced by summons in the name of the people of this State, on the relation of any person who may make complaint. Each and every of the offenses described in this act is hereby declared to be a nuisance, and it shall be the duty of all courts of equity in this State upon the proper application, to enjoin and prohibit the same, and no bond shall be required of the complainant in such a case. A bill, or petition for injunction, may be filed, by any person aggrieved, either in his own name, or in the name of the people on his relation."

This section endeavors to provide "remedies." But instead of remedies it furnishes the most unobstructed liberty to those who may desire to show their religious zeal by harassing those who may not desire to observe Sunday so strictly as their Puritan neighbors. Chapter 69, paragraph 9, of the Illinois statutes, under the caption of "Injunctions," reads: "In all other cases [except injunctions to enjoin a judgment], before an injunction shall issue, the complainant shall give bond in such penalty, and upon such condition and with such security as may be required by the court, judge, or master granting or ordering the injunction, *provided* bond need not be required when, for good cause shown, the court, judge, or master is of opinion that the injunction ought to be granted without bond."

This provides that in case a person has an injunction served on him or is enjoined to cease doing anything, the person so enjoining shall be required to give bonds to cover the damage done the defendant, in case the injunction proves to be unjust. For instance: A man is building a house, and his neighbor concludes that when the structure is up it will prove a damage to him. So he has an injunction issued to have the building stopped. This will necessitate the stoppage of all the hands on the building, and everything in connection with its erection must cease. Anyone can see that this would involve a big expense to the builder. To cover the damage thus accrued, in case the injunction proves to be unjust, the law requires that the complainant shall give bonds.

If such bonds were not required, we should be exposed to the caprice and malice of any unprincipled person who might, to annoy us, keep asking a continuous round of injunctions on the pretext of various "grievances." This would not only be very annoying, but would involve much expense on the part of the person enjoined. But the statute, to prevent such annoyance and injustice, provides that bonds must be given, except in cases where "the court, judge, or master is of opinion that the injunction ought to be granted without bond." The framer of this Sunday bill would claim, perhaps, that *it* should come under this provision of the statute, thinking that Sunday desecration is so clear an offense as to require no bonds. But he was not so clear on the subject when he was framing section 3, for there we are left in doubt as to what are works of "necessity or charity." And the only way to find out what such works are is to get "e*njoined*" and go before the court for a decision. Could anything be worse? Leave a law so loose that we can't tell just what it means, and then have the effrontery to presume that an injunction provided by such law was so obvious and palpably clear that the complainant, no matter who, if he be only "aggrieved," may pray for an injunction without giving bonds!

There are diversities of opinion in regard to works of "necessity or charity," as well as works of *privilege* among many who observe Sunday; and there is also a respectable class of Christians who do not believe in keeping Sunday at all, but observe the original Sabbath or Saturday. And still outside of these there is a large number who claim the privilege of skepticism in regard to all religious beliefs, and consequently have no conscience upon any sabbath. All of these classes have a right to protection in a civil government, and none should be allowed to set up his conscience as a standard, and compel the rest to come to it. But this bill, if passed, would allow the narrowest-minded zealot in the land to harass with impunity his less enthusiastic neighbor. For, mark you, "any person aggrieved" may file a petition for injunction without giving bond for the same. It will surprise us to learn how easy some persons are "aggrieved" on this subject. When prominent clergymen within the last year of this enlightened nineteenth century will say, *"Nothing outside of the home and the sanctuary is proper recreation for the Sabbath-day,"* and, "O*h, for a breath of the Puritan!"* anyone can see that they are only waiting for such laws as the foregoing to furnish them the unobstructed opportunity of making their ideas and desires felt. The above is only a sample of the kind of legislation that is being asked in so many places in favor of Sunday. Again, fellow-citizens, let me ask, Are you ready to accept such laws and be subject to the intolerance of religious bigots who are even in our enlightened day clamoring for law that they may compel, under pains and penalties, the observance of religious dogmas? The bill closes thus:—

> "Section 5. Subject to the provisions of this act, and of other laws of this State, all persons may spend Sunday in any orderly and peaceable manner, as they deem proper, and no person shall be prosecuted, harassed, or annoyed under color of this act for anything done on Sunday, which is not prohibited by some law or ordinance, or which is not in its nature offensive and contrary to the peace and good order of society."

This section would seem to give some privileges after all in advance of the "Puritan Sabbath." But take the bill as a whole, and how much is not prohibited by some law or ordinance? Section three makes everything unlawful on Sunday except circulating books, tracts, and papers, the sale of medicine, the delivery of milk, and the running of railroad and street-cars and "works of necessity or charity;" and we are assured that this law is only an initiatory step toward the stricter legislation that is to follow later on. And while this last section might seem at first to soften the whole bill, yet in reality it is only a blind to lead us into the narrow confines of the ideal of the Puritans.

Even if all were settled in regard to Sunday being the right day to observe as the Sabbath, the words of Him who said, "My kingdom is not of this world," would forever forbid us to enforce by civil enactment any religious institution. And with all the history of religious intolerance coming to our minds, are we ready to be drawn into the same thing again? The great clamor at the present time for civil law to enforce religious beliefs and observances, should arouse every American citizen from his feeling of security, and cause him to consider whether he is ready to submit to all the intolerance resultant upon a union of Church and State.A.
