The Rev. S. M. Johnson, a Presbyterian pastor in Denver, spoke on Sunday, February 17, on the Sunday-closing movement, and in his discourse said:—

> "If we were to distinguish, we would say that it is unskilled laborers with whom the Sunday saloon has much to do. Many of them are employed as shovelers and diggers on the streets. They take a ten-cent lodging. It is good enough during the week, when the day is spent in hard work, and the men go to their rooms to sleep. But a ten-cent lodging is quite dreary when Sunday comes. How will they spend the day? Go to Trinity to hear the great organ? But how many churches in Denver would be inviting to those men? Go to the Y. M. C. A. rooms? But they are too finely furnished to be home-like to such men. Where then? What other doors are open? The saloon doors."

That is all true; but whose fault is it? One of the proofs which Christ gave that he was the Christ was that he preached the gospel to the poor. But here we find a professed follower of Christ pleading for a civil law to keep the poor back from that to which the unchristlike position of professed Christian workers has driven them. They want the State to do for these people that which they ought to do, but are not willing to do. We commend to them the words quoted in another part of this paper from the *Catholic American.*
