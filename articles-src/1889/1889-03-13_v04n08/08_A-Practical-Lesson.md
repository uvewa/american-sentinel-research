# A Practical Lesson.

In the *Christian Statesman* of January 10, National Reform Secretary B. C. Wylie draws a practical lesson from the late election, for the benefit of the Prohibition party. He says that at the Indianapolis Convention the watch-word was, "A million votes for Fisk!" and that the Prohibition party were certain that Fisk and Brooks would receive "a million votes;" and, that even the least sanguine would not put it below half a million. But the returns show that only about 250,000 votes were cast for the Prohibition nominees. Now the lesson which Mr. Wylie wants the Prohibition party to learn is, Why this great falling off between the estimate and the reality? The reason of this, he claims, is that the Prohibition party failed to acknowledge the authority of Christ and his law in their party platform. He says that two delegations, one from the Woman's Christian Temperance Union and the other from the National Reform Association, went to Indianapolis to urge upon the Prohibition Convention this very acknowledgment; that these delegations presented their cause, both in the convention and to the platform committee; but that instead of acknowledging Christ as the Nation's ruler, they actually left out the reference to his law, which they had put into the platform of 1884. Hence their loss of the great number of votes. Therefore, he says:—

> "The first lesson for the Prohibitionists to learn is that the way to the White House is not made so short and easy as they supposed by ignoring Christ and his law."

Whether the Prohibition party will consider itself instructed by such a lesson as this, we do not know. But it seems that the National Reformers are becoming quite familiar with the use of their idea of the Saviour as a "divine politician," when they can attribute the loss of 750,000 expected votes to His judgment upon a party for not being recognized in their political platform. If they would study the Saviour's word more, they would find there the statement that, "God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved."
