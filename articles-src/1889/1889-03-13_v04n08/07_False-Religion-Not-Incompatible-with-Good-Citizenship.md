# False Religion Not Incompatible with Good Citizenship.

It is possible that a religion may be at variance with common sense and with the word of God, and yet so far as civil society is concerned, be perfectly harmless. For instance, some may believe that the body and blood of Christ are, in contradiction to their senses, *verily and indeed* taken by the faithful in the Lord’s Supper, and yet be as temperate, upright and beneficent as their neighbors who believe that the bread and wine in that ordinance are merely symbols of the body and blood of Christ. Again, some may be pleased to have other gods besides Jehovah, the living and true God, in opposition to the first precept of the decalogue; and some may go a step further, and have pictures and images of God, in defiance of the second, and yet be as good citizens as the most rigid Unitarians, or the most orthodox Calvinists. Probably some of my readers begin to think that this is carrying toleration too far, and that the writer is criminally indifferent to the honor of God; and yet, perhaps, there is not one of all these who is not in the daily habit of breaking the third commandment, by taking the sacred name in vain!

> “Religion is the cause of God, and it is at our peril that we neglect to support it.” And does it follow, that we are to support it by whatever means the devil, or his emissaries, may suggest? If we make a distinction between what is divine and what is human, we ought much more to distinguish between what is divine, and what is infernal. Do we serve God, that God who is good [61] to all, and whose tender mercy is over all his works—who, when he was importuned to reveal his glory, declared himself the Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abundant in goodness and truth; that God, all whose perfections are but different forms of love— by making him guilty of a religion, dark and lowering as a thunder-storm, which blasts and desolates the earth as it advances? Can this be that religion which was ushered into the world with “glory to God in the highest; peace on earth; and good-will towards men”? Granted, “genuine religion is the cause of God;” and this great truth furnishes many arguments against every species of persecution.

> “Is, then, every ridiculous vagary on which the human mind may light, to be tolerated in religion?” Why not? Considered in a political point of view, there is not a worse, in a religious point of view, not a more absurd, vagary than intolerance; and the tendency of intolerance, to give consistence and perpetuity to the fleeting shades of mental weakness, may be received as a good *argumentum ad hominem,* by those who think it may be employed to promote truth and uniformity.— *Clarke’s History of Intolerance.*
