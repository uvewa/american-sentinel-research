While the ministers of Denver are united in desiring to have a Sunday law strictly enforced, they are not agreed as to the reason for such a law. Some think that the day should be kept strictly, while others think that any business except the saloon should be allowed to run. The ideas vary according to the degree of straitness of the religious creed of the individuals expressing them. If it were purely a temperance affair, or if they wanted a civil holiday, religious opinions would have nothing to do with it.
