Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.— *U S. Constitution.*

The Denver *Republican* says: "The State names Sunday as a day of rest by the same power that it names the Fourth of July as a legal holiday." Then why does the State treat Sunday so much differently from the Fourth of July? It compels people to rest on Sunday, whether they want to or not, but it leaves them free to do just as they please on the Fourth of July. Anybody can see that it is not the exercise of the same power in each case. There is all the difference in the world. No one complains that Sunday is made a legal holiday, although it commemorates nothing in connection with the State; but the Sunday-law people are not satisfied with that. They do not want it made such a holiday as the Fourth of July. Just let somebody introduce a bill into Congress, providing that everybody should celebrate the Fourth of July in a certain way, and that nobody should do any work upon it, and there would be a protest against such unjust interference with people's rights. Much as we honor the Declaration of Independence, such an act as that would show that the principles of the Declaration of Independence had been forgotten, and so will a Sunday law. There is not one point in common between Sunday and the Fourth of July; and when the advocates of a Sunday law mention the National holiday as a precedent for Sunday legislation, they but make emphatic the fact that there is a feature in their work from which they would fain attract attention.
