At the Sunday mass-meeting in Denver, the Rev. Father Carr said:—

> "We know that there is less crime, lawlessness, and drunkenness in Denver than in any other city of its size in the Union. We know it, but how can we explain it to our Eastern friends, with the condition of affairs as they now exist? Let me tell an Eastern friend that our saloons and gambling-places are open on Sunday, and he cannot understand how it is that the good order which I may at the same time claim, prevails."

That is the latest excuse yet devised for a Sunday law, and it is about the thinnest. They have the best of order in Denver, with practically no Sunday law, but they want the Sunday law so that they can attribute the good order to it. The great plea for a Sunday law is on the ground that it will tend to peace and prosperity; but unfortunately for the argument, they have that condition of things already, and they are anxious to hurry up the Sunday law, or the enforcement of what they have, so that they can point to the good order that already exists, and say, "See the result of strict Sunday laws." This is sufficient to show that it is not in the interest of temperance that they are working, but it is just as certain that they are not working in the interest of religion, that is, if telling the truth is a part of religion. It is indeed a *form* of religion that they are working for, but a form of religion that has no connection with Christianity.
