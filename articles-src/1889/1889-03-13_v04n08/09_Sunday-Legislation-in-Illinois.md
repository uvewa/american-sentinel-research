# Sunday Legislation in Illinois.

A bill was introduced in the House of the Illinois Legislature January 25, which is another evidence of the drift toward enforcing religious beliefs by civil law. Notwithstanding the fact that the constitution of Illinois provides for the “free exercise and enjoyment of religious professions and worship, without discrimination,” these apostles of church and State want to compel, contrary to the supreme law of the State, the observance of a religious institution. Following are the first two sections of the bill:—

> “Section 1. *Be it enacted by the people of the State of Illinois, represented in the General* *Assembly, *That whoever shall keep open on Sunday any shop, store, factory, or other public place, for the manufacture, or preparation, or packing, or sale, or other disposition of any goods, wares, or merchandise, except as in this act expressly provided, shall be deemed guilty of a high misdemeanor, and upon conviction thereof shall be fined in a sum not less than fifty, nor more than five hundred dollars, for each offense, and shall be committed to the common jail, till the fines and costs are paid.

> “Section 2. Whoever shall procure, or permit to be employed in any secular business on Sunday in any of the places mentioned in section 1 of this act, any clerk, workman, or other person, except as in this act expressly permitted, shall be deemed guilty of a like misdemeanor, and shall suffer the like penalty as is prescribed in the foregoing section.”
These sections prohibit only a certain class of labor. However, the mover of the bill says privately that it does not cover all they want. But if they make the bill too sweeping on the start, they fear it will be defeated; and he thinks that half a loaf is better than no bread. This will prove a stepping-stone toward getting stronger legislation in the future in favor of Sunday. True to the watchword of Sunday-law advocates, the standard of the ideal Puritan Sunday is erected in the background, and they try to lead us on cautiously, step by step, till we shall be hemmed in on all sides, and the only thing allowable on Sunday will be to go to church to listen to the lengthy disquisition of some prosy divine. But even as an initiatory measure, on the class the bill touches, it imposes a fine that would soon use up a small fortune. The author of the bill frankly stated to me that it was intended to protect the religious interests of Sunday. It seems strange to hear men talk of imposing such fines if we refuse to observe in sacred style a dogma of disputed origin in the Christian church. Think of it! from fifty to five hundred dollars! Would it not be well before making such laws in favor of what lie thinks to be the Christian religion, to examine the records to see if the Author of the Christian religion would be in harmony with such action?

According to these sections of the bill, the offender “shall be deemed guilty of *high* misdemeanor.” The criminal code of the Illinois statutes divides offenses into “felonies,” “misdemeanors,” and “infamous crimes,” but I do not find anything referring “to *high* misdemeanor.” In view of the fact that this is only a “stepping-stone” to the legislation they want in favor of Sunday, I suppose it was deemed unwise to call a violation of this act either “felony” or “infamous crimes.” And yet the simple term of “misdemeanor” in the statutes is not strong enough, so the term “high misdemeanor” must be used. The “Library of Universal Knowledge” defines “h*igh* misdemeanor” as “an offense short of, but closely bordering on, treason.” And in the Articles of Confederation between the original thirteen States (Art. 4) we have the expression, “If any person guilty of or charged with treason, felony, or other high misdemeanor,” etc., thus associating “high misdemeanor” with treason and felony. Fellow-citizens, are we ready to be classed with those guilty of the infamous crime of *treason* just because we choose to dissent from the idea of observing a religious institution, no matter whether we are conscientious about it or not? God does not in the Christian dispensation delegate to anyone the authority to inflict temporal punishment on the violators of his law. Would it not be well for these would-be defenders of the Christian religion to be more moderate in their proposed enactments? The third section is as follows:—

> “Section 3. This act shall not apply to the printing or circulation of newspapers, nor to the sale of medicine, nor to the delivery of milk, nor to the running of railroad or street-cars, or other means for the necessary transportation of the people for all lawful purposes, nor to the circulation of proper books, tracts, or papers, nor to any other work of necessity or charity. In case of any question whether any particular work be a work of necessity or charity, any person may apply to any court having equity jurisdiction, to enjoin the same, and upon such application the question aforesaid shall be determined.”

This section very graciously exempts newspaper men, druggists, milkmen, and railroad and street-cars, because, as the father of the bill says, they do not care to have the opposition of these industries at present. After they get the bill passed, they will be able to use it as a lever to get stricter legislation, and stop everything on Sunday. But the worst feature of this section is the loose way in which it leaves works of “necessity or charity.” The bill says that “in case of any question whether any particular work be a work of necessity or charity, any person may apply to any court having equity jurisdiction, to enjoin the same, and upon such application the question aforesaid shall be determined.” We are here informed that there really are works of necessity and charity. But the only way to find out “in case of any question whether any particular work be a work of necessity or charity” is to go ahead, do the work, and be subject to the caprice of *any person* who wishes to “apply to any court having equity jurisdiction, to enjoin the same,” and by a suit at law have the matter determined. Our statutes should be so framed that we may know what is lawful and what is not, without first having to do some deed and be “enjoined,” and have a lawsuit in order to ascertain what the law is. Such a law would be expected from a tyrant, but is not becoming to a free people. An article in the special edition of the October Sentinel, entitled, “The Savor of Tyranny,” is to the point here, and we request all our readers who have not a copy of the paper to send and get it. The article is well worth reading and rereading. The bill continues:— [62]

> “Section 4. In addition to the penalties in this act provided, the several remedies hereinafter specified may be had, for any offense described in this act. A fine not exceeding $200 may be recovered in a common suit, before a justice of the peace or police magistrate commenced by summons in the name of the people of this State, on the relation of any person who may make complaint. Each and every of the offenses described in this act is hereby declared to be a nuisance, and it shall be the duty of all courts of equity in this State upon the proper application, to enjoin and prohibit the same, and no bond shall be required of the complainant in such a case. A bill, or petition for injunction, may be filed, by any person aggrieved, either in his own name, or in the name of the people on his relation.”

This section endeavors to provide “remedies.” But instead of remedies it furnishes the most unobstructed liberty to those who may desire to show their religious zeal by harassing those who may not desire to observe Sunday so strictly as their Puritan neighbors. Chapter 69, paragraph 9, of the Illinois statutes, under the caption of “Injunctions,” reads: “In all other cases [except injunctions to enjoin a judgment], before an injunction shall issue, the complainant shall give bond in such penalty, and upon such condition and with such security as may be required by the court, judge, or master granting or ordering the injunction, *provided* bond need not be required when, for good cause shown, the court, judge, or master is of opinion that the injunction ought to be granted without bond.”

This provides that in case a person has an injunction served on him or is enjoined to cease doing anything, the person so enjoining shall be required to give bonds to cover the damage done the defendant, in case the injunction proves to be unjust. For instance: A man is building a house, and his neighbor concludes that when the structure is up it will prove a damage to him. So he has an injunction issued to have the building stopped. This will necessitate the stoppage of all the hands on the building, and everything in connection with its erection must cease. Anyone can see that this would involve a big expense to the builder. To cover the damage thus accrued, in case the injunction proves to be unjust, the law requires that the complainant shall give bonds.

If such bonds were not required, we should be exposed to the caprice and malice of any unprincipled person who might, to annoy us, keep asking a continuous round of injunctions on the pretext of various “grievances.” This would not only be very annoying, but would involve much expense on the part of the person enjoined. But the statute, to prevent such annoyance and injustice, provides that bonds must be given, except in cases where “the court, judge, or master is of opinion that the injunction ought to be granted without bond.” The framer of this Sunday bill would claim, perhaps, that *it* should come under this provision of the statute, thinking that Sunday desecration is so clear an offense as to require no bonds. But he was not so clear on the subject when he was framing section 3, for there we are left in doubt as to what are works of “necessity or charity.” And the only way to find out what such works are is to get “e*njoined*” and go before the court for a decision. Could anything be worse? Leave a law so loose that we can’t tell just what it means, and then have the effrontery to presume that an injunction provided by such law was so obvious and palpably clear that the complainant, no matter who, if he be only “aggrieved,” may pray for an injunction without giving bonds!

There are diversities of opinion in regard to works of “necessity or charity,” as well as works of *privilege* among many who observe Sunday; and there is also a respectable class of Christians who do not believe in keeping Sunday at all, but observe the original Sabbath or Saturday. And still outside of these there is a large number who claim the privilege of skepticism in regard to all religious beliefs, and consequently have no conscience upon any sabbath. All of these classes have a right to protection in a civil government, and none should be allowed to set up his conscience as a standard, and compel the rest to come to it. But this bill, if passed, would allow the narrowest-minded zealot in the land to harass with impunity his less enthusiastic neighbor. For, mark you, “any person aggrieved” may file a petition for injunction without giving bond for the same. It will surprise us to learn how easy some persons are “aggrieved” on this subject. When prominent clergymen within the last year of this enlightened nineteenth century will say, *“Nothing outside of the home and the sanctuary is proper recreation for the Sabbath-day,”* and, “O*h, for a breath of the Puritan!”* anyone can see that they are only waiting for such laws as the foregoing to furnish them the unobstructed opportunity of making their ideas and desires felt. The above is only a sample of the kind of legislation that is being asked in so many places in favor of Sunday. Again, fellow-citizens, let me ask, Are you ready to accept such laws and be subject to the intolerance of religious bigots who are even in our enlightened day clamoring for law that they may compel, under pains and penalties, the observance of religious dogmas? The bill closes thus:—

> “Section 5. Subject to the provisions of this act, and of other laws of this State, all persons may spend Sunday in any orderly and peaceable manner, as they deem proper, and no person shall be prosecuted, harassed, or annoyed under color of this act for anything done on Sunday, which is not prohibited by some law or ordinance, or which is not in its nature offensive and contrary to the peace and good order of society.”

This section would seem to give some privileges after all in advance of the “Puritan Sabbath.” But take the bill as a whole, and how much is not prohibited by some law or ordinance? Section three makes everything unlawful on Sunday except circulating books, tracts, and papers, the sale of medicine, the delivery of milk, and the running of railroad and street-cars and “works of necessity or charity;” and we are assured that this law is only an initiatory step toward the stricter legislation that is to follow later on. And while this last section might seem at first to soften the whole bill, yet in reality it is only a blind to lead us into the narrow confines of the ideal of the Puritans.

Even if all were settled in regard to Sunday being the right day to observe as the Sabbath, the words of Him who said, “My kingdom is not of this world,” would forever forbid us to enforce by civil enactment any religious institution. And with all the history of religious intolerance coming to our minds, are we ready to be drawn into the same thing again? The great clamor at the present time for civil law to enforce religious beliefs and observances, should arouse every American citizen from his feeling of security, and cause him to consider whether he is ready to submit to all the intolerance resultant upon a union of Church and State.A. O. Tait.

Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.— *U S. Constitution.*

The Denver *Republican* says: “The State names Sunday as a day of rest by the same power that it names the Fourth of July as a legal holiday.” Then why does the State treat Sunday so much differently from the Fourth of July? It compels people to rest on Sunday, whether they want to or not, but it leaves them free to do just as they please on the Fourth of July. Anybody can see that it is not the exercise of the same power in each case. There is all the difference in the world. No one complains that Sunday is made a legal holiday, although it commemorates nothing in connection with the State; but the Sunday-law people are not satisfied with that. They do not want it made such a holiday as the Fourth of July. Just let somebody introduce a bill into Congress, providing that everybody should celebrate the Fourth of July in a certain way, and that nobody should do any work upon it, and there would be a protest against such unjust interference with people’s rights. Much as we honor the Declaration of Independence, such an act as that would show that the principles of the Declaration of Independence had been forgotten, and so will a Sunday law. There is not one point in common between Sunday and the Fourth of July; and when the advocates of a Sunday law mention the National holiday as a precedent for Sunday legislation, they but make emphatic the fact that there is a feature in their work from which they would fain attract attention.

The Rev. S. M. Johnson, a Presbyterian pastor in Denver, spoke on Sunday, February 17, on the Sunday-closing movement, and in his discourse said:—

> “If we were to distinguish, we would say that it is unskilled laborers with whom the Sunday saloon has much to do. Many of them are employed as shovelers and diggers on the streets. They take a ten-cent lodging. It is good enough during the week, when the day is spent in hard work, and the men go to their rooms to sleep. But a ten-cent lodging is quite dreary when Sunday comes. How will they spend the day? Go to Trinity to hear the great organ? But how many churches in Denver would be inviting to those men? Go to the Y. M. C. A. rooms? But they are too finely furnished to be home-like to such men. Where then? What other doors are open? The saloon doors.”

That is all true; but whose fault is it? One of the proofs which Christ gave that he was the Christ was that he preached the gospel to the poor. But here we find a professed follower of Christ pleading for a civil law to keep the poor back from that to which the unchristlike position of professed Christian workers has driven them. They want the State to do for these people that which they ought to do, but are not willing to do. We commend to them the words quoted in another part of this paper from the *Catholic American.*

In his essay on “Southey’s Colloquies,” Lord Macaulay said:—

> “The ark of God was never taken till it was surrounded by the arms of earthly defenders. In captivity, its sanctity was sufficient to vindicate it from insult, and to lay the hostile fiend prostrate on the threshold of his own temple. The real security of Christianity is to be found in its own benevolent morality, in its exquisite adaptation to the human heart, in the facility with which its scheme accommodates itself to the capacity of every human intellect, in the consolation which it brings to the house of mourning, in the light with which it brightens the great mystery of the grave. To such a system it can bring no addition of dignity or of strength, that it is part and parcel of the common law.” [63-64]

Note.—No papers are sent by the publishers of the American Sentinel to people who have not subscribed for it. If the Sentinel comes to one who has not subscribed for it, he may know that it is sent him by some friend, and that he will not be called upon by the publishers to pay for the same.

The *Censor,* a professedly Prohibition journal, published in Los Angeles, Cal., thus shows itself to be a strictly National Reform organ:—

> “The ten commandments are the basis of a perfect National Constitution, and the sermon on the mount and the Lord’s prayer the model of a perfect city charter.”

We have no fault to find with the ten commandments, the sermon on the mount, or the Lord’s prayer; they are perfect; but we should hate to live in a city governed by mortals, in which the sermon on the mount was taken as the charter. We should say, with King David: “Let me fall now into the hands of the Lord; for very great are his mercies; but let me not fall into the hands of man.”

The *Advance* of February 21 thinks that “there is promise of good things in the announcement that John Wanamaker is to be PostmasterGeneral.” It thinks that, as an active Sundayschool worker, Me will use his influence to stop Sunday work in the Post-office Department of the Government, and says: “There is so much room for improvement of this kind in the department that Mr. Wanamaker may look upon it as a wide field of religious usefulness.” That caps the climax of cabinet speculations. If the ideas of some people could be carried out, the entire Government would be simply a religious machine. The reader should not fail to note these unpremeditated admissions that legislation to stop the mails on Sunday is religious legislation.

At the Sunday mass-meeting in Denver, the Rev. Father Carr said:—

> “We know that there is less crime, lawlessness, and drunkenness in Denver than in any other city of its size in the Union. We know it, but how can we explain it to our Eastern friends, with the condition of affairs as they now exist? Let me tell an Eastern friend that our saloons and gambling-places are open on Sunday, and he cannot understand how it is that the good order which I may at the same time claim, prevails.”

That is the latest excuse yet devised for a Sunday law, and it is about the thinnest. They have the best of order in Denver, with practically no Sunday law, but they want the Sunday law so that they can attribute the good order to it. The great plea for a Sunday law is on the ground that it will tend to peace and prosperity; but unfortunately for the argument, they have that condition of things already, and they are anxious to hurry up the Sunday law, or the enforcement of what they have, so that they can point to the good order that already exists, and say, “See the result of strict Sunday laws.” This is sufficient to show that it is not in the interest of temperance that they are working, but it is just as certain that they are not working in the interest of religion, that is, if telling the truth is a part of religion. It is indeed a *form* of religion that they are working for, but a form of religion that has no connection with Christianity.

The New York preachers’ meeting of the Methodist Episcopal Church, embracing ministers in that denomination in New York and adjacent cities, at a recent session heartily indorsed the principles of the American Sunday Union, declaring that “its methods and plans, so far as they have been developed, are singularly wise and efficient.” No one can question but that its methods are “efficient,” and they no doubt exhibit the wisdom of the serpent, in that they are crafty; but we are sure that a method by which one name is multiplied by 7,200,000, and a single church or other organization is represented three or four times over upon the strength of a vote by a few of them, is a manifestation of almost anything but the wisdom that comes from above. But then, such methods are “efficient,” and that proves their wisdom.

The *Pearl of Days* says that the practice of holding mass-meetings on Sunday, in the interest of labor, has resulted in a vigorous protest on the part of many workingmen in Cincinnati, and quotes from the Chicago *Inter- Ocean* to the effect that the Central Labor Union having called a meeting for Sunday, February 24, instead of February 22, as at first intended, a mass-meeting of trade unionists to protest against Sunday meetings in general, and this one in particular, was appointed. The *Inter-Ocean* says that “the workingmen are nearly equally divided on this question.” The *Pearl of Days* says: “We can but rejoice in this hopeful sign.” Yes, but how does this tally with Mr. Crafts’s statements that the Sunday-Rest bill was framed to satisfy the clamor of the workingman? This doesn’t look as if the clamor had been very great. The most of the clamor has been stirred up by Mr Crafts himself.

At the anniversary dinner of the Catholic Club, in Philadelphia, Cardinal Gibbons, Archbishop Corrigan, and Archbishop Ryan were present and made speeches. Among other things, Archbishop Ryan told of the meeting between a Protestant and the Pope, and how well pleased the two men were with each other, and said: “So, many Protestants who have met the Pope, while not religiously Catholic, are personally Papists. He then continued:—

> “On the great dogmas we are all united. We have a common love for religion. In an age when society is threatened with grave dangers it is well that men who love Christianity and Christian civilization should unite. I was glad to find when I came to Philadelphia that most of the public men were Christians, and I see no reason why on the great questions we may not agree.”

This speech was greeted with “great applause,” therefore the National Reformers may take courage. There is a growing prospect that their overtures to the Roman Catholic Church will not much longer be repulsed.

Protestant preachers inveigh against the Sunday newspapers, for the reason that the newspapers keep people from church. The Sunday newspaper has become a popular necessity in this country; it has come to stay. That is a fact to be faced, whether you like it or not. Whatever the Sunday newspaper may be or may become, they must be poor preachers, poor churches, and poor creeds indeed which confess themselves beaten by a Sunday newspaper. There must be something radically wrong with them, as in truth there is. No Catholic priest would complain of the Sunday newspaper on the ground that it drew people away from mass and the sacraments of the Lord’s day. Catholics, a comparatively small minority happily, do stay away from mass and the sacraments; but this grave sin of theirs is not owing to Sunday newspaper reading. It is because they have fallen into the habit of neglecting what they know to be their duty; Catholics read the newspapers on Sunday just as Protestants do; but the Catholic Churches, crowded at all the masses, as any inquirer may convince himself by visiting the churches, testify to the fact that newspaper reading affects in no wise Catholic faith and worship. The trouble of which the Protestant preachers complain does not lie with the newspapers, but with themselves, rather, their vague doctrinal teachings, and their soulless worship on empty altars.— *Catholic American. *[65]
