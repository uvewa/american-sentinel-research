Protestant preachers inveigh against the Sunday newspapers, for the reason that the newspapers keep people from church. The Sunday newspaper has become a popular necessity in this country; it has come to stay. That is a fact to be faced, whether you like it or not. Whatever the Sunday newspaper may be or may become, they must be poor preachers, poor churches, and poor creeds indeed which confess themselves beaten by a Sunday newspaper. There must be something radically wrong with them, as in truth there is. No Catholic priest would complain of the Sunday newspaper on the ground that it drew people away from mass and the sacraments of the Lord's day. Catholics, a comparatively small minority happily, do stay away from mass and the sacraments; but this grave sin of theirs is not owing to Sunday newspaper reading. It is because they have fallen into the habit of neglecting what they know to be their duty; Catholics read the newspapers on Sunday just as Protestants do; but the Catholic Churches, crowded at all the masses, as any inquirer may convince himself by visiting the churches, testify to the fact that newspaper reading affects in no wise Catholic faith and worship. The trouble of which the Protestant preachers complain does not lie with the newspapers, but with themselves, rather, their vague doctrinal teachings, and their soulless worship on empty altars.— *Catholic American. *[65]
