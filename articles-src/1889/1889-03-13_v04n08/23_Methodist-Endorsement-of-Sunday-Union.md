The New York preachers' meeting of the Methodist Episcopal Church, embracing ministers in that denomination in New York and adjacent cities, at a recent session heartily indorsed the principles of the American Sunday Union, declaring that "its methods and plans, so far as they have been developed, are singularly wise and efficient." No one can question but that its methods are "efficient," and they no doubt exhibit the wisdom of the serpent, in that they are crafty; but we are sure that a method by which one name is multiplied by 7,200,000, and a single church or other organization is represented three or four times over upon the strength of a vote by a few of them, is a manifestation of almost anything but the wisdom that comes from above. But then, such methods are "efficient," and that proves their wisdom.
