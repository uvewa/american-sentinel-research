The *Pearl of Days* says that the practice of holding mass-meetings on Sunday, in the interest of labor, has resulted in a vigorous protest on the part of many workingmen in Cincinnati, and quotes from the Chicago *Inter- Ocean* to the effect that the Central Labor Union having called a meeting for Sunday, February 24, instead of February 22, as at first intended, a mass-meeting of trade unionists to protest against Sunday meetings in general, and this one in particular, was appointed. The *Inter-Ocean* says that "the workingmen are nearly equally divided on this question." The *Pearl of Days* says: "We can but rejoice in this hopeful sign." Yes, but how does this tally with Mr. Crafts's statements that the Sunday-Rest bill was framed to satisfy the clamor of the workingman? This doesn't look as if the clamor had been very great. The most of the clamor has been stirred up by Mr Crafts himself.
