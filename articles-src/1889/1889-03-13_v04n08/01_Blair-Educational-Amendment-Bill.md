# Blair Educational Amendment Bill.

*(Continued.)*

The question now to be decided is, “What are the principles of the Christian religion, which are to be taught if the amendment is adopted?” The Methodists would give one answer, if it were left with them, the Baptists another, the Presbyterians another, and other denominations still another. All would differ, yet each would present something common to all. But the question is not to be left to any one denomination; for the latter part of the second section expressly stipulates that no public money shall ever be appropriated for the instruction of children in any of the tenets or doctrines peculiar to any sect. It is this part of the amendment, so wondrously worded, which catches the multitude, and blinds them to the principle of Church and State union, which is involved. They think it will be so fine a thing to settle it forever that no public money shall be appropriated for the purpose of sectarian teaching, that they lose sight of the real gist of the thing. Protestants think that it would forever shut Catholics off from any share in the school money, whereas it would give them practical control of the schools, as we shall show later on.

We will now consider the amendment adopted, and Congress ready to enforce it by proper legislation. It finds a score of denominations, each strenuous to have its own peculiar views taught in the public schools, if any are to be taught. But this will not do; only those can be taught which are common to all—upon which all can agree. It is manifest, therefore, that the churches themselves are the only ones who could determine this.  They only can tell the principles upon which they can all agree. Congress cannot decide this point, nor would they allow it to if it could, for they have already expressed themselves on the matter. In the *Christian Statesman *of February 21, 1884, Rev. J. C. K. Milligan said in regard to theological questions:—

> “The churches must settle these questions among themselves, and with each other, and at least we will not allow the civil government to decide between them, and to ordain church doctrines, ordinances, and laws.”

Further on in the same article he said:—

> “The churches and the pulpit have much to do with shaping and forming opinions on all moral questions, and with interpretations of Scripture on moral and civil, as well as on theological and ecclesiastical, points, and it is probable that in the almost universal gathering of our citizens about these [the churches and the pulpits] the chief discussions and the final decisions of most points will be developed there.”

In short, before Congress could enforce the new article, it would be obliged to call a council of the churches. Representatives of all the churches would convene and decide what they could all agree upon, and would then inform the Government just what it should enforce. This would be an exact parallel to the Council of Nice, A. D. 325, which Constantine convened in order that the bishops might settle upon some common principles which could be enforced by imperial authority. Now as that action is universally recognized as the celebration of the union of Church and State, this would necessarily be the same. The churches in America would, by the adoption of the Blair Educational Amendment, which they desire, be forced to follow in the steps of the bishops of the church in the fourth century. The State would then be simply the agent to execute ecclesiastical decrees.

Remember that in such a council all professed Christian churches would have to be represented. That would include the Catholic Church, for it is reckoned as a branch of the Christian Church. But from many States the Catholics, according to a fair representation, would have a very large majority of the delegates; and their delegates in the council would nearly equal those of all the Protestant churches. So the Catholic Church would be able to dictate terms to the council. For of course a vote would have to be taken to decide upon the principles of the Christian religion, and the Catholics could carry more of their points than the Protestants could. Thus the Catholic Church would secure the practical control of the public schools. The Protestants might not like this very well, but having committed themselves to the theory of religious teaching by the State, they would have to abide by the decision of the majority.

As stated before, the State would be simply the agent of the church, to carry into execution its decrees. And this would be exactly in accordance with the ideas of the Papacy, as set forth by an eminent and highly educated Catholic. Speaking of natural and revealed law, Dr. Brownson says of the church:—

> “She is, under God, *the supreme judge of both laws,* which are for her but one law; and hence she takes cognizance, *in her tribunals,* of the breaches of the natural law as well as of the revealed, and has the right to take cognizance *by Nations* as well as of its breaches *by individuals,* by the prince as well as by the subject, for *it is the supreme law for both.* The *State is,* therefore, only *an inferior court, bound to receive the law from the Supreme Court,* and liable to have its *decrees reversed, on appeal.”—Brownson’s Essays, p. 284, quoted in The Papacy and the Civil Power, p. 32.*

Let the Blair Educational Amendment be adopted, and we should have a very pretty likeness of the Papacy—an American Papacy. There might not be any one man acknowledged as Pope, but that would make no difference. There was not in Constantine’s time. It took time to grow into that.

Anybody can see that while such a council [58] would be a nominal union of all the churches, there would be no real union. All would be satisfied with the enunciation of those teachings which were really common to all, while everybody, except those belonging to the sect having the strongest representation in the council, would be dissatisfied. It was just so in the fourth century. Neander says:—

> “In fact, however, the manner in which the controversies had been decided by the Council of Nice, could only contain the seeds for new disputes; for there was here no cordial union springing freely, by a natural course of development, out of inward conviction; but a forced and artificial union of men, still widely separated by their different modes of thinking, on a creed which had been imposed on them, and which was differently expounded according to the different doctrinal interests of the several parties.”

And just so it would be in this case. Their union would be no real union, but only a confederacy.

But Senator Blair would contend that nothing of this kind could take place, because he does not intend to have anything but the empty shell of religion taught. Following are the remarks which bear directly upon this question of religion in schools, in the Senator’s speech in the Senate, December 21, 1888, made on the occasion of his calling the bill from the table to have it referred to the Committee on Education and Labor:—

> “Of course the clause to require instruction to be given those between the ages of six and sixteen years, inclusive, in the common branches of knowledge only, and in virtue, morality, and the principles of the Christian religion, brings up a question much discussed, and upon which the public mind is not settled. . . .

> “It is said that this sort of instruction should be turned over to the clergy, to the churches, to other influences, to the family especially; but we all know, not perhaps mathematically, for we cannot settle it exactly, that there are not far from one- third of the children of this country who never see the inside of a church, and who in their family relations are so unfortunate as to have little, if any, training in the ordinary principles of virtue and morality. If it is indispensable that they have training in these ideas, that these ideas be implanted in the young mind with a view to safe and proper citizenship in the future, the instruction must be given by the public schools dependent on the power of the State. The preservation of the State demands it, and self-preservation is the first law of nature to the State as of individuals.
> “In regard to the general principles of the Christian religion, no one but a bigot would think of having introduced into the public schools instruction in any form of sectarianism; but a knowledge of the Christian religion, even if there be no enforcement of those truths upon the conviction and belief of the child, instruction in those principles, a statement or explanation of what they are, exactly as instruction is given in the principles of arithmetic and geography, and any of the common branches of science, is exceedingly desirable and important for every citizen to possess, whether he applies the principle in his personal conduct or not, because they are the warp and woof, the very fabric of society, of the surroundings in which he lives, the basis of our customs and laws, and of the conduct of life. These general principles are exceedingly essential and important not only to apply in personal conduct, but a knowledge of them should be possessed by anyone who is to enter successfully into the ordinary competitions and relations of life. There never was a great Nation yet which was without an affirmative religious belief and practice—a religion which was the source and aspiration of perhaps the noblest deeds of the people.”
The Senator well says that this is a question upon which “the public mind is not settled.” May it be long before it becomes settled upon the side which he advocates. As to his argument, we wish to say:—

1. Virtually admitting that the churches are the bodies to teach the principles of the Christian religion, which is true, since they are organized for that purpose and for no other, he would give that work to schools supported by the State. Thus he would have the schools do the work of the churches. He would have the State support the work of the church, only that work would be done in the school-houses instead of in the church buildings. But it makes no difference where the work is done, whether in the churches, the schoolhouses, or in the woods; when the State carries on the work of the church, you have simply a State church. That is all there is of it. The State, under the working of the Blair amendment, will be a grand church school.

2. This amendment, according to Senator Blair’s explanation—and he ought to know, for he made it—puts the State not only in the place of the parent, but above the parent. Take his argument that the State must educate the children in religion, because so many of them never go to church. Now suppose the case of an infidel, or of a man who strongly dissents from the decree of the council. He refuses to send his children to a school where they will be taught what he believes to be error. And then the State must necessarily, in the discharge of its duty as laid down by Mr. Blair, take that child away from its parents, and place it where it can be educated in the religion of the State. Protestants have been justly indignant when such things have been done in countries where Catholicism was the religion of the State. Bead the account given by Dowling (“History of Romanism,” pp. 794-800) of the abduction of the boy Edgar Mortara, whose parents, being Jews, naturally wanted to educate him in their own religion, but who was abducted, and brought up as a Catholic. That very thing might, and almost undoubtedly would be, repeated in this country if the Blair Educational Amendment were adopted. This again marks it as a measure that would make this country a likeness of Papal governments.E. J. W.

The Denver *Republican* states that a bill has passed the Colorado Senate providing that no one shall be compelled to observe Sunday as a day of rest, who makes it a practice to observe some other day, and says that the bill should be killed as a matter of course. We don’t have any faith in exemption clauses, but the *Republican’s* position shows how utterly regardless of the rights of workingmen those are who clamor for Sunday legislation. Here is the situation: Without any Sunday law every workingman is free to work or to refuse to work, whenever he wishes. No one can force him to work on Sunday; and if it be true, as it is claimed, that the great majority of workingmen want Sunday as a day of rest, then there would be very little danger of his losing his place. If the most of the workingmen want to rest on Sunday, then they have the matter in their own hands, and need no laws. This does no injustice to anybody, and leaves those free to work on Sunday who must work on that day in order to get in the six days which are theirs by divine right.

On the other hand, as soon as the Sunday law is passed and enforced, a good many workingmen are thrown out of employment, forced to quit work to gratify nothing but religious bigotry. For no matter how much they seek to evade it, the fact is that it is only at the instigation of the ministers and the church people that Sunday legislation is sought. If it were not for the fact that the intolerance of the thing has been shown up so much, there would be no pretense of any other basis for a Sunday law than that of religious obligation. Next week we intend to show, from the testimony of the prime movers in this Sunday business, that all other reasons that are given for Sunday legislation are simply feints, to divert the minds of different classes of people from the real spirit of the movement.
