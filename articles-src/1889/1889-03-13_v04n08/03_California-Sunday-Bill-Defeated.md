The Sunday bill which was introduced into both Houses of the California Legislature, and which we printed last week, with a few comments, met an ignominious death in the Senate, where it was refused a second reading. This will leave California free from any danger of a Sunday law for two years more, as it is not at all probable that another bill would fare any better. Meanwhile the Sunday-law agitators may agitate themselves to their heart's content.
