The Denver *Republican* states that a bill has passed the Colorado Senate providing that no one shall be compelled to observe Sunday as a day of rest, who makes it a practice to observe some other day, and says that the bill should be killed as a matter of course. We don't have any faith in exemption clauses, but the *Republican's* position shows how utterly regardless of the rights of workingmen those are who clamor for Sunday legislation. Here is the situation: Without any Sunday law every workingman is free to work or to refuse to work, whenever he wishes. No one can force him to work on Sunday; and if it be true, as it is claimed, that the great majority of workingmen want Sunday as a day of rest, then there would be very little danger of his losing his place. If the most of the workingmen want to rest on Sunday, then they have the matter in their own hands, and need no laws. This does no injustice to anybody, and leaves those free to work on Sunday who must work on that day in order to get in the six days which are theirs by divine right.

On the other hand, as soon as the Sunday law is passed and enforced, a good many workingmen are thrown out of employment, forced to quit work to gratify nothing but religious bigotry. For no matter how much they seek to evade it, the fact is that it is only at the instigation of the ministers and the church people that Sunday legislation is sought. If it were not for the fact that the intolerance of the thing has been shown up so much, there would be no pretense of any other basis for a Sunday law than that of religious obligation. Next week we intend to show, from the testimony of the prime movers in this Sunday business, that all other reasons that are given for Sunday legislation are simply feints, to divert the minds of different classes of people from the real spirit of the movement.
