The *Censor,* a professedly Prohibition journal, published in Los Angeles, Cal., thus shows itself to be a strictly National Reform organ:—

> "The ten commandments are the basis of a perfect National Constitution, and the sermon on the mount and the Lord's prayer the model of a perfect city charter."

We have no fault to find with the ten commandments, the sermon on the mount, or the Lord's prayer; they are perfect; but we should hate to live in a city governed by mortals, in which the sermon on the mount was taken as the charter. We should say, with King David: "Let me fall now into the hands of the Lord; for very great are his mercies; but let me not fall into the hands of man."
