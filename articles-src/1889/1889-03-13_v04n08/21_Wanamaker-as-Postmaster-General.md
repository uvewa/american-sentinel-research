The *Advance* of February 21 thinks that "there is promise of good things in the announcement that John Wanamaker is to be PostmasterGeneral." It thinks that, as an active Sundayschool worker, Me will use his influence to stop Sunday work in the Post-office Department of the Government, and says: "There is so much room for improvement of this kind in the department that Mr. Wanamaker may look upon it as a wide field of religious usefulness." That caps the climax of cabinet speculations. If the ideas of some people could be carried out, the entire Government would be simply a religious machine. The reader should not fail to note these unpremeditated admissions that legislation to stop the mails on Sunday is religious legislation.
