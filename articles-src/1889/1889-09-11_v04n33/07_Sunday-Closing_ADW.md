The value of enforced idleness and of Sunday prohibition was well illustrated in the city of Racine a short time ago. The Milwaukee *Sentinel* of June 24, says:—

> "The good people of Racine supposed that when Mayor Mitchell issued his proclamation ordering the closing of saloons on Sunday, the Bell City would virtually be a prohibition town on that day, and that there would be no drunkenness. They were mistaken. A larger amount of liquor has been consumed to-day than has been the case when the dram shops were run wide open. On the first Sunday under the new order it was different, the town being quiet as a grave-yard, owing to the fact that a heavy rain prevailed all day long. But to-day the city presented a different aspect. To be sure the saloons were closed, and entrance was impossible, except to those who knew the back or side-door signals. But the average tippler provided himself with a bottle or keg of beer before 12 o'clock Saturday night, and it was a common occurrence to see dozens of men going home with bottles protruding from their pockets, while others tramped along with keg on their shoulders. The result was seen to-day. Up the river there were several picnic parties, and the crowds present were plentifully supplied with liquid refreshments which had been secured yesterday. On the harbor piers were gathered from 300 to 500 people, and the male portion of the crowd were not bashful in pulling out bottles and sipping their contents. In the woods a great many men and boys gathered and drank whisky and beer." A. Delos Wescott. [263-264]
