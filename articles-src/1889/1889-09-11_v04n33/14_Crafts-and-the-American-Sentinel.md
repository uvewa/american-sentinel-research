Rev. Wilbur F. Crafts, field secretary of the American Sabbath Union, is lecturing in this State in the interest of the above organization, which has for its object a national Sunday law. We hope Mr. Crafts will not fail to read the American Sentinel published at Oakland, Cal., whose articles on this subject breathe more common sense than any publication we know of. The impression is gaining ground that some of the more intelligent people of this country have failed to properly study the principles of our government. That portion of their education seems to have been sadly neglected.—*Mendocino Beacon, Aug. 10.*
