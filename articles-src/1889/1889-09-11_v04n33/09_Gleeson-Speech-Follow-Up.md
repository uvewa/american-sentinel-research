The speech of Mr. Gleeson, of the Roman Catholic Church, which we print this week, opens up anew the subject of religion and the public schools. This will be followed with a series of articles on that subject, in the course of which not only our own national system will be discussed, but the Canadian also. Now is a good time to subscribe.
