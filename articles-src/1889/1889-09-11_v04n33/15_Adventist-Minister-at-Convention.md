A Seventh-day Adventist minister was unceremoniously sat upon by a convention held in Minneapolis recently, that discussed the Sundaylaw question. The Adventist offered a resolution which he wished passed instead of one which a committee reported. Dr. Crafts, a Presbyterian minister from New York, asked the denomination of the Adventist, and when informed, said that "A Seventh-day Adventist had no place in that convention except as a spectator or reporter." We had thought the time was past for running things in such a high-handed way, but it seems we were mistaken. No men nor set of men need ever think to enforce a moral or religious principle without submitting it to an intelligent discussion. The advocate of any question that refuses to thoroughly discuss it, is open to the charge of corruption, and is unworthy of this "land of the free and the home of the brave."— *Review, Litchfield, Minn. *[265]
