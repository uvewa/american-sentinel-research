Religion produced by force, and a religion resorting to force, is simply no religion at all. Notwithstanding this, there are some religionists who cannot forbear to resort to coercion. They covet the strong arm of the State to lean on, and to be employed for the purpose of church-extension. To accomplish this desire, and to give the whole the appearance of order and right, their specific creed is made a part of the common law of the land. Then whoever derides the creed derides the law; and whoever derides the law must suffer the penalty.
