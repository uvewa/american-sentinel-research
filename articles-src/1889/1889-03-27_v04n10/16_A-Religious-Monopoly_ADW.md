# A Religious Monopoly.

At the present time, a powerful effort is making in this country to again place a religious restriction upon citizenship. The National Reform Association, supported by the Prohibition party in many States, the W. C. T. U., and the most influential religious denominations, propose to secure such an amendment to the United States Constitution as will "place all Christian laws, institutions, and usages of our Government on an undeniable legal basis in the fundamental law of the land." Their motto is, "Christ the King of Nations, and the Bible the supreme law." They do not expect Christ is coming to rule personally as he ruled the Israelites, but they intend to rule in his stead, thus putting themselves in the place of God. One of their chief organs, the *Christian Nation,* in its issue of February 24, 1886, contained the following:—

> "Respect for the Bible means respect for the church, for the preaching of the gospel, and for all the means of grace."

Now this is but a statement of the simple fact; and if this be true, then it follows that if the Bible is ever made the supreme law in this country, then will everybody be forced to show "respect for the church, for the preaching of the gospel, and for all the means of grace." It would not be showing respect for the gospel not to listen to it, therefore people must be compelled to attend church, and be baptized to show "respect for the preaching of the gospel and for all the means of grace." The *Christian Nation* continues:—

> "Of course, a Government organized on a basis embracing Christianity, could not, with propriety, intrust those with office who are hostile to its characteristic faith. And none of this class have any right to claim that they shall be equally eligible to office with those who are *bona fide* citizens."

Rev. W. J. Coleman, one of the principal National Reform exponents, in the *Christian Statesman* of November 1, 1883, said: "To be perfectly plain, I believe that the existence of a Christian Constitution would disfranchise every logically consistent infidel." That is to say, that the infidel who tells the truth about himself will be disfranchised, while the hypocrite, who pretends to be a Christian, but is not, can be a good citizen. When the leaders in a political monopoly are religious people, members of the church, then, judging from all history, as well as from the inevitable logic of the case, we may look out for a religious monopoly. This is the worst of all monopolies. While other monopolies take away man's civil rights, a religious monopoly takes away the right of conscience, and destroys free moral agency. God holds every person responsible for the exercise of his choice, as a free moral agent. But how can a man choose according to the light of his own reason and conscience, when the civil government has chosen for him and [78] compelled him to accept its choice? Again, how can God give a person credit for making a good choice, when the fact is he was compelled to do it? A few months ago, some greedy monopolists got a "corner" on wheat, by means of which they took away the civil rights and the property of a good many citizens. We regard this as a great wrong; but what shall we say when Christians begin to combine and petition to Legislatures for a "corner" on religion? Yet this is exactly what they are doing. Within a few weeks nearly seven millions of people have placed their names on a petition asking Congress to pass a stringent National Sunday law, thus compelling every man to observe a religious institution whether he has any religion in his heart or not, and compelling him to accept that particular kind of religion which the National Legislature prescribes, without consulting his own reason or conscience in the matter.

[It is probable that the writer had not had an opportunity to learn the facts about that petition when he wrote this. Seven millions of people have not placed their names to a petition asking Congress to pass a Sunday law, and no such number of individual signatures will ever be secured to any such petition. The number of actual signers to the Sunday-law petition number even now only a few thousands at most. The vast number which was reported was secured by what they call "representative indorsement," and that kind of representation is simply misrepresentation. —Ed. Sentinel.]

The Presbyterian Sunday-school Quarterly, in lesson for November 25, says, "We are free to accept or reject God's service." This is true now, but will not be if Senator Blair's Sunday bill is passed. The same lesson says also that "the power of choice is given each of us, and we alone are responsible for its use."

When church members petition to Congress for a Sunday law, or any other law to compel people to show respect for religion, it is a pitiable acknowledgment that they have a kind of religion which cannot stand competition; or else that they have wandered so far from God that they no longer have his power to aid them in their work, and so they are obliged to petition for civil power to take the place of that they have lost. They are "having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof," and they want to compel others to do the same.
