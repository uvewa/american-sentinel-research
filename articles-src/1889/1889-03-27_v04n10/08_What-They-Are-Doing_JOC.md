# What They Are Doing.

A delegation from the committee of one hundred of Boston, Mass., appeared before the Senate Committee on Education and Labor, February 22, and pleaded for the passage of the joint resolution now pending in the Senate, which proposes to amend the Constitution of the United States, so as to admit the teaching of the Christian religion in the public schools. The plea of the Boston delegation was wholly based on their statements that the influence of the Catholic Church has become such that they are encroaching upon the public-school system through the teaching of their religious faith.

The opposition to the proposed amendment argued that if such were the case then legislation of the kind contemplated in the resolution would only plunge the public-school system and the country at large into deeper trouble. The speaker maintained that in case the principles of the Christian religion were to be taught in all schools, it would be necessary to have those principles established by a council of theologians from all denominatians. Of course Catholics could not well be denied a representation in such a council. And if their influence is already dangerously strong, their presence in a national council to decide the question as to what constitutes the principles of the Christian religion, would certainly influence that council in favor of Catholic doctrine. It follows, then, that, instead of the teaching of their doctrines being confined to their parochial schools, the essence of them would be taught in all the schools of the country. The schools, in that case, would be tainted with sectarian teaching, which would be not only opposed to the declaration of the resolution itself, but would also be subversive of religious liberty, because then those who do not believe the tenets of that faith would be taxed to have it taught in the public schools, and to their own children.

At this point Senator Blair, the chairman of the committee, objected, saying that it was not necessary to have the principles of the Christian religion decided by any such council, but that the courts would decide whether the points taught were proper, just the same as they could determine whether grammar or geography were being rightly set before the pupils. But it was retorted by the opposition, that, as the statutes of the country in no way define what are the principles of the Christian religion, then the judges must decide the matter in accordance with their sectarian training. In one case the judge might be a Methodist, in another a Baptist, and in still another a Presbyterian. Would not schools in all such districts become purely sectarian schools? Certainly, and by such an amendment as is proposed [75] there could be nothing else, for all those who would be called to arbitrate in such cases would base their decisions on opinions received from sectarian training.

There is only one source from which to draw the principles of the Christian religion, that is, the Bible. But, unfortunately, these people who clamor for the religious amendment, do not want to take that good Book in all its simplicity, as their rule of faith. They only want certain portions of it, which they may decide upon, and call those the principles of Christianity. Speaking on this point, Dr. Schaff says: "A competent committee of clergymen and laymen of all denominations could make a judicious selection which would satisfy every reasonable demand."

That is what is wanted. They do not want the entire Bible to be better understood, but they want certain portions of it collated and taught, to the exclusion of all other parts. Thus much of the good old Book would be suppressed; what for? Simply because it would be objectionable in a State religion. If such a condition of things is brought about, how much closer could this Nation follow the Roman hierarchy? Woe to the people of this Nation when such a time comes, for then will their peace and happiness have been destroyed, and confusion and strife will reign in their stead.

It would be far better to leave such work as the teaching of religion to the church and home. These have heavenly credentials for such a business, but the State has none. She would better not intermeddle in the affairs that belong alone to the church and the family. If these are left to do their legitimate work, and the State is satisfied to attend to purely civil matters, there would be no difficulty about the differences of religious opinion. It is only when one party becomes intolerant, and wishes to dominate over others, that it appeals to the State for power to make its bigotry felt on all who dare to differ with its religious views. It is but the old mantle of the Papacy fallen upon the shoulders of American religionists who would grasp the reins of power to enforce their religious views upon all others, at the expense of the peace and happiness of the Nation. Let such read and profit by the words of Pope:—

> "Let not this weak, unknowing hand
Presume Thy bolts to throw
 And deal damnation round the land,
On each I judge Thy foe."

J. O. Corliss.
