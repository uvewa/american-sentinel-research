# A Good Protest.

It is most encouraging to see how the people generally are becoming aroused over the subject of religious legislation. It shows that the spirit of the Reformation is not wholly dead yet. There are many who utter manly protests to the spirit which would turn this Government into an adjunct of the Pope of Rome. This matter has become one of the leading questions of the day, as is shown by the prominence given it by the secular press, both editorially and by communications. The following is the latter half of an article in the Fresno (Cal.) *Expositor* of January 17, upon the subject of “The Blair Bills:”—

> “Another ground of protest we have to present is that both these bills are unchristian. That is, they are contrary to the teachings of Christ, in whose name and for whose glory they are presented. Jesus never authorized his church to legislate in his name. He never left any credentials behind empowering his followers in any churchly capacity to force his institutions and his doctrines upon the people. We have the commission to his ministers given quite plainly in Matt. 28:19, 20, and elsewhere. They were to teach the nations and baptize. But no one was to be baptized unless he believed, and no one to believe and be baptized unless he saw fit, and no one was to be taught unless he chose; but the Blair scheme proposes to teach people whether they choose or not; they want the power of Government behind them so they can corral the people and teach them whether they will or will not. This is the gospel with a vengeance, indeed. Whether or not they propose to baptize those whom they teach, and make them join the church, the bill does not inform us. Certain it is, however, if they have the right to do the one they have the right to do the rest. “Whosoever will,” says Jesus. Rev. 22:17. This is the divine key-note. The apostles caught the spirit of their Master and said, “Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord we persuade men.” 2 Cor. 5:11. Yes, persuade men. And again, “The weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds.” 2 Cor. 10:4.

> “Senator Blair’s weapon is coercion (tolerably carnal), and is mighty, through the legal arm, to the pulling down of civil and religious liberty.
> “We take the stand that Congress has no right to pass a Sunday law. This is legislating in favor of establishing religion and religious institutions. Th is Congress has no right to do. We do not believe in the divine right of kings and Congresses. Those who are so forward to help the Lord in his own business, would better attend to their own affairs and take a course of lessons in common modesty. Civil government has no more right to pass laws in the interest of Sunday than it has to pass laws in the interest of baptism or psalm singing. Congress has the same right to decree that everybody shall keep Sunday, or Saturday, or Monday, or any other day, as it has to decree that everybody shall be baptized and make a public profession of religion [and no more]. To civil government we say, Hands off religion. Look to the happiness, material prosperity, and moral and social rights of the citizen, and you will fulfill the ends of your existence. As to religion, the United States Senate long ago said: ‘Our Constitution recognizes no other power but persuasion for enforcing religious observances.’
> “Roger Williams, banished for his Baptist principles, said: ‘The public or the magistrates may decide what is due from men to men, but when they attempt to prescribe a man’s duty to God they are out of place, and there can be no safety.’ All of this we respectfully commend to Senator Blair and his friends. Would that our words could be transformed into trumpet tones, that the people of this Nation might be aroused to the danger germinant in these bills. This hateful, meddling spirit bears with it the same old ear-marks that attached to ecclesiastical despotism all along the way from Constantine the Great down to and through the twelve centuries of Popish domination, and from Star Chamber times and Salem withcraft courts on to the end of the chapter. We protest, and repeat, There is danger in the Blair measures, although they are of Protestant birth, and in the tutorage of Protestant ecclesiastics!
> “Friends of civil and religious liberty everywhere, protest! protest!! protest!!!
> “We are not alarmed over a small matter. Every despotism that ever cursed the world began in an innocent way, but the beginning was not the end.”
Our correspondent from the Louisville Prohibition Conference says of Rev. Green Clay Smith: “From his address, and also from a private conversation I had with him, I learned that he and many others of the Prohibition party are opposed to the policy they are running into, of favoring civil laws to compel the observance of religious institutions. He, with many others, is heartily in favor of prohibition being carried in connection with good civil government, but does not want the party to set itself up as the advocate of civil law to compel religious observance.”

In opening the recent Chicago Sunday-law meeting, Dr. J. L. Withrow said:—

> “How many people in Chicago, if it was put to a vote, would vote that there should be no Sabbath? How big a vote could you get on that side of the question? A very small one. Very well, we shall only ask that unnecessary labor shall be stopped on that day, and that places productive of crime and debauchery shall at least be closed one day in the week. What man can afford to refuse us this?”

Surely this is but a little thing. Even the keepers of the places productive of crime and debauchery ought to be willing to divide the time with these men. All they ask for is a monopoly of the Sunday, and they are willing to grant the dive keepers a monopoly of the other six days of the week. Is it not a little thing? [79-80]

Note.—No papers are sent by the publishers of the American Sentinel to people who have not subscribed for it. If the Sentinel comes to one who has not subscribed for it, he may know that it is sent him by some friend, and that he will not be called upon by the publishers to pay for the same.

At the Sunday-law meeting in Chicago, March 3, under the auspices of the “Sabbath Observance Association,” there were 3,000 people present.

The Chicago *Tribune* thinks that the Sundaylaw agitation in that city at the present time is simply a movement to influence the coming city election, and says: “There will be more confidence in these Sunday-closing meetings when they are held in some other month than March.” The people who are in the movement, however, are very sanguine, and expect large and definite results.

The Rev. Green Clay Smith gave the address of welcome at the Prohibition Council in Louisville, Ky., February 13, and said, among other good things: “The Sabbath-day and its observance has been agitated. Many want a statute in favor of Sunday. I think Sunday observance ought to be left to the churches, and not be touched by the civil government.” We think so, too, but our friends of the American Sunday Union accuse us of pandering to saloon men, etc. Will they also accuse Rev. Green Clay Smith, Prohition candidate for President in 1876, and still a prominent leader in the Prohibition party, of being in sympathy with the saloons? It will not be long before candid people will see that Sunday legislation has no connection whatever with temperance, and that a man may be a temperance man, a Christian, and a loyal American citizen, and still be opposed to Sunday laws.

At the recent Sunday-law meeting in Chicago, the president of the Jesuit College, who was one of the speakers, said:—

> “This movement has the approval of all Catholics, and for Catholics there is one other consideration—keeping the day holy is prescribed as a matter of strict obligation. There is to be a cessation of all labor as performed on week days, and it shall be a sober day, and be made notable by the closing of tippling-houses and dram-shops. The church claims the right to make it a holy day, and no man shall say nay.”—*From Report in Chicago Tribune, March 4.*

That shows what kind of a “civil Sunday” they want. Yet in that very meeting it was claimed that their movement was “a movement for the working classes.” So it is, a movement to compel them to stop work on Sunday, whether they want to or not.

If Cardinal Gibbons was sincere when he uttered the words quoted in the following paragraph, and if they mean what they appear to on their face, the National Reformers would do well to take some lessons of him. They are from a recent speech in Philadelphia, at the anniversary dinner of the Catholic Club, which was reported in the *Catholic* of February 16:—

> “For my part, and I say it boldly, I much prefer the system which obtains in our country, where the Church is Sustained by the voluntary contributions of the faithful, as contrasted with the customs which prevail in portions of Catholic Europe, where the Church is supported at the expense of the Government. The Church has to pay often very dearly for this support that is given to her by the State. It is but a very feeble and inadequate compensation for the wholesale confiscation of her property. Moreover, the ministers of religion are deprived of the liberty and the exercise of their exalted functions, and exposed to many annoyances to which, thanks be to God, we are utter strangers in this country.

> “I hope the day will never come when we will be obliged to call upon the State to build our churches; for if they build our churches they may dictate to us what doctrine we are to preach or what we are not to preach.”
The following is our correspondent’s summing up of the Louisville Prohibition Council: “Taking the convention from first to last, it could be said to be little besides a heated discussion of woman suffrage. So much did it appear so that one gentleman said in convention that he had felt tempted to present a resolution in favor of prohibition, but was afraid it would not pass, or would be ignored because of the intense interest and excitement over the woman suffrage question.” It seems that the Prohibitionists are not doing anything just yet in the way of temperance; they are getting a good ready, and by and by they intend to astonish the country. We have known people who expended all their strength getting ready to do a work, and so never accomplished anything. We think it will be so in this case.
