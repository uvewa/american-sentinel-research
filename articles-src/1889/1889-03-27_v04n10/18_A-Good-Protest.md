# A Good Protest.

It is most encouraging to see how the people generally are becoming aroused over the subject of religious legislation. It shows that the spirit of the Reformation is not wholly dead yet. There are many who utter manly protests to the spirit which would turn this Government into an adjunct of the Pope of Rome. This matter has become one of the leading questions of the day, as is shown by the prominence given it by the secular press, both editorially and by communications. The following is the latter half of an article in the Fresno (Cal.) *Expositor* of January 17, upon the subject of "The Blair Bills:"—

> "Another ground of protest we have to present is that both these bills are unchristian. That is, they are contrary to the teachings of Christ, in whose name and for whose glory they are presented. Jesus never authorized his church to legislate in his name. He never left any credentials behind empowering his followers in any churchly capacity to force his institutions and his doctrines upon the people. We have the commission to his ministers given quite plainly in Matt. 28:19, 20, and elsewhere. They were to teach the nations and baptize. But no one was to be baptized unless he believed, and no one to believe and be baptized unless he saw fit, and no one was to be taught unless he chose; but the Blair scheme proposes to teach people whether they choose or not; they want the power of Government behind them so they can corral the people and teach them whether they will or will not. This is the gospel with a vengeance, indeed. Whether or not they propose to baptize those whom they teach, and make them join the church, the bill does not inform us. Certain it is, however, if they have the right to do the one they have the right to do the rest. "Whosoever will," says Jesus. Rev. 22:17. This is the divine key-note. The apostles caught the spirit of their Master and said, "Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord we persuade men." 2 Cor. 5:11. Yes, persuade men. And again, "The weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds." 2 Cor. 10:4.

> "Senator Blair's weapon is coercion (tolerably carnal), and is mighty, through the legal arm, to the pulling down of civil and religious liberty.
> "We take the stand that Congress has no right to pass a Sunday law. This is legislating in favor of establishing religion and religious institutions. Th is Congress has no right to do. We do not believe in the divine right of kings and Congresses. Those who are so forward to help the Lord in his own business, would better attend to their own affairs and take a course of lessons in common modesty. Civil government has no more right to pass laws in the interest of Sunday than it has to pass laws in the interest of baptism or psalm singing. Congress has the same right to decree that everybody shall keep Sunday, or Saturday, or Monday, or any other day, as it has to decree that everybody shall be baptized and make a public profession of religion [and no more]. To civil government we say, Hands off religion. Look to the happiness, material prosperity, and moral and social rights of the citizen, and you will fulfill the ends of your existence. As to religion, the United States Senate long ago said: 'Our Constitution recognizes no other power but persuasion for enforcing religious observances.'
> "Roger Williams, banished for his Baptist principles, said: 'The public or the magistrates may decide what is due from men to men, but when they attempt to prescribe a man's duty to God they are out of place, and there can be no safety.' All of this we respectfully commend to Senator Blair and his friends. Would that our words could be transformed into trumpet tones, that the people of this Nation might be aroused to the danger germinant in these bills. This hateful, meddling spirit bears with it the same old ear-marks that attached to ecclesiastical despotism all along the way from Constantine the Great down to and through the twelve centuries of Popish domination, and from Star Chamber times and Salem withcraft courts on to the end of the chapter. We protest, and repeat, There is danger in the Blair measures, although they are of Protestant birth, and in the tutorage of Protestant ecclesiastics!
> "Friends of civil and religious liberty everywhere, protest! protest!! protest!!!
> "We are not alarmed over a small matter. Every despotism that ever cursed the world began in an innocent way, but the beginning was not the end."
