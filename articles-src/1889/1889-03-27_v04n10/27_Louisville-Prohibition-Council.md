The following is our correspondent's summing up of the Louisville Prohibition Council: "Taking the convention from first to last, it could be said to be little besides a heated discussion of woman suffrage. So much did it appear so that one gentleman said in convention that he had felt tempted to present a resolution in favor of prohibition, but was afraid it would not pass, or would be ignored because of the intense interest and excitement over the woman suffrage question." It seems that the Prohibitionists are not doing anything just yet in the way of temperance; they are getting a good ready, and by and by they intend to astonish the country. We have known people who expended all their strength getting ready to do a work, and so never accomplished anything. We think it will be so in this case.
