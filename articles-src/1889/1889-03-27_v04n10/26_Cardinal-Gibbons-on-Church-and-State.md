If Cardinal Gibbons was sincere when he uttered the words quoted in the following paragraph, and if they mean what they appear to on their face, the National Reformers would do well to take some lessons of him. They are from a recent speech in Philadelphia, at the anniversary dinner of the Catholic Club, which was reported in the *Catholic* of February 16:—

> "For my part, and I say it boldly, I much prefer the system which obtains in our country, where the Church is Sustained by the voluntary contributions of the faithful, as contrasted with the customs which prevail in portions of Catholic Europe, where the Church is supported at the expense of the Government. The Church has to pay often very dearly for this support that is given to her by the State. It is but a very feeble and inadequate compensation for the wholesale confiscation of her property. Moreover, the ministers of religion are deprived of the liberty and the exercise of their exalted functions, and exposed to many annoyances to which, thanks be to God, we are utter strangers in this country.

> "I hope the day will never come when we will be obliged to call upon the State to build our churches; for if they build our churches they may dictate to us what doctrine we are to preach or what we are not to preach."
