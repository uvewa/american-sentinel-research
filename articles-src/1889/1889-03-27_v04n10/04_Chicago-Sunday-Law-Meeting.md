A great meeting for the discussion of Sunday observance and how to secure it, was held in Central Music Hall, Chicago, Sunday afternoon, March 3. The meeting was presided over by the Rev. Dr. Withrow, of the Third Presbyterian Church. Among the speakers were the following gentlemen: Professor Scott, of the First Congregational Church; the Rev. Dr. Barrows, of the First Presbyterian; Rev. Dr. Hansen, of the First Baptist; Rev. Dr. Bolton, of the First Methodist; Rev. J. Coleman Adams, of the Universalist; Father Higgins, President of the Jesuit College; Rev. N. C. Ranseen, of the Swedish Lutheran, and other leading ministers. The meeting was held under the auspices of the Sabbath Observance Association. One or two representatives of the Knights of Labor also made short speeches, and thus the meeting was slightly relieved of its ecclesiastical coloring. Sundaylaw meetings usually present the appearance of a religious conference. Isn't it strange that very few people besides ministers take any interest in the workingman? Several extracts from the speeches, with comments, appear in this number of the Sentinel.
