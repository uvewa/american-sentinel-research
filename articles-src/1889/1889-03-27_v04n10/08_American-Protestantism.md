# American Protestantism.

A Protestant in fact is one who would make all forms of religious faith equal in the eyes of the law. That form of Protestant which recognizes the right of free thought and free speech, for all men, provided they speak and act as he does, is the European type. That which recognizes the right of free thought and free speech, in those who think and speak differently from what we do, is the American type. This is quite plainly implied in the words of the Declaration of Independence. All men are created free and equal. In the Constitution we have the plainest recognition of the new development of Protestantism, in the words, “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.”

The fact so often referred to by the opponents of secular government, that a class of divines have, ever since the adoption of the Constitution, been giving expression to dissatisfaction, is an exemplification of their lack of capacity to grasp the American idea of civil government, rather than a proof of any error in the system. The same sagacity that perceived that men could govern themselves in civil affairs without a king, was not slow to discern that the interests of religion were served by having it depend on its own intrinsic merits, without being recognized by the State.

The experience of the framers of the Constitution could only serve to demonstrate the folly of intrusting the best of men with civil power to execute the will of God. The Salem witchcraft affair, the proscription of the Baptists, and the [77] flogging and hanging of the Quakers, served to engraft in their minds the scion of American Protestantism. We believe that a candid investigation of the cause that led to these acts will incline every unprejudiced individual to decide as they did, that it is unsafe to trust fallible men with civil power to enforce any religious observances. Were the men who made their memory odious by participating in these persecutions, men of corrupt minds? Did they belong to a venal age? Were they mere hypocrites? Would not their religious faith, if judged by the Bible standard, compare favorably with any of the sects of these days? We believe no charge of this kind could be sustained. Does not the whole secret lie in the fact that the idea of a union of Church and State had not been eradicated from their minds?—*“A. M.” in Kansas Worker.*
