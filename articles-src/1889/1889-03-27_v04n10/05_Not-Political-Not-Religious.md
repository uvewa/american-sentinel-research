Our friends who are making such great efforts to secure legislation in behalf of Sunday, say that they ask for it only on civil grounds. They disclaim any thought of wanting "Sabbath laws" in the interest of religion. Doubtless all who were concerned in the Sunday-law mass-meeting held in Chicago, on Sunday, March 3, would make the same claim. Yet they one and all declared that their movement was not in any sense political. The Rev. Dr. Lorimer said that he did not want to be a party to any political movement. So says the Chicago *News,* which also adds: "The Rev. Dr. Withrow, pastor of the Third Presbyterian Church, and chairman of the meeting, said there was no politics in it, and other speakers agreed with him." Well, then, what is in it? Between their efforts to make people believe that they are not in politics, and their still more strenuous efforts to make it appear that they are not working in behalf of religion, many ministers nowadays have a pretty busy time of it.
