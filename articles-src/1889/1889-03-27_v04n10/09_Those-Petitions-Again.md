# Those Petitions Again.

The Kev. A. J. Nelson, secretary of the San Francisco District of the American Sabbath Union, feels considerably stirred up because a petition against the Sunday-Rest bill has been introduced into Congress, signed by 31,575 Californians. He says that it “may be true” that there are 30,000 people in California who would sign such a petition, but comforts himself with the belief that there are 100,000 who would sign a petition in favor of the bill. Well, it not only “may be true,” but it *is* true, that a good many more than 30,000 adults in California have protested against the bill; and there are thousands more who will sign it. We don’t know how big a list can be rolled up in favor of the bill; but if its friends on this coast proceed according to the rules of the American Sunday Union, and get the autographs of a few prominent men, they will doubtless go before Congress with something like a million petitioners from California, as there are about that many people,—men, women, children, and babies,—in this State.

He says that the canvassers for signatures to these petitions “set forth that the Blair bill was a Roman Catholic movement in the interest of the union of Church and State. Most of these signatures were procured by this false statement. No doubt the saloonists all signed it.” There seems to be some strange fatality about this Sunday business, that soon deprives those who work for it of the power to correctly represent a matter. How does Mr. Nelson know how “most of these signatures” were obtained? Was he around with the canvassers? No; he knows nothing whatever about it. His statement is a sample of the reckless assertions that are made by the Sundaylaw workers, to cast contempt on an opposition which they cannot meet by argument.

As a matter of fact, we know that the canvassers for the anti-Sunday petition did not “set forth that the Blair bill was a Roman Catholic movement.” On the contrary, the American Sentinel has repeatedly pointed out that the Roman Catholics have had little or nothing to do with it, notwithstanding Cardinal Gibbons’s letter, by which Mr. Crafts and his fellow-craftsmen have sought to make the country believe that all the Catholics signed their petition. Mr. Nelson has not been in the business long enough to learn the ropes. He does not know that it is the policy of his chief to make the people believe that all the Roman Catholics, and everybody else, are in favor of the Sunday bill. Mr. Crafts will not thank him for disclaiming the Catholics as his fellow-workers in the movement. It is the Sunday folks themselves who have set forth that the Blair bill met the hearty approbation of 7,200,000 Catholics in this country, including the little children, all of whom they set forth as being twenty-one years of age or more. It is not probable that a single Roman Catholic has signed the petition in favor of the bill, although a few may have done so; but we know that scores of Catholics, priests as well as lay members, have signed the protest to the bill. Would they have signed the protest if the canvassers had been setting forth that the bill is a Roman Catholic measure?

To say that the signatures were obtained by false pretense is to charge the judges, lawyers, doctors, teachers, and other professional men who signed the remonstrance, with being easily duped. Such a charge will not hold, any more than will the implied charge that most of the signers were saloon keepers. We have before mentioned that in one California town of about 7,000 inhabitants, over 1,300 signatures were obtained. We don’t believe that any Californian will admit that there is any small town in the State that contained that number of saloon keepers or adult ignoramuses.

When Theodore Tilton was editor of the New York *Independent,* he remarked concerning a snarling contemporary that its bad blood was owing to its poor circulation. We opine that it is something like that with our Sunday-law friends. If they could point to one-fourth of 230,000 actual individual signatures already obtained, they would not feel so bad. If they could only purge themselves of the dishonesty of the act of going before Congress claiming to have 14,174,744 petitioners on the strength of only 407 actual signatures, and could make it appear to be a legitimate transaction, they would regard 230,000 opposers as the merest trifle.

A moment’s calculation will show anyone that if for each signature that we have obtained, we should claim as many petitioners as they do, we should have the handsome number of 98,749,680 petitioners in the United States, against the Blair bill, or one and one-half times as many people as there are in the United States! This would give a surplus to use in case of an emergency. When the Sunday Union people, with their knowledge of multiplication, consider the possibilities in 230,000 signatures, no wonder they are troubled. But they need not fear that we shall follow their example.
