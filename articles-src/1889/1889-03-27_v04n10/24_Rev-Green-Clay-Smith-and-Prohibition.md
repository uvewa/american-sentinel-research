The Rev. Green Clay Smith gave the address of welcome at the Prohibition Council in Louisville, Ky., February 13, and said, among other good things: "The Sabbath-day and its observance has been agitated. Many want a statute in favor of Sunday. I think Sunday observance ought to be left to the churches, and not be touched by the civil government." We think so, too, but our friends of the American Sunday Union accuse us of pandering to saloon men, etc. Will they also accuse Rev. Green Clay Smith, Prohibition candidate for President in 1876, and still a prominent leader in the Prohibition party, of being in sympathy with the saloons? It will not be long before candid people will see that Sunday legislation has no connection whatever with temperance, and that a man may be a temperance man, a Christian, and a loyal American citizen, and still be opposed to Sunday laws.
