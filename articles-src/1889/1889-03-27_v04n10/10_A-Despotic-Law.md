# A Despotic Law.

Editor American Sentinel—*Dear Sir:* The *Mercury* (Manhattan, Kan.), Vol. 5, No. 244, in an editorial, speaks as follows: “In the last quarter of the nineteenth century in this alleged free country, the governor of Vermont has approved the law in regard to the enforcement of prohibition in that State, which reads as follows: ‘It shall be the duty of any sheriff or his deputy or any constable to search without warrant any wagon, carriage, cart, sleigh, sled, . . . trunk, box, hand-bag, satchel, bundle, or clothing conveyed or worn along any road or street in the State for intoxicating liquor, if he thinks there is a chance of finding any by so doing.’ It is also stipulated that the officer is entitled to one-fourth of the fine imposed. Under this law an officer can walk up to a man, seize his hand-bag, if he has one, or go through his pockets by simply giving as a reason that he wants to ascertain if he has any liquor about him. He can also subject a woman to the same process. You may search the Russian statutes for edicts, but you will find nothing where the personal liberty of the citizen is so restricted, or where the despotic spirit of tyranny is more completely shown.”

We can only expect in the near future, after the passage of the Blair bill or anything similar to it, just as unjust laws in regard to religious matters. People’s dwellings and places of business will be ordered searched or watched to ascertain if any labor or play of any sort whatever is done or participated in. Don’t understand me to say that some religious legislation is right. Not so! far from it, for such legislation destroys religious freedom, and only begets tyranny and despotism.S. H. Carnahan.
