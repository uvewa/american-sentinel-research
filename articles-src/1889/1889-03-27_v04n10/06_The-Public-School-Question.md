# The Public School Question.

Under the above heading, in *America* of December 13, 1888, Prof. Charles Kendall Adams, President of Cornell University, discusses the recent agitation in Boston, and, indeed, in the whole country, consequent upon the exclusion of Swinton’s “Outlines of the World’s History” from the public schools because of its teaching concerning the Reformation. While the article contains a few statements concerning the Reformation which we cannot accept, we can heartily agree with all that is said in the following on the matter of religious freedom. Coming from the source it does, it should command careful attention:—

> “It is undoubtedly going too far to say that this country was founded on the idea of political and religious freedom. The Puritans were not tolerant of what they regarded as heresy. To use Franklin’s figure, we may say that they were strenuous believers in their own ‘doxy,’ and that they were equally strenuous disbelievers in the ‘doxy’ of anybody else. No one of them had the courage and wit to say, with Sydney Smith, that he should never be perfectly happy till he had dined off a roasted Quaker; but that seems to have been about the way very many of them felt. Nor was this feeling confined to New England. There was a kindred intolerance in the South. The settlers of this country were undoubtedly advancing toward religious freedom; but they had yet a long road to travel before they could reach the goal. But, nevertheless, there was but one ending to the road on which they had entered.

> “As the country came to be filled up with differing peoples and sects, there was absolutely no other way than either to live in interminable discord, or to agree to live in absolute toleration and peace. Our forefathers wisely chose the latter alternative. And so, when the State Constitutions and the National Constitution came to be adopted, the only logical course was to exclude entirely from the domain of political and governmental consideration all questions of religious profession and belief. In the Constitution of the United States, and in the Constitutions of the individual States, laws discriminating against any particular form of belief or disbelief are, as a rule, prohibited. In general, it may be said that ever since the formation of the Government, persons of any form of religious belief, and persons of any form of disbelief, have been equally eligible to any of the political offices in the gift of the Government or the people. This is tantamount to a constitutional declaration, or at least admission, that no one form of belief or disbelief is essential to the successful performance of the duties of any political office. If not essential to an officer, still less would any particular form of belief seem to be necessary to a private citizen.
> “This line of reasoning brings us to the obvious necessity of erecting a barrier against any obligatory religious instruction whatever. Indeed, such instruction can logically be required only in a State which officially recognizes some particular form of religious belief. Our constitutional limitations on this subject, therefore, are but the natural expression of positive necessity.
> “We are brought still more obviously to the same conclusion in another way. Even if we were to admit the necessity of teaching some form of religious truth in our schools, the question would at once confront us as to what form we should teach. And the moment the question is raised we are brought face to face with the fact that in our body politic there is no one set of men authorized to answer it. Shall a majority answer it? But there is no way in which a majority can possibly perform so complicated an act as to exercise discriminating judgment upon the countless details of a great body of religious doctrine.
> “But even if it were claimed that such a judgment could be exercised by chosen representatives, there would still be the embarrassing fact that there are a hundred forms of belief; in other words, that there would be a hundred tickets in the field at the same election, and on the same question. Either the question would have to be stripped of all those details which constitute the characteristics of the different religious denominations, and thus be reduced to a question of simple morality, or it would be absolutely necessary that a hundred questions should be submitted at once, and, consequently, that the right to decide between them should be conferred on a mere plurality. But a plurality is often a minority. If a mere plurality were given the privilege of deciding such a question, the inevitable result would ensue that, occasionally, at least, a minority would have the privilege of enforcing obnoxious doctrines upon the majority. Would such a result be tolerated? In a community where a plurality, let us say, are Unitarians, would Trinitarians consent to have their children taught doctrines that are sharply opposed to the Trinity? Would Protestants submit to have their children taught the doctrines of Catholics merely because Catholics happened in a given district or city to be more numerous than any other religious body? The answer is too obvious to require hesitation.
> “But even if we were to allow the matter to be determined by a clear majority, we should not be released from logical difficulties. However it may have been during the colonial period, it is certainly true that ever since we became a united Government under the Constitution we have persistently and systematically denied to a majority the right to impose any particular form of religious belief upon a minority. To demand that this fundamental principle, which has, in fact, become a part of the bone and fiber of our people, should be set aside, is simply to ask our civilization to face about and march in the opposite direction; for if there is anything which the civilization of the last 300 years has been saying in louder tones than anything else, it is that a majority has no right to enforce its religious beliefs on a minority. This carries with it also the postulate that no one man has a right to enforce his beliefs on any one of his fellow-men. Just as truly it follows that no one man, or body of men, has a right to enforce certain beliefs upon the children of other men. And unless we hold that when we elect a School Board we give them religious as well as educational supervision over our children, it follows that neither School Board nor teacher has any right to impose, as an obligation, any particular form of religious belief upon any pupil.”
