At the recent Sunday-law meeting in Chicago, the president of the Jesuit College, who was one of the speakers, said:—

> "This movement has the approval of all Catholics, and for Catholics there is one other consideration—keeping the day holy is prescribed as a matter of strict obligation. There is to be a cessation of all labor as performed on week days, and it shall be a sober day, and be made notable by the closing of tippling-houses and dram-shops. The church claims the right to make it a holy day, and no man shall say nay."—*From Report in Chicago Tribune, March 4.*

That shows what kind of a "civil Sunday" they want. Yet in that very meeting it was claimed that their movement was "a movement for the working classes." So it is, a movement to compel them to stop work on Sunday, whether they want to or not.
