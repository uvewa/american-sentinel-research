The *Genesee Valley Post* (Belmont, N. Y.) has a correspondent signing himself "Clericus," who writes in the following manner, which shows that he has a clear perception of the situation:—

> "It seems to be a fact that a movement is on foot to legislate on the Sabbath question. Some men, seeing the evil of this, thought it would blind the opposition by saying it was only a 'civil rest- day' we wanted, and not in the interests of any *day* for the Sabbath. This mask, however, is thrown off by the prime movers, and it is frankly stated that religious worship and Sabbath observance is what they seek to promote by civil enactment. If this movement proves successful, then it is plain that those in the minority will be sufferers, being robbed of one-sixth their time which they conscientiously believe God commands them to use in secular labor. The injustice of this is apparent to every lover of humanity."
