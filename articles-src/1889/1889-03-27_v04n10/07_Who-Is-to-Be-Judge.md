# Who Is to Be Judge?

In his speech before the National Sunday Convention, in Washington, in accepting the presidency of the American Sunday Union, Col. Elliott F. Shepard said:—

> "Every man, woman, and child in our country is going to be judged by the fourth commandment."

We do not in the least question the truthfulness of this statement; we believe it. But a question which is of very great importance is, By whom are they to be judged? In the Bible we read of "God the judge of all;" and that "he hath appointed a day in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath given assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead." Acts 17: 31. And we also read that "we must all appear before the judgment-seat of Christ; that everyone may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad." 2 Cor. 5:10. But these texts do not seem to have any connection with a National Sunday law.

Remember that this remark by Colonel Shepard was a part of his speech in favor of a Sunday law. Now if in his reference to the judgment, he meant the general Judgment at the last day, there could be no argument in it for a Sunday law, for the Lord already has a law by which to judge the world, and human enactments, even though they were perfectly in harmony with it, could not add anything to its power. It must be that he intends for this Government to judge every man, women, and child on the basis of the fourth commandment. If this is not putting whoever shall be at the head of the judiciary in this Government in the place of God, we do not know how the thing could be done.

Whichever way you look at it, Mr. Shepard's speech shows that religious legislation is what they are after. If they say that the Government is to do the judging of violations of the fourth commandment, then they show that they are usurping God's place as Judge of all. If the United States should proceed to judge a man for violating a law of Germany, it would soon find itself in trouble; and can we think that God will be any less tolerant of infringements upon his prerogatives? Let the United States Government proceed to enforce the fourth commandment, and to judge men for violation thereof, and it will find that although the trouble may be delayed, it will be terrible when it does come.

If, however, they disclaim any idea of having United States judges passing judgment in place of God, and say that God himself is to be the Judge, but that this country is merely to pass laws so that the people will be prepared for a favorable verdict in that great day, then they admit that their Sunday legislation is religious legislation. By that very act they deny that religion is a man's personal relation of faith and obedience to God. They make the Jaw of the land do more than the work of a preacher; they make it compel men to prepare for the judgment of God, whether they wish to or not.

We believe that all men ought to keep all the commandments of God; but we protest against the plan of turning the Government into a religious machine, for the manufacture of machine Christians. When they pass their Sunday law, the United States will be a vast religious machine, but it will make, not Christians, but only the semblance of Christians, and that means hypocrites. Before that time the Christianity will have disappeared entirely from the religion of the land. Religion and State may be united, but Christianity and State never can be.
