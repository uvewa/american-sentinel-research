# Is It Treason?

The Rev. J. Boring Gold said in his speech at the great Chicago Sunday meeting, March 3:— "It should be understood first and last that this is America, not Europe, and the laws say expressly that no work, save that of necessity and charity, shall be performed on the Sabbath. The man who does not subscribe to the doctrine of Sabbath observance is a traitor to his country, and should be treated as such."

Bold words! Let Americans who love liberty, and who know what true patriotism is, make a note of them. "The man who does not subscribe to Sabbath observance is a traitor, and should be treated as such." By Sabbath observance he means Sunday observance, of course. Now mark the heartless tyranny that is deliberately advocated by this Sunday partisan. A man may be a strict observer of the seventh day, and thus a subscriber to Sabbath observance as he finds it enjoined in the sacred Scriptures; he may have given years of his life, and may have shed his blood, in defense of his country; he may be a tax-payer, and a quiet, hard-working, law-abiding citizen; but if he doesn't bow the knee to the "venerable day of the sun," he must be treated as a traitor. Such a position is simply abominable, and cannot be denounced in too strong terms. It shows that when the State takes religious institutions under its protection, it will not lack for inquisitors.

We do not know the gentleman who made that speech, but we should not be at all surprised if he had never seen this country when many loyal, native-born Americans, whom he denounces as traitors, were periling their lives for the country. We think it is high time for American people to begin to wake up to what is going on. [81]
