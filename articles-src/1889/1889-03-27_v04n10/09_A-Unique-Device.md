# "A Unique Device."

At a Sunday-law meeting held in Oakland two years ago, some resolutions were presented, and in order to be able to record a unanimous vote in favor of them, the chairman did not call for the negative. If he had done so, he could not have stated that there was no opposition; for there were a good many in the audience who would have voted against them. But Dr. Withrow adopted a plan at the Chicago meeting which leaves the Oakland method entirely in the shade. Says the Chicago *Times:—*

> "At the close of Father Higgins's remarks, Dr. Withrow adopted a unique device to obtain an expression upon the resolutions previously read. He asked that all in favor of them signify their approval by leaving the hall in a decorous manner."

That was certainly "a unique device," and no doubt the Doctor thought it very clever. From the standpoint of Sunday-law morality it was doubtless all right; but, from the standpoint of strict morality, it was certainly dishonest. There were, no doubt, scores, and perhaps hundreds, of people in that congregation who were opposed to the resolutions, one of which called upon the Legislature to amend existing Sunday laws so that they would be more strict. Yet because those persons were respectable people, and conducted themselves in an orderly manner, they must be counted as favoring what they in heart oppose, and they are deprived of power to protest. The trick, for it was nothing else, was an effort to make it appear that all opposition to Sunday laws comes from the hoodlum element. A movement that will lead ministers of the gospel to adopt such obviously unfair methods in its support, must be inherently wrong, and should receive the hearty opposition of all honest men. Truth is never advanced by fraud; and the fact that the Sunday-law movement flourishes by just such methods, is evidence of its iniquitous character.
