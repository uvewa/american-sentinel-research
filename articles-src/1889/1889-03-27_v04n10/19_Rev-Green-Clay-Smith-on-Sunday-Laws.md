Our correspondent from the Louisville Prohibition Conference says of Rev. Green Clay Smith: "From his address, and also from a private conversation I had with him, I learned that he and many others of the Prohibition party are opposed to the policy they are running into, of favoring civil laws to compel the observance of religious institutions. He, with many others, is heartily in favor of prohibition being carried in connection with good civil government, but does not want the party to set itself up as the advocate of civil law to compel religious observance."
