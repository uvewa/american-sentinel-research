# An Inconsistency.

No one will deny that the denominations of our land are seeking for closer unity with each other. We may take the Methodist, Presbyterian, Congregationalist, Lutheran, Baptist, and Protestant Episcopal Churches as the great representative bodies of Protestantism. These churches all claim to be Christian churches. Each one recognizes all the others as branches of the Christian church. Many leading men in these denominations recognize the Roman and Greek Catholic Churches also as branches of the Christian church. They say that the Christian church is made up, not of one of these sects, but of all, with some minor ones included; and their union is devoutly to be hoped for and labored for. Many, in fact, contend that they are already united in essentials; that they are all only divisions of one great army. Their aggregate work and progress is counted as the work of the Christian church. None who are informed will deny any of the foregoing statements.

These bodies are also endeavoring to place certain laws called *Christian* in the statute law of our Government. They are charged with attempting to unite Church and State. But what do they reply? "We are utterly opposed to a union of Church and State; we are in favor of liberty of conscience." But why the desire for these laws? And if passed, will they not be in effect a union of Church and State? "No; not by any means. These laws are not in favor of any sect or denomination; the majority agree with them. All denominations of note are united in these measures."

Mark the inconsistency. When the churches wish to get nearer together, they are all parts of *the one Christian church.* But when this combination has its religious notions common to the majority crystallized into law, it ceases to be *the one Christian church,* because to admit this would be to admit the union of Church and State. They are one church religiously considered, but not politically considered. But logic and truth demand that if they together compose a church *now,* they together will compose a church when their tenets are made a part of statute law. And legislation on what all these branches of this one church hold in common will be nothing else than a union of Church and State; and that means persecution to those who may dissent from this so-called creed of the so-called Christian church..
