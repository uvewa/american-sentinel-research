The Chicago *Tribune* thinks that the Sundaylaw agitation in that city at the present time is simply a movement to influence the coming city election, and says: "There will be more confidence in these Sunday-closing meetings when they are held in some other month than March." The people who are in the movement, however, are very sanguine, and expect large and definite results.
