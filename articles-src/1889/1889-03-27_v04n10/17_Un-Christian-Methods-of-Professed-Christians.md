# Un-Christian Methods of Professed Christians.

The Kev. Dr. Withrow, who is the leading spirit in the Chicago movement to secure Sunday observance by law, was interviewed by a *Tribune *reporter the day before the great meeting in Music Hall, when he said: "I do not believe that the foreigners—so-called—are opposed to a Christian observance of the Sabbath." In that one sentence he showed the animus of the whole thing—it is the "Christian observance of the Sabbath" that they want, and the interests of the church are the great ends kept in view.

He says that he does not believe that foreigners are opposed to a Christian observance of the Sabbath. Neither do we. In fact, we don't know of anybody who is opposed to a Christian observance of the Sabbath. We are not, by any means. But we are decidedly opposed to have unchristian observance of the Sabbath, such as would be secured by a civil Sunday law. A "Christian observance of the Sabbath" would be, waiving all discussion as to which day is the Sabbath, the observance of the Sabbath by Christians, on purely Christian grounds, namely, the commandment of the Lord. Nobody is opposed to this. Christians may keep Sabbath as strictly as they please, and they may take whichever day they please as the Sabbath, and nobody will object. Nobody could hinder them from so doing, even if they did object.

But when professed Christians attempt to have the State compel all men to observe the Sabbath, no matter what religion they profess, or whether they profess at all, then whatever Christianity there may be in the observance of the day vanishes. There is no Christianity in enforced compliance with any religious custom, no matter how proper that custom may be. We remember reading the remark of an inhabitant of Rhode Island, who, in Puritan days, chanced to stray over the line into Connecticut, and saw a man being whipped for non-attendance at church. It was a new experience to the man who was acquainted only with the true Christian theory of civil government as set forth by Roger Williams, and, settling himself in his saddle, so as to be able to save himself by instant flight, he said to the persecutors: "You serve the Lord as though the devil was in you."

We have often thought of the aptness of that remark, and we cannot help thinking of it when men talk about enforcing the Christian observance of the Sabbath, and of treating as traitors all who do not subscribe to their creed in that respect.
