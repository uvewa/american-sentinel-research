# Shall We Have a National Religion?

Under this heading a lawyer gives, in the Decatur (Texas) *Post* of February 1, 1889, the following brief but just analysis of the object of the Blair bills:—

No doubt the great majority of the people of this part of the country would be utterly opposed to anything like a union of Church and State, or the establishment of a national religion, yet some may never duly consider the fact that there are measures now pending in Congress which are believed by many to have direct tendency in that way. Reference is here made to the Blair Sunday bill and Constitutional Amendment, introduced into the United States Senate last spring by Senator Blair, of New Hampshire. The object of the bill is to compel everybody over which it would have jurisdiction to absolutely refrain from any labor or business whatsoever (works of necessity and mercy excepted) on Sunday, regardless of religious conviction or commercial conveniences, and makes the violator subject to a fine of $10 to $1,000, and provides that it "may be recovered by whoever shall first sue for the same." "Whoever" is a universal term, and leaves the man who is supposed to have violated the law at the mercy of any and everybody in the wide world that desires to enter suit against him; although the work done may not have been of a nature to disturb anyone, yet he must suffer if the plaintiff insists that it was.

It will not answer to say that the accused is given immunity from the penalty of the law provided he does not disturb others; for it is left to the other man to say whether he is disturbed or not. And it opens up the way for an enemy, or any other man who desires to take advantage of the law, to cause a great deal of suffering to an innocent victim by charging that he was "disturbed." He can thus easily give vent to his feelings of animosity and revenge, because the man is technically, though not really, guilty, and has no protection.

The whole thing is unjust, and makes the liability to punishment many times rest upon a slender thread—the whim, caprice, or prejudice of any and everybody, with the additional incentive of recovering the amount of the fine, if he will sue him. It also gives room for the worst of forms of oppression and despotism—religious prosecution. In addition to the Jews there are the Seventh-day Baptists and Seventh-day Adventists, two Christian denominations who conscientiously observe the seventh day of the week, or Saturday, for the Sabbath, and believe it is their God-given right to go quietly about their work on the first day of the week. Now if the first-day man, through prejudice or any other motive, desires to use the power placed in his hands by such a law (and the history of humanity in the past shows that it is difficult for a weak man to resist the temptation to use it), what a splendid opportunity is afforded him for persecuting his neighbor. And the writer is acquainted with a case in the State of Arkansas, where, under the operations of a similar law (but which is now repealed, because of its unjustness, be it said to the State's honor), a good, quiet citizen was arrested, imprisoned, and fined for getting a mess of potatoes out of his garden Sunday morning for his dinner table; and many others suffered similarly. And it was all owing to religious prejudice. This is religious legislation, and nothing else can be made of it. And whenever the Government establishes such a precedent, it lays the foundation for untold evil.

The proposed amendment is in perfect keeping with this bill; in fact, it was necessitated by the introduction of the bill. This is evident upon a little investigation of the matter. As the Constitution now stands it forbids religious legislation. "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof." But as this bill is "respecting an establishment of religion," the amendment is called for to make it constitutional. The amendment provides that the teaching of "the principles of the Christian religion" shall be made compulsory in all the free schools of the Union. That "each State shall establish and maintain such a system of free public schools." This is apparently unobjectionable at first thought, as few people object to Christianity in the common acceptation of the term, if left free to exercise as each one sees best. But if the Government thus pledges itself to enforce its teaching in the schools, it will require something definite. It would require, therefore, a congress of the churches to declare what is Christianity. And whenever the majority of the churches render a decision in the matter, and the Government has pledged itself to require its compulsory teaching, that is the Government virtually establishing a national religion.

A State religion is a religion that has the financial support of the State or Government for its maintenance and propagation, whether that be done through the schools so supported, or the church. And if that is not establishing a national religion, then it would be difficult to conceive of a national religion. And how would this affect those, either the children or their parents, who did not happen to believe the creed formulated by the church congress? What then would become of the individual right and liberty to think and believe as one chooses in matters of religion? Must they submit, because they are in the minority, to receiving a religion they cannot believe? This would be religious oppression, and this is just what may be expected if this amendment is passed.

This measure has received more encouragement than many of us would have imagined. It has already passed two readings in the United States Senate without a dissenting voice, and its [76] friends claim to have over 14,000,000 petitioners praying Congress to pass it. The prime movers in the scheme are the self-styled National Reform Association, which has now roped into its services the Third Party Prohibitionists, some of the Labor Unions of the North, and the heretofore noble W. C. T. U. They have scoured the towns and cities of the North for signatures to their petitions, and are now to turn their attention to the South. Let the people arouse, and consider well what is before them.
