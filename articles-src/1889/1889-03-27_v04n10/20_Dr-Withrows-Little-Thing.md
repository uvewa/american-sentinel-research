In opening the recent Chicago Sunday-law meeting, Dr. J. L. Withrow said:—

> "How many people in Chicago, if it was put to a vote, would vote that there should be no Sabbath? How big a vote could you get on that side of the question? A very small one. Very well, we shall only ask that unnecessary labor shall be stopped on that day, and that places productive of crime and debauchery shall at least be closed one day in the week. What man can afford to refuse us this?"

Surely this is but a little thing. Even the keepers of the places productive of crime and debauchery ought to be willing to divide the time with these men. All they ask for is a monopoly of the Sunday, and they are willing to grant the dive keepers a monopoly of the other six days of the week. Is it not a little thing? [79-80]
