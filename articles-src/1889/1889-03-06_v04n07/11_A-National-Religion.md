# A National Religion,

The above was the subject of a discourse by the Rev. E. H. Sawyer, pastor of the Calvary Baptist Church, Denver, Colorado, which was preached in that city on Sunday, January 13. The discourse was mainly in opposition to the Blair Educational Amendment bill, especially the clause which provides for the education of children in the public schools, “in the common branches of education, and in virtue, morality, and *the principles of the Christian religion.”* The portion of the sermon which follows, we clip from the *Rocky Mountain News* of January 15. We think our readers will join us in commending the editorial statement in the *News,* that the sermon was thoughtful and logical:—

> “This bill is now pending before Congress, and we are told that Senator Blair is supported in his advocacy of his amendment by petitions already aggregating about one-quarter of our entire population. I challenge the churchman and the statesman to beware of the danger to which he exposes the institutions bequeathed us by our fathers. I exhort you, my people, ‘Take heed that no man deceive you!’ To provide liberally and intelligently for the education and culture of our children is the constitutional prerogative and duty of our Government, but to ‘educate our children in the principles of the Christian religion,’ is the right and duty reserved by the divine Law-giver, and assigned solely to the church of Jesus Christ.

> “It was while pursuing the great object of his ambition through the dark and bloody paths of war and policy, that Constantine is said to have beheld the sign of a cross in the heavens—inscribed, ‘By this conquer’—and henceforth he assumed the relation of terrestrial father to Christianity, that ‘daughter of the skies.’ Having acquired political dominion over the States of Europe, he conceived the idea of forming an alliance between the civil and the religious organizations in the empire. From this unholy alliance, consummated in the fourth century, has issued a progeny of evil which during many centuries have afflicted both Church and State.
> “A National religion often becomes to the State, in times of special awakening, burdensome and even revolutionary; be the zeal of a religionist the ambition of a Becket, a Hildebrand, or a Wolsey, or be it the flaming love for souls that burned in a Whitefield, a Wesley, or a Bunyan, or be it the heroic attachment for truth which actuated a Wycliffe, a Luther, or a Calvin. A fervid state of the church causes more or less uneasiness to the worldly ruler who must deal with it. To the church, on the other hand, such alliance becomes an influence to secularize, to pervert, and to cripple, while nominally subsidizing, assuming, and patronizing her. Persecution becomes almost an inevitable sequent.
> “State-craft and priestcraft, each evil when alone, become more vicious by their mutual aid and emulation, and plague together the country which in common they drain of its resources, and in common they circumscribe and fetter in its development. Revenue and rank and wealth tempt evil men into high places of the church. Simon Maguses are more easily fostered than Simon Peters, and when, if ever, God withdraws his hand of restraint, the National church sees rising within her nominal bounds, men like Dunstan and Wolsey and Richelieu and Mazarin and Dubois, trampling on truth and right, and aiming at power won by the worst means and used for the basest purposes. Our own favored land has for many years enjoyed the distinction and blessedness of seeing the Christian churches left alike unendowed and unfettered by the State, and yet largely influential, widely enterprising, and greatly prospered.
> “The ‘danger clause’ in the proposed amendment to our National Constitution would require for its appropriate execution the assembling by executive authority of a council similar to the Council of Nice, ordered by Constantine, of the most learned and distinguished divines and statesmen, to frame a creed embracing ‘the principles of the Christian religion,’ contemplated in the bill. The diversity of belief, hitherto allowed and fostered by our free Constitution, would necessarily require the adoption of the vaguest and laxest type of Christian doctrine, and the loosest and most secular type of Christian practice consistent with the retention of the Christian name. Thus would we repeat the folly and crime of the Old World. In the name of religion, and appealing to the Bible for our support, we would confiscate Christ’s own golden crown of Godhead, to beat it into the thin and flexible gold-leaf bands of a perilous and unwarranted brotherhood. The pulpit in a National church would reflect the will of the cabinet, and be the mouth-piece of the court. Such has been the experience in Europe. In the wars of the league in France it trumpeted sedition and revolt; in the days of the Stuarts of England it sought to graft passive obedience in the interests of despotism on the gospel of Paul and of Paul’s master. . . .
> “If this scheme was practicable we should admire their wisdom; if it was possible we should applaud their zeal; if it was patriotic we should emulate their devotion; if it was Biblical we should memorialize their achievement. But, alas! they would have the State by a strange impartiality widen its establishment, varying its motley creeds and rituals to suit its complex subjects. By what talisman would the statesman select and establish the true religion for us? Great Britain, confessedly one of the most enlightened and religious Governments of earth, has subsidized Episcopacy in England, Presbyterianism in Scotland, and threatened by more than one of her statesmen to add to the staff of her ecclesiastical pensioners by endowing Romanism in Ireland. By some of her Indian placemen she has contributed to the festivals of Juggernaut, foul and bloody as they are.
> “France pays salaries to the Romish priest, the Protestant pastor, and the Jewish rabbi. Now a faith thus elastic, indiscriminate, and all-devouring, cannot honor God or rightly develop conscience. Parity of reasoning would require the State to extend salaries and subsidies to the impurities and defilements of Mohammedanism and Mormonism, should votaries of either delusion in sufficient number colonize our soil. The God of the Bible would be compelled to share his throne with mammon, and the system sweeping on into the dim and misty realms of pantheism would ultimate in the prince of this world branding all truth as lies, and approving all lies as truth.”
In commenting upon the late address of the Pope before the Sacred College, *America,* a Chicago paper, remarks that “this address of Leo XIII. possesses the deepest interest for Americans. It is a notification to the 7,200,000 Roman Catholics in the United States that their supreme allegiance is due, not to the republic, but to the pontificate. If this claim were merely the garrulous utterance of an old man jealous of the authority and the prestige that has departed from his office, Americans could afford to dismiss it with a smile. But it is the expression of the pivotal dogma upon which revolves the mighty system of Roman supremacy over its children among the children of the earth. It is the doctrine subscribed to by over eight thousand priests, and preached by them to over ten thousand congregations, to over seven million American citizens. Worse than this, it is the un-American theory inculcated by alien teachers in two thousand seven hundred parochial schools, to over five hundred and thirty-seven thousand American children.” [55-56]

Note.—No papers are sent by the publishers of the American Sentinel to people who have not subscribed for it. If the Sentinel comes to one who has not subscribed for it, he may know that it is sent him by some friend, and that he will not be called upon by the publishers to pay for the same.

*Leave the matter of religion to the family altar, the church, and the private school supported entirely by private contribution. Keep the Church and State forever separate.— General Grant, in Des Moines Speech.*

Although all the churches and all the temperance societies, and all the labor organizations in the country, have been represented twice as petitioning Congress for the passage of the Sun- day-Rest bill, petitions from the same parties still come in. It is strange how the members of these organizations multiply.

Put down a long mark to the credit of Arkansas. Its Legislature has passed a memorial to Congress, asking the defeat of the Blair Sunday- Rest bill. The memorial was passed by a large majority in both Houses. We are glad that Arkansas has done this much toward redeeming herself from the disgrace of her Sunday law of a few years ago.

The *Catholic Mirror* announces that “His Eminence Cardinal Gibbons has been invited to address the convention of the National Teachers’ Association, at Nashville, Tenn.” How fitting that the representatives of the public schools of America should be addressed by the representative of that power which is doing its utmost to overthrow them!

Will our friends, when they send us clippings from local papers, always be careful to give the name of the paper, the place where it is published, and the exact date of the issue containing the item? Without these facts, an item that is really valuable often becomes of no use to us. We must be able to give our authority for every statement that we publish. The best way would be to send the entire paper, and then there can be no mistake.

In his famous Gettysburg speech, Lincoln gave in one pithy sentence the genius of American Government, describing it as a Government “of the people, by the people, and for the people.” This sums up the whole matter. Government is for the protection of the people, not for the protection of days. Here is the fatal sophistry of National Reformers; they say that the Government must protect the people in their right to rest on Sunday, and then they assume that this can be done only by Sunday laws; but in that they dodge the point. Government must indeed protect the people in their right to rest on Sunday; but since the Government is for *the people, *and not for any special class of the people, it must equally protect the people in their right *not *to rest on Sunday. To say that the State must enforce Sunday observance, because a portion of the citizens observe that day, is either to assume that that portion constitutes *the people,* or else to deny that government is properly for the people.

On Friday, the 8th of February, Senator Turpie presented in the Senate the petition of Norman Beckley, of Elkhart, Indiana, general manager of the Cincinnati, Wabash, and Michigan Railway Company, praying for the passage of a Sunday-Rest bill. Mr. Beckley is no doubt a conscientious Sunday keeper, and so he wants Congress to pass a law compelling him to stop his work on Sunday, “in accordance with the dictates of his conscience,” as the good women of the California W. C. T. U. put it.

We are constantly in receipt of letters from friends in different parts of the country, some of whom are personally known to us, and others not, expressing their appreciation of the work of the American Sentinel, and giving us words of encouragement. Often these letters contain items from local papers, in relation to the great issue now before the people. It is impossible for us to send a personal answer to all these letters, but we desire to say to our friends that their words of encouragement are highly appreciated, and that they give us strength for the work. It probably took but a few minutes of your time to write those words, but they are long remembered at this end of the line.

The following memorial was introduced into the Colorado Assembly on the last day of January, and was referred to a committee which is said to favor it:—

*To the Honorable, The Senate and House of Representatives of the United States, in Congress assembled:*

Your memorialists, the General Assembly of the State of Colorado, would respectfully represent;

Whereas, We heartily indorse the total separation of Religion and State, established by our fathers and guaranteed by our National Constitution as it now is; and,

Whereas, In our estimation, the Blair Sunday- Rest bill and the Blair Educational Amendment are subversive of religious liberty and tend toward a union of Religion and State,

*Therefore,* Your memorialists respectfully pray your honorable bodies not to pass any bill in regard to the observance of the Sabbath, or Lord’s day, or any other religious or ecclesiastical institution or rite; nor to favor in any way the adoption of any resolution for the amendment of the National Constitution that would in any way give preference to the principles of any one religion above another, or that will in any way sanction legislation upon the subject of religion; but that the total separation between Religion and the State, assured by our Constitution as it now is, may forever remain as our fathers established it.
