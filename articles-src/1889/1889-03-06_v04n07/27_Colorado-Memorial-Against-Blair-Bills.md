The following memorial was introduced into the Colorado Assembly on the last day of January, and was referred to a committee which is said to favor it:—

*To the Honorable, The Senate and House of Representatives of the United States, in Congress assembled:*

Your memorialists, the General Assembly of the State of Colorado, would respectfully represent;

Whereas, We heartily indorse the total separation of Religion and State, established by our fathers and guaranteed by our National Constitution as it now is; and,

Whereas, In our estimation, the Blair Sunday- Rest bill and the Blair Educational Amendment are subversive of religious liberty and tend toward a union of Religion and State,

*Therefore,* Your memorialists respectfully pray your honorable bodies not to pass any bill in regard to the observance of the Sabbath, or Lord's day, or any other religious or ecclesiastical institution or rite; nor to favor in any way the adoption of any resolution for the amendment of the National Constitution that would in any way give preference to the principles of any one religion above another, or that will in any way sanction legislation upon the subject of religion; but that the total separation between Religion and the State, assured by our Constitution as it now is, may forever remain as our fathers established it.
