In his famous Gettysburg speech, Lincoln gave in one pithy sentence the genius of American Government, describing it as a Government "of the people, by the people, and for the people." This sums up the whole matter. Government is for the protection of the people, not for the protection of days. Here is the fatal sophistry of National Reformers; they say that the Government must protect the people in their right to rest on Sunday, and then they assume that this can be done only by Sunday laws; but in that they dodge the point. Government must indeed protect the people in their right to rest on Sunday; but since the Government is for *the people, *and not for any special class of the people, it must equally protect the people in their right *not *to rest on Sunday. To say that the State must enforce Sunday observance, because a portion of the citizens observe that day, is either to assume that that portion constitutes *the people,* or else to deny that government is properly for the people.
