Will our friends, when they send us clippings from local papers, always be careful to give the name of the paper, the place where it is published, and the exact date of the issue containing the item? Without these facts, an item that is really valuable often becomes of no use to us. We must be able to give our authority for every statement that we publish. The best way would be to send the entire paper, and then there can be no mistake.
