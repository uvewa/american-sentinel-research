The Friday edition of the New York *Mail and Express* will henceforth contain the matter that was formerly issued in the monthly magazine, the *Pearl of Days,* the official organ of the American Sabbath Union. The heading, "The Pearl of Days," is used over the department containing the Sunday matter, and we shall often use it in giving credit for quotations from it.
