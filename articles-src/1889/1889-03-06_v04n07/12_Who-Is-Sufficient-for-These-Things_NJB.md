# Who Is Sufficient for These Things?

It appears to be a popular thing in some quarters to demand that Christianity be taught in public schools. It seems that the Christian ministry, Sunday-schools, and home training, and theological seminaries, have all made more or less of a failure in their work,—have to a certain extent missed their calling, or something of the sort,— and some other kind of machinery must be rigged up, so that the great work of the gospel will not be a failure all around. That was a brilliant thought of Senator Blair's. It is hardly original, however, with him; somebody else, it is likely, furnished the raw material, so to speak, and the Senator spent his genius upon it, and the result was the Educational Amendment Bill.

It has occurred to the writer that the instructors in the "free public schools" sought to be "established," will have to possess certain qualifications which the average public school-master or school-mistress does not now have. If a person sets up to teach anatomy, and physiology, and geology, and other branches, he must have some knowledge of them. The more practical the knowledge, the better the instruction. Will the coming public teacher be a graduate in theology? If so, where will he earn his diploma?

> "The principles of the Christian religion" are the principal doctrines of Christianity,—faith, repentance, baptism, resurrection, etc. See Heb. 6:1, 2. The churches and theological schools differ, some of them essentially, on all these great themes of the gospel, and there would be danger of spreading theological confusion all through our schools; the poor children would hardly know what to believe, and until some understanding could be had, would probably believe nothing. This would, under the circumstances, be a wise decision. One teaching the five points of Calvinism, and another free grace and conditional salvation, and another adult baptism, and another infant sprinkling, and still another telling that no water at all is necessary—one teaching the tenets of the infallible church, and that divine honors are due to the Virgin Mary, and another teaching that such instruction is all superstition—would make bad work. The various churches would have to get together and agree to teach those things only which are common to all. This might be done, [53] and probably will be. Then the teachers will have doled out to them, in text-books specially prepared, what they shall teach.

It may make no difference to the theological board whether the teacher believes what he is set to teach or not, just so he teaches it, and it *may* make no difference to the teacher. Some of the teachers may be as indifferent as was the one in Texas, or somewhere else it may be; when asked by the school board whether he would teach that the world is round or flat, he replied it made no odds to him, he would teach round or flat, just as they wished!

This whole educational scheme is a piece of fanatical folly, to say the least. We cannot think just now of better words to express our thought about it. The truth is, no one but a Christian can teach the principles of the Christian religion. One who loves Christ and his truth, and has his Spirit, and such only, can teach the principles of his holy religion. Christ never commissioned civil government to teach his gospel, and Mr. Blair and his friends ought to know it. N. J. Bowers.
