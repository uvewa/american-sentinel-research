The *Catholic Mirror* announces that "His Eminence Cardinal Gibbons has been invited to address the convention of the National Teachers' Association, at Nashville, Tenn." How fitting that the representatives of the public schools of America should be addressed by the representative of that power which is doing its utmost to overthrow them!
