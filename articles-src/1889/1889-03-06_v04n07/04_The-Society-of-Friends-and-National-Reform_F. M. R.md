# The Society of Friends and National Reform.

Having noticed that some of the Friends of Indiana and Iowa have indorsed the petitions for the passage of the Blair bills, our friend G. S. Honeywell has taken the pains to ascertain the exact facts as to the relation of this people to the National Reform movement, and submits the results of his investigation to us as follows, which we are sure will be read with great interest:—

This people may be considered as three distinct bodies, as follows: The Wilberites, Guernites and Hicksites. The first-named body represents the orthodox Friends, numbering about 15,000, and located east of the Alleghany Mountains. This society stands almost unanimously opposed to the Blair movement. Then there are the Guernites, numbering about 50,000, representing the so- called orthodox Friends west. This body I am sorry to say are largely, the majority perhaps, in favor of the union of Church and State, on the basis of the National Reform Association. The third branch, or Hicksite Society, located both east and west, numbering about 40,000, are solidly opposed to religious legislation, as shown by the following correspondence between their leader in this city (Richmond, Ind.), and our representative from this district in Congress, the Hon. Thomas M. Brown:—

## “Richmond, Ind., Dec. 22, 1888.

> “Friend Thomas M. Brown, Washington, D. C.: I inclose to-day a copy of the American Sentinel, containing the proposed Sunday law and amendment to the United States Constitution. Doubtless thou art well acquainted with the provisions of both. Let this, then, serve only as a reminder that the Society of Friends view with alarm any step in the direction of Church and State union

> “Believing as we do that this is only a forerunner of persecution for opinion’s sake, that it means, when stripped of its sophistry, *religious opinions prescribed by Statute;* believing further that all interference by the power, in matters of religious thought or the expression of it, is the beginning of despotism, we enter our solemn protest against the passage of the bill and resolution. While I am not authorized to speak for the Society of Friends at large, I *know* their opinions are in harmony with those I have expressed. At a meeting of the Philanthropic Committee of our Society, W. C. Starr and myself were requested to write to our Senators and Representatives in Congress and learn from them the probabilities of the passage of the bill and resolution, that the society in its official capacity may take proper action relative thereto.
> “With true regard I remain, thy friend,
“W. W. Foulke.”

The following is the reply:—

## “House of Representatives, U. S., Washington, D. C., Dec. 27, 1888.

> “W. W. Foulke, Richmond, Ind.—*My Dear Friend:* I have your favor calling my attention to the proposed Sunday law and amendment to the Constitution of the United States; I have had my attention called to this subject frequently of late, and have made myself acquainted with the details of the proposed legislation. I have also tried to ascertain the view taken of the matter by the representatives of the people in Congress. I think it safe to say that there is not the slightest danger of the passage of either of these measures. They have never been reported by the committee to which they are committed, and probably never will be. If they were submitted to a vote, I am sure they would be defeated by a decisive majority. But I do not apprehend that they will even reach a vote. I need not say to you that I am opposed to them for the reasons you have so well stated in your letter. Religious opinion cannot be fashioned by statute.

Legislation looking in that direction can only result in making slaves and hypocrites.

## “Yours truly, Thomas M. Brown.”

> The following interesting article published in the *Friends’ Intelligencer and Journal,* of Philadelphia, under date of December 22, 1888, is a true picture showing how the better class of Friends regard the recent efforts of certain religious elements to recover by civil enactments what they have lost by apostasy and union with the world.

“ETERNAL VIGILANCE IS THE PRICE OF LIBERTY.”

> “Realizing the full force of this statement, and feeling that there is great need for the guardians of that priceless boon to mankind, ‘liberty of conscience,’ to be on the alert, we desire in as few words as possible to call the attention of Friends to a threatened danger.

> “A bill to regulate the strict observance of the first day of the week as the Sabbath-day, has been introduced into the United States Senate, by Senator Blair, and an effort is also being made to make it compulsory to teach ‘the principles of the Christian religion ’ in the public schools.
> “This is to be accomplished by an amendment to the Constitution of the United States, the object being to make our Nation ‘a Christian Nation,’ by a union of the Church with the State.
> “A petition signed by a million and a half of names, urging the passage of the bill, has also been presented, and we are informed that the friends of this legislation are exceedingly active in its behalf. It is warmly advocated by men and women of high position and great influence, who, undoubtedly, have the welfare of the human race at heart, but, as is so often the case, their zeal has outrun their judgment, and one might almost say, their Christianity; for where the spirit of intoleration is, there the Spirit of Christ cannot dwell, neither is it with those who arrogate to themselves infallibility.
> “There are several religious sects who honestly believe, and who would uphold their belief with [52] their lives, that it is required ef them to observe the seventh day as the Sabbath-day. Now, shall these Christians, professing the name of Christ, obey the mandates of self-righteous men who presume to say, ‘This day shalt thou keep ’ ? or shall they obey the ‘voice’ within their own souls?
> “The advocates of this bill say, ‘Obey this law which we have made/ and think by this means to build up a Christian Nation. Will any forced observance of moral law be accepted of God, or accounted unto the doer for righteousness? The temple was built of free-will offerings only. Can we raise up a Nation of Christians by simply compelling an outward semblance of religion?
> “We might say there is nothing to prevent anyone from keeping the seventh day if they want to do so, but we must remember that their pecuniary circumstances may not be such as to permit them to observe *both* days as days of rest.
> “Again, one might suppose that the clause, ‘to the disturbance of others,’ so limited the operation of the law as to render it less harmful; but when we remember the bitter persecutions of Friends for acts in themselves quiet and peaceable, we cannot doubt that very many religious fanatics will be very easily disturbed by any observance of a day not strictly in accord with their views.
> “In regard to the other point, it would at first seem as though we would all unite on a willingness to hate the *principles* of the Christian religion taught in the public schools; but who is to decide precisely what constitutes the essentials of the Christian religion or its principles?
> “The highest civil tribunal is the Supreme Court. Can that body decide the question so as to satisfy the Catholic and Protestant, or even the various sects among the latter? An attempt to unite the Church and State has always proved disastrous. Turn back the pages of history, and we shall find that the bloodiest wars that have stained our annals were waged in support of religious belief. Recall what the early Friends suffered, comparatively a short time ago, in order to maintain ‘liberty of conscience.’ The spirit of intolerance is only sleeping. Would we, as Friends, be satisfied to have any body of men decide what our children should be taught as ‘the Christian religion’? Many of the warmest advocates of these measures utter the most severe denunciations of all religions not in harmony with their own, showing a spirit that would crucify the Christ within their brother’s soul; while professing to follow his voice, speaking in their own. ‘Woe unto you, hypocrites! ’
> “It was through the influence of a Friend that liberty of conscience was secured by our Constitution, and they have always stood foremost in the fight when it has been assailed, and we take this means of calling everyone to the duty of the hour, reminding one and all that ‘eternal vigilance is the price of liberty.’
> “While using every effort to prevent the taking of this step in the wrong direction, we would not be understood as denouncing, personally, the author of the measure, or the signers of the petitions, or their motives; but even great and good men make very grave mistakes, and it is the duty of each one of us to guard with exceeding care this priceless gift of God unto the children of men, both from the attack of enemies and the harmful abuse of overzealous friends.
> “No one could be more desirous than we to see the day when Christ shall rule the world, but this proposed step is a retrograde movement, and when one of its supporters would say, ‘The Government has the right to command the consciences of men,’ it is full time to call a halt.
> “This is the first step. The second would be to secure the erasure of the word “principles;” and the next, the insertion of the name of that religion holding the balance of power.
> “Ah, friends, it would be impossible to fully comprehend the danger until we are caught within its toils.
> “May our Father in Heaven guide and protect us.”
