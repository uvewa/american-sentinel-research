# The Kind of Law Wanted.

In the *California Prohibitionist,* of December 6, 1888, there appeared an article entitled, “The Sabbath Question,” by our friend Rev. N. R. Johnston, in which he discusses the necessity for a Sunday law in California, and tells what kind of a law is wanted. A brief notice of some of his points is eminently in place in the American Sentinel, both because the matter of a Sunday law is now being agitated in this State, and others also, and because Mr. Johnston is one of the original National Reformers, having been one of the secretaries at the first two National conventions held by that association, and so he speaks by the book when he discourses about Sunday laws.

After bewailing the fact that “California has no law in reference to the Christian Sabbath,” Mr. Johnston says:—

> “And now it is for the people to say whether we shall have such a law or not. The friends of religion, the friends of Christian morality, the friends of temperance, have the power. Will they exercise it? That is the question. To aid in its proper solution, I submit the following fundamental statements, in the hope that they will help to prepare the way for proper action in due time; for truth is a strong and safe foundation, on which if we build we are wise:—

> “The divine law should be supreme in the State. The people should act on this hypothesis, and instruct their representatives to frame laws agreeable to the divine law, and so for the highest good of the whole.
> “As the Christian Sabbath is a divine institution, and inseparably connected with the Christian religion, and as a State destitute of religion is in danger of dissolution or ruin, if California should continue to have no Sabbath law, the State and people would be exposed to the greatest peril.”
We have copied enough so that we cannot be accused of misrepresentation. Now who can read the above, and then deny that what the agitators for a Sunday law desire is a law establishing religion? They wish to establish an institution that they say is “inseparably connected with the Christian religion;” and since the Christian church and Christian religion are inseparably connected, it certainly follows that to enact Sunday laws is only to unite Church and State. Even in the face of this, they will probably feebly assert that they don’t want a union of Church and State, but what does such an assertion amount to? We don’t care what they call it; the *name* doesn’t amount to anything; but the reality will be there just as soon as they get what they want.

But Mr. Johnston speaks still more plainly. He quotes with approval the declaration of the National Woman’s Christian Temperance Union in favor of a Sunday law, in which they say:—

> “We recommend most strenuous and prayerful efforts in all the States and Territories to secure legislation in harmony with the fourth commandment.”

We will not at this time do more than mention the incongruity of asking for a Sunday law “in harmony with the fourth commandment,” when that commandment declares that “the seventh day is the Sabbath.” It is about as sensible as it would be for the Mormons to ask for a law legalizing polygamy, “in harmony with the seventh commandment.” But, inconsistency aside, take notice that what they want is legislation in harmony with the fourth commandment—as interpreted by them. In short, they want the State to make and enforce a purely religious law.

But says Mr. Johnston:—

> “Our aim is not to compel men to keep the Sabbath holy; but we do ask a law that will be in accordance with the divine law of the fourth commandment.”

Did the gentleman ever read the fourth commandment? If he ever did, he ought to know that the very first clause of that commandment is this: “Remember the Sabbath-day, *to keep it holy.”* A Sabbath that is not kept holy is not in the least in accordance with the fourth commandment, even though it be the very day that the commandment enjoins—the seventh day. “A law that will be in accordance with the fourth commandment,” would be a law (taking their assumption that Sunday is the day enjoined) compelling people to keep that day holy, so far as outward action is concerned.

And that is just what they do want. They may say that they don’t want to compel men to be religious. Of course they don’t, for they know very well that that cannot be done. But they do want to compel men to act as though they were religious; and more than that, they want men to act in harmony with *their* religion. Mrs. Foster said, in the Convention at Washington, that they wanted a law to compel everybody to observe the first day of the week; and another speaker said that the law which they desired would make “Sunday the ideal Sabbath of the Puritans, which day shall be occupied only by worship.”

We warn the people against this scheme. When they tell you that all they want is a “sanitary arrangement,” tell them that you will trust all sanitary arrangements with the board of health. Don’t be deceived by their pretensions that they don’t want to force religion upon the people. They do want just that thing, and they want to enforce a religion of their own manufacture. They want, in short, to unite Church and State.
