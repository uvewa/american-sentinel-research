# They Know Not.

National Reformers and the Woman's Christian Temperance Union are determined to make this Nation a Christian Nation, with Christian rulers, who will *compel* obedience to Christian laws and ordinances.

But this is absolutely impossible for two reasons: First, a Nation can become Christian only by all the individuals composing it becoming Christians. Christianity is an affair of the heart. It is inwrought into the individual life by repentance of sin, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ. But the Nation is not an individual; it cannot repent or believe. Christianity, being an affair of the heart and conscience, cannot be compelled; it is wholly voluntary. Men may be forced to become hypocrites, but not Christians. But legislation is designed to restrain, enforce, compel. Therefore National Reformers cannot, in the very nature of the case, nor can any number with them, make of this Nation a Christian Nation.

Secondly, To attempt this in the way they are doing, is unchristian. We read: "But Jesus called them [his disciples] unto him, and said, Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them, and they that are great exercise authority upon them. But *it shall not be so among you;* but whosoever will be great among you, let him be your minister; and whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant; even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister." Matt. 20:25-28. "He that saith he abideth in Him, ought himself also so to walk, even as He walked." 1 John 2:6. "If any man will come after Me, let him *deny himself,* and take up his cross, and follow Me." Matt. 16:24. "Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus." Phil. 2:5.

We might- quote many more passages of the [54] same import, which teach Christianity—the way of Christ. It is the way of humility, self-denial, cross-bearing, and long-suffering. But certainly these principles are the very opposite of the principles of those who are engaged in the religio- political crusade of to-day.

Christianity can never be reached in an unchristian way; for it is the *way* that makes it what it is. The way of National Reformers is arrogant, ambitious, tyrannical, usurping, and is, therefore, unchristian. Whatever, then, their object may be, the end will never justify the unchristian means; nor will the end be more Christian than the means are. Such Reformers (?) are like two rash ones of old, who were desirous of using similar means,—they know not what manner of spirit they are of. Luke 9:55.M. C. W.
