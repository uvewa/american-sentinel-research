Under the heading, "The Way of the World," the *Voice* says that petitions said to represent 14,000,000 persons have been presented to the Senate, praying that Congress shall forbid all needless work in the mail and military service, and in interstate commerce." This item comes very fittingly under the heading of "The Way of the World," for if there ever was a transaction that was marked by worldly policy and scheming it is that matter of the Sunday-law petitions.
