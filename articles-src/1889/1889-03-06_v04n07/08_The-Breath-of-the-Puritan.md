# The “Breath of the Puritan.”

The British colonies in North America were originated by the scandalous intolerance of a Protestant Government. That oppression must have been truly insupportable, which induced a number of sober-minded men, total strangers to that enthusiasm which is imparted by the spirit of adventure, to turn their eyes from the land of their nativity, from the homes which had descended to them from their fathers, to a transatlantic settlement, in a region unknown and inhabited by savages. As our non-conformist emigrants braved the mighty winds and waves of the western ocean, to get beyond the reach of spiritual courts and penal laws, it naturally occurs to us that religious liberty would be the animating principle of their civil institutions. How is this expectation supported by matter of fact? The following are some of the laws made in the dominion of New Haven, one of the general divisions of Connecticut, at its first settlement:—

> “No one shall be a freeman, or give a vote, unless he be converted, and a member in full communion of one of the churches allowed in this dominion.”

> “No man shall hold any office who is not sound in the faith, and faithful to this dominion; and whoever gives a vote to such a person, shall pay a fine of one pound. For a second offense he shall be disfranchised.”
> “Each freeman shall swear by the blessed God, to bear true allegiance to this dominion, and that Jesus is the only king.”
> “No Quaker, or dissenter from the established worship of this dominion, shall be allowed to give a vote for the election of magistrates, or any officer.”
> “No food or lodging shall be afforded to a Quaker, Adamite, or other heretic.”
> “If any person turns Quaker, he shall be banished, and not suffered to return, but upon pain of death.”
> “No priest shall abide in the dominion. He shall be banished, and suffer death on his return. Priests may be seized by anyone without a warrant.”
Similar laws were made in several of the American States; and they were not made merely to be suspended *in terrorem* over the heads of the guilty; they actually came down in all their vengeance, on many hapless victims.—*History of Intolerance, by Thomas Clarke.*
