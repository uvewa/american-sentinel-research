# Sunday Legislation in California.

The following bill was introduced into the California Senate January 16, and into the Assembly February 8, and has been referred in both instances to the Committee on Public Morals:—

AN ACT.

To Add Three New Sections to the Penal Code, To Be Known As Sections 299, 300, and 301, Respectively, Relative to Sunday Amusements Where Liquors Are Sold, and Keeping Open Places of Business on Sunday.

*The People of the State of California, represented in Senate and Assembly, do enact as follows:*

Section 1. A new section is hereby added to the Penal Code, to be known and numbered as section two hundred and ninety-nine, as follows:

299. Every person who on Sunday gets up, exhibits, opens, or maintains, or aids in getting up, exhibiting, opening, or maintaining any bull, bear, cock, or prize fight, horse-race, circus, gamblinghouse, or saloon, or any barbarous and noisy amusement, or who keeps, conducts, or exhibits any theater, melodeon, dance-cellar, or other place of musical, theatrical, or operatic performance, spectacle, or representation, where any wines, liquors, or intoxicating drinks are bought, sold, used, drank, or given away, or who purchases any ticket of admission, or directly or indirectly pays any admission fee to or for the purpose of witnessing or attending any such place, amusement, spectacle, performance or representation, is guilty of a misdemeanor.

Sec. 2. A new section is hereby added to the Penal Code, to be known and numbered as section three hundred, as follows:

300. Every person who keeps open on Sunday any store, workshop, bar, saloon, banking-house, or other place of business, for the purpose of transacting business therein, is punishable by fine not less than twenty nor more than one hundred dollars.

Sec. 3. A new section is hereby added to the Penal Code, to be known and numbered as section three hundred and one, as follows:

301. The provisions of section three hundred do not apply to persons who on Sunday keep open hotels, boarding-houses, barber shops, baths, markets, restaurants, taverns, livery stables, or retail drug stores, for the legitimate business of each, or such manufacturing establishments as are usually kept in continued operation.

It does not need many words, after all that has appeared in the Sentinel, to show up the character of such a bill as this. In prohibiting bull, bear, cock, and prize fights, gambling, and barbarous amusements, on Sunday, it virtually says to those who indulge in such things, "You are all right, so long as you don't do it on Sunday." It is strange that people cannot see this. Let us illustrate. A mother sees her little boy playing with his ball on Sunday, and says, "Johnnie, you ought not to play ball to-day, it is Sunday." Johnnie puts his ball away, and the next day goes to playing with it, as though nothing had been said about it. He could not imagine, from what his mother said, that she thought it wrong to play ball, but only that she thought it wrong to play ball on Sunday. No one will question this.

Now suppose Johnnie, after a few years, should take to playing cards. If his mother, seeing him playing cards with a boon companion on Sunday, should say, "John, don't you know you ought not to play cards on Sunday," would John think that his mother had any objection to his playing cards provided he didn't do it on Sunday? He could not. If she should lay upon him an express prohibition never to play cards, he would know that she looked with displeasure on that amusement; but if she specified a certain time when he should not play cards, then he would know that in her mind the time when the thing was done determined its character.

So it is with this Sunday law. It virtually says that all these fights and barbarous amusements are all right on any day except Sunday. The Sunday-law zealots may call what they please for our opposition to Sunday laws; we have got used to being classed by them with the rabble, for it is the only argument they have to use against us; but nothing shall make us give our assent to any law that classes saloon keeping, cock and prize fighting, and such things as that, on a level with banking and manufacturing. We don't know what stronger indictment than this need be brought against the bill.
