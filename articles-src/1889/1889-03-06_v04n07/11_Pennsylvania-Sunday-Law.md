# Pennsylvania Sunday Law.

The following petition to the Pennsylvania Legislature has been widely circulated by the Philadelphia "Sabbath Association," and kindred organizations:—

> "The undersigned, citizens of Pennsylvania, respectfully represent that great advantages have accrued to the public and private interests of the people of this State, from the operation of the laws upon our statute-books in relation to the observance of the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday, and they therefore pray your honorable body that no act be passed that will in any way impair the efficiency of the laws which now secure to the toiler his needed weekly rest."

In order that all may know the "efficiency" of the Pennsylvania Sunday law, we give it herewith. It was enacted April 22, 1794, and is as follows:—

> "If any person shall do or perform any worldly employment or business whatsoever on the Lord's day, commonly called Sunday (works of necessity and charity only excepted), shall use or practice any unlawful game, hunting, shooting, sport or diversion whatsoever, on the same day, and be convicted thereof, every such person so offending shall, for every such offense, forfeit and pay four dollars, to be levied by distress; or in case he or she shall refuse or neglect to pay the said sum, or goods or chattels cannot be found whereof to levy the same by distress, he or she shall suffer six days' imprisonment in the house of correction of the proper county:

> *"Provided always.* That nothing herein contained shall be construed to prohibit the dressing of victuals in private families, bake-houses, lodginghouses, inns, and other houses of entertainment for the use of sojourners, travelers, or strangers, or to hinder watermen from landing their passengers, or ferrymen from carrying over the water travelers, or persons removing with their families on the Lord's day, commonly called Sunday, nor the delivery of milk, or the necessaries of life, before nine of the clock in the forenoon, nor after five of the clock in the afternoon of the same day.
> *"Provided always,* That every such prosecution shall be commenced within seventy-two hours after the offense shall be committed."
That is the law entire. The following, from "Sergeant and Rawle's Reports," vol. 3, page 47, states the bearing which the law has upon those who observe the seventh day as the Sabbath. Let the reader reconcile it, if he can, with the statement so commonly made that Sunday laws are solely in the interest of public health, that the workingman may obtain needed physical rest:—

> "A conviction for doing worldly business on the Sabbath under the act of the 22d of April, 1794, is good if it follows the form prescribed in the law, though it does not state the time when or the place where the work was done, or the nature of it.

> "The proper mode of proceeding for this offense is by conviction, not by *qui tam* action. Persons professing the Jewish religion, and others who keep the seventh day as their Sabbath, are liable to the penalty imposed by the law for this offense."
Accepting the statement that Sunday laws are solely for the benefit of the workingman, that he may recruit his wasted physical energies, can anybody tell us why the workingman who observes the seventh day as the Sabbath should require twice as much rest as his fellow-laborers who do not observe the seventh day?

But read the following, on the same subject, from "Pennsylvania State Reports," by Barr, pp. 312, 313:—

> "The first section of the act of the 22d of April, 1794, prohibiting the performance of any worldly employment or business on the *Lord's day,* commonly called *Sunday,* works of necessity or charity only excepted, is not in conflict with the 3d section of the 9th article of the constitution of Pennsylvania, and is constitutional.

> "Members of a society or sect, who conscientiously observe and keep the seventh day of the week as the Christian Sabbath, are, upon conviction for violating the first day of the week, or Sunday, by working or performing any worldly employment, amenable to the penalties inflicted by the act of the Assembly.
> "The first section of the act of the 22d of April, 1794, only selects and sets apart *the first day of the week, or Sunday,* as a day of legalized rest, and enforces the observance thereof by legal sanctions, and is, essentially, but a civil regulation made for the government of a man as a member of society."
It no doubt satisfies the consciences of National Reformers and their allies, to call the law only a civil regulation made for the government of man as a member of society. By that form of words they can persuade themselves, if they care to, that it is not religious legislation, and then they can drive ahead, and indulge in all the persecution for conscience's sake that they please. It is worthy of note that the *Christian Statesman* some time ago warned the people that efforts would be made this winter to repeal or modify this law, and urged them to resist any such attempt. This it did with the full knowledge that cruel persecution had already been carried on under it. People who think, and who care to look closely, can see beneath the mask of National Reform the features of the Papacy.
