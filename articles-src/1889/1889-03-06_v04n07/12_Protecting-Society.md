# Protecting Society.

The idea which Sunday-law zealots have of protecting society, may be learned from the following, which appears in the *Pearl of Days,* under the heading, “The Arm of Law:”—

> “It is the habit in some places to depreciate Sunday law. But so long as the spirit of lawlessness exists society will need this shield. There is a commendable vigor in the recent action of the civil authorities in Philadelphia, which may well be adopted elsewhere. James Higgins and Charles Beig were convicted in Judge Gordon’s court of selling liquor at No. 606 South Fourth Street, without a license, and selling liquor on Sunday. Higgins will have to serve two years and ninety days’ imprisonment and pay $1,500 fine, and Beig will give one year and ninety days’ service to the city and pay $1,000 fine. According to the evidence of the police, No. 606 South Fourth Street has for a long time been known as ‘Higgins’s Dive,’ and has been a resort for thieves and people of the worst character. During the trial the fact was disclosed that one of the prisoners had made his place the rendezvous for political bummers, and that fourteen illegal voters were registered from the three rooms that comprised his headquarters.”

And this is called protection to society! We are amazed beyond measure at the blindness of men who can deliberately write such stuff, and congratulate themselves that society is being elevated by such things. Just think of it! Here is a place long known as “Higgins’s Dive,” which has been a resort for thieves and people of the worst sort, but no effort is made towards closing up the vile den until it is found that the disreputable owners have committed the unpardonable double offense of selling liquor without a license, and on Sunday, too! And then society must be protected.

We have no patience with such shallow pretensions of reform. These sham reformers who work so zealously for a Sunday law can sit calmly by and see thieves and prostitutes congregate night after night in the lowest dives, but as soon as the same thing is done on Sunday their indignation is aroused. The above from the *Pearl of Days* is only another instance of the premium which Sunday laws put upon crime. The *Pearl of Days, *let it be remembered, is the official organ of the so-called “American Sabbath Union.” [57]
