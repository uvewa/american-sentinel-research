On Friday, the 8th of February, Senator Turpie presented in the Senate the petition of Norman Beckley, of Elkhart, Indiana, general manager of the Cincinnati, Wabash, and Michigan Railway Company, praying for the passage of a Sunday-Rest bill. Mr. Beckley is no doubt a conscientious Sunday keeper, and so he wants Congress to pass a law compelling him to stop his work on Sunday, "in accordance with the dictates of his conscience," as the good women of the California W. C. T. U. put it.
