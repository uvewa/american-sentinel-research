# Intolerant and Illiberal.

The *Bradford* (Penn.) *Era,* of January 24, has the following temperate and sensible words concerning the Blair Sunday-Rest bill:—

> “It is claimed that 14,000,000 names have been secured to the petition asking for the passage of this law. If this be true, it is only another illustration of the ease with which Americans place their signatures to documents without giving the subject matter of them any careful thought. Such a law could not be enforced without doing injustice to a large portion of our population. Hebrews, Adventists, Seventh-day Baptists, and Sabbatarians generally, would be greatly wronged by the passage of such a law. The law itself smacks of an intolerant and illiberal spirit, which it was once hoped had long since passed away.”

> “While Mr. Crafts is undoubtedly correct in his observations [as to the amount of work done on Sunday], the remedy is not to be sought in legislation. A morality that is enforced by statutory limitations is never secure. You cannot make men either religious, temperate, or moral by act of the Legislature. There are two good and sufficient reasons why manhood in general should observe one day out of seven as a day of rest and surcease from toil. The first is a sacred and religious one; the second, purely physiological. Most men can be induced to the observance from one reason or the other. But all will not agree upon which day of the seven shall be set apart for this purpose. The day will be better and more faithfully observed when mankind is thus induced to do voluntarily than when compelled by act of Legislature.
> “Aside from its religious aspect, the subject is purely intellectual and educational. Another point to be borne in mind is the exceeding difficulty of enforcing such an act after it has become a law. Some communities would be very lax in their observance of the law, while others would be equally strict. The very fact of making the observance compulsory would tend to create a disrespect for the day on the part of many who are now disposed to recognize its sacred character. Religious observance of all kind in a free country must continue free and voluntary. Our day of rest, call it by what name you will, should be left to the individual citizen as free as it is at present. We may educate our citizens to observe the first or the seventh day of the week as a holy day, by appeals to their religious and moral nature, but no such observance should be made compulsory. The influences that now hallow the Christian Sabbath-day would in a large degree be dissipated when the day became set apart and its observance forced, under penalty of fine or imprisonment. There is no need of any such legislation in this country.”
