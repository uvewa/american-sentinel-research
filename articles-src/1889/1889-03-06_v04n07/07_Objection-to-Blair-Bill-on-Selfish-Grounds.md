We are informed that there are some people who keep the seventh day of the week, who object to the Blair Sunday Bill, on the ground that they would be oppressed if it should become a law; and that they would not object to the bill if it made an exemption in their favor. With all respect for the good people who take such a position, we must say that it is purely a selfish one, and selfishness, as they will find, never gains for its possessor any permanent good. Those who labor for exemption clauses in Sunday laws, thereby give their influence in favor of such laws, and when the laws are enacted they may be counted as having contributed to that end. But upon trial, it will be found that exemption clauses are inconsistent with the succesful enforcement of Sunday laws, and will not long be retained; and then when those people are oppressed, they will have the comfort of knowing that they themselves are in part the cause of their own suffering. No, friends, base your opposition on the broad ground of true Christian charity, which has equal regard for the rights of all men.
