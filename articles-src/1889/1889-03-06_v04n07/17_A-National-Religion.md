# "A National Religion,"

The above was the subject of a discourse by the Rev. E. H. Sawyer, pastor of the Calvary Baptist Church, Denver, Colorado, which was preached in that city on Sunday, January 13. The discourse was mainly in opposition to the Blair Educational Amendment bill, especially the clause which provides for the education of children in the public schools, "in the common branches of education, and in virtue, morality, and *the principles of the Christian religion."* The portion of the sermon which follows, we clip from the *Rocky Mountain News* of January 15. We think our readers will join us in commending the editorial statement in the *News,* that the sermon was thoughtful and logical:—

> "This bill is now pending before Congress, and we are told that Senator Blair is supported in his advocacy of his amendment by petitions already aggregating about one-quarter of our entire population. I challenge the churchman and the statesman to beware of the danger to which he exposes the institutions bequeathed us by our fathers. I exhort you, my people, 'Take heed that no man deceive you!' To provide liberally and intelligently for the education and culture of our children is the constitutional prerogative and duty of our Government, but to 'educate our children in the principles of the Christian religion,' is the right and duty reserved by the divine Law-giver, and assigned solely to the church of Jesus Christ.

> "It was while pursuing the great object of his ambition through the dark and bloody paths of war and policy, that Constantine is said to have beheld the sign of a cross in the heavens—inscribed, 'By this conquer'—and henceforth he assumed the relation of terrestrial father to Christianity, that 'daughter of the skies.' Having acquired political dominion over the States of Europe, he conceived the idea of forming an alliance between the civil and the religious organizations in the empire. From this unholy alliance, consummated in the fourth century, has issued a progeny of evil which during many centuries have afflicted both Church and State.
> "A National religion often becomes to the State, in times of special awakening, burdensome and even revolutionary; be the zeal of a religionist the ambition of a Becket, a Hildebrand, or a Wolsey, or be it the flaming love for souls that burned in a Whitefield, a Wesley, or a Bunyan, or be it the heroic attachment for truth which actuated a Wycliffe, a Luther, or a Calvin. A fervid state of the church causes more or less uneasiness to the worldly ruler who must deal with it. To the church, on the other hand, such alliance becomes an influence to secularize, to pervert, and to cripple, while nominally subsidizing, assuming, and patronizing her. Persecution becomes almost an inevitable sequent.
> "State-craft and priestcraft, each evil when alone, become more vicious by their mutual aid and emulation, and plague together the country which in common they drain of its resources, and in common they circumscribe and fetter in its development. Revenue and rank and wealth tempt evil men into high places of the church. Simon Maguses are more easily fostered than Simon Peters, and when, if ever, God withdraws his hand of restraint, the National church sees rising within her nominal bounds, men like Dunstan and Wolsey and Richelieu and Mazarin and Dubois, trampling on truth and right, and aiming at power won by the worst means and used for the basest purposes. Our own favored land has for many years enjoyed the distinction and blessedness of seeing the Christian churches left alike unendowed and unfettered by the State, and yet largely influential, widely enterprising, and greatly prospered.
> "The 'danger clause' in the proposed amendment to our National Constitution would require for its appropriate execution the assembling by executive authority of a council similar to the Council of Nice, ordered by Constantine, of the most learned and distinguished divines and statesmen, to frame a creed embracing 'the principles of the Christian religion,' contemplated in the bill. The diversity of belief, hitherto allowed and fostered by our free Constitution, would necessarily require the adoption of the vaguest and laxest type of Christian doctrine, and the loosest and most secular type of Christian practice consistent with the retention of the Christian name. Thus would we repeat the folly and crime of the Old World. In the name of religion, and appealing to the Bible for our support, we would confiscate Christ's own golden crown of Godhead, to beat it into the thin and flexible gold-leaf bands of a perilous and unwarranted brotherhood. The pulpit in a National church would reflect the will of the cabinet, and be the mouth-piece of the court. Such has been the experience in Europe. In the wars of the league in France it trumpeted sedition and revolt; in the days of the Stuarts of England it sought to graft passive obedience in the interests of despotism on the gospel of Paul and of Paul's master. . . .
> "If this scheme was practicable we should admire their wisdom; if it was possible we should applaud their zeal; if it was patriotic we should emulate their devotion; if it was Biblical we should memorialize their achievement. But, alas! they would have the State by a strange impartiality widen its establishment, varying its motley creeds and rituals to suit its complex subjects. By what talisman would the statesman select and establish the true religion for us? Great Britain, confessedly one of the most enlightened and religious Governments of earth, has subsidized Episcopacy in England, Presbyterianism in Scotland, and threatened by more than one of her statesmen to add to the staff of her ecclesiastical pensioners by endowing Romanism in Ireland. By some of her Indian placemen she has contributed to the festivals of Juggernaut, foul and bloody as they are.
> "France pays salaries to the Romish priest, the Protestant pastor, and the Jewish rabbi. Now a faith thus elastic, indiscriminate, and all-devouring, cannot honor God or rightly develop conscience. Parity of reasoning would require the State to extend salaries and subsidies to the impurities and defilements of Mohammedanism and Mormonism, should votaries of either delusion in sufficient number colonize our soil. The God of the Bible would be compelled to share his throne with mammon, and the system sweeping on into the dim and misty realms of pantheism would ultimate in the prince of this world branding all truth as lies, and approving all lies as truth."
