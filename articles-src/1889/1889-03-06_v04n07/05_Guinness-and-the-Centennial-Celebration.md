The Rev. H. Grattan Guinness is a believer in the doctrine commonly known as the "Age to Come." In a recent discourse in Boston, he said: "All prophecy of the Scriptures, in the next age, will be taught in the common schools, and will be as well understood by the children as geography and astronomy." But Senator Blair is just an age ahead of Mr. Guinness. He proposes to have these things taught in the present age, the same as arithmetic and geography. Without doubt the Age-to-Come advocates will gladly unite with Senator Blair, in hastening the time.

The chairman of the Executive Committee on the centennial celebration of Washington's inauguration, has sent out addresses to all the clergymen of the country, asking them to hold a service of prayer and thanksgiving in their churches at 9:30 A. m., April 30, and have also sent an address to the President, asking him to make a proclamation calling upon all citizens of the United States to observe April 30 as a day of National thanksgiving. The most noticeable thing is that the addresses are "signed by a committee of clergymen representing the clergy of New York and Brooklyn," and that of the eleven representative clergymen whose names are signed, that of Martin J. Brophy, "representing Archbishop Corrrigan," heads the list, and that of William Hayes Ward, editor of the *Independent,* is at the bottom. Does anybody suppose that that address could by any means have been sent out with the order of names reversed? If he does, he doesn't know the Roman Catholic Church. Protestants must give her representatives the first place if they would secure her co-operation.
