We are constantly in receipt of letters from friends in different parts of the country, some of whom are personally known to us, and others not, expressing their appreciation of the work of the American Sentinel, and giving us words of encouragement. Often these letters contain items from local papers, in relation to the great issue now before the people. It is impossible for us to send a personal answer to all these letters, but we desire to say to our friends that their words of encouragement are highly appreciated, and that they give us strength for the work. It probably took but a few minutes of your time to write those words, but they are long remembered at this end of the line.
