The *Voice* of October 3, 1887, said:—

> "Every department of life must be made to conform to the principles of Christianity. The Saviour refused the kingdoms of the world on Satan's terms. He will have them on his *own* terms. For this conquest the clergy are needed. They lift the governments of earth with a leverage that has for its fulcrum the throne of God."

That is all true as it stands, but it is not true as the *Voice* intends it; because it presently inquired, "Why should the clergy lose interest in secular things?" thus showing that it is by political agitation and legislation—religious prohibition "civil" Sabbath observance, etc.,—that they are supposed to lift the kingdoms of the world. But it is not by legislation that any such thing as that can ever be accomplished.

It is true that this is to be done by the power of God, but this power is exerted by his holy Spirit and not by legislatures. It is manifested through the gospel and not through law.
