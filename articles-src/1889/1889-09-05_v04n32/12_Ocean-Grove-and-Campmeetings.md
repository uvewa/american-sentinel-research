At the Ocean Grove and other great campmeetings and places of religious resort, Sunday is always the greatest day. The best speakers are expected to speak then, the best meetings are expected to be had, the most solemn and lasting impressions made, but yet the gates are rigidly shut. No person from the outside can come in at all. People who are busily engaged at their work all the week are shut away from the meetings on Sunday. However impressive the services, however grand the sermons, none of it is for them. It seems that at those places the effort and the expectation is to call only the righteous to repentance. Sinners can shift for themselves. If it were sinners that they wished to call to repentance assuredly Sunday is the day when the gates should be widest open and the richest welcome extended to all. That is the day when more people can be reached than any other; because by the Sunday laws they are compelled to be idle. But instead of doing this, the managers of the great religious meetings closely shut all approaches on Sunday. They compel the wicked to be idle, then shut the gates so they can't go to the meetings and then declaim against the increasing Sabbath desecration. How can it be otherwise? The wicked are not allowed to work on Sunday, they are not allowed to go to the meetings on Sunday. They have to fill up the time some way, and if they fill it with dissipation who is most to blame? It would be well for the managers of these places of religious resort to bear in mind that the work of the gospel of Christ is "not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance."
