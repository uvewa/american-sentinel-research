The American Sabbath Union argues that all Sunday mails can be absolutely stopped because such "emergency letters" as would have to be delivered on Sunday, may go by telegraph on Saturday and such as would have to be sent on Sunday to reach their destination on Monday, can go by telegraph on Monday morning. But this does not meet the case of such emergency letters as could reach their destination, say one hundred or one hundred and fifty miles, within the Sunday hours, and to meet this demand the American Sabbath Union says he would have "one telegraph operator sitting with his family, but within reach of a bell so that he could easily be called." But in such a system as this, there is such an assumption of overlordship as does not comport well with the spirit of free institutions.
