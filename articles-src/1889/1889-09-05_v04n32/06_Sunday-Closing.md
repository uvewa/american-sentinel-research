# Sunday “Closing.”

The value of enforced idleness and of Sunday prohibition was well illustrated in the city of Racine a short time ago. The Milwaukee *Sentinel* of June 24, says:—

> “The good people of Racine supposed that when Mayor Mitchell issued his proclamation ordering the closing of saloons on Sunday, the Bell City would virtually be a prohibition town on that day, and that there would be no drunkenness. They were mistaken. A larger amount of liquor has been consumed to-day than has been the case when the dram shops were run wide open. On the first Sunday under the new order it was different, the town being quiet as a grave-yard, owing to the fact that a heavy rain prevailed all day long. But to-day the city presented a different aspect. To be sure the saloons were closed, and entrance was impossible, except to those who knew the back or side-door signals. But the average tippler provided himself with a bottle or keg of beer before 12 o’clock Saturday night, and it was a common occurrence to see dozens of men going home with bottles protruding from their pockets, while others tramped along with keg on their shoulders. The result was seen to-day. Up the river there were several picnic parties, and the crowds present were plentifully supplied with liquid refreshments which had been secured yesterday. On the harbor piers were gathered from 300 to 500 people, and the male portion of the crowd were not bashful in pulling out bottles and sipping their contents. In the woods a great many men and boys gathered and drank whisky and beer.” A. Delos Wescott. [263-264]

Note,—No papers are sent by the publishers of the American Sentinel to people who have not subscribed for it. If the Sentinel comes to one who has not subscribed for it, he may know that it is sent him by some friend, and that he will not be called upon by the publishers to pay for the same.

The speech of Mr. Gleeson, of the Roman Catholic Church, which we print this week, opens up anew the subject of religion and the public schools. This will be followed with a series of articles on that subject, in the course of which not only our own national system will be discussed, but the Canadian also. Now is a good time to subscribe.

At the meeting of the Congregational Club of San Francisco, August 19, Mr. Crafts made a speech in which he took occasion to put California on a level with France in the matter of morals and observance of the Sunday. Rev. Dr Barrows, of San Francisco, replied to this, positively denying that the State of California is deteriorating either civilly or religiously, and rather pointedly observed that “a person who has been on the Pacific Coast but a few days was not qualified to speak disparagingly of the moral or spiritual condition of the State.” Dr. Barrows is right. Those Eastern Sunday-law crusaders profess great sympathy for poor benighted California, while the fact is California is far ahead of their own States in almost everything. Aside from all this, however, theirs is only a crocodile sympathy anyhow. They want to get California into the line of religious legislation so they can bring it with all the others under the rule of the preachers.

In Germany the State teaches religion in the public schools. What is the result? Last winter at Washington, Dr. Conrad, editor of the *Lutheran Observer,* said that an American family who had just returned from a three years’ stay in Germany said: “There is no real religion. Religion is turned over to the schoolmaster. The parents say, ‘The schoolmaster teaches religion, I am not responsible for that.’” This result is inevitable. The State settles what religion shall be taught. The parent can have nothing to say. Then the State has the selecting and appointing of the school-teachers. It is a State office. Teachers profess the religion to get the office. Then having no religion themselves, yet being obliged to teach it, the baldest rationalism is taught. And the nation is filled with irreligious religionists. Let the American people think of this now, while the movement is being made to establish religious instruction in their public schools.

Last December, at the Washington City Sunday-law convention, Mr. Elliott F. Shepard, to make a strong point in favor of Sunday laws, said: “The West Shore Railroad of New York ran Sunday excursion trains and bankrupted. The Lord blew upon it. Then others took the road and stopped all that, and the road is now making money.” Now we find that the New York Central Railroad Company controls the West Shore road, and we personally know that the New York Central runs Sunday trains both freight and passenger both on its own and the West Shore lines. This shows plainly enough that it was not the Sunday trains that caused the bankruptcy; because Mr. Shepard’s own testimony is that the company which now controls the road is making money, and that company runs Sunday trains. Or does Mr. Shepard mean that the Lord is so discriminating as to “blow upon” a company for carrying passengers on an excursion train on Sunday, and to give prosperity to another company for carrying many of the same passengers on a regular train?
