What kind of a religious worship do the Sunday-law workers intend shall be protected by their national Sunday law? Is it the Chinese religious worship? Would the Chinese be allowed to conduct their idolatrous worship, by noisy processions with dragons and Chimeras dire? It is certain that that would not suit the ideas of the Sunday-law workers as comporting with the proper observance of the day. But that is religious worship. And if it should be objected against as not being the kind of religious worship contemplated in the Act, the United States courts would be forced into the necessity of settling religious disputes, and of deciding what is religious worship. And if it should be pleaded, what is manifestly designed in the Act, that it is Christian worship only, that is contemplated, and that is to be protected, and the courts should so decide, then there is an established religion at once. Which proves again that the establishment of a national religion will be the inevitable result of a national Sunday law.
