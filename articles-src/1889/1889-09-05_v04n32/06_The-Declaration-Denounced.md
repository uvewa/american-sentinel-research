# The Declaration Denounced.

The object of the American Sabbath Union, whose work was practically indorsed by one of the resolutions passed by the W. C. T. U. of this county at its late session, is clearly stated by Rev. W. D. Gray, Secretary of the Missouri Sabbath Union, as follows:—

> "I do not believe that governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed, and so the object of this movement is an attempt to change that feature of our fundamental law."

Can patriotic, fair-minded American citizens indorse such doctrines? Are we to practically resign the political and religious liberty bought by our forefathers at the price of so much blood and treasure? If the present combination among a vast number of religious and quasi-political organizations shall be successful in passing some such law as the Blair Sunday-Rest Bill, it may be justly feared that the future measures of this government will soon be controlled by the same influence. All religious despotisms originate by combination and influence, and when that influence begins to be felt in the politics of a country the civil power soon bends to it.

The results of such action in other nations furnishes to us an awful example of the consequences. Do religious enthusiasts, who are working for such a law, realize that they are surely drifting towards the dogma of the "Divine right of Kings," instead of upholding the grand principles of the Declaration of Independence, which asserts that "Governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed?" When one of the leading advocates of such a measure sees clearly that the work they are doing conflicts with the very fundamental principles on which our government is based, it is time that fair-minded Christian people pause and take their bearings. Religious and civil liberty are guaranteed by our Constitution, and the American is not a good citizen who seeks to subvert either.—*Daily Humboldt Standard. *[255-256]
