Not long since there was considerable agitation for a little while over the Press dispatches from Korea, stating that Mrs. Hattie Heron, late of Jonesboro, Tennessee, was under sentence of death in Korea for teaching the doctrines of Christianity. Upon this, a correspondent sent us the following brief remarks, which we think the reader will appreciate in more ways than one:—

> "Inasmuch as 'the powers that be are ordained of God,' and as every soul is counseled to be 'subject unto the higher powers,' I suppose that those people who hold to the theory that civil government has a right to enter the realm of religion and enforce, under pains and penalties, its conceptions of purely religious requirements, and that we can therefore never be justified in refusing to obey its mandates in this respect, would have advised Mrs. Heron, and would still advise others of similar Christian zeal, to stop preaching Christ in Korea, and to absolutely refuse to carry out the Lord's commission, 'Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature,' until such time as 'the powers that be,' might see fit to look upon it more favorably."

We think so. And we might add, that if only our States were independent powers the persecution of this Tennessee lady in Korea might offset the persecution of those people in Tennessee who choose not to keep the "Christian" Sabbath. And if that in Korea can be counted persecution, what is this in Tennessee?
