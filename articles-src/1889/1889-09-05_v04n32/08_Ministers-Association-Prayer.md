At the Young Men's Christian Association rooms, 3 p. m., August 5, the Ministers' Association of San Francisco were addressed by the American Sabbath Union on organization. In the opening prayer, it was prayed that the Lord would "hasten the time when all Sabbath desecration shall be stopped and the time when this shall be a nation whose God is the Lord." Now desecrate is defined to mean "to divest of a sacred character or office; to divert from a sacred purpose or appropriation; to treat in a sacrilegious manner." Neither that prayer nor the definition of the term used in the prayer can be made to fit onto a civil Sabbath.
