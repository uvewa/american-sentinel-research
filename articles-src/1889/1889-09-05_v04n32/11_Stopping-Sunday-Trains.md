When it is proposed to stop all Sunday trains, boats, and means of distant transportation, a great many people have asked the question involved in the suggestion of President Ledyard of the Michigan Central, that if your son or daughter, or wife or husband, were lying at the point of death, and you were on the way to be with them in their last moments and the train which was carrying you should stop at midnight, Saturday night, and lie there for twenty-four hours, you would be ready to say that such Sunday laws were not the best thing in the world. The American Sabbath Union meets this suggestion by saying:—

> "It is true, the dying one might lose some sentimental comfort by your not being there, but your presence could not prolong his life even if you had been able to reach him, and therefore no great harm would be done."

This shows that the Sunday-law managers have degenerated into the hard, unfeeling spirit of the Pharisees of Christ's day, who forbade his healing the sick and ministering to the afflicted on the Sabbath. And it is time that these were learning the direction of Christ to those, "Go ye and learn what that meaneth, I will have mercy and not sacrifice." Matt. 9:13.
