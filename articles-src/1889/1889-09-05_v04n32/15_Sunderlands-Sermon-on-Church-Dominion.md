Here is a quotation that is worth reading just now:—

> "Nations and kingdoms are to be the servitors of the church, with its Bible, its sanctuary, and its Sabbaths. Human governments and races and generations are to be the enginery and the apparatus, the forces and influences through which the church shall ascend to dominion over the world, and those nations and kingdoms that refuse this grand service to the church of God shall perish and be utterly wasted."

Some of our readers may think that this is quoted from some Roman Catholic bishop or priest or paper or book, but it isn't. It is quoted from Rev. Byron F. Sunderland, D. D., of Washington, D. C., a Presbyterian, and a member of the American Sabbath Union, in a sermon preached in Washington City, and printed in the *Christian Statesman* of June 27, 1889. Then after nearly two pages of the same sort, he closed up with this:—

> "Over the chasm of a century, I see a mighty arch. On that arch must be graven an inscription. What shall it be? 'This is the gateway to the favor of God and all human felicity?' or this other mournful epitaph which the world shall read with sorrow of despair: 'Here sank the American Republic, the most favored, the proudest, the grandest of all the unions of the earth because she derided God, and despised the service of his ever-living church'?"

And that shows plain enough what all *his* demand for Sunday legislation is for. He wants this government to serve the church.
