The following item from the Denver *News *shows how little the great subject of religious liberty is understood in these days:—

> "If the importance of perpetuating one day's rest in seven is conceded, and to save this rest to the industrial masses it is necessary to legalize a day, the fact that such law would occasion inconvenience to a minority does not necessarily imply injustice to the latter. Such concessions are in harmony with a principle that is essential to the existence of society."

But such a law would occasion more than "inconvenience" to a minority; in several States such laws have occasioned persecution to "a minority." An instance of this kind was given in these columns last week, under the heading, "Practical Workings of a Sunday Law." Disguise it as they will, the fact remains that Sunday laws are demanded because so many regard the day as sacred, and when they secure a law which makes such a thing possible, they will use it to oppress those who teach and practice differently from themselves. The ostensible reason urged for Sunday laws is, to secure a day of rest for working men; the real reason is, the religious character of the day.
