According to the Milwaukee *Sentinel* of June 17, Rev. T. D. Forbush, one of the pastors of that city, in his sermon on the previous day, discussed the "Sabbath Question," and in the course of his remarks said some very good things. The reader will observe that in paragraphs which we quote from the published report of this sermon the term "Sabbatarian" is applied to those who advocate stringent Sunday observance; but according to lexicographers the term is properly applied only to those who observe the seventh day. We make this explanation so that none may misunderstand Mr. Forbush's meaning. He said:—

> "It has long been the desire of the Sabbatarians in some way to make Sabbath observance compulsory; there is a movement looking to the union eventually of Church and State, and a young man was imported here last Sunday to teach the principles of this movement. The Sabbatarians believe that because a thing seems to them to be desired it should be enforced by statute, an idea that has been held by fanatics for a long time, and who seek to make people miserable by revamping old-time laws that caused infinite misery in their time. The movement, I am sorry to say, has found the W. C. T. U. willing to stand sponsor to it. I consider the W. C. T. U. a grand order, but I regret that it should join in the Sabbatarian movement and seek to maintain moral and religious ideas by the power of the State.

> "It is safer to follow the counsel of Madison and Jefferson and Washington and Franklin in such things than that of Miss Willard and Mrs. Livermore. The Government has covenanted never to interfere in man's belief, and to force the views of some men on others is to go contrary to the republican form of government. The Sabbatarians hold that Sunday is for religion, and that deviation from that idea is sin. The Rev. Mr. Crafts said that the movement's work was as two arms. The right arm was the desire for Sabbath observance for religion's sake; the left, its observance for the benefit of the people in a secular way. However, the movement puts its left arm forward. It is ready to tell the people what they shall not do as a duty to the State, but not quite ready to say what they must do for religion. It is clear that when by the left arm they have restricted Sunday conduct, the right arm would come forward and enforce conformity to their ideas of worship. The spirit that begins by prohibiting will end by proscribing."
Then, continuing, Mr. Forbush said:—

> "Do not think that I hold Sunday lightly. I believe in it as a day when care can be laid aside; [221] I believe in it as a day of thoughtful worship. Mankind would lose vastly by losing its rest-day. Those who do not try to keep it are robbing themselves of part of their strength. . . . But while I believe in it as a civil day and a religious day, I cannot believe in trying to force men to observe it. It is humanity's day, and men ought to be able to observe it as they think best, so they do not annoy others. The Sabbatarians are trying to force the views of the majority on the minority. I do not think I have a right to force my skeptical neighbor to accept my ideas any more than he has a right to force his on me. But I have a right to try to convince him. When Christians resort to compulsion they are on dangerous ground. First it will be 'Thou shalt not work on this day; thou shalt not play, nor walk;' and then it is not a long step to say, 'Thou shalt go to church' under pains and penalties. It is always well to put ourselves in a neighbor's place and treat him as we would be treated."
