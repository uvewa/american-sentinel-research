The American Sentinel, published at Oakland, California, carries as its motto, "Equal and exact justice to all men, of whatever state or persuasion, religious or political." Those who have read the writings of that time-honored "Father of Democracy," will recognize the above as the language of Thomas Jefferson. But we are drifting away from the teachings of the fathers of this republic as surely and serenely as the waters of Niagara, in its upper course, drift toward their terrible plunge at the dread cataract. The surface looks smooth, and the prophets of Mammon are singing siren songs of peace, and telling the people that a political millennium is about to dawn upon us, when every baleful force of society points to the fact that a political and religious despotism may be reared upon the ruins of our free Government unless the people are wise enough to check the insidious influences that will bring it about. Already gold buys the highest offices in the gift of the people; great corporations buy State Legislatures, bribe the judges of our highest courts and even Congress itself. . . .

There is another danger, to which most people are not awakened, which the Sentinel combats with vigor and ability, the union of Church and State. Not an absolute union as in many of the old countries, but a *quasi* union, that will act as an entering wedge which shall open the way to put every man's conscience into the keeping of the law,—the Blair Sunday-Rest bill, which many able Christians are opposing because of the danger of the precedent. We do not wish to return to the persecutions of the Inquisition, to the cruelties of Cromwell, nor the no less barbarous persecutions of the Puritans against those who did not adhere to their religious faith. The history of religious wars and persecutions in all ages, should warn us of the danger of taking a single step towards opening a door, that, like Pandora's box, may let loose a multitude of evils to afflict mankind and curse the earth.

Our Constitution is broad enough; its foundation is firm, and we need no laws to force upon us the religious beliefs or creeds of others. We have yet the liberty to worship God according to the dictates of our own conscience; our civilization is essentially Christian in its nature, and that church which would endeavor to fasten any law upon us, affecting religious belief, has a zeal not according to knowledge. We commend the work of the American Sentinel. It *is American.* It upholds the principles for which our forefathers fought, and warns the people who would regulate the religious faith of the people by statute 'or Constitutional law, that they are treading on dangerous ground. A yoke of bondage is none the easier to bear, that it is placed upon the people in the name of religion. Of the great religious persecutions of the past, which have caused rivers of blood to flow, none were begun without an abiding faith in those who instigated them that they were doing the will of God. Let the American people, then, be content with their Constitution, nor attempt an innovation which can do no possible good, but may bring upon us woes equal to the seven plagues of Egypt.— *Humboldt Daily Standard, July 9, 1889.*
