In its issue of May 16, the *Christian Statesman *waxes very indignant over what it terms "an act of unspeakable impudence," which consisted in offering to President Harrison a goblet full of American wine from a float representing the liquor interest, and which took part in the industrial parade of New York on the occasion of the recent centennial exhibition there. We do not intend to condone such an offense as this, for, apart from its moral aspect, it was certainly in violation of all rules of good taste; but the point which most forcibly impressed us in the *Statesman's* account was the manner in which it referred to the "effrontry of the liquor industry."

The *Statesman* is very actively engaged in the movement to suppress the Sunday saloon. In fact, this is one of the great sources of evil in our country, according to the statements of National Reformers, in whose interests the *Statesman* is published. Shut up the saloon on Sunday, they say, so the Sabbath can be observed and people can have an opportunity to attend church, etc.

By taking such a position as this they tacitly admit that the saloon is evil only on Sunday. No amount of argument can dodge this conclusion. If the saloon is evil, and only evil, and if the liquor interest of the country is a gigantic source of wrong, then why shut up the saloons on Sunday any more than on any other day? Wrong is wrong, no matter upon what day it is committed; but the *Statesman,* in taking the position it has in the past on the Sunday saloon question, virtually admits that the business of saloon-keeping is just as legitimate and honorable upon the other days of the week as any other business that could be mentioned. If this is the case, (a point which we by no means admit, but which would be plainly proven by the *Statesman's* logic), then it certainly is very much out of place for the *Statesman* to sneer at the "liquor industry" of America. Consistency, though a jewel, is conspicuous chiefly on account of its absence in such a course as this.
