The object of the American Sabbath Union is thus defined by Rev. W. D. Gray, secretary of one of its auxiliaries, the Missouri Sabbath Union:

> *"I do not believe that governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed, and so the object of this movement is an effort to change that feature of our fundamental law."*
