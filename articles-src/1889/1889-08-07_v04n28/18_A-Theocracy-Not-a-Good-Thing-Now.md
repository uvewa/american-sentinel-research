A National Reformer very innocently asks, "If a theocracy was a good thing for the children of Israel, why would a theocracy not be a good thing for us now?" We answer: For the simple reason that while the Jewish theocracy was established by God, any so-called theocracy that might be set up now, would be simply man-made; and instead of God being the ruler, men would rule in the name of God. In short, such a government would be nothing more nor less than an image to the Papacy. The Pope poses as the Vicar of the Son of God; he is described by the apostle (2 Thess. 2: 4) as sitting "in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God," and this is just what any man must do who attempts to put into practical operation the theocratical theory of government.
