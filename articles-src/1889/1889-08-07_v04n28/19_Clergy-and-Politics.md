The New York *Churchman* says that "it is remarkable that the clergy of the various religious bodies take so small a part in political concerns, for in other free countries they are conspicuous in such affairs. It is stated that parliamentary government was an invention of theologians, the first truly representative imperial parliament that ever met having been the Church Parliament at Nicea." Just so; and the decrees of that "representative imperial parliament" were enforced by the civil power, and those who refused to assent to its dogmas were banished. If the *Churchman* can point to nothing any more creditable to the clergy than their part in the Council of Nicea, those who love liberty of conscience will be likely to conclude that the less ministers, as such, have to do with politics the better.
