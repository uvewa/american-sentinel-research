National Reformers are wont to insist that they are opposed to the union of Church and State, and, allowing them to define the term, we suppose that they are, for they say that such a union consists in a union of some particular sect and the State. This they are opposed to, but, say they, "We want a union of religion and the State." This is simply making a distinction without a difference, for when the State adopts a religion, somebody must decide what that religion is, and the tenets thus decided upon become the State creed, or the State religion. When Constantine made Christianity the religion of the Roman Empire, a council was called to decide what was entitled to be recognized as Christianity, and then that which was thus recognized by the council received the protection of Rome, while everything else was outlawed. And just so it would be in this country if Christianity were declared to be the religion of the United States or of any State, some authority would have to say what constitutes Christianity, and everything outside of that would be outside of the law. And this is just what the National Reformers are seeking to bring about.
