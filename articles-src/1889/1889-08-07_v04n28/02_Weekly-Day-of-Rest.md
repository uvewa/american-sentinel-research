A weekly day of rest has never been permanently secured in any land except on the basis of religious obligation. Take the religion out, and you take the rest out.—*Rev. Wilbur F. Crafts, field secretary of the American Sabbath Union, before the General Assembly of the Knights of Labor, as reported in the Journal of United Labor, November 29, 1888.*
