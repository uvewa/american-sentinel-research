In Calvin Townsend's "Shorter Course in Civil Government," we find the following under the head of "Political Maxims":—

> "That government under which the rights of all persons are not equally protected, is organized injustice."

No truer or more important principle of government was ever stated than is found in these words. According to this principle, however, the American Sabbath Union has been constituted for the express purpose of establishing organized injustice throughout this Nation. For they do intend to secure better protection of the rights of some people than of others; and not only this but they propose to give better protection to the strong than they do to the weak, to the majority than they do to the minority. It will be conceded by everyone, except an intolerant bigot, that:—

1. Every human being is directly and personally accountable to God.

2. This being the case he ought to serve God as he believes God requires.

3. Therefore each person has the inalienable right to choose his own religion.

Says Dr. Philip Schaff:—

> "Religious liberty is a natural, fundamental, and inalienable right of every man. It is founded in the sacredness of conscience which is the voice of God in man, and above the reach and control of human authority. There is a law above all human laws. It is written not on parchment and tables of stone, but on the heart of man by the finger of God. It is that law which commands with the categorical imperative, and which filled the philosopher Kant with ever-growing reverence and awe. 'We must obey God more than man.' He, and he alone, is the author and Lord of conscience, and no power on earth has a right to interpose itself between them. 'Every man stands or falls to his own Lord.' Liberty of conscience requires liberty of worship as its manifestation. To grant the former and to deny the latter is to imprison conscience and to promote hypocrisy and infidelity. Religion is in its nature voluntary and ceases to be religion in proportion as it is forced. God wants free worshipers, and no others."

From this it follows that every person has the inherent civil right to observe any day of the week he may choose as a day of religious worship. And from the principle laid down by Mr. Townsend, it also follows that each person should be equally protected with all others in the right to observe the day of his choice. Now the American Sabbath Union claims that it is impossible for a person to strictly and religiously observe the day of his choice unless there is a law to prohibit all labor on that day. They say that if some people are working while others are resting the latter are disturbed by the former, and so those who do not want to rest ought to be made to rest in order that the others may not be disturbed.

At the present time, there are two days of each week that are observed in this country as the Sabbath—the seventh day, or Saturday, and the first day, or Sunday. It follows, therefore, from the premises of the American Sabbath Union, that upon the first and seventh days of each week all secular labor should be prohibited by law in order that the whole people may be protected in their religious rights.

Is it this for which the Union is working? Not at all. They propose to entirely ignore the right of seventh-day people to be protected from "disturbance," and only ask for a law to protect Sunday-keepers. This shows the inherent selfishness of their scheme. It shows that instead of following Christ's golden rule, they have made a rule of their own to follow, an iron rule of organized injustice and religious tyranny.

If the doctrine of "liberty of rest for each demands a law of rest for all," it is just as true upon Saturday as it is upon Sunday; and we would like to see the "strategic" officers of the American Sabbath Union undertake to change this conclusion by the construction of an argument more intellectual in substance and logical in form than the ordinary Pharisaical sneer.

The fact that seventh-day observers are in the minority, has nothing to do with this question. The doctrine that the majority should be better protected than the minority, that the strong should be better protected than the weak, is simply barbarous. It is on the principle that might makes right. That was the principle on which the Jews crucified Christ. If a lion and a lamb were about to come in contact, which do you think would stand in the greater need of protection? "The lamb," you say; very well, the lamb is the minority; the lion is the majority. There is not much danger that the lamb will devour the lion, but there is great danger that the lion will devour the lamb.

God is no respecter of persons, but the American Sabbath Union is a respecter of the class that is rich in numbers and clothed in the garments of power. Their conclusions are based upon no general principles which they are willing to apply to all classes alike, unless it is this one, that "wide is the gate and broad is the way that leadeth to" salvation, and all should be compelled to "go in thereat." Their sole object is to establish "organized injustice" and subvert the United States Constitution, which declares that no State shall "deny to any person within its jurisdiction the *equal protection* of the laws."
