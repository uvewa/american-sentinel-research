To N. J. Bowers:—In the American Sentinel of July 17, I have read your article under the above heading. I am a National Reformer; but in what I am now about to write I beg leave to speak for myself only. Others may not believe as I do, and if you think my sentiments are erroneous, you must not charge my errors to them.

In common with millions of other Christians, you are in error, I think, in reference to the character of the Hebrew Civil Government, as well as in reference to what government should be now.

I ask your attention to the following propositions:—

1. The theocracy of the Hebrew commonwealth was a lawful and good government. God appointed it for the good of his chosen nation. If good then, why would not a similar theocracy be good now?

2. If there was a union between Church and State then, as you allege, and this by divine appointment too, why would not a similar union be a good thing now?

3. But there was no union of Church and and State then—no union such as people generally object to now. In the Hebrew commonwealth or Nation, the two institutions, Church and State—the religious and the civil departments —there was no union. They cooperated, each in its own department. That is all. They were each independent of the other—one did not control the other. One had no power over the other, as formerly in Great Britain. The members of the church were members of the Government or State also; but that did not make a union of Church and State. The officers of the one were sometimes officers in the other; but that did not unite Church and State. President Garfield was a minister of the gospel in the Christian Church. He held two offices, one in the religious department and one in the civil. This did not unite Church and State. President Harrison is an elder in the Presbyterian Church. He holds an office in the church and another in the State or civil department. This does not make a union of Church and State. In the Legislature of California there is a Congregational minister, and a pastor of a church. I see no union of Church and State in California. Every member of the United States Senate might be a Christian and even a minister, or elder, or deacon, and still the the Church and the State would be separate—no union.

There are three institutions, and probably only three, of divine appointment, viz.: the family, the church, and the State—family government, ecclesiastical government, and civil government. All the people should or may belong to all these. But this would not, does not, unite Church and State. The family would still be a separate institution; the church would still be a separate organization, and independent of the State; and the civil society or government would still be independent of the religious society, the church; *no union.*

4. That the Hebrew commonwealth was a *theocracy* is true, and rightfully. But the commonwealth of the Hebrews was also a *republic. *Any righteous government could be both a theocracy and a republic at the same time. All governments should be theocracies and republics, not monarchies. The government that God founded or appointed under Moses was both theocratic and republic or representative. The people afterwards clamored for a king, and God in anger gave them Saul. Every monarchy, except it be an elective monarchy, is a usurpation. And every republic in which the authority of God is rejected, is also a usurpation.

5. Notwithstanding all that I have said, I acknowledge that in the United States such a republican theocracy, or such a theocratic republic, as there should be, would be impracticable—an utter impossibility now—but only or mainly for the reason that all the people are not of one mind or of one religion as were the Hebrews. All should be Christians; but they are not. All should be Protestants; but they are not. All should be of one mind on the subject of the Sabbath; but they are not. All should accept the law of God for the rule of action in both Church and State; but they do not. These and similar are reasons why we cannot have, what we should have, a pure republican theocracy; that is, a government in which the will of God would be the supreme law by the consent and vote of the people. No other government is lawful. In the Hebrew commonwealth or theocracy, the officers were chosen by the people, and God was the Supreme Ruler. His will was supreme; the people's will law only when in accordance with the divine will. This was God's kind of government. It was good. The same should be now, and none other. All others are usurpers. With the permission of the editors, I may yet have a few more words of criticism. N. R. Johnston.
