The question of Sunday marriages has been before the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, and that tribunal has decided that a marriage solemnized on Sunday is null and void! Such a law may be in the interests of Sunday sanctity, but it certainly will not tend to protect young marriageable females. Any lecherous wretch who wants to accomplish the ruin of some confiding girl, in Pennsylvania, need no longer take his chances on prosecution for seduction; he can just get her to consent to a marriage on Sunday, and then when his lust is satiated, he can cast her off like an unclean thing. Anyone at all conversant with legal matters can readily see how such a decision will work untold injustice to hundreds of innocent women and children; but what of that, so long as Sunday is protected? This decision may be law, but it is not equity. It is, however, another illustration of the wickedness of Sunday laws.
