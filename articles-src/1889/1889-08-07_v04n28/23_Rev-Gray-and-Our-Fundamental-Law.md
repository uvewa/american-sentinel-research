Let no reader of the American Sentinel forget that, in a speech before the recent Missouri Sabbath Convention at Sedalia, Rev. W. D. Gray said, *"I do not believe that Governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed, and so the object of this movement is an effort to change that feature in our fundamental law."*

We have been charged with being unfair because we have treated the work of the American Sabbath Union as being identical with the work of the National Reform Association, but we submit if everything we have ever said to that effect is not fully justified by these words of Mr. Gray. It may be claimed that Mr. Gray did not properly state the object of the American Sabbath Union, but we believe that when these words were uttered the field secretary of that Union was present, and not only offered no protest but permitted Mr. Gray to be chosen secretary of the permanent State organization.
