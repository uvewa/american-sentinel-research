The following from an editorial in the *Christian Nation,* June 15, 1887, we insert exactly as it is. Comment is unnecessary:—

> "When the State becomes positively Christian in Constitution, and Christian men are elected to make laws, something like this will be done! A street-car company's charter will be granted conditioned upon the running of cars free on the Sabbath for the accommodation of Christian people on errands of worship, or necessity, and of mercy, even as bridge toll is at present remitted on the Sabbath in some places. To this it will be objected that others than Christians may ride for other than Christian purposes, which is very true, but the sin will be upon their own souls. The company will suffer no hardship. The men employed will be God's messengers for good, 'and in that day there shall, be upon bells of the horses, *Holiness unto the Lord.'"*
