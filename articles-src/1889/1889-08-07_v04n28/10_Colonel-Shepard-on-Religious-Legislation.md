Whatever may be the opinions and object of his co-workers in behalf of a National Sunday- Rest law, Col. Elliott F. Shepard, president of the so-called American Sabbath Union, does not hesitate to base the movement squarely upon the fourth commandment as he understands it. In a recent address before the Kings County (N. Y.) Sabbath Association, Mr. Shepard said:—

> "The Sabbath question is to be viewed first from the divine side. . . . Now, what is the law of the Lord respecting the Sabbath-day?" He then quoted the fourth commandment, and after making some statements in regard to the change of the day, he continued to argue at length for its religious observance. In this connection he denounced in strong terms the "antiSabbath Pope." He did not, however, explain how it comes that the Pope is "anti-Sabbath," in the sense of being opposed to Sunday-keeping. If he will examine Catholic catechisms, he will find that Sunday-keeping is enjoined upon all Catholics; that they are all expected to attend religious services on Sunday, and to spend the rest of the day in reading religious books. That they do not do so is not the fault of the Pope, and it comes with rather bad grace for Mr. Shepard to accuse that dignitary of being opposed to Sunday, when the Pope himself poses as the defender of Sunday, and when the association of which Mr. Shepard is president counts the entire Catholic population of the United States as being petitioners in favor of the Blair Sunday-Rest bill, which he heartily endorses.

But Mr. Shepard not only advocated laws for the religious observance of Sunday, but he went so far as to advocate the legal enforcement of the entire decalogue. He said: "Now let me illustrate for one moment as to the third commandment, 4 Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain, for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.'" A great many of the States, he said, had passed laws against blasphemy, and that was all right. "If this principle had been observed," he remarked, 44 we would never have known or heard of the abominable idolatry in our country known as Mormonism. The very foundation of that religion is, that a man can take the name of God in vain. It soon becomes nothing for him to say the Lord God says through him do so-and-so."

Mr. Shepard's idea seems to be that this country should have a law forbidding any to set up the claim of being a prophet, and of saying that the Lord has authorized him to speak in any way. Of course, it is blasphemy for any man to set up a false claim of being divinely inspired. But does Mr. Shepard really think that such claims should be forbidden by law? So it seems from his words. The plan laid down in the Scriptures for determining such claims is, "To the law and to the testimony. If they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them." But this test, we understand, is to be applied by each individual for himself, and not by the State or by courts erected by the State.

There is one feature of Mormonism with which it is certainly right that the civil law should deal, namely, polygamy. That is not merely a question of religious *belief* but of civil *practice.* It is a matter which concerns not simply a single individual who may marry more than one wife, or even the several wives which one man may have; but it goes farther than that, and it is proper that the Government should forbid it, not because it is immoral, but because it is uncivil. But to pass a law that would cause the courts to say that certain language is blasphemous, or that any man is a blasphemer because he professes to speak in the name of the Lord, would be simply to establish in this country a religious despotism.

However, Mr. Shepard is consistent in this, that he insists that a man has no right to make a difference in the commandments. He says: "The keeping of the ten commandments is simply obeying God, and so, of course, when you break one commandment you break them all. The ten commandments are like a beautiful prism that reflects the image of the Creator, and when you have broken it, the image and reflection are gone. When the spirit of disobedience has crept in and gone to work, you may break the ninth, or seventh, or all the commandments together, just as you please." Mr. Shepard's idea seems to be that it is the prerogative of civil government to require man to keep the law of God, but we would like to know how he would compel men to keep the tenth commandment. It says, 44 Thou shalt not covet." Or even how he would enforce, by civil law, the sixth or seventh commandments *as such.*

True, we have laws against murder, and against adultery, but the sixth and seventh commandments are vastly more than any civil enactment can possibly be. As magnified by the Saviour, hatred is a violation of the sixth commandment, and lust is a violation of the seventh. Now if a law is going to be enforced by civil government, the man who has murder or lust in his heart must be punished just the same as though he had committed the overt act to which these feeling would naturally lead. But how is any court or jury to determine a man's feelings? They can arrive at it only in one way, namely, by forcing from the individual a confession by means of torture. It may be said that this will never be done. Probably not, but it shows just how impossible it is for men to enforce the decalogue as such. The law of God is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart, and can be administered only by Him who reads the heart. And thus again it appears that to carry out the ideas set forth by the speakers of this Kings County convention, would be to establish in this country a religious despotism.—*Signs of the Times.*
