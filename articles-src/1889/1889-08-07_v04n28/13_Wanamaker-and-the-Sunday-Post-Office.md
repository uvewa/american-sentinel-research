In more than one hundred years of its existence no attempt has ever been made to have this Government officially recognize any religious denomination or sect, and the precedent would be a danger. A one to establish. Suppose, for instance, that Wanamaker, who is a Presbyterian, should succeed in having all work stopped in our post-offices on Sundays during his administration of the Post-office Department. So far all right, but now suppose that in the unexpected upheaval of politics he should be succeeded by a Hebrew, or a Seventh-day Adventist, both of which sects regard Saturday as the Sabbath-day, and that he should insist on having all post-office work stopped on his Sabbath. Then what a row we should have! Church and State both have important functions to perform in this as well as every other country, but let us keep them separate and distinct, for if history teaches anything it is the utter futility of successfully uniting the two.
