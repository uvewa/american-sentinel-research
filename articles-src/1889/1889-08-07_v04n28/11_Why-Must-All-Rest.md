The crude ideas which some people have of civil and religious liberty are well illustrated by the following extracts from an editorial article in the *Golden Censer,* a paper which is lending its influence to the iniquitous schemes of the National Reformers. It says:—

> "It is a strange sight to witness some good Christians opposing this reform. They are few, but very urgent. We believe they are mistaken in their fears, and thus we have charity for them. If it were, as they believe, a first step straight towards the union of Church and State, they would have fair reason for their opposition; but it is not so. . . .

> "The State does not make a religious Sabbath at all; it recognizes that a rest-day in the seven is a physical and moral necessity, and so ordains the day commonly called Sunday to be that rest-day, because that is the overwhelming choice of its citizens. It protects that day from intrusion by avaricious persons, but does not in any sense require any man to be religious, or to do worship on that day; it only says he shall not do ordinary secular work on that day, or disturb its quiet, because it would tend to destroy the rest-day for the people at large. . . . We must have a rest-day; and it must be an uniform day among all trades, or it cannot be maintained at all, in the very nature of the case; and the minority should cheerfully yield the choice of which day it shall be, to the majority. While we mean to fully protect Jew and Adventist and Baptist, and every other, who religiously has another Sabbath than Sunday, securing to him the utmost freedom of conscience, and protecting him in his place and act of worship, yet the State can have but the one day of the seven as a civil rest-day, and it must fully protect that one from violation by anybody, whatever be his belief or unbelief."
Certainly, as explained by its friends, the proposed Sunday law is a very innocent thing; it won't hurt anybody; its only for the health of the working people, and the minority must submit for the good of the majority who want to rest on Sunday. Of course! This is the theory; but what are the facts? In Arkansas they had a Sunday law which prohibited "ordinary secular labor" upon Sunday in order that the general rest might not be disturbed, and that saloons might be closed; but while no saloons were closed, and while, as a general thing, the day was no more quiet than before the law was passed, good Christian men, peaceable, and good citizens, honest, and industrious, were arrested and fined, one for painting the back end of a building, another for plowing half a mile from any road and from any house, another for digging potatoes for his dinner, and another for mending his wagon-brake in order that he might start early the next morning on a journey. These men observed the seventh day, and felt that they had a God-given right to work upon the other six days of the week, and in doing so they disturbed no one, but they were arrested and fined nevertheless, just as men have been arrested and fined under similar circumstances in several other States. But in the face of scores of such cases, we are gravely told that all are to be allowed the greatest freedom of conscience, and to be fully protected!

But why are these people thus compelled to rest absolutely on Sunday? Not for their health, for they rest upon Saturday. Not that others may rest, for such labor does not require that others labor also. Not that worship may not be disturbed, for such labor makes little or no noise, and does not disturb anybody in any proper sense. It follows that it is simply and only because others regard the day as sacred and want to compel all to act as though they had a similar regard for it. If such compulsion is not an infringement of the rights which a just government ought to guarantee to every citizen, we would like to know what would be. [222]
