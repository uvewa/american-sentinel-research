The National Reformers have a great deal to say about American institutions, the American Sunday, etc.; but the fact is, the movement is wholly un-American. In a speech the other day, the editor of *Free Thought* made the following point, which we think is exceedingly well taken:—

> "Constantine, the Roman Emperor, who lived over three hundred years after Christ, first instituted the observance of Sunday as the sacred day—the Sabbath; and we of the nineteenth century are compelled to adjourn the celebration of our national anniversary, the fourth of July, when it comes upon a Sunday, in recognition of Constantine's Sabbath; and every time we do so, our flag is trailed in the dust before the Roman emperor. We want our rights respected."

The whole National Reform movement is but an effort to Romanize America. There is only one error in the above, and that is, that Constantine instituted the observance of Sunday as a sacred day. Although he issued the first law that ever existed in regard to Sunday, its observance as a sacred day was unknown till long after Constantine's time. His law was like the one which the National Reformers want; it was not designed to make men very religious, only to make some of them appear so outwardly.
