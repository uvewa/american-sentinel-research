# Who is the Unfair One?

The *Christian Statesman* feels aggrieved at what it terms the Sentinel’s unfair criticisms on National Reform work. In its issue of January 10, it arraigns us in several counts, only one of which we will notice now. It says:—

> “The same disposition to impute evil motives appears in the criticisms in the last number of the Sentinel, on the signatures to the petition for a National Sabbath law, as accumulated and displayed last month at the National Sabbath Convention in Washington. That petition was signed by some millions of citizens with their own hand, and was indorsed officially by the representatives of many millions more. The supreme judicatures of the churches, the national conventions of labor organizations, and other representative bodies, directed their officers to sign it in behalf of their respective organizations. Cardinal Gibbons wrote a letter officially approving of the measure in behalf of the Roman Catholic Church. These facts were fully, frankly, publicly stated.”

Yes; and that was just the ground of our charge. We know that there was no attempt to make it appear that all the alleged petitioners had signed in person. What we found fault with was the “facts” which they so “fully, frankly, and publicly stated.” Our accusation was, that their “facts” were not true, and we leave it to anyone who reads the article entitled “That Wonderful Letter,” which appears on another page of this issue, to judge if our accusation was not a just one. That letter shows upon the face of it that it was unofficial, and everybody ought to know, what intellegent Catholics freely state, that Cardinal Gibbons had no power to sign any petition in behalf of 7,200,090 Catholics. Yet the *Christian Statesman* repeats that statement, even while protesting against our charge. We do not accuse it of intentional deception; we simply think it has a wonderful faculty for misapprehending facts.

We don’t like to speak of such things. We wish the National Reform Sunday-law folks wouldn’t do so. But since they do them, and seek to influence legislation by such frauds, we are compelled to mention them, not for the purpose of bringing odium on the individuals, but to show how far from Christian the whole scheme is. If National Reformers use such methods to secure their ends, what may we expect when they once get their “Christian” Government fairly established?
