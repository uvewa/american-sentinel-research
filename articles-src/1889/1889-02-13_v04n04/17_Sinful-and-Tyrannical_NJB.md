# Sinful and Tyrannical.

In the year 1785, Thomas Jefferson said: "To compel a man to furnish contributions of money for the propagation of opinions which he disbelieves, is sinful and tyrannical." Well, the Blair Educational bill proposes to do this very thing. Section two provides that each State "shall establish and maintain" free public schools, in which, along with "the common branches of knowledge," shall be taught "the principles of the Christian religion." Section four declares, "That Congress shall enforce this Article by legislation when necessary." That is to say, should any State, or all the States, decide not to establish and maintain such schools, the National Government can compel them to. Or in other words, the Jew and the free thinker can be forced to "furnish contributions of money for the propagation of opinions which they cannot indorse. According to the above Jeffersonian doctrine, this would be "sinful and tyrannical."

A man is taxed to support institutions in which are taught principles he does not believe. He does not believe in the Christian religion, yet he must help to financially support it. It would be as just to tax him to support the church and ministry, because their mission is to teach the Christian religion—the same as the Blair scheme. On the same principle a man could be taxed to support Sunday-schools, as their work is to teach "the principles of the Christian religion."

The proposed measure is a high-handed outrage upon American citizens, and the proposition ought to be treated with the contempt it so richly deserves. Should there come before Congress a proposal to establish free public schools, in which should be taught the principles of Paine and Ingersoll, what a howl of indignation would go up from Senator Blair and his friends all over the land, and with what zeal would they protest; *and this would be right.* Civil government has no right to legislate upon the people, atheism and infidelity, Judaism nor Christianity. The powers that be may not recognize a man as an atheist, or a deist, or a Mohammedan, or a Jew, or a Christian, but as a *citizen.* Congress cannot legislate in favor of religion or irreligion, heathenism or Christianity. It has nothing to do with such subjects. It cannot legislate *against* the Jew and the infidel, *nor in favor of the Christian* and his religion, and vice versa. Civil government has to do with *civil* affairs, not *religious.* N. J. Bowers. [31-32]
