# Sinful and Tyrannical.

In the year 1785, Thomas Jefferson said: “To compel a man to furnish contributions of money for the propagation of opinions which he disbelieves, is sinful and tyrannical.” Well, the Blair Educational bill proposes to do this very thing. Section two provides that each State “shall establish and maintain” free public schools, in which, along with “the common branches of knowledge,” shall be taught “the principles of the Christian religion.” Section four declares, “That Congress shall enforce this Article by legislation when necessary.” That is to say, should any State, or all the States, decide not to establish and maintain such schools, the National Government can compel them to. Or in other words, the Jew and the free thinker can be forced to “furnish contributions of money for the propagation of opinions which they cannot indorse. According to the above Jeffersonian doctrine, this would be “sinful and tyrannical.”

A man is taxed to support institutions in which are taught principles he does not believe. He does not believe in the Christian religion, yet he must help to financially support it. It would be as just to tax him to support the church and ministry, because their mission is to teach the Christian religion—the same as the Blair scheme. On the same principle a man could be taxed to support Sunday-schools, as their work is to teach “the principles of the Christian religion.”

The proposed measure is a high-handed outrage upon American citizens, and the proposition ought to be treated with the contempt it so richly deserves. Should there come before Congress a proposal to establish free public schools, in which should be taught the principles of Paine and Ingersoll, what a howl of indignation would go up from Senator Blair and his friends all over the land, and with what zeal would they protest; *and this would be right.* Civil government has no right to legislate upon the people, atheism and infidelity, Judaism nor Christianity. The powers that be may not recognize a man as an atheist, or a deist, or a Mohammedan, or a Jew, or a Christian, but as a *citizen.* Congress cannot legislate in favor of religion or irreligion, heathenism or Christianity. It has nothing to do with such subjects. It cannot legislate *against* the Jew and the infidel, *nor in favor of the Christian* and his religion, and vice versa. Civil government has to do with *civil* affairs, not *religious.* N. J. Bowers. [31-32]

Note.—No papers are sent by the publishers of the American Sentinel to people who have not subscribed for it. If the Sentinel comes to one who has not subscribed for it, he may know that it is sent him by some friend, and that he will not be called upon by the publishers to pay for the same.

A gentleman in Bancroft, Iowa, in renewing his subscription to the American Sentinel, says: “God bless the efforts of the Sentinel: If it does not meet with much reward in this world, I feel quite sure that God will openly reward it in the next. I have been a subscriber for two years, and would not do without the Sentinel. I am circulating a petition in the interest of religious liberty; am doing it for the love I have for freedom in this respect.” Many similar words of encouragement come to us. In return we say, God bless the army of workers for the American Sentinel and true religious liberty, and may their numbers increase many fold.

In speaking of our public-school system, the *Catholic Telegram* says: —

> “It will be a glorious day for Catholics in this country when, under the law of justice and morality, our school system shall be shivered to pieces.”

Then of course Roman Catholics ought to favor the Blair Amendment Bill, for if that will not shiver our system of public free schools, we know not what will. Then in that glorious day, in the rivalry which will come between the infidel and the Christian elements, the Catholics will hold the balance of power, and so be able to dictate just what “principles of the Christian religion” will be taught in our schools, as provided by the Blair Amendment. But all men may not be able to indorse what Rome calls Christian. And so legal persecution will follow.

Will all who write to the American Sentinel please make a note of the following? When you write matter designed for publication, or send questions or any other matter for the editor, address your envelope to “Editor American Sentinel.” If you send in subcriptions, or write only on business, address only “American Sentinel.” If you have both business and correspondence, and do not wish to send two separate packages, put the business on a sheet by itself, and the matter for the editor on another sheet. The business offices and the editorial rooms are some distance apart, and a little care on your part will save us much inconvenience. Besides, each department wishes to keep on file, for reference, all matter that comes to it; but this cannot be done when business and correspondence are put upon one sheet. Please don’t forget this.

The National Reformers have a great deal to say about American institutions, the American Sunday, etc.; but the. fact is, the movement is wholly un-American. In a speech the other day, the editor of *Free Thought* made the following point, which we think is exceedingly well taken:—

> “Constantine, the Roman Emperor, who lived over three hundred years after Christ, first instituted the observance of Sunday as the sacred day—the Sabbath; and we of the nineteenth century are compelled to adjourn the celebration of our national anniversary, the fourth of July, when it comes upon a Sunday, in recognition of Constantine’s Sabbath; and every time we do so, our flag is trailed in the dust before the Roman emperor. We want our rights respected.”

The whole National Reform movement is but an effort to Romanize America. There is only one error in the above, and that is, that Constantine instituted the observance of Sunday as a sacred day. Although he issued the first law that ever existed in regard to Sunday, its observance as a sacred day was unknown till long after Constantine’s time. His law was like the one which the National Reformers want; it was not designed to make men very religious, only to make some of them appear so outwardly.

January 17 was petition day in the United States Senate. On that day petitions from citizens of twenty-one States, two Territories, and the District of Columbia, were presented by various Senators. In fact the whole number of signatures—professedly about 14,000,000—- were presented, and the petitions were referred to the Committee on Education and Labor. Of course the fact that the Senators presented the petitions from their respective States, proves nothing whatever as to their standing on the matter. But there was one man who did not propose to be, by any remote construction, identified with the thing desired by the petitioners. That was Senator Riddleberger, of Virginia. Said he: —

> “I present a petition of citizens of Virginia, containing 1,851 individual signatures, in favor of a National Sunday rest law. I take it for granted it is the same as the other Senators here have presented, because of the red covering; and I present it recognizing the right of petition, but in presenting it I want to state what other Senators have not done, my unqualified opposition to any such legislation.”

It is refreshing to know that some are not prevented by weak sentimentalism from speaking out their honest convictions. It is an encouraging fact, also, that Senator Riddleberger is one of the Committee on Education and Labor, to which these petitions are referred.

At the recent meeting held in Washington by sectarian delegates from nearly every State in the Union, to promote the scheme for establishing a national Sunday, or, in other words, enforcing by legislative enactment a Christian Sunday upon the people of the United States, great unanimity prevailed among the delegates upon the subject. Strong objections, however, were made by representatives of the Seyenth-day Adventists, who worship on the ordained Sabbath, as do the Jews. A learned rabbi also entered a powerful protest, but as the opponents are a mere handful, and the supporters of the movement are numbered by hundreds of thousands, the voice of the former may be said to have been scarcely heard. This device for a Christian Sabbath, it seems to us, is but another scheme of the powerful body of fanatics who are making herculean efforts to have the Constitution of the United States so amended as to recognize our Government as a Government purely Christian in its character, with Jesus Christ as the ruler of the nation. When we contemplate these things, and also remember that our common schools are being assailed by the most aggressive and powerful religious sect in the land, well we may exclaim, with the immortal Washington, that “eternal vigilance is the price of liberty.”—*The Jewish Times and Observer.*
