# Some Questions and Answers.

One who is interested in the work of the Sentinel asks the following questions, to which we append replies:—

> “Do you hold that the basis of your religion is to serve God?”

The *object* of our religion is to serve God. Its basis is faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, with all that faith implies. 1 Cor. 3:11.

> “Do you recognize and acknowledge the fact, that every blessing secured for the well-being of humanity is so much towards serving the will of God? Or, do you consider that every blessing to mankind is an expression of God’s goodness?”

To the first part of this compound inquiry, we say unqualifiedly, Yes, if it be indeed a blessing. But not all things are blessings which are called blessings. And every blessing is also an expression of God’s goodness, whether secured through man’s agency or not.

> “Do you believe that to neglect to discharge a plain duty is wrong?”

Most certainly; “to him that knoweth to do good and doeth it not, to him it is sin.” Jas. 4: 17.

> “Do you think that a passive consent to our present liquor traffic is a sin against God and a crime against humanity?”

A passive consent to any evil is sin against God. It is sin because it is a violation of the principle, “Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.” But the liquor traffic is a crime only as it violates human laws. A passive consent to the violation of State laws would be a crime. But it would not necessarily be sin. The law itself might be sinful, as were the laws of Nebuchadnezzar and Darius (Dan. 3 and 6); yet it was a crime against the State to violate them. The worldlings, the covetous, the licentious, the hypocrites, are all sinners; but just as long as they refrain from violating State law, they are not criminal. Sin has reference to the moral law of God alone, and extends even to motive, intention, and cherished thought. But crime pertains to overt act alone against the law of a State. Therefore sin need not be criminal, neither need crime be sinful. If the present liquor traffic is in the bounds of law, it is not crime, yet we are free to say that it ought by law to be made a crime. It certainly is evil and only evil.

> “Do you feel it [the liquor traffic] to be one such of much consequence?”

We do. It numbers its victims by myraids.

> “Why do you, as men professing temperance, morality, and Christianity, claiming to fear God and to keep his commandments, array yourselves against and oppose the humane and beneficent cause of temperance and prohibition?”

The Sentinel has no opposition to the *beneficent* cause of temperance and prohibition. It has advocated both from its beginning. But it is not partisan. It belongs to no party. It has not been established to support the Prohibition Party, or any other political party, but to defend the religious rights and liberties of American citizens, and to warn them of the dangers that now menace them. It is strenuously and persistently opposed to religious legislation in any form, whether in connection with temperance or otherwise. Yet this is what the leaders in the Prohibition party and Woman’s Christian Temperance Union are endeavoring to do. Principles which, if crystalized into law, would destroy the religious liberty of this country, are found embodied in the State and national platforms of both these parties, and are declared, over and over again, to be among the objects for which these parties are striving. The logical outcome of these principles, if embodied in law, is a reproduction of the persecution of the Dark Ages and the Inquisition, with all their evils. These principles we oppose wherever found. The fact that they are connected with temperance and prohibition principles, and that good men, morally and socially, favor them, makes them all the more potent for evil. The encroachments on religious rights in the first centuries were, in many respects, less marked and pronounced than we now see and hear in the National Reform and Prohibition par ies a d Woman’s Christian Temperance Union. But *those* led to the Papacy; these; if their object is reached, will form an image to the Papacy. When the Prohibition party is willing to renounce its position as regards all religious questions, be assured it will meet no opposition from the Sentinel. But we do not propose to support one good thing, uncertain in itself, and thereby bring a certain train of evils as great as it seeks to cure, or greater. We cannot “do evil that good may come.” “Whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.”M. C. W.
