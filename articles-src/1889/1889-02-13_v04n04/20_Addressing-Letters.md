Will all who write to the American Sentinel please make a note of the following? When you write matter designed for publication, or send questions or any other matter for the editor, address your envelope to "Editor American Sentinel." If you send in subcriptions, or write only on business, address only "American Sentinel." If you have both business and correspondence, and do not wish to send two separate packages, put the business on a sheet by itself, and the matter for the editor on another sheet. The business offices and the editorial rooms are some distance apart, and a little care on your part will save us much inconvenience. Besides, each department wishes to keep on file, for reference, all matter that comes to it; but this cannot be done when business and correspondence are put upon one sheet. Please don't forget this.
