It is possible that some may think we have strained a point in our article on another page, entitled, "A Sign of the Times," and that Sunday laws will never be so rigidly enforced as to lead to a man's house being searched to see if he is quietly at work. But we have not drawn on our imagination in the least, for in Belleville, Ontario, a man was recently prosecuted and fined for keeping open his photograph gallery on Sunday. We might state, incidentally, that this man is a conscientious observer of the seventh day. This reminds us that in nearly every case of prosecution for working on Sunday, of which we ever heard, the victim was a seventh-day keeper. And this is one of the things that confirms us in the belief that the prime factor in the enactment and enforcement of all Sunday laws, is sectarian bigotry. If the people who so zealously work for such laws, would openly declare that they want to have a chance to vent their spite on those who differ with them in faith, we could have more respect for them than we can when they cover their real desire under a pretense of wanting temperance.
