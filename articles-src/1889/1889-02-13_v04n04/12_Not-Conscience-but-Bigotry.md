# Not Conscience, but Bigotry.

One thing that must strike every one who follows the Sunday-law agitation, is the complaint that it is made about the laxness of Sunday observance on the part of church members. We have listened to several sermons and Sunday-law speeches, and in every instance it was declared that church members are largely responsible for the neglect of Sunday. In the January number of *Our Day,* Professor Ballantine, of Oberlin College, has an article on Sunday travel in the West, which turns out to be an account of how eastern tourists, who are church members, use Sunday for sight-seeing when they are in the West. It is a well-known fact that the first Sunday train into Boston was run at the request of the ministers and church people of that city. And even the good women of the W. C. T. U. call loudly for a Sunday law in order that they may be prevented from making the Sunday a day of hilarity and dissipation.

This being the case, why is it that a general Sunday law is wanted? Why impose a law on those whose conscience forbids them to rest on Sunday in order to make others rest, “according to the dictates of their own conscience?” It looks very much like putting B into jail because A is a thief. We can’t understand such a procedure.

Now, we have no objection to offer if any church, as a church, shall make laws to compel its members to keep Sunday. We would not raise the slightest objection if all the churches should combine and pass a law that all their members shall keep Sunday, no matter how severe they make the penalty. What we object to is, their passing laws to make people keep Sunday who do not accept their form of religion, and then getting the State to enforce their church laws. If those who profess to have a conscience in the matter of Sunday observance would only act according to that conscience, they would not be troubled in their Sunday rest. The trouble is, that what they call conscience, is bigotry, which may be defined as one person’s conscience for somebody else.
