January 17 was petition day in the United States Senate. On that day petitions from citizens of twenty-one States, two Territories, and the District of Columbia, were presented by various Senators. In fact the whole number of signatures—professedly about 14,000,000—- were presented, and the petitions were referred to the Committee on Education and Labor. Of course the fact that the Senators presented the petitions from their respective States, proves nothing whatever as to their standing on the matter. But there was one man who did not propose to be, by any remote construction, identified with the thing desired by the petitioners. That was Senator Riddleberger, of Virginia. Said he: —

> "I present a petition of citizens of Virginia, containing 1,851 individual signatures, in favor of a National Sunday rest law. I take it for granted it is the same as the other Senators here have presented, because of the red covering; and I present it recognizing the right of petition, but in presenting it I want to state what other Senators have not done, my unqualified opposition to any such legislation."

It is refreshing to know that some are not prevented by weak sentimentalism from speaking out their honest convictions. It is an encouraging fact, also, that Senator Riddleberger is one of the Committee on Education and Labor, to which these petitions are referred.
