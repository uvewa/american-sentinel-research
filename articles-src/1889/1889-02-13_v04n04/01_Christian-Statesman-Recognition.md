The *Christian Statesman* says: "We recognize the ability of the American Sentinel, published in Oakland, California, against the cause of National Reform, and we admire the consistency with which it follows its own premises to their uttermost conclusions."

We highly appreciate that recognition. We never did bear any malice to our opponent; and since we have succeeded in raising its estimation of us from contempt to respect, it is barely possible that we may induce it to listen to reason on some points. At any rate, if consistent opposition to National Reform will do the work, we are sure of keeping its respect and admiration.
