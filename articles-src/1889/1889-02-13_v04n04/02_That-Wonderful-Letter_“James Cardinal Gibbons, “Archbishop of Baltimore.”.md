# That Wonderful Letter.

The letter which Cardinal Gibbons wrote to W. F. Crafts has been the subject of a great deal of comment and conjecture. It is safe to say that that one letter has been of more service to the National Sunday Union than everything else that has been done. On the strength of that letter, the number of signatures to the Sunday law petitions was advanced at once from something over 6,000,000 to 14,000,000. Following is the entire letter, which we take, together with the introduction, from the January number of *Our Day:—*

> “Cardinal Gibbons has indorsed the petition for a National Sunday rest law in the following letter, which is here for the first time published in full:—

“Cardinal’s Residence, 408 N. Charles Street, Baltimore,

> December 4, 1888.

> “Rev. W. F. Crafts—*Rev. Dear Sir:* I have to acknowledge your esteemed favor of the 1st inst., in reference to the proposed passage of a law by Congress ‘against Sunday work in the Government’s mail and military service,’ etc.
> “I am most happy to add my name to those of the millions of others who are laudably contending against the violation of the Christian Sabbath by unnecessary labor, and who are endeavoring to promote its decent and proper observance by legitimate legislation. As the late Plenary Council of Baltimore has declared, the due observance of the Lord’s day contributes immeasurably to the restriction of vice and immorality, and to the promotion of peace, religion, and social order, and cannot fail to draw upon the nation the blessing and protection. of an overruling Providence. If benevolence to the beasts of burden directed one day’s rest in every week under the old law, surely humanity to man ought to dictate the same measure of rest under the new law.
> “Your obedient servant in Christ,
“James Cardinal Gibbons, “Archbishop of Baltimore.”
