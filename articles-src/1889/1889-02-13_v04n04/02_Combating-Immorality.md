> "What can be done to stem the tide of rampant immorality, which is rising all around us?" was the subject of discussion at a recent meeting of ministers. This is a question which is attracting much attention of late, and the usual solution is an appeal to civil law. It is strange that none of them ever think of following the rule laid down by the apostle Paul, for use in such cases. He wrote to Timothy of a time when people would not only be immoral, but would choose teachers who would wink at, if not pander to, their lusts, and his injunction was, "Preach the Word?" That old pioneer of Christianity knew of no other way to combat immorality. He said that the weapons of his warfare were "not carnal." But now the appeal is constantly to the civil law. What has caused the change? Is it that men are so differently constituted now that the gospel cannot affect them? or is it because the ministers have not the same gospel that Paul preached.
