At the recent meeting held in Washington by sectarian delegates from nearly every State in the Union, to promote the scheme for establishing a national Sunday, or, in other words, enforcing by legislative enactment a Christian Sunday upon the people of the United States, great unanimity prevailed among the delegates upon the subject. Strong objections, however, were made by representatives of the Seyenth-day Adventists, who worship on the ordained Sabbath, as do the Jews. A learned rabbi also entered a powerful protest, but as the opponents are a mere handful, and the supporters of the movement are numbered by hundreds of thousands, the voice of the former may be said to have been scarcely heard. This device for a Christian Sabbath, it seems to us, is but another scheme of the powerful body of fanatics who are making herculean efforts to have the Constitution of the United States so amended as to recognize our Government as a Government purely Christian in its character, with Jesus Christ as the ruler of the nation. When we contemplate these things, and also remember that our common schools are being assailed by the most aggressive and powerful religious sect in the land, well we may exclaim, with the immortal Washington, that "eternal vigilance is the price of liberty."—*The Jewish Times and Observer.*
