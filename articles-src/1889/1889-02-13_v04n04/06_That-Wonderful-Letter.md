# That Wonderful Letter.

The letter which Cardinal Gibbons wrote to W. F. Crafts has been the subject of a great deal of comment and conjecture. It is safe to say that that one letter has been of more service to the National Sunday Union than everything else that has been done. On the strength of that letter, the number of signatures to the Sunday law petitions was advanced at once from something over 6,000,000 to 14,000,000. Following is the entire letter, which we take, together with the introduction, from the January number of *Our Day:—*

> "Cardinal Gibbons has indorsed the petition for a National Sunday rest law in the following letter, which is here for the first time published in full:—

"Cardinal's Residence, 408 N. Charles Street, Baltimore,

> December 4, 1888.

> "Rev. W. F. Crafts—*Rev. Dear Sir:* I have to acknowledge your esteemed favor of the 1st inst., in reference to the proposed passage of a law by Congress 'against Sunday work in the Government's mail and military service,' etc.
> "I am most happy to add my name to those of the millions of others who are laudably contending against the violation of the Christian Sabbath by unnecessary labor, and who are endeavoring to promote its decent and proper observance by legitimate legislation. As the late Plenary Council of Baltimore has declared, the due observance of the Lord's day contributes immeasurably to the restriction of vice and immorality, and to the promotion of peace, religion, and social order, and cannot fail to draw upon the nation the blessing and protection. of an overruling Providence. If benevolence to the beasts of burden directed one day's rest in every week under the old law, surely humanity to man ought to dictate the same measure of rest under the new law.
> "Your obedient servant in Christ,
"James Cardinal Gibbons, *"Archbishop of Baltimore."*

There you have it. Now we ask, in all candor: Does it justify the claim that has been made for it? Was there any reason in that letter for doubling the number of signatures to the Sunday law petition, and throwing in a few thousand names extra? We say, No. There is not the slightest hint in it that the Cardinal thought he was acting officially. He says, "I am most happy to add *my name"* etc. If all the members of the Catholic Church virtually signed their names to that petition when Cardinal Gibbons did, then, by the same token, they all eat their breakfast whenever he eats his breakfast. Are the members of the Catholic Church so closely united to Cardinal Gibbons that every individual act of his becomes theirs? Must they, per force, actually sneeze every time he takes snuff? We know that he spoke only for himself, because intelligent Catholics have roundly denounced, as a piece of worse than political trickery, the effort to make it appear that he signed for the whole Catholic Church; and not only so, but many Catholics, and even Catholic priests, have signed the petition asking Congress not to pass the Blair bills.

And yet, in the very number of the magazine in which this letter is published, it is stated editorially, that "Cardinal Gibbons also sent him [Mr. Crafts] an official letter indorsing the petition on behalf of the Plenary Council of the Roman Catholic Church." Senator Blair, also, in presenting the petitions to the Senate, December 16, stated that the Cardinal had indorsed them in behalf of 7,200,000 Catholics. We can stretch our charity enough to imagine that the Senator had never seen the letter, since we do not positively know that he had seen it; and so we can absolve him from any attempt at willful deception. But what shall we say of the others, who had the letter in their possession? We will not mention the commandment which they have deliberately broken, for we have no desire to put them personally into the pillory; but we do want everybody to know by what base trickery and contemptible frauds the officers of the National Sunday Union are trying to influence legislation. And still these men propose to purify politics!
