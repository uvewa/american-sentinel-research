# The Real Point of Conflict.

Will it be permitted those who religiously differ with the Sunday law, when it is enacted, to construe its wording: "The Lord's day the Christian Sabbath," and "the first-day of the week," to mean one day in seven and no definite day in particular; a law enacted simply to secure a weekly rest one day in seven, each week? Will the courts, the ministers, and the churches, allow of such construction of the wording of their Sabbath law? and if not, why not? This argument is used by the two latter classes, to those who insist on the literal rendering of the Sabbath law, [30] given by Jehovah himself from Sinai, which reads, "the *seventh day is the Sabbath."* "But ah!" they say: "that expression, the *seventh* day, does not mean the definite seventh day, but one day in seven. So you are at liberty to rest on Sunday or any other day. Now if this argument is valid when reasoning in reference to the law of God, why would it not be when discussing the laws of men?

But they tell us: "the definite day prescribed in the law must be insisted upon, or the whole law will be subverted, and general confusion will result. So say we of the law of God. And thus it appears that they and we agree perfectly upon the reading and application of the laws, and that the whole point of difference arises between us in reference to which law we are loyal to, just as it reads— the law of God or law the of man. And so the real point of conflict, they themselves being the judges, and their line of argument the will, is between the two laws.G. B. Starr.
