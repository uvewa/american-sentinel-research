A gentleman in Bancroft, Iowa, in renewing his subscription to the American Sentinel, says: "God bless the efforts of the Sentinel: If it does not meet with much reward in this world, I feel quite sure that God will openly reward it in the next. I have been a subscriber for two years, and would not do without the Sentinel. I am circulating a petition in the interest of religious liberty; am doing it for the love I have for freedom in this respect." Many similar words of encouragement come to us. In return we say, God bless the army of workers for the American Sentinel and true religious liberty, and may their numbers increase many fold.

In speaking of our public-school system, the *Catholic Telegram* says: —

> "It will be a glorious day for Catholics in this country when, under the law of justice and morality, our school system shall be shivered to pieces."

Then of course Roman Catholics ought to favor the Blair Amendment Bill, for if that will not shiver our system of public free schools, we know not what will. Then in that glorious day, in the rivalry which will come between the infidel and the Christian elements, the Catholics will hold the balance of power, and so be able to dictate just what "principles of the Christian religion" will be taught in our schools, as provided by the Blair Amendment. But all men may not be able to indorse what Rome calls Christian. And so legal persecution will follow.
