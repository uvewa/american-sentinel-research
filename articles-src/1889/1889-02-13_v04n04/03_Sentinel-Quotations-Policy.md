Let it be distinctly understood that we quote in the Sentinel no extracts from journals opposed to National Reform aims. Not that we do not print selected articles opposed to that work, but we make no statements concerning its aims, and what is being done or is proposed to be done, except what we glean either from official organs, or from journals friendly to that cause. This gives those statements, damaging as we show them to be, additional weight. We propose to convict them on their own testimony. Readers of the Sentinel may depend on it that the aims of those who are working to secure religious legislation are accurately represented by it. And here we wish to call attention to one fact, and readers of the official organs of the National Reform Association will uphold us in the statement, that if you want to get a full, accurate, and comprehensive view of the principles of what is called National Reform, you must take the American Sentinel. You will find it nowhere else. Send for the first three volumes, and read up on the subject.
