The American Sentinel is always welcomed to our table. It is for religion; but religion free from the trammels of law. All experience has shown that a Church in alliance with the State proceeds at once to become a monstrous evil, and the religion of the devil. The thirst for power is natural to man, and the Churches of Rome and England have shown how religious men can abuse it. The Pope and the Archbishop of Canterbury are alike the enemies of all true religion, true liberty, and true humanity. They are bulwarks of barbarism.—*Political Record, San Francisco.*
