We have received No. 1, Vol. 1, of the *Western American,* a paper published in Chicago, Illinois, "devoted to politics that will preserve liberty, civil and religious." In his salutatory the editor says:—

> "We shall courageously expose every attempt to unite Church and State, to secure fraudulently, public money for institutions under religious control, to weaken and in time destroy religious liberty."

And again he says:—

> "If the teachings of Christ mean anything, they command his followers to keep their hands and tongues out of politics, to concern themselves only with a government that is not of this world, and to render unto Cesar the things that are Cesar's, and unto God the things that are God's."

We welcome the *American* to this field, and hope that it will prove true to its motto, and to its statement of principles. Certainly there are not at the present time too many papers to oppose this work of a union of Church and State.
