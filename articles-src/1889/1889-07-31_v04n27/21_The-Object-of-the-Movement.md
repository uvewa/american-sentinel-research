The *Christian Statesman* of July 4, quotes approvingly the words of Rev. W. D. Gray before the Missouri Sabbath Convention:—

> *"I do not believe that, as a political maxim, Governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed. And so the object of this movement is an effort to change that feature in our fundamental law."*

These words need no comment, for they show positively and clearly that the object of both the National Reform Association and of the American Sabbath Union is to subvert the very principles of our Government and establish a religious despotism upon the ruins of our free institutions.
