When the field secretary of the American Sabbath Union was before the General Assembly of the Knights of Labor last November, with the petition for a National Sunday law, the question was asked:—

> "Could not this weekly rest-day be secured without reference to religion by having the workmen of each establishment scheduled in regular order for one day of rest per week, whichever was most convenient, not all resting on any one day?"

The answer was:—

> "A weekly day of rest has never been permanently secured in any land except on the basis of religious obligation. Take the religion out and you take the rest out. Greed is so strong that nothing but God and conscience can keep him from capturing all the days for toil."

And yet in the face of this it is denied that the Union is asking for religious legislation.
