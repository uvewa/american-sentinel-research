The Denver, Colo., *News* is in favor of a Sunday law which shall respect the "rights of those who from religious motives keep another day," and "also the rights of people who attach no religious significance whatever to any day." That would be a very peculiar sort of a law, and totally unlike any Sunday law ever enacted, for it would apply only to those who believe that they ought to religiously observe the day. That being the case it would seem that they might get along very comfortably without such a law, but possibly some of them need it to reinforce their consciences. But much as we would like to see them gratified, we are not prepared to admit that the State has any just right to compel any man to perform even those religious duties which he freely admits that he should perform.
