Advocates of Sunday legislation urge in behalf of their measure that they are willing to grant an exemption clause permitting Seventhday people to do "private work" on Sunday at "almost anything except to open shop, which would interfere with the general rest." But are seventh-day people the only ones who have any rights which are bound to be respected? How about others who have no conscientious scruples in regard to Sunday. Must they rest simply because others do?
