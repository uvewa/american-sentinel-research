In a recent letter to the *Christian Statesman, *written from Cincinnati, District Secretary Foster says that the *Journal and Messenger* of that city gave an article on National Reform a few weeks since. But Mr. Foster forgets to say that the article was in point blank opposition to his so- called reform movement. It is an excellent article, and so we give it to the readers of the Sentinel. We wish that it could be read by all who imagine that only infidels are opposed to the schemes of these pseudo-reformers.
