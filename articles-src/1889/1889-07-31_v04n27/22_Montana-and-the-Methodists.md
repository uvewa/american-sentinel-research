July 10 a memorial was presented to the Helena Constitutional Convention from the Montana Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church, praying the convention to incorporate in the new constitution a clause providing for strict Sunday observance. Methodists were once persecuted for conscience' sake, but it seems that now they are themselves becoming persecutors. An article on another page of this paper shows how they are using the Sunday law of Tennessee to drive from the State those who conscientiously observe the seventh day, and at the same time their brethren in the North are laboring to make such things possible in Montana. Has Methodism lost its old- time power, that it is invoking the civil power in behalf of its dogmas?
