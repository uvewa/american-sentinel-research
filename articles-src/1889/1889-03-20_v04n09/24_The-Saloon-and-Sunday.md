Says the *Christian Nation:—*

> "Not a day too soon has been begun the aggressive work of Dr. W. F. Crafts and his Sabbath Association for securing a National Sabbath law. In New York City the saloon has made the bold demand for a law permitting the continuance of its businesses on the Sabbath as on other days; and so portentous of evil is their move that the secular press—itself a sinner in the same direction, but not willing to give Sunday completely into the devil's hands—has sounded a warning in vigorous language."

Does anybody notice in the above any hint of special antipathy to the liquor traffic? No; it is only the Sunday that is in danger. Very "portentous of evil is this move." In what respect? In that the liquor traffic is increasing? Oh, no; only in that it spreads its business over a little more time, and does some of it on Sunday. Even "the secular press" is being made to feel that it is wicked to sell liquor—on Sunday.
