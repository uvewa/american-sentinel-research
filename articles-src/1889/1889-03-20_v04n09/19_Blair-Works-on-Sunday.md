Senator Blair doesn't want Government employes to be required to work on Sunday, and he is a very active worker for the passage of a law which will make it a misdemeanor for anybody to work on that day. But he evidently knows that where no law is there is no transgression, and so until his bill becomes a law he is free to use Sunday for business. This is shown by the fact that he was in his place in the Senate during its session March 3, and in a lull in the business proceedings presented another petition in favor of his Religious Amendment bill. Sunday must be observed by everybody, if its advocates have to work all day Sunday to accomplish their object.
