# Duplicity.

In the first monthly document of the "American Sabbath Union," issued in December, 1888, we find the following in the statement of what the Union asks of the friends of the Sunday:—

> "Let the church look to its laurels, lest in the humane aspect of the Sabbath question it shall be outstripped in zeal by the labor organizations. We ask every religious paper to publish our petition, and every church and preachers' meeting and religious conference or convention to indorse the petition by resolution, and also, as far as possible, by individual signatures, which duplicate its strength. The Catholic Church has indorsed the petition through a letter of its Cardinal, and most of the Protestant churches by resolutions of their supreme councils, but these indorsements are strengthened by the confirming votes and signatures of local churches."

The word at the head of this article does not apply to the statement that the Catholic Church has indorsed the petition by means of the Cardinal's letter. That is not duplicity, it is only simple falsehood. But "duplicity" signifies double-dealing. It comes from the same word as "duplicate;" and when the American Sunday Union sends up petitions to Congress, in duplicate, professing to have a certain number when some of them are repeated, it is guilty of duplicity. And when it counsels its agents to pursue such a course, its duplicity is inexcusable.

But the duplicity of the Union is duplicated, that is, it exhibits double duplicity, for, in order to make up its 14,000,000 petitions, some of them were repeated as much as four times, to say nothing of the name of Cardinal Gibbons, which was multiplied by 7,200,000. For such wholesale work there is no name, for the records of ballot- box stuffing afford no parallel. It must stand in history as the most stupendous fraud ever perpetrated; and the Sunday-law workers must stand self-convicted of using fraud in the attempt to secure their ends. No good object could admit of such measures being employed.
