Put down a long mark to the credit of Arkansas. Its Legislature has passed a memorial to Congress, asking the defeat of the Blair Sunday-Rest bill. The memorial was passed by a large majority in both Houses. We are glad that Arkansas has done this much toward redeeming herself from the disgrace of her Sunday-law work of a few years ago.
