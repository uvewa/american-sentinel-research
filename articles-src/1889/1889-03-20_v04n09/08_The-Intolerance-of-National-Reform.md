# The Intolerance of National Reform.

There are certain necessities which naturally grow out of the conditions that exist among the various forms of society adopted by men. Civil government is, or should be, simply the crystallization, so to speak, of certain rules governing and regulating these necessities. These rules, naturally taking the form of common law, should bear with equal force upon all classes of society coming within their jurisdiction. Therefore, civil government, if properly administered, should be, in the highest sense, the representation of the will of each individual, as one of the component parts of the entire fabric of human society. Each individual should have a voice in the forming of those laws which govern the body politic, in order to have a successful and a harmonious form of government. This is the right which is guaranteed to all, under our present National Constitution.

But, right at this juncture, the National Reformers rise up and insist that the real elements of success and harmony are still lacking, and that, in order to supply this lack, it is necessary to incorporate certain religious features into the Constitution and the civil law. “Let all Christian laws, institutions, and usages,” say they, “be placed on an undeniable legal basis in the fundamental law of the land.” This, and this only, they claim, is what will save this Nation, and assure to it true harmony in all its workings.

It will take but a moment’s thought to see that the only way in which harmony could possibly exist under such conditions as these, would be for each individual to recognize the moral obligation of these Christian laws, institutions, and usages, and be willing to conform to them. “Exactly so,” say National Reformers, “and this is precisely the reason why we want these matters placed on a legal basis, in order that every individual may recognize them as part of the fundamental law.” But, hold! will the fact that these institutions are a part of the fundamental law be sufficient to convince the minds of all who are subject to it that this law is therefore right? and will *moral* obligation be thus enforced? In other words, will might make right in the minds of the people? As before shown, individuals can agree on certain rules regulating their civil relations toward each other, because these rules are simply for the regulation of certain necessary conditions, and it is this unanimous consent which constitutes, in a large measure, the strength of all republican forms of government.

But will there be such a unanimous agreement when the questions involved are those of religious faith and practice? It is very evident that there will not be. So we see that the very moment the question of the individual’s relation to a divine power arises, a dilemma at once appears. If each individual recognizes the obligation of these moral requirements, he will certainly obey them, inasmuch as they emanate from a source which is, to him, higher than any human authority whatever; and in that case there would be no necessity of enforcing these higher requirements by the power of civil law.

If, on the other hand, these duties toward God did *not* present themselves before the minds of all, and yet by the power of civil law these moral obligations were made legal obligations as well, would such enforced obedience be acceptable in the sight of God? Assuredly not; for if God had desired such obedience as this, he would undoubtedly have deprived man of the power of free moral agency at the outset of his career, a fact which even National Reformers would be slow to admit. But in their desire to enforce this moral obedience by the power of civil law, they virtually deprive mankind of this God-given right of the power of moral choice, and thereby place themselves in the unenviable position of instructors of the Almighty! Is it not a wonder how God has managed during all these years to govern his creation without the help of these self-appointed teachers?

It is this supreme, self-satisfied assurance on their own part, which leads them to be so intolerant of the opinions of others. Religious convictions, whether true or false, have always been the strongest emotions of the human heart, and when the ability to enforce these convictions upon others has been conferred by law upon any class of religionists in the past, the result has always proved disastrous. The work of the ancient Scottish Covenanters, and of the Romish Church as well, is a fair example of this. History furnishes no instance to the contrary, nor would it, though the experiment were to be a thousand times repeated. Whenever the power of civil government falls into the hands of any religious body, the result must be an abuse of that power for the furtherance of so-called religious ends. In the very nature of the case it could not be otherwise. The very knowledge of having the power to enforce a dogma or doctrine, is a temptation which it is difficult to resist.

Although it would seem that these principles are so plain to all that even National Reformers would see them, and avoid the direful results which must naturally come from them, we see the lust for power so far overcoming their conscientious scruples that already they begin to use the same intolerant expressions that characterized the followers of Ignatius Loyola, and others of his class, in the past. For instance, take the following, from a sermon delivered by Rev. T. De Witt Talmage, in Brooklyn, N. Y., October 26, 1884:—

> “It is a matter of vast interest whom these great masses of humanity are going to vote for. . . . American politics will never be purified and made decent by anything less pungent and all-pervading than the Christian religion. . . . I hope to live to see in this country a party with two planks in its political platform, the ten commandments and the sermon on the mount. That would sweep the land like a tornado. . . . This is what we ought to have, and what we *will* have, —a National religion. . . . What we need is such multitudes of converted and evangelical people that they shall be in the *majority,* and that they shall *control* everything that is *secular* as well as *everything religious. . . .* The Christian religion will yet take possession of every [70] ballot-box, of every school-house, of every home. . . of this National domain.”

A few words have been italicized in the foregoing extract in order that the reader may see the real underlying sentiment to be the force of law, and not the love of religion or the religion of love, which is to accomplish all this. And when this glorious (!) gospel of coercion is established, as Mr. Talmage says it will be, and when everything which is secular shall be controlled by the religious “majority,” what will we have but the same enforcement of religious opinions against the rights of conscience as in the Dark Ages? And what may reasonably be expected but a repetition of the same religious persecution and bigotry which characterized that period? If we wish to know what kind of toleration will be extended to those who dare to maintain individual rights of conscience contrary to this established religion of the land, it is only necessary to turn back the pages of history a few years and see what has been done in the past under similar circumstances. In every instance we find the same result. First, fines and imprisonments; then confiscation of property; and finally, such gentle means of moral suasion as the rack, the dungeon, and the fagot were considered none too strong to convince the recalcitrant of the error of his ways.

The following, from *Zion’s Watch Tower,* of July, 1888, gives so much of the real animus of National Reform that we would like to lay it before the readers of the Sentinel for their thoughtful consideration. It was published under the head of “Papal Love for the Bible and for Protestants,” and is as follows:—

> “A large number of copies of the Bible were recently burned in Barcelona, Spain, by order of the Government—of course at the instigation of the Church of Rome. The following, translated from the *Catholic Banner,* the organ of Papacy there, shows that they approved and appreciated the action. It said:—

> “‘Thank God, we at last have turned towards the times when those who propagated heretical doctrines were punished with exemplary punishment. The re-establishment of the Holy Tribunal of the Inquisition must soon take place. Its reign will be more glorious and fruitful in results than in the past. Our Catholic heart overflows with faith and enthusiasm; and the immense joy we experience as we begin to reap the fruit of our present campaign exceeds all imagination. What a day of pleasure will that be for us when we see anticlericals writhing in the flames of Inquisition!”
To encourage another crusade, the same paper says:—

> “We believe it right to publish the names of those holy men under whose hands so many sinners suffered, that good Catholics may *venerate their memory:—*

> Total number burnt in effigy18,637
> Total number condemned to other punishments 293,533
> Total 347,704
And who were these “sinners” who suffered such “exemplary punishment”? Those who “propagated heretical doctrines,” and who refused to be governed in their religious opinions by the secular power enforced by the religious “majority.” In other words, those who dared to think for themselves in matters pertaining not to their duty toward their fellow-men, but toward their God. And it is nothing but the facts in the case and the published assertions of the “Reformers” themselves, which constrain us to say that this is the very spirit which again exists in embryo in all this National Reform movement of today. Notice a few of their utterances. In a speech delivered before the National Reform Convention in New York, 1873, the Rev. Dr. Jonathan Edwards, of Illinois, after referring to atheists, deists, Jews, Seventh-day Baptists, and others whom he classed under the general head of “objectors” to the Reform movement, said:—

> “These are all, for the occasion, and so far as our amendment is concerned, one class. . . . *They must be counted together. . . *. They must be named from him [the atheist]; they must be treated as, for this question, one party.”

And then, to show how very tolerant such treatment would be, he says:—

> “Tolerate atheism, sir? There is nothing out of hell that I would not tolerate as soon!”

Let but the National Reform *régime* prevail, and any individual who dares to express an opinion contrary to the new order of things will doubtless be made to realize that the “tender mercies” of this much-vaunted “reform” are about as inconsistent and cruel as such mercies usually are. It is no wonder, then, that we find the National Reform party taking so kindly to that bigoted body of religionists whose teachings and whose principles fed the fierce fires of persecution in the past; nor does it require any great stretch of the imagination to picture, at no distant day in the future, the Reform party coming into direct affiliation with Rome, and once more inaugurating, by the same methods of warfare, just such an era of persecution for conscience’ sake. That such results are contemplated is sufficiently proved by the following statement of a leading National Reformer, the Rev. Sylvester F. Scovel, as published in the *Christian Statesman* of August 31, 1881. He says:—

> “We may be subjected to some rebuffs in our first proffers [to co-operate with Roman Catholics], and the time is not yet come when the Roman Church will consent to strike hands with other churches—as such; but the time has come to make repeated advances, and gladly to accept co-operation in any form in which they may be willing to exhibit it. It is one of the *necessities* of the situation.”

Following out this same line of policy, we find the editor of the *Christian Statesman* expressing himself in the columns of that journal of December 11, 1884, in this significant language:—

> “Whenever they [Roman Catholics] are willing to co-operate in resisting the power of political atheism, we will gladly join hands with them.”

Remember that this “political atheism” is simply the refusal to indorse their views concerning the proposed religious amendment to the Constitution of the United States. No matter how honest and devoted a Christian a man may be, no matter how loyal to our present form of government, unless he falls in with the National Reform movement, he is an “atheist,” and is to be no more tolerated than anything else “out of hell.” Surely these National Reformers are apt scholars in learning the lessons of Popery. And “if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in the dry?”

Just as surely as the American people allow these principles of National Reform to succeed in the United States, just so surely will the deathknell of liberty be tolled in this fair land of ours. And may God help the poor persecuted ones in that day!J. W. Scoles.
