A gentleman who sympathizes quite strongly with the work of National Reform, writes us that aside from the argumentative part of the Sentinel, it contains nothing but sawdust. Inasmuch as the American Sentinel is packed full of argument from beginning to end,—argument which no National Reformer has yet attempted to refute,—we take the statement as proof that it is considered pretty solid.
