The *Christian Statesman* refers to the American Sentinel as "the paper published in opposition to the Christian idea of civil government."

In this, as in most things, the *Statesman* is mistaken; the Sentinel is not published in opposition to the Christian idea of civil government, but in support of it. The Sentinel is published in opposition to the *Papal* idea of civil government. The Christian idea of civil government is announced by Christ, namely, that to Cesar are to be rendered only the things that are Cesar's, while to God are to be rendered the tilings only that are God's. This idea is embodied in the United States Constitution, which declares that the National Legislature shall have nothing to do in the matter of religion. It demands that to Cesar shall be rendered the things that are Cesar's, and leaves every man free to render to God the things that are God's. The words of Jesus Christ and the principles of the American Constitution are the platform upon which the American Sentinel stands.

The Field Secretary of the American Sunday Union, Mr. W. F. Crafts, is out with a circular calling on everybody to sign his petition, which he says represents 14,000,000 people. Of course, everybody who has read the Sentinel knows that this is not true, but we suppose he will keep on saying so, nevertheless. Aside from absolute dishonesty, we can account for such reckless statements only on the ground that he has become so infatuated with the Papal theory of representation that he sees nothing incongruous in one man embodying in his own personality millions of people. If our Congressmen shall recognize that petition for what is claimed for it, it will show that Republicanism is dead in this country. The name will continue just as it continued in Rome after Cesar became Dictator, but it will be only a name.
