*Every Evening,* published at Wilmington, Delaware, says: "If most people were as well informed, and had such strong convictions upon the danger of any form of religious legislation, as the American Sentinel, there would be still less danger that such fanatics as Elliott F. Shepard and Senator Blair would succeed in gaining any serious consideration in their well-meant but worse than mischievous schemes for inducing the National Government to force men to be religious." .
