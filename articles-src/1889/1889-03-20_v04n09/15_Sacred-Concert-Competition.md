Mr. M. A. Gault reports in the *Christian Statesman* of January 10, from Oskaloosa, Iowa, that he had arrived there at a very opportune time, because Gilmore's great musical combination had been announced to give a sacred concert in the largest opera hall, on Sunday evening; and the pastors had held several meetings in order to frame a protest, because "some of them feared the concert would greatly diminish their congregations." That was the trouble in the fourth century; the church teachers were forced to complain that in the competition with the circus and the theater, these places would get the largest congregations. The church teachers could not stand the competition; they wanted a monopoly, so they sent up a petition to the emperor, asking that the circuses and theaters might be shut on Sunday. But those exhibitions did not even pretend to be sacred. The church teachers of our day cannot stand the competition even of a sacred concert; they want a monopoly of everything on Sunday. [71-72]
