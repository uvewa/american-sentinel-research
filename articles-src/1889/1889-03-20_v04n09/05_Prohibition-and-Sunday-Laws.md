In the *California Prohibitionist* of February 14 a correspondent writes thus: "I quite agree with you that all issues should be dropped from our party, save one, prohibition. ... By all means let us steer clear of the Sunday law. It is not popular."

This is sensible advice, but it will not be followed. The first thing that man knows he will be charged with being in league with the brewers and saloon keepers, because he believes in prohibition every day in the week, and not merely on Sunday. Sunday-law advocates say that they want a Sunday law so that saloons may be closed on Sunday; if they were real prohibitionists, and would work for prohibition, they would have no need of a Sunday law for such a purpose.
