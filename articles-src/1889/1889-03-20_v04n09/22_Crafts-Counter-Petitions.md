Mr. Crafts complains that the counter petitions, asking Congress not to pass laws interfering with religion, are "so worded as to give the false impression that we are asking for a law to promote the religious observance of the Sabbath, whereas our petition seeks only protection for Sunday rest and worship." Well, is there no religion in Sunday rest and worship? If Mr. Crafts takes that ground, he differs very much from Presbyterians of the olden time. But if there is nothing of religion in their proposed Sunday law, why did Mr. Crafts, in answer to the question, "Could not this weekly day of rest be secured without reference to religion?" say to the Knights of Labor: "A weekly day of rest has never been permanently secured in any land, except on the basis of religious legislation. Take the religion out, and you take the rest out." Does Mr. Crafts tell the same story to everyone he meets? or does he, like "Mr. Orator Puff," have two voices?
