The *Lutheran Observer,* whose editor is an active member of the Executive Committee of the American Sunday Union, notes the fact that petitions are being presented to the Senate every day, asking for the passage of the Sunday-Rest bill, and calls for the hearty co-operation of the Germanic churches in the movement. It says:—

> "Our godly pastors and their people, by helping to swell the number and weight of the petitions in favor of better Sabbath observance, will become a very important factor. When not practicable to secure individual names, whole congregations, through vestries or pastors, can forward their petition."

That's the way it is done. If individual signatures cannot be obtained, just sign for the whole congregation, and in that way you will get many more petitioners, for you will be able to count in many who would not sign under any condition. When people can reconcile such a course with honesty, we don't see what is to hinder their fabricating a congregation, and sending in a large list of names from some obscure place where there is no church. Nobody could detect the fraud, since the petitions are usually presented as from States and not from certain towns. [73]
