A series of county conventions has been held in Pennsylvania, preparatory to the approaching quarter centennial celebration of the National Reform Association. In announcing four of these conventions, the *Christian Statesman* of February 21 said: "These all are held under joint control of the W. C. T. U. and the N. R. A." "The addresses will be by ladies and gentlemen of both organizations." Among the subjects of the addresses, were the following: "The National Reform Movement the Work of the Holy Spirit," and "Woman's Work in Enthroning Christ in Our Government and Laws." This last was by Mrs. Mary C. Welch, president of the Washington W. C. T. U. Another official of the W. C. T. U. had a Bible-reading on "Christ in Civil Government." These items show two things; namely, that the interests of the National Reform Association and the Woman's Christian Temperance Union are identical, and that both are working for a union of Church and State.
