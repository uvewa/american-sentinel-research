# By What Power?

Dr. Adam Clarke lived at a time when he could see the evils of the Church controlling the State, as the people of God were still suffering from this terrible evil.

In his note on Zech. 4:6, "Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith the Lord of hosts," he says:—

> *"'Not by might* [of thy own], *nor by power* [authority from others], but by my Spirit ' —the providence, authority, power, and energy of the Most High. In this way shall my church be raised and preserved. No secular arm, no human prudence, no earthly policy, no suits at law, shall ever be used for the founding, extension, and preservation of my church.

> "But the spirit of the world says, 'These are all *means* to which we must have recourse; otherwise the cause of God may be ruined.' Satan, thou liest!"
Dr. Clarke says it is the spirit of the world, or, which is the same thing, a worldly church, which seeks by the secular arm, and human prudence, and earthly policy, and suits at law, to preserve and extend the church.

He calls this Satan, which is equivalent to saying that the people who work thus are controlled by the spirit of the devil.

And when the Lord Jesus says, "My kingdom is not of this world," he practically shuts out all who seek to *make* his kingdom of this world. John R. Calkins.
