The *Patriot,* published at Concord, New Hampshire, Senator Blair's State, is true to its name in opposing the Senator's schemes. It says:—

> "Congress is being flooded by petitions, circulated by cranks of the Blair school, favoring the passage of the bill which Senator Blair introduced, last spring, to regulate Sunday observance by National enactment. The Seventh-day Baptists and Adventists are opposing the measure. They should be re-inforced in their opposition by the people generally. The subject does not come within the scope of congressional action under the Constitution."

Such will be the language of all true patriots.
