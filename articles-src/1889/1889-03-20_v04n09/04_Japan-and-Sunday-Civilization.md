The empire of Japan will undoubtedly soon be Christian. In proof thereof read the following from the *Voice:—*

> "The imitation of Western civilization by the Japanese has led them to regard Sunday, which in Japan has hitherto been decidedly continental in its character, as a day of rest. This began with the closing of the Government establishments on Sunday. The Tokio citizens followed this example, and the closing spread from city to village, and now on a fine Sunday business is nearly suspended, and the places of popular resort are crowded."

Western civilization and commerce have much to do with influencing Eastern nations; doubtless those nations can easily be induced to adopt Sunday laws as a matter of business policy, and then they will all be Christian nations. How easily the world may be converted in these days.

The *Christian Statesman* of January 24, 1889, says that Free Masonry always boasts of its "historical descent from the Eleusinian mysteries and the sun-worship of ancient times." Will the *Statesman* kindly inform the public where Sunday laws, which it so much favors, came from, except from the sun-worship of ancient times? Does not the *Statesman* know that the first Sunday law that ever was, was to enforce the observance of "the venerable day of the sun," and that it was issued by a downright sun-worshiper? If it does not know this, or does not believe it, will it please tell us what other historical descent Sunday laws have than from the sun-worship of ancient times?
