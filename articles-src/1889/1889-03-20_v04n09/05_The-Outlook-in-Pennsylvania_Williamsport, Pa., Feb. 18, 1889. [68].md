# The Outlook in Pennsylvania.

Having spent a few days at Harrisburg, Pa., the capital of the Keystone State, I am happy to report that as far as I can judge from interviews with prominent men from different parts of the State, there will be found many true American citizens who will raise their voices against any movement which, like the Blair bill, points towards a union of Church and State in our United States.

I secured over 800 signatures to the petitions to Congress, in opposition to religious legislation, the most of which were of influential citizens of Harrisburg, and representative men from different parts of the State. In three hours I secured twenty-six yearly subscriptions for the American Sentinel, some subscribing for themselves and their friends.

There does not seem to be any prospect of securing a repeal of the present stringent Sunday law, which was enacted away back in 1794, and still stands upon the statute books, at this session of the Legislature, although some amendments to it will doubtless be passed. Among them is one which was introduced last week in the House by Representative Shiras, of Alleghany County. It provides that: It shall be lawful for any person duly qualified, under the provisions of the act to which this is a supplement, to carry on business as a retail druggist, pharmacist, or manager of a retail drug or chemical store, to carry on his business as such on every day in the year, either in person or through the services of a registered pharmacist as a qualified assistant.

They are empowered to keep open their store, or stores, to attend to the business of compounding medicines and selling medicines, which shall be construed to mean anything contained in the dispensaries of the United States, or medicines prescribed by physicians, proprietary goods, surgical instruments and appliances, and such other articles as are legitimately connected with the transaction of such business.

About 20,000 names have been received at our office from different parts of the State, sent in by those who have been and are still circulating the petitions to Congress. Among these are Congressmen (elect), tate Senators, members of the House, judges, mayors, lawyers, and professional men of all classes. The local papers are noticing the subject in many places. I quote the following from the Jamestown *Sun* of January 7:—

> “Petitions are being signed (and none too soon) in this vicinity to be presented to both Houses of Congress for the purpose of checkmating the efforts of a fanatical crank named Blair, in the United States Senate, to so amend the Constitution as to fetter religious liberty. The majority of the people of the United States do not, as yet, want to be compelled by *force* to receive their religion from the Government of the United States. They need no priests in politics. They want no union of Church and State. And yet, astounding as it may seem, ’ tis said that 14,000,000 names have been sent to Washington in favor of the Blair bill; a bill which threatens religious liberty in our Government, and which has passed two readings in the United States Senate.”

I might quote many other articles which have the true ring in them on this subject, but will not take the space.

The outlook in Pennsylvania is encouraging. Men and women, regardless of party or sect, are assisting in the good work of distributing reading matter which will place the subject intelligently before those who will give it a careful consideration.L. C. Chadwick.
