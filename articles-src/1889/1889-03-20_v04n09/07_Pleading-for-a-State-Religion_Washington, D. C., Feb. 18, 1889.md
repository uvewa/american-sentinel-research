# Pleading for a State Religion.

On Friday, February 15, a delegation from New York, New Jersey, and Philadelphia, appeared before the Senate Committee on Education and Labor to urge the passage of the Blair Educational Amendment to the Constitution. Dr. Stevenson, of Philadelphia, spoke in behalf of the National Reformers, Dr. King, of New York, for the Evangelical Alliance.

Were it not for the serious nature of the question under discussion, it would be really amusing to note the conflicting theories advanced as reasons why the proposed amendment to the Constitution should be adopted. Dr. Stevenson thought that the change ought to take place in order to stop the growing sentiments of Liberalism and Catholicism, but his chief objection was against the doctrines of the Catholic Church. Under a system of close questioning by Senator George, of Mississippi, he admitted that there were over 7,000,000 Catholics who would be compelled to surrender their rights of conscience by such a change, and also a “vast, indefinite following” of Liberals whose freedom of thought would be invaded. “But,” said he, “there is no other course open. Neutrality in matters of religion is impossible.”

It was plainly evident from his speech that the Reverend Doctor is in favor of coercing the minority to yield their religious, or non-religious, principles, as they may happen to hold, to the dogmas of those who happen to be in the majority. This seems all right to him, because he stands on the popular side of the question. But he did not condescend to state how the question would be affected in his mind if, by some turn in the wheel of fortune, the other side should happen to become the majority, and have the power to change at will the religious complexion of the Nation, and oblige him, because found on the side of the minority, to yield his convictions of religious truth, and his duty to God, to the dictates of the majority. Could he but place himself for a brief space in that position, it may be that he would then see the injustice of the result he now seeks to obtain.

Dr. King’s hobby was the growing demand of the Catholics for a portion of the school fund to be applied to their parochial schools. He thought the proposed amendment would cure that evil, because if it were to become a law, every child in the United States, between the ages of six and sixteen years, would be compelled to attend a school where the religious views taught would be regulated by the Government instead of one’s convictions received from the religious teachers of any one denomination. It was also a startling thought to him that Catholicism was assuming such proportions as to be able to secure the voracious demands of the church. “What we want,” said he, “is a Christianity taught in our public schools, which is not founded on any particular tenets.”

But the logic of the learned gentleman did not lead him to announce what effect the power of Catholicism would have in moulding the “principles of Christianity” to be taught in the public schools, in case the amendment should be ratified in due form. He of course knows that these millions of Catholics are American citizens just as much as are Protestants, and as such are entitled to as much respect in every way as any others. Should a school system be inaugurated such as is proposed in the contemplated bill, would not these same Catholics be entitled to recognition in framing the “principles of Christianity” to be taught in the schools? And if, as Dr. King affirmed, their power is now sufficient to give them what they demand, would they not wield a large influence in settling what should be taught in the schools as the “principles of Christianity”? Does it not follow, then, that instead of the proposed amendment obviating the present difficulty between Protestants and the demands of Catholics, they would be greatly enhanced? Surely he must be willingly lacking in discernment who cannot see the logical sequence of such a movement.

Some may go so far as to say that Catholics, Jews, and others should be excluded from the counsels of those who would arrange text-books for National schools under the proposed amendment. To say nothing of the injustice of such a course, would it help the situation? Would 7,000,000 or more Catholics, and over half a million Jews, all of whom have children to be influenced by the law, tamely submit to such disrespect? If such a course were to be taken, it would only create disrespect, and even hatred, on the part of the offended, toward the public teachers and the Government which sustained them, and the result would be religious strife and perhaps bloody discord. In other words, the history of the Dark Ages would be repeated.

It is worse than folly to talk of having the “principles of Christianity” taught without bringing in any particular tenets. What are the principles of the Christian religion but particular tenets of faith? The *principles* of the Christian religion surely embrace the doctrines of repentance, baptism, the Lord’s Supper, and many others, which now cause endless discussion. If these are taught at all, “particular tenets” must be taught and enforced to the exclusion of others which may be considered obnoxious by those who prepare the text-books.

The two speakers mentioned were followed by Dr. Morris, of New Jersey. He seemed to [69] discern the difficulty the others had encountered by antagonizing the Catholics, and sought to avoid it by saying that he had nothing against the Catholics, as a church, and thought they ought to have their say in all great questions. The only fault he found with them was that they were “introducing into politics religious questions which are destined to produce sad results.” After deploring the situation, he said that “if this amendment pass, it will remove religious questions from politics.”

Upon being questioned by one of the Senate Committee as to the nature of the political agitation caused by the Catholics, the speaker said that their religion called them to yield obedience to a foreign potentate rather than to the United States Government, and therefore their church “is a perversion,” to which he was opposed. He wanted the amendment to pass in order to put a quietus on the teaching of such a system, and also that such principles might be taught in our public schools as would cultivate assimilation to American ways.

Just how the proposed amendment is fitted to cultivate assimilation to American ways is hard to define; for if American ways are to be judged by the National Constitution, the proposed amendment is most intensely un-American; for that instrument distinctly provides that Congress shall make no laws respecting the establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof. But if an amendment shall become law which establishes certain forms and prohibits the free exercise of the Catholic, or Jewish, or any other religion, then this country will be no longer American in its principles, but will be like the arbitrary powers that ruled Europe in the days of superstition and ignorance.

But Dr. Morris, upon cross-examination, finally concluded after all that Catholics would not be subjected to any inconvenience, because they now really accept the principles of the Christian religion. He did not seem to notice the conflict between this statement and his * former one, that their principles of faith were so different from that held by himself and others that he wanted an amendment to the Constitution to cure evils growing out of religious questions that the Catholics were weaving into politics, which were causing trouble to American ideas of Christianity. Neither did he explain why the Catholics were now so afraid to have their children taught by Protestant teachers as to forbid their attendance at public schools. It seems strange that this should be so if they are so much in harmony with the principles of the Christian religion that they could quietly acquiesce in having their children taught in schools where the majority of the teachers would be Protestants, and would, as such, teach the principles of Christianity. Then, too, how strange that an amendment to the Constitution should be needed to neutralize the power of the Catholics, if they are already in harmony with the proposed change.

Then, again, how ridiculous the idea that such an amendment would forever remove religion from politics. One clause of the proposed amendment provides expressly that Congress shall have power to legislate from time to time upon the measures of the bill, as it becomes necessary. How plain, then, that as the religious complexion of the governing power changes, religious questions will continually arise for adjustment, only to be settled according to the will of the existing majority, which, in some cases, as in other questions, would be a complete subversion of previous legislation. Indeed, when the proposed amendment is effected, religion has then just been really introduced into politics, to worry and harass the Nation with the feuds engendered by political wire-pulling. Better let well enough alone, before it is meddled with. But these men will not be satisfied till they get what they demand, no matter what it entails on the Nation. If those who are so eager to promote such folly were the only ones to suffer, it would not be so bad, but when this scheme is well afloat, it will carry the entire Nation into the whirlpool of religious strife. J. O. Corliss.
