The editor of the Burlington *Hawkeye,* which, by the way, publishes no Sunday edition, says: "It is absurd to claim that the work upon a Monday morning paper can be done on Saturday and after twelve o'clock Sunday night; for the news cannot be gathered until it happens, and it cannot be put in type until it is prepared." This is so evident that anybody can see it, and yet the clamorers for a Sunday law have no objection to the Monday paper, the work of which is mostly done Sunday night, while they execrate the Sunday morning paper, the work upon which is mostly done the day before. Why is this? Simply because the Sunday paper is a rival to the church service. If it can be suppressed, then no doubt some who now stay at home to read it will go to church in order to pass away the time, just as the Christians (?) of the fourth century attended church when the theaters were closed to them. That is all that the Sunday-law advocates want. If the many who now stay at home to read the Sunday newspaper can be driven to church, they will not trouble themselves about the smaller number who have to work on Sunday to get out Monday morning's paper.
