In the line of the policy of compelling children by law to go to school is the theory of making voting by qualified citizens compulsory. A new idea of this theory in a modified form comes from Kansas City. It is a municipal arrangement, levying a poll-tax, which will be discharged by the act of voting, but collected upon a failure to vote, and the money turned into the school fund. Reformers are getting in their work rapidly of late, and the simplicity of our forms of government are being packed away in the closets with the other relics.— *Cincinnati Commercial Gazette.*
