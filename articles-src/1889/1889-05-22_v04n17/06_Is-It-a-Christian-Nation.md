# Is It a Christian Nation?

The *Christian Statesman* of March 7 presents nearly two columns of selected matter under the heading of "Public Morals." The matter consists of six different items. The first item tells that thirty thousand children of school age in the city of Chicago are said to be addicted to the use of strong drink. The third item quotes from the New York *Mail and Express* that there "are something like ten million men and women in this country who do not hesitate to get drunk whenever they feel like it, regardless of laws or anything else."

The fourth item is from the New York correspondent of the Philadelphia *Public Ledger,* relating to the condition of things in the city and State of New York, stating that at Albany there [131] is the assembly ceiling fraud, by which the State treasury was robbed to the amount of $160,000, a systematic swindle carried on by the county clerk at Brooklyn; and that the investigation of the new West Washington Market disclosed "an amount of bribery and unclean politics that is making a bigger stench than the refuse of the market itself." Besides the Wall Street transactions of Henry S. Ives, and the bribing aidermen of ' 84, whose trial drags along, the account says that "all these are merely links in what seems to be an almost endless chain of scandals." It mentions county court house frauds, canal frauds, acqueduct frauds, aldermanic frauds, custom house frauds, election frauds, and says: "One is tempted to exclaim, in the language of Macbeth, "What? will the line stretch out to the crack of doom?"

The fifth item is a statement from Chicago that the Legislature of Illinois lately refused to pass an act to amend the divorce law, "which has become such a reproach in the estimation of all good citizens."

The sixth item discusses specially the report of the United States Commissioner of Labor on "marriage and divorce," in which it is shown that the "divorce iniquity" is on the increase throughout the Nation; that the annual rate of divorces for twenty years in the Nation has grown from 9,937 to 25,535, the total number of divorces in the twenty years being 328,716, making 657,432 persons divorced. And that more than 66,000 of the divorces were for adultery.

And yet the *Christian Statesman* determinedly insists that the people of this Nation must declare by an amendment to the Constitution that this is a Christian Nation. What more is needed to show the deplorable inconsistency of the *Christian Statesman* than the evidence which is supplied in its own columns? This is not a Christian Nation; and a national declaration that it is, would be a piece of national blasphemy.
