# Sectarian Appropriations.

The total amount of taxes to be levied in this city for the current year is $33,800,000, and of this amount $13,000,000 go for State purposes, and $20,800,000 are used to defray municipal expenses. The sum of $1,142,232.61 is appropriated to charitable and benevolent institutions in this city, which, being classified according to their characters, as public, private, Protestant, Roman Catholic, and Jewish, are receiving aid from the funds of the city as follows:—

From these figures it appears that the Protestant Episcopal Church in this city will, from the city treasury, during the current year, receive the sum of $31,814.63 for the support of charitable institutions under its special direction, in which the religious tenets of that church are taught; that the Roman Catholics of the city will get the sum of $549,325.60 from the same source to aid them in supporting their charitable and sectarian institutions; and that the Jews will, from the same source, get $60,000 for a like purpose. The aggregate of these several sums, distributed among the three mentioned religious sects, is $632,130.23, of which the Catholics will get the lion’s share, while the aggregate expended for non-sectarian charities under the control and management of the city government is $510,092.- 28. More than half of the whole sum appropriated for charitable and benevolent institutions will go to institutions originated and managed by religious sects, in which their peculiar religious tenets are taught. Such, in plain words, is the exhibit which these figures present to the taxpayers of this city.

We have no objections that Catholics, Episcopalians, Presbyterians, Congregationalists, Jews, and even infidels, should organize as many private charities as they choose, and in the same teach their own religious tenets, provided always that they will be content to foot the bills thereof out of their *own* funds. This is their unquestionable right. But when religious sects seek to use the funds raised by general taxation for the support of their sectarian charities, either in whole or in part, then they in effect ask the people, through the system of compulsory taxation, to aid them in their work of special religious propagandism. To this we do most decidedly object, and would not appropriate a single dollar of public money for any such purpose. Every dollar thus appropriated in aid of a private sectarian charity, or in aid of a private sectarian school for the education of children, is misused and diverted from the purpose for which it was raised by taxation. The fundamental principle of our institutions is that the friends of religion must pay its bills by *voluntary* contributions, and that the public money shall be used only for purposes in which all the people have a common interest.

To compel a taxpayer to help support Catholicism, whether he wishes to do so or not, by using for this purpose a part of the money collected from him as a tax, is to him a gross injustice. This injustice is avoided only by leaving all the religious sects to pay all the bills of their special propagandism. There should be no departure from this rule in a solitary instance or to the amount of a dollar.—*N. Y. Independent, January 10, 1889.*

We notice considerable agitation in regard to the Blair Educational Amendment. This should certainly be carefully discussed by the American people. The provision of the second section, for the maintenance in each State of free schools, in which the “principles of the Christian religion” shall be taught, is not in accord with the principles of American Government. While it may be well enough to class this as a Christian country, the establishment of a Christian Government is quite another thing. Many of our best citizens are not adherents of the Christian religion, the believers in the Hebraic and other doctrines numbering millions. Again, the establishment by law of “the Christian religion” would necessitate the definition by law of what is the Christian religion. The range from Catholicism, Presbyterianism, and like creeds, to Universalism and other beliefs even more liberal, is great, and it would be hard to make a general definition that would not work a hardship upon some denomination of even those who profess to be followers of Christ. This Nation cannot afford to take a step that so manifestly points to ultimate theocracy.— *Vermon County (Missouri) Republican. *[135-136]

The American Sabbath Union has already appointed a vice-president of the society for Oklahoma. The appointee is Rev. B. C. Swartz, a Methodist.

The officers of the National Reform Association for the coming year are the same as last year, with the addition of I. N. Hays, of Allegheny, Penn., as district secretary. We are glad if the association has ceased to elect dead men to office.

On the walls of the room in which the recent National Reform Convention assembled were the following mottoes: “Righteousness Exalteth a Nation;” “The Bible in the Schools;” “A Scriptural Divorce for the Nation;” “The Sabbath-Rest Bill;” “The Blair School Amendment;” “Remember the Sabbath to Keep It Holy;” “Christ the King of Nations.”

We do not know which to be amused at the most—the audacious presumption of a man like Col. Elliott F. Shepard giving instruction on the Sabbath question to a body of Baptist ministers, lecturing them on the meaning and force of the fourth commandment, or the docility with which the reverend doctors of divinity listened to the law as laid down by this new convert. Is it true, as sporting men say, that “money talks”?

A recent number of the *Christian Instructor *(Reformed Presbyterian) contained the following, which the *Cynosure* thought good enough to reprint without comment:—

> “A Hungarian applied to be naturalized at the Court of Common Pleas in this city last week. The court officer asked him if he swore or affirmed. He replied that he did neither. He was asked if he did not believe in a God, and he answered that he did not believe in a deity of any kind. Judge Arnold promptly told him that he could not be naturalized, as he could not take an oath of allegiance, and added, ‘We do not want any more infidels in this country. There are enough in it as it is.’ The applicant left the court discomfited. Of course the secularists will protest against this action, but all good and true citizens will applaud it.”

This is National Reform with a vengeance. If they do such things now, what will they not do when they get the Constitution fixed to suit them? They have already declared that the success of their movement would “disfranchise every logically consistent infidel,” and it must be that their movement has nearly succeeded. Of course if the man would not declare allegiance to the United States Government, he could not become a citizen of the United States; but for the judge to refuse to admit him to citizenship because he was an infidel, was a most unwarranted assumption of authority. We should like to know how far we shall be from having a union of Church and State when a man must pass the same test to become a citizen that he would have to pass to become a church-member.

We make no plea for infidelity; it is unreasonable and absurd, to say nothing more. But we do make a plea for individual rights. A man is a man, no matter what his belief; and a Christian is entitled to no more right as a man than is an infidel. We want no self-constituted infallible popes in this country, who will make every man’s liberty depend upon his acquiescence to their opinions.

The *Union Signal* of April 25 speaks of the National Reform Convention, then in session at Pittsburg, as a “convention which, in the importance of themes discussed, is second to none that has met within the decade.” It says that “it convenes in response to the call of the National Reform Association for a conference on the Christian principles of civil government.” This shows that the organ of the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union is fully committed to the cause of so- called National Reform.

Commenting on Colonel Elliott F. Shepard’s wild flights into the domain of theology, since he became head of the Sunday crusade, and of his reckless assertions, which are due both to his zeal as a young convert, and to his utter ignorance of the Bible and church history, the *Sabbath Recorder* well says:—

> “The new field of theology which the *Mail and Express* has lately entered, demands an amount of accuracy and carefulness in statement to which the average daily newspaper is somewhat a stranger. If Colonel Shepard is to become ‘a pastor of pastors,’ and ‘a brilliant reformer/ as the New York dailies assert, it will be well for him to read up a little on church history, and to recognize the truth that, as a rule, it is best to give a fair amount of facts when dealing with history, and especially with New Testament history. A little leisure for the study of the New Testament would be an excellent recreation for the *Mail and Express.”*
