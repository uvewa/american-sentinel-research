From these figures it appears that the Protestant Episcopal Church in this city will, from the city treasury, during the current year, receive the sum of $31,814.63 for the support of charitable institutions under its special direction, in which the religious tenets of that church are taught; that the Roman Catholics of the city will get the sum of $549,325.60 from the same source to aid them in supporting their charitable and sectarian institutions; and that the Jews will, from the same source, get $60,000 for a like purpose. The aggregate of these several sums, distributed among the three mentioned religious sects, is $632,130.23, of which the Catholics will get the lion's share, while the aggregate expended for non-sectarian charities under the control and management of the city government is $510,092.- 28. More than half of the whole sum appropriated for charitable and benevolent institutions will go to institutions originated and managed by religious sects, in which their peculiar religious tenets are taught. Such, in plain words, is the exhibit which these figures present to the taxpayers of this city.

We have no objections that Catholics, Episcopalians, Presbyterians, Congregationalists, Jews, and even infidels, should organize as many private charities as they choose, and in the same teach their own religious tenets, provided always that they will be content to foot the bills thereof out of their *own* funds. This is their unquestionable right. But when religious sects seek to use the funds raised by general taxation for the support of their sectarian charities, either in whole or in part, then they in effect ask the people, through the system of compulsory taxation, to aid them in their work of special religious propagandism. To this we do most decidedly object, and would not appropriate a single dollar of public money for any such purpose. Every dollar thus appropriated in aid of a private sectarian charity, or in aid of a private sectarian school for the education of children, is misused and diverted from the purpose for which it was raised by taxation. The fundamental principle of our institutions is that the friends of religion must pay its bills by *voluntary* contributions, and that the public money shall be used only for purposes in which all the people have a common interest.

To compel a taxpayer to help support Catholicism, whether he wishes to do so or not, by using for this purpose a part of the money collected from him as a tax, is to him a gross injustice. This injustice is avoided only by leaving all the religious sects to pay all the bills of their special propagandism. There should be no departure from this rule in a solitary instance or to the amount of a dollar.—*N. Y. Independent, January 10, 1889.*
