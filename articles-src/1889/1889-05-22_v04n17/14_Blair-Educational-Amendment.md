We notice considerable agitation in regard to the Blair Educational Amendment. This should certainly be carefully discussed by the American people. The provision of the second section, for the maintenance in each State of free schools, in which the "principles of the Christian religion" shall be taught, is not in accord with the principles of American Government. While it may be well enough to class this as a Christian country, the establishment of a Christian Government is quite another thing. Many of our best citizens are not adherents of the Christian religion, the believers in the Hebraic and other doctrines numbering millions. Again, the establishment by law of "the Christian religion" would necessitate the definition by law of what is the Christian religion. The range from Catholicism, Presbyterianism, and like creeds, to Universalism and other beliefs even more liberal, is great, and it would be hard to make a general definition that would not work a hardship upon some denomination of even those who profess to be followers of Christ. This Nation cannot afford to take a step that so manifestly points to ultimate theocracy.— *Vernon County (Missouri) Republican. *[135-136]
