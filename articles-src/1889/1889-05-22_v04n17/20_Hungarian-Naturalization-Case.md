A recent number of the *Christian Instructor *(Reformed Presbyterian) contained the following, which the *Cynosure* thought good enough to reprint without comment:—

> "A Hungarian applied to be naturalized at the Court of Common Pleas in this city last week. The court officer asked him if he swore or affirmed. He replied that he did neither. He was asked if he did not believe in a God, and he answered that he did not believe in a deity of any kind. Judge Arnold promptly told him that he could not be naturalized, as he could not take an oath of allegiance, and added, 'We do not want any more infidels in this country. There are enough in it as it is.' The applicant left the court discomfited. Of course the secularists will protest against this action, but all good and true citizens will applaud it."

This is National Reform with a vengeance. If they do such things now, what will they not do when they get the Constitution fixed to suit them? They have already declared that the success of their movement would "disfranchise every logically consistent infidel," and it must be that their movement has nearly succeeded. Of course if the man would not declare allegiance to the United States Government, he could not become a citizen of the United States; but for the judge to refuse to admit him to citizenship because he was an infidel, was a most unwarranted assumption of authority. We should like to know how far we shall be from having a union of Church and State when a man must pass the same test to become a citizen that he would have to pass to become a church-member.

We make no plea for infidelity; it is unreasonable and absurd, to say nothing more. But we do make a plea for individual rights. A man is a man, no matter what his belief; and a Christian is entitled to no more right as a man than is an infidel. We want no self-constituted infallible popes in this country, who will make every man's liberty depend upon his acquiescence to their opinions.
