# The United States Constitution.

The third argument advanced by the advocates of constitutional amendment is that the omission of all direct recognition of God and Christianity gives a basis for the claim that this is not a Christian Nation, and that there is no warrant for the laws for the observance of the Sabbath, for religious teaching in the schools, etc.

This argument reaches the real merits of the question, and it must in fairness be conceded that it is based upon truth. It is true that the omission claimed *does* give a basis for the claim that this is *not* a Christian Nation, if we shall look no farther than the declarations of the Constitution for evidence of the fact.

It is also true that such omission furnishes a basis for the claim that there is no warrant in our fundamental law for legislative enactment for the preservation of the Sabbath, for religious teachings in the schools, etc. It is not only fair that this much should be admitted, but it is also but fair that it should be admitted in broadest terms that it was intended that the Constitution should be construed just as the advocates of amendment now construe it in this regard; and that there should not be found in the instrument any warrant for legislation to require any to observe the Sabbath as a religious duty, or to enforce any religious observance. . . .

The same constitutional principle would apply to and render invalid any law requiring religious teaching in the public schools; or to any law which should have for its object the enforcement of any act as a religious duty, or compulsory observance of any religious rite. Here I apprehend is where the real cause of discontent lies, and in this fact may be found the real cause for the agitation and demand for the amendment of the National Constitution. As evidence of this fact, let me again call attention to the concluding clause of the article of the constitution of the National Reform Association before quoted, which is in these words:—

> “And to secure such an amendment to the Constitution of the United States as will declare the Nation’s allegiance to Jesus Christ, and its acceptance of the moral laws of the Christian religion, and so indicate that this is a Christian Nation, *and place all the Christian laws, institutions, and usages on an undeniable legal basis* in the fundamental law of the land.”

There has long been a demand for an advance in legislation upon questions relating to morality and religion, and it is found by the advocates of amendment, that the National Constitution marks a line of limitation as to such laws and prohibits them to the extent that they may not be enforced upon a religious basis; and hence it is that an amendment is demanded which shall recognize the Christian religion as a part of the fundamental law, and this accomplished, all our laws affecting men’s conduct may be made to conform to the moral laws of the Christian religion. The question in this view of it becomes a serious one. It is not only a demand for a declaration which shall express the religious sentiment of the people, but it is a demand for such change in our fundamental [134] law as will authorize legislation to control men’s conduct to that extent which would destroy religious liberty and freedom of conscience, which we now regard as our most sacred natural right.

From whence comes this demand for greater power to legislate upon questions of morality and religion? It is believed to have its origin in the old spirit of intolerance, or in unrestrained religious enthusiasm. We are accustomed to think that the age of persecution and intolerance in the name of religion has passed. We know that in our own country men have been tortured, persecuted, and banished for no other offense than that in religious belief they differed with the majority. But that time, we say, has happily passed. But has it in fact entirely passed away? may we not yet trace the evidences of the same spirit in matters of religious belief and practice among our people to-day? It is undeniable that the same spirit *does *yet exist among the people, and it is neither difficult to discover or trace to its logical results as a motive to action. There are vastly more people than commonly believed who would be glad to enforce acquiescence in their own religious opinions by law. No observing person can doubt that there are many good people in every community who would feel especially favored if they were privileged to prohibit our comfortable enjoyment of the Sabbath, our newspaper, and perhaps our comfortable Sunday dinner, and would feel special delight in depriving us of tobacco; they would be glad to regulate our conduct in many ways according to their own standard.

Then we have in every community the other class whom we speak of without irreverence or disrespect. They are the religious enthusiasts, without balance of judgment. These are the worms of the dust, who are only here temporarily. With this class all joy and merriment is frivolity and worldliness. They do not see how one can be joyous and happy when there is so much wickedness and sin in the world. These are the people who expect God in some mysterious way to pay their rent. They go into business without capital and trust the Lord to interpose his providence in some way to pay their debts and give them success. They would minister the consolation of religion to the starving, and would not think to relieve the suffering with bread. With this class there is nothing in this world calling to duty, or for man’s serious consideration, except the church and its agencies. They express their readiness and anxiety to leave this wicked world at any hour, and they do not understand why the good doctor smiles when they appear among the first to be vaccinated. They are good people in their way, well meaning and sincere; but they misconceive their true relations to human society. It would pain them exceedingly to realize that they were a real hindrance in the great work of the church, but if the fact may be stated without disrespect, they are. This class of our good people are in favor of the Constitutional Amendment, and they are the class who most earnestly press their demands for advanced legislation regulating men’s moral conduct beyond the line now permitted by our organic laws. This class of good people, and those in whom dwells the old spirit of intolerance, constitute largely, it is believed, the moving cause which has influenced the agitation and demand for constitutional amendment of the character under discussion.

Having seen that a change in our National Constitution is essentially necessary, as claimed by the advocates of amendment, before valid laws can be passed to regulate human conduct in accordance with the Christian religion, it becomes an interesting subject of inquiry whether such advanced laws are desirable, and whether they are consistent with the natural rights of men, and whether such a change as would necessarily result in our system of government would be of advantage or otherwise. This suggests an examination of the theory of government upon which our present Constitution is based, and the theory upon which the proposed amendment would place it, so far as related to the subject under discussion.—*Hon. John L. Rupe, Richmond, Ind.*
