# Sunday Legislation.

## DO WE NEED IT? AND IS IT RIGHT?

(From the Allegan, Michigan, *Journal.)*

Editors Journal: As the Sunday-law question is receiving some attention at the present time, please permit a few remarks upon it, touching some points brought out in the recent meeting held in Union Music Hall in the interests of the Blair Sunday-Rest bill.

It seems strange, indeed, that Christianity in past ages when championed by but few, has been able to maintain and defend its doctrines successfully, not only in the absence of civil laws in its favor, but in direct opposition to such laws; but that now, with a numerical strength of boasted millions, it is compelled to appeal to the civil law to save, as is claimed, one of its most cherished and important institutions. We are led to inquire if it is the same Christianity. To resort to civil power it would seem is a confession of weakness on the part of the church.

In explaining the bill it was stated that its nat- ture and intent were such that should it pass and be strictly enforced the people of Michigan would not know, so far as effects are concerned, that there was such a law. If this be so, we query why it was thought necessary to call a mass-meeting of the citizens of Allegan, to consider the bill and urge its passage. It might be well to call attention to that section of the bill which says: “The same shall be construed so far as possible to secure the *whole* people rest from toil during the first day of the week, their mental and moral culture, and the religious observance of the Sabbath-day.” That will include the people of Michigan.

It was also stated that no such thing as religious intolerance or infringement on the rights of conscience is intended by the bill. Allowing this to have been the sincere opinion of the speaker, the best way to ascertain what it may do is to learn what has resulted from the enactment of similar laws in the past. In the States of Arkansas and Tennessee, in the years 1885-86, quite a number of respectable citizens, who, after having conscientiously kept the seventh day, went quietly about their work on the first day, were indicted, fined, and imprisoned, in accordance with the strict Sunday laws then in force in these States. Some were prosecuted for no greater offense than digging a mess of potatoes for dinner on Sunday. Only a few weeks ago a former resident of Otsego, and an observer of the seventh day, was taken up, in Georgia, for splitting an armful of wood on Sunday. So, whatever the intent of the Blair bill may purport to be, laws which permit such intolerance, and the taking of such advantages, are dangerous, and should never be enacted. The bill prohibits certain things “to the disturbance of others.” But this is a very treacherous and uncertain qualification. Some people are very easily disturbed. To many the bill may appear quite harmless, but beneath a fair exterior is couched a most splendid opportunity for the exercise of religious bigotry, and an open sesame for intolerence and persecution.

The Fresno (Cal.) *Expositor* of January 17 has truly said: “Every despotism that ever cursed the world began in an innocent way, but the beginning was not the end.”

Quite a different complexion is given to the question by those who are leaders in the cause, and have been longer in the way. The *Christian Nation* of September 28, 1887, said:—

> “Let those who will, remember the Sabbath to keep it holy from motives of love and obedience; the remnant must be made to do so through fear of law. We have no option.”

Rev. M. A. Gault, a vice-president of the National Reform Association, says:—

> “Our remedy for all the malific influences is to have the Government simply set up the moral law, and recognize God’s authority behind it, and lay its hands on any religion that does not conform to it.” And in a recent speech at College Springs, Ia., he said the means for accomplishing the desired object were four: (1) agitation; (2) petition; (3) the ballot; (4) the sword and bullet.

These sentiments more nearly accord with the actual workings of such laws as that which the Blair bill contemplates, where they have been tried.

There is nothing in man’s physical nature that indicates a needed rest of one day in seven any more than one in six, five, or eight. Night is the time indicated by nature for such rest. A law compelling men to go to bed regularly every night, would be a more reasonable one from a physical standpoint than one requiring them to rest one in seven. The great design of the Sabbath was for a vastly higher and altogether different purpose, of which physical disengagement is but a necessity in the case. The Sabbath command is to remember the day “to keep it holy,” not because we are tired, but because “in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, .... and rested the seventh day.” The day, to be of profit, must be employed in religious pursuits. A day of enforced idleness would prove a curse rather than a blessing, for Satan always finds something for idle hands to do.

The *Christian Statesman* of April 4 says:— “Labor ceases on that day [Sunday] ; wages paid on Saturday are still, to some extent, in the hands of workingmen. The Sabbath is the great opportunity [133] for filching these wages for drinks. Statistics show that on this day the sales of liquor, when unrestrained, are two and one-fifth times the average for other days, and the mischief done is greater in the same proportion.”

This shows that for the best interests of society no day at all would better be kept unless it be kept “holy.” But no one but God and religion can supply these hallowed influences. And unless the Government has a right to step in, in the place of God, and compel men to go to church and be religious, it has no right to compel them to rest on the day set apart for these purposes.

That the most prosperous men in the world are the best men is hardly a Bible axiom, to say the least. Wealth is not held out in that as a special inducement to right action. In that we read, “Sell what thou hast,” and of those who had “forsaken all;” David speaks of the “prosperity of the wicked,” and James asks, “Hath not God chosen the poor of this world, rich in faith?”

The statement that God had never abrogated the Sunday law of the decalogue need not be questioned, as the decalogue never knew of such a law. “Chambers’s Encyclopedia” states that the first Sunday law either human or divine the world ever saw was Constantine’s Sunday edict, of a. d. 321.

It is a false impression that religious assemblies are protected from disturbance by Sunday laws. These and deliberative assemblies are protected by peace regulations, which apply to meetings held on one day as much as another, 365 days in the year.

The Blair Sunday-Rest bill is an infringement on both civil and religious rights. It compels men to keep Sunday whether they believe in keeping it or not. This interferes with the individual right to use one’s time as he sees fit, and is contrary to the principles of religious liberty and the right of choice. No man is compelled to work on Sunday, for every man chooses his vocation, and is at liberty to change it at any time. The Government has no right to enact compulsory laws for the observance of any religious institution—the Sabbath no more than the Lord’s Supper, or baptism. Christians cannot be manufactured by political machinery. The Government should protect men in their religious worship, and that it already does. Therefore, with the *Christian Leader,* of February 5, we would say to all ministers on religious matters, “Keep within your pulpits.”— *W. A. Colcord.*
