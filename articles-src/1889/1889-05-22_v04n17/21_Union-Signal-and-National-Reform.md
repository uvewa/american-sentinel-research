The *Union Signal* of April 25 speaks of the National Reform Convention, then in session at Pittsburg, as a "convention which, in the importance of themes discussed, is second to none that has met within the decade." It says that "it convenes in response to the call of the National Reform Association for a conference on the Christian principles of civil government." This shows that the organ of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union is fully committed to the cause of so- called National Reform.
