# Pagan Tactics.

It has been the policy of the promoters of religious legislation in this country to attribute public calamities to our so-called infidel Constitution, and urge as a remedy for storms, earthquakes, yellow fever, and small-pox, that we vote the name of God into our Constitution.

A rehearsal of this superstitious idea appeared in the *Christian Statesman* of March 7, in which the rain which fell on inauguration-day is attributed to the anger of God because of the trains which brought the visitors to the capitol running on Sunday.

Does God smile when the sun shines and frown when it rains? Is he, like mortals, subject to fits of impatience? and does he manifest his displeasure by sprinkling his victims with rain-water?

The idea, though apparently harmless, involves a dangerous doctrine, and if acted upon will make some person or class of persons responsible for every public calamity, and thereby bring down upon them the fanatical frenzy of the ignorant and superstitious.

A quotation from “Neander’s Church History” (page 92), will show how well this doctrine served the purpose of the pagans: “If in hot climates long absence of rain brought on a drought; if in Egypt the Nile failed to irrigate the fields; if in Rome the Tiber overflowed its banks; if a contagious disease was raging; if an earthquake, a famine, or any other public calamity occurred, the popular rage was easily turned against the Christians.” That an enlightened and Christian people should have recourse to the same tactics is most astonishing.

Are the Christian churches annually burned down, blown down, and wrecked by lightning to be considered special objects of God’s wrath, and those left standing of his special care? No, it is but one of the many absurd deductions from National Reform principles, and received its rebuke 1,800 years ago from the lips of the Saviour when he assured his disciples that the men killed by the falling tower of Salome were not to be considered “sinners above all men which dwelt in Jerusalem.” A. T. Ballenger.
