# Which Is the More Dangerous?

The *Christian Statesman* of March 27 says that in a speech at Chicago lately, Mrs. Lucy Parsons declared "that the Socialists want a revolution, peaceful or bloody, they care not which."

This is just what the National Reformers want; for when the Ministerial Association of Des Moines, Iowa, in 1886 "resolved that the National Reform Association is an attempt to accomplish by revolution the Christianizing of the Nation, and therefore meets our disapproval," District Secretary M. A. Gault replied in the *Christian Statesman* in these words:—

> "Whether the Constitution will be set right on the question of the moral supremacy of God's law in government, without bloody revolution, will depend entirely upon the strength and resistance of the forces of antichrist."

And in a meeting held at College Springs, Iowa, Sunday, February 10, 1889, Mr. Gault stated four ways by which influence may be brought to bear to make this a Christian Nation: First, agitation; second, petition; third, by the ballot; fourth, by the sword. And in explaining and justifying the use of the sword he said: "Don't think we are advocating war; but if we are not faithful in the use of these other means, as it was with the antislavery question, after they had agitated and petitioned and used the ballot, they drew the sword; so shall we, as a last resort, be compelled to use the sword and the bullet."

If there is any difference between the intentions and the methods of the Socialists and those of the National Reformers, as officially expressed by M. A. Gault, we are utterly unable to discern it. There is this, however, in favor of the Socialists, that where they propose bloody revolution schemes, out of sheer, open wickedness, the National Reformers propose revolution under a form of godliness, making it so much more calculated to play into the hands of Satan.
