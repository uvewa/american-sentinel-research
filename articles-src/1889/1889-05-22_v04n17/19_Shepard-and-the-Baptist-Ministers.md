We do not know which to be amused at the most—the audacious presumption of a man like Col. Elliott F. Shepard giving instruction on the Sabbath question to a body of Baptist ministers, lecturing them on the meaning and force of the fourth commandment, or the docility with which the reverend doctors of divinity listened to the law as laid down by this new convert. Is it true, as sporting men say, that "money talks"?
