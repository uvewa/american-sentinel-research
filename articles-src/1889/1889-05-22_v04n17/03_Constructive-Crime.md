# Constructive Crime.

The New York *Independent* of March 14, 1889, presents a piece of news that most excellently serves to illustrate how the National Reform theory of the ten commandments being made our civil and political code, may be made to work practically. The New York *Times,* being opposed to Mr. Harrison’s administration in general, and to Mr. Wanamaker, the new Post- master-General, in particular, declared that when Mr. Wanamaker took the office as Postmaster- General he broke two of the ten commandments. The two commandments which the *Times* asserts that Mr. Wanamaker broke are the last two: “Thou shalt not bear false witness;” and, “Thou shalt not covet.” The *Times* says, however, that it does not suppose that Mr. Wanamaker was conscious of having violated either of them. Yet it asserts, nevertheless, that he did violate them both, and is therefore guilty of both. To sustain its indictment of Mr. Wanamaker, the *Times* testifies that he “contributed to a campaign fund of the Republican party that was expended in the most extended scheme for bearing false witness against the majority of the American people, and in particular against the leaders of that majority in politics.” That is the way in which, according to the *Times,* Mr. Wanamaker broke the ninth commandment.

That he broke the tenth commandment is proved by the *Times* in this way: “Protection to American industries,” says the *Times,* is a “form of covetousness.”

Mr. Wanamaker, having worked and contributed for the protection of American industries, is therefore guilty of covetousness. And then the *Times,* according to its own estimate, having convicted Mr. Wanamaker of such heinous crimes, gives vent to the doleful prospect before the country by the sore lamentation that “it is plain that we are in the presence of a pervading demoralization such as the republic has never witnessed before.”

This proceeding is strictly in the line of the National Reform theory of government. If the ten commandments were the civil code of this country, then the *Times* could carry a case against Mr. Wanamaker upon that plea. Every action in the life of every man would fall within the purview of judicial investigation and process; because there is nothing that a man may do that does not involve one or more of the ten commandments. Such a system of government as is proposed by the National Reform Association and its allies who are working so strenuously for religious legislation, would annihilate every form of civil freedom, to say nothing of religious freedom. The evils of the old English process of “constructive treason” were not a circumstance compared with the state of affairs which this would create.
