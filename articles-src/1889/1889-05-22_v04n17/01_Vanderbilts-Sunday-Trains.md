The Philadelphia *Inquirer* of April 25 speaks of Vanderbilt's decision to run no freight trains on Sunday, except such as are absolutely necessary, and to run as few passenger trains as possible, noticing the effect that this will have on other roads, and adds:—

> "We don't wish to seem irreverent about it, but really it looks as if certain rich men may get into the kingdom of Heaven by way of the New York Central and Hudson River Railroad, after all."
