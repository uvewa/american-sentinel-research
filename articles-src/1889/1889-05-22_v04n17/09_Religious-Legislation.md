# Religious Legislation.

Almost from the beginning of our country’s career as an independent Government, efforts have been made by various individuals to bring into connection with its statutory laws divers religious provisions. The latest and most thoroughly organized effort in this direction, however, has been made by the so-called National Reform Association, which for several years past has been laboring with intense but misguided zeal to accomplish this result. As most of the readers of the American Sentinel are doubtless aware, this movement has received a fresh impetus by the introduction, during the last Congress, of two bills by Senator Blair, one providing for religious instruction in the public schools, the other being his well-known Sunday-Rest bill.

That these bills were intended as religious measures no one can reasonably doubt, especially in view of the fact that they were introduced at the request of and championed by, the National, Woman’s Christian Temperance Union, which is confessedly a religious organization. Their passage was also earnestly advocated by the National Reform Association, which stands committed on the same issue by virtue of its constitution, which states the grand object of the society to be the securing of “such an amendment to the Constitution of the United States as will declare the Nation’s allegiance to Jesus Christ, and its acceptance of the moral laws of the Christian religion.” It also proposes to place the existing Christian usages and institutions of our country on an “undeniable legal basis in the fundamental law of the land.” With such an outspoken statement of principles as this, it would not be expected that the National Reformers would let slip such an excellent opportunity to show their sincerity as was offered by the bills in question.

How these two bodies of would-be reformers can shut their eyes to the legitimate consequences of the success of such a movement as this is difficult to understand. We can readily see how it is that many good people might be led to favor the legislation proposed, because, at first thought, its real nature might not be apparent. But that any loyal American citizen, after carefully reasoning out the logical result of such work, could favor the intolerance necessarily connected with this, or any other such scheme of religious legislation, we do not believe.

Legislation is right, and religion is right, and even religious legislation is right when it proceeds from proper authority, but that authority does not consist in the issuing of religious mandates by men, or even in God’s commandments interpreted and enforced by human power. And whenever we see any class of men proclaiming their right to formulate civil laws to govern the religious belief of their fellow-men, we shall oppose such intolerance with all our power, and enter a most vigorous protest.

The word “legislation” comes from the Latin *legis,* or law, and is defined by Webster to be “the act of legislating or enacting laws.” We believe in law, and hold, in common with all good citizens, that without law anarchy must supervene. In fact, law is the foundation of all government, and a Government without law is simply no Government at all. But because it is right for men to be governed by law, it does not necessarily follow that that law must be religious in its character. Far from it. The laws which govern men in their relations to each other must be, in the very nature of the case, as different from the laws governing their relation to God as God is different from man. Religion has direct reference to God and his worship, and is worship, in fact, in one sense of the word; and in all senses of the word is the recognition of some object of veneration or worship. We care not whether this object be animate or inanimate; whether it be simply a principle, or Jehovah himself. The idea is the same. Religion is the recognition of the idea of deity, and religious legislation is simply the enactment of laws professedly emanating from a divine source, and relating to divine government. But as no power, save that of their own wills, can lead men to pay reverence and homage to a Supreme Being, it follows that all efforts in the direction of religious legislation must end in failure, whenever such legislation is controlled and conducted by men.

When will people learn that no human power whatever can control the individual consciences of the children of men? It would be well if National Reformers, and others of their class, would learn what are the first principles of religion, and that enforced worship never did and never can constitute true and acceptable service to God. Perhaps if they understood this more perfectly, they would not desire to place themselves so conspicuously in God’s stead.J. W. Scoles.
