# Sunday-Law Methods in Michigan.

In a recent mass-meeting held in Allegan, Mich., called by the ministers of the place in the interests of the Blair Sunday bill, the petitions circulated for signatures consisted simply of blank paper. The people were urged to sign the “petition,” being assured that after they had done so, the slips would be collected, pasted together, and the “appropriate heading” affixed to them. No explanation was made as to how the petition was to read; whether the undersigned were “adult residents of the United States, twenty-one years of age or more,” or not. Consequently, children were allowed to sign the spotless and wordless document. At this juncture, some five or six speeches having been made by various divines, attorneys, and merchants, a lawyer arose in the audience, and, after remarking that there had been considerable complaint as to the methods employed by this side in obtaining signatures, etc., said he had signed the other petition, and would like two minutes to state why he did so, upon which the chairman very promptly informed him that they did not care to hear him. Such are some of the blind methods of promoting the Sunday cause, and such a sample of the freedom of speech allowed under a Government ruled by the church.— *W. A. C., in Review and Herald. *[137]
