# Religious Persecution in Georgia.

We have already printed the Associated Press dispatch, concerning the persecution of Mr. D. Conklin, a Seventh-day Adventist, in Georgia, for working on Sunday, but we republish it for the sake of the comments made upon it by the Allegan (Mich.) *Journal,* from which the following is clipped. Sunday-law zealots would like to make it appear that all Seventh-day people who are or have been persecuted for working on Sunday were cranks and disputatious busybodies who deserved persecution on general principles; the following makes such an attempt impossible in this case:—

> “D. Conklin, who was for several years a resident of Otsego, where he was greatly respected, recently moved to Milton County, Georgia, and has been brought into serious trouble by his religious opinions, which are those of the Seventh-day Adventists.

> “Elder M. G. Huffman, of that sect, has written a letter to the General Conference, at Battle Creek, in which he says:—
> “‘Mr. Conklin has been reported to the Grand Jury, and a bill found against him for working on Sunday, and all he did was to cut a few sticks of wood to build a fire—just what I have seen many others doing since I came to the State. The penalty for violating any portion of the law in this State is very severe. They have what is known in this State as a “chain gang,” where those who violate the law are taken, and ball and chain fastened to one leg, and they are made to work on the public roads and railroads, and those who are put there are many of them treated worse than brutes; many have been whipped to death, and doubtless if he should be taken for working on Sunday he would be compelled to work on the Sabbath or be whipped. What is your advice? Should we be beaten in the Circuit Court? would you take the case to the Supreme Court? and if so can you help us? We are all poor here.’
> “This is the case of a man well known in this vicinity, and of whom his former neighbors speak in the highest terms. It scarcely seems credible that in the United States a man should be in danger of being sent to the chain-gang because, after conscientiously keeping the seventh day of the week, he sees fit to chop wood on the first day, but it is nevertheless true, and there is a good deal of this same religious intolerance in our very midst. With this, and other similar experiences in view, is it strange that the Seventh- day Adventists are bitterly opposed to the Blair Sunday-Best bill, which would render them amenable to law in other parts of the Union if they did any work on Sundays?”
