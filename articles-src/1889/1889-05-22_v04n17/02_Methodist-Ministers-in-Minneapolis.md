The Methodist ministers in Minneapolis have been considerably agitated over the question of whether or not they should countenance the camp-meeting held at Red Rock Park, unless the gates should be closed on Sunday, so that no one who patronized a Sunday excursion train could come in. They finally decided that they would support the meeting if the gates of the park were closed on Sunday. One of the ministers interested in the camp-meeting says that it will be impossible to keep the gates closed on Sunday, and that it is absurd for people to say that meetings open to the public should not be held on Sunday, simply because trains go by. He adds: "If this were true, why should the Centenary Church, for instance, be open on Sunday, when people take the motor line to get to the church?" We do not see how the city clergymen can well reply. Their position leaves them open to the suspicion of desiring to have a monopoly of the Sunday services.
