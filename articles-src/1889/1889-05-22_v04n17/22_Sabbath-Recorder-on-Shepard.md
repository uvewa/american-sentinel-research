Commenting on Colonel Elliott F. Shepard's wild flights into the domain of theology, since he became head of the Sunday crusade, and of his reckless assertions, which are due both to his zeal as a young convert, and to his utter ignorance of the Bible and church history, the *Sabbath Recorder* well says:—

> "The new field of theology which the *Mail and Express* has lately entered, demands an amount of accuracy and carefulness in statement to which the average daily newspaper is somewhat a stranger. If Colonel Shepard is to become 'a pastor of pastors,' and 'a brilliant reformer,' as the New York dailies assert, it will be well for him to read up a little on church history, and to recognize the truth that, as a rule, it is best to give a fair amount of facts when dealing with history, and especially with New Testament history. A little leisure for the study of the New Testament would be an excellent recreation for the *Mail and Express."*
