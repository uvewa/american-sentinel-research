# Who Are Religious Persecutors?

Among Protestants, in the past, such terms as “Papal,” “Romish,” etc., were synonyms of all that was intolerant. In other words, the Catholic Church has received credit for about all the bitter persecutions that have ever been heaped upon doctrinal opponents. And because of this quite general impression, erroneous as it is, people are wont to rest in utter unconcern as to any danger of religious persecution in this country, where the Catholics are not at liberty to openly manifest their traditional characteristics.

It is, therefore, supposed by many to be safe, yea, even expedient, to trust all civil and religious authority in the hands of Protestant religionists in the United States. And a very extensive and aggressive movement is on foot to carry out such a scheme. Because of this prevalent delusion it is well to note some of the tendencies of religious [147] individuals and sects outside of the Catholic Church, when clothed with secular power.

All students of history, as well as many merely casual readers, are familiar with the tyrannical and intolerant sway of the Covenanters and Presbyterians in Great Britain, in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. It may not be generally understood, but it is a fact, that the Reformed Presbyterians in the United States boast of being the only conservators of the principles of the Scottish Covenanters. Of course they are Protestants, as their religious progenitors, of whom John Knox was a leader, taught that it was right to disfranchise Catholics, and even to put them to death.

This church is leader in the movement to secure a religious amendment to the Constitution of the United States, enforcing by law what it deems the principles of the Christian religion. And representative men, including Conferences, Presbyteries, and other general bodies of the leading denominations, have joined hands with them in the work. Now no man, or set of men, ever earnestly solicit a law which they do not expect to have enforced,—and enforced at all hazards. And it is impossible that they should contend for a law against a strong element of opposition for a quarter of a century without some idea of what would be necessary in order to enforce it. Therefore, persistence in the effort means, in case of success, persistence on the part of the Government in the execution, at whatever cost. In support of this position, I quote the following sentiment from one of the most active leaders in the movement here alluded to. He says:—

> “Whether the Constitution will be set right on the question of the moral supremacy of God’s law in the Government without a bloody revolution, will depend entirely upon the strength and resistance of the forces of antichrist.”

This National Reform Association, which is a wheel within the Reformed Presbyterian wheel, is well aware, from its experience of twenty-five years in the direct advocacy of its pet scheme, that there will be strong opposition to the measure. Knowing this, they deliberately plan to meet it; and expecting, through any and every means, to eventually succeed in becoming a majority in the land, they openly avow their intentions. The president of this society’s Prayer League says to opponents:—

> “You look for trouble in this land in the future, if these principles are applied. I think it will come to you if you maintain your present position. . . . If, through prejudice or the enmity of unregenerate hearts, you have determined to oppose the progress of this Nation in fulfilling its vocation as an instrument in the divine work of regenerating human society, you may rightly expect trouble. It will be sure to come to you.”

Another apostle of National Reform, as advocated by this religio-political association, says:—

> “There ought to be a mighty army ready to pour out treasure and blood, if need be, to vindicate the authority of Christ. The Bible should be adopted as a standard to decide questions of political life, to decide between right and wrong. The idea of a divine law and a divine Christ should be forced into politics.”

And still another declaration of intention indorsed by that body is thus expressed:—

> “Those who oppose this work now will discover, when the religious amendment is made to the Constitution, that if they do not see fit to fall in with the majority, they must abide the consequences, or seek some more congenial clime.”

According to the express acknowledgment, yea, the boast, of those who are endeavoring to have their faith incorporated in the fundamental law of the land, when they shall have attained their end they will use the utmost power of the Government—if need be, “a mighty array ready to pour out treasure and blood”—in order to compel all to accept their peculiar religious faith. And this is so-called Protestantism. Now we have it plainly set before us, that opening the way for religious legislation in our free country means radical persecution for all dissenters from the established faith. And this notwithstanding the fact that Protestants are the instigators of the scheme, and expect to be the executors of the law. Let no one be deluded by the seductive idea that this is a Protestant move and can bode no danger. Beware of the religious clan that seeks political power. Human nature is the same in all ages, and in all religious sects. W. N. Glenn.
