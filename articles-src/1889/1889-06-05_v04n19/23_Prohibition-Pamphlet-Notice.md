> "Does prohibition prohibit?" is a question in which all are more or less interested because of the rapid growth of temperance sentiment during the past few years, and it is candidly and fearlessly answered in a recent pamphlet by S. B. Bradford, ex-attorney-general of Kansas. Mr. Bradford has had unexampled facilities for informing himself relative to the practical workings of prohibition, and no one, whether friend or foe of prohibition, can read his statement of facts without deep interest. The friends of constitutional and statutory prohibition should not only read but should study Attorney Bradford's pamphlet, as it will fill their mouths with arguments in favor of prohibition; and the liquor dealers should read it, as it will show them what they will shortly have to meet in other States. The price of the pamphlet is 25 cents. For sale by The George W. Crane Publishing Company, Topeka, Kansas.
