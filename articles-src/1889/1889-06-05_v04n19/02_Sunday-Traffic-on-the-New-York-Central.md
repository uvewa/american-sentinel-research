Sunday traffic on the New York Central Railroad has been reduced about fifty per cent., and the *Christian Union* says that "the thanks of the religious community are especially due to Mr. Cornelius Vanderbilt, whose persistent urgency in this matter has a length borne fruit."

We fail, however, to see that Mr. Vanderbilt is entitled to the thanks of anybody, for in view of the fact that the change makes a material reduction in the monthly pay-roll, without reducing the business of the road, it seems plain that he was not influenced altogether, if at all, by either religion or philanthropy. We suppose, however, that he is now eligible to become one of the vice- presidents of the National Reform Association.
