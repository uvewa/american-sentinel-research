# Is It Ignorance?

Under the heading, “Ignorance That Is Inexcusable in This Progressive Age,” the Sacramento *Record- Union* of May 8 publishes the following. We are inclined to the belief that the letter to the *Record- Union* was the result, not of ignorance, but of something which is even more inexcusable.

“The following letter was received by the managing editor of the *Record- Union* yesterday:—

731 N Street, Sacramento, May 7, 1889.

> Dear Sir: Please instruct your carrier *not to leave the Sanday issue* of your paper at my house.

> I am opposed to Sunday papers on principle, and am sorry for this change in policy in the management of the *Record- Union.*
> A Monday paper *may* be published without Sunday work, but seven papers a week cannot. I am, yours respectfully,
Arnold T. Needham,

Pastor Sixth Street M. E. Church
