# Christianity Does Not Need It.

A correspondent of *Reason* has struck the right chord in opposition to the proposed Sunday law, as will be seen from the following, which we clip from that paper:—

> “On grounds of public policy there are grave objections to the proposed legislation, but the objections from the standpoint of those who have the best interests of religion at heart are equally weighty. The Christian Church in America occupies a position different from that in those countries where it has been in league with the State. While there may be much indifference and unbelief, there is but little active hostility. Secularism in the European sense of bitter hatred of all that savors of the church, has little power among our native-born population. It is because here the church has not been identified with ecclesiastical annoyance and intolerant legislation.

> “Our Protestant churches cannot afford to enter the arena of politics, and transform what had been mere unbelief into active enmity. Religious legislation in a country like this has no power to convince nor to coerce, it can only irritate.
> “Christianity must be true to itself before it can perform its work; and Christian charity ‘vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own.’ Christianity ‘vaunting itself’ in legislative enactments and ‘seeking its own ’ in the Constitution is true neither to its highest mission nor faithful to its best spirit. Dogmatic and sectarian Christianity is, even in the proposed amendment, refused the recognition of the Government; spiritual Christianity does not need it nor ask for it.”
It is not enough to say that Christianity does not need such legislation; it cannot stand it. Christianity will not ask for legislation in its favor, even as Christ did not, and if men secure legislation in favor of Christianity, they will succeed only in driving Christianity out of the Church as well as out of the State. [151-152]

Note.—No papers are sent by the publishers of the American Sentinel to people who have not subscribed for it. If the Sentinel comes to one who has not subscribed for it, he may know that it is sent him by some friend, and that he will not be called upon by the publishers to pay for the same.

The Southern Baptist Convention, recently in session at Memphis, Tenn,, adopted the following resolution:—

> *“Resolved,* That we fully sympathize with the American Sabbath Union in laboring to secure such national legislation as will allow to all employes of the National Government one day in seven as a day of rest, and request our brethren to promote its work so far as may be practicable.”

That is a rather misleading way of putting it; for that for which the American Sabbath Union is laboring is not to secure to Government employes the *right* to rest, but to *compel* everybody to rest whether they wish to or not. If anybody doubts this, let him read the Blair Sunday-Rest bill, which the Union indorsed. We very much fear that the Southern Baptists are proving recreant to true Baptist principles.

We are informed by a letter from our brother editor, A. T. Jones, now in the East, that the debate between Dr. Crafts and himself announced to take place in Chicago, June 12, 13, 14, has been declared off by Mr. Crafts, the challenging party, and that for no better ostensible reason than that the Chicago ministers refuse to interest themselves in the matter as fully as he feels that they should. This is quite a disappointment to us, and we doubt not that it will be also to the readers of the American Sentinel, as we proposed to give a verbatim report of the debate. Mr. Jones has written to Mr. Crafts protesting against his arbitrary action in the matter, and offering to meet him at some other time. We trust he will yet be able to make satisfactory arrangements with this champion of National Reform, and if so we promise our readers the full benefit of all that is said on both sides of the question.

Georgia ought to be a paradise for National Reformers, for the law of that State provides that a fine for working on Sunday may be as high as $1,000, and that “all moneys arising from fines imposed for offenses, the gist of which consists in their being committed on the Sabbath-day, shall be paid to the Ordinary of the county, to be by him distributed for the purpose of establishing and promoting Sabbath-schools in the county.” In addition to the fine the convicted person may be imprisoned for six months and worked in the chain-gang. No exemption is made in favor of those who observe a day other than Sunday. It should be remembered in this connection that it is urged in behalf of a National Sunday law that all that is wanted is simply to make State laws effective. But in the case of Georgia that would be a good deal more than any Christian would ask. Such a law is a disgrace to any State. And to seek to make it effective stamps any association, we care not how high its professions may be, as antichris- tian. Men who would seek to make such a law “effective” would use the rack and thumb-screws if they had the power.

An association has been organized in Japan, the object of which is to maintain Buddhism, especially in view of its political character in the empire. The members pledge themselves, in the selection of representatives in Parliament, provincial assemblies, town councils, or local offices, and in the appointment of school-teachers, officials of societies and business companies, “carefully to exclude all who are disloyal to our emperor or untrue to Buddhism by believing in the foreign religion called Christianity.” This is simply National Reform in the interest of Buddhism. But there is hope for Christianity in the fact that many of the Japanese newspapers which have no special interest in Christianity are condemning severely this attempt to drag religion into the sphere of politics. And it ought to be condemned not only in Japan but in the United States. If it is right that the majority should rule in matters of religion in one country it cannot be wrong in another, and Japan would have the same right to exclude or boycott Christianity that the United States would have to discriminate in religious matters.

The following from the *Churchman* is interesting as showing the real ground of opposition to Sunday newspapers; it is not the labor that is performed on Sunday, but it is because the Sunday paper is a too successful rival of the churches:—

> “The outcry in England against the appearance in London of a Sunday edition of the New York *Herald* appears to be a little paradoxical. Everyone knows that in the principal centers of population in England there always have been Sunday papers of more or less respectability. The *Observer* is really a high-class Sunday paper. The projectors of the *Herald* evidently consider both Paris and London as mere suburbs of New York, but the opposition to their Sunday edition suggests a question as to the violation of Sunday rest involved in the Monday edition of a paper. It is the Monday paper that requires editors, compositors, and printers to work on Sunday. Only the publishing and distribution of the Sunday paper demands Sunday labor. It seems a more rational demand that proprietors of newspapers do as Italian papers in this city do, *i. e., *omit a Monday edition, or else publish it only at noon or after noon. But of course we must not lose sight of what is, after all, the strongest argument against the Sunday paper, namely, that its piquant attractions, its utter worldliness and secularity, distract the minds of the people from the religious observance of the week’s one hallowed day.”

The National Reformers assume prerogatives and vested rights in the matter of Sunday legislation on the ground that first-day observers are largely in the majority as compared with those who adhere to the seventh day. Now we have always maintained that the issue is not between the claims of certain days to special consideration. It is a question as to whether the civil and religious liberty of all classes now guaranteed by the Constitution shall be maintained. Equal and exact justice to all men is the principle for which we contend, no matter what day they choose to keep, or whether they keep any day. Justice is not determined by majorities, but even if it were, that would nullify the assumed rights of the Reformers. Although Sunday-keepers are more numerous than the observers of the seventh day, both together—if we reckon by church membership—are but a small minority of the people of the United States. So, to be consistent with their own arguments, they should stop their clamor for religious legislation. They know very well the majority is against it. But, as we have before stated and often demonstrated, consistency is no part of National Reform.

The *Frontier* is a journal published at Spokane Falls, Washington Territory. A copy of its issue of February has been sent us which contains a marked editorial against the work of obtaining signatures to the remonstrances against religious legislation and what the editor calls liberty. He refused to sign a remonstrance against religious legislation, or allow the petition to be circulated in his rooms. His ability to judge of what is liberty can be estimated from the opening sentence, as follows:—

> “A man came to our rooms recently with a petition to the Legislature, asking that the section in the Constitution of the United States in reference to the strict observance of the Sabbath be not inserted in the new charter for the State of Washington.”

First, there is no section in the Constitution of the United States in reference to the strict observance or any observance of the Sabbath; and secondly, no such petition was ever circulated in Washington Territory. The petitions were that the Constitution of the United States should remain as it is. The *Frontier* had better get into the civilization of the district school.

> “Does prohibition prohibit?” is a question in which all are more or less interested because of the rapid growth of temperance sentiment during the past few years, and it is candidly and fearlessly answered in a recent pamphlet by S. B. Bradford, ex-attorney-general of Kansas. Mr. Bradford has had unexampled facilities for informing himself relative to the practical workings of prohibition, and no one, whether friend or foe of prohibition, can read his statement of facts without deep interest. The friends of constitutional and statutory prohibition should not only read but should study Attorney Bradford’s pamphlet, as it will fill their mouths with arguments in favor of prohibition; and the liquor dealers should read it, as it will show them what they will shortly have to meet in other States. The price of the pamphlet is 25 cents. For sale by The George W. Crane Publishing Company, Topeka, Kansas.

The “Report of the Missionary Conference” held in London in 1888 is upon our table. It is in two volumes, of some 650 pages each. These volumes are full of live, interesting matter, and should be in the hands of all who are in any way interested in the spread of gospel truth in foreign lands. Every Christian should be intelligent in regard to what is being done for the evangelization of the world, and we know of no better source of information than these books, which can be had by sending $2.00 to the publisher, Fleming H. Revell, 12 Bible House, New York, or 148 and 150 Madison Street, Chicago. [153]
