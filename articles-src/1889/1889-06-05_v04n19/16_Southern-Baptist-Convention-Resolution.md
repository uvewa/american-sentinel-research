The Southern Baptist Convention, recently in session at Memphis, Tenn., adopted the following resolution:—

> *"Resolved,* That we fully sympathize with the American Sabbath Union in laboring to secure such national legislation as will allow to all employes of the National Government one day in seven as a day of rest, and request our brethren to promote its work so far as may be practicable."

That is a rather misleading way of putting it; for that for which the American Sabbath Union is laboring is not to secure to Government employes the *right* to rest, but to *compel* everybody to rest whether they wish to or not. If anybody doubts this, let him read the Blair Sunday-Rest bill, which the Union indorsed. We very much fear that the Southern Baptists are proving recreant to true Baptist principles.
