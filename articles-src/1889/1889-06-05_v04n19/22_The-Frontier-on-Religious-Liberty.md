The *Frontier* is a journal published at Spokane Falls, Washington Territory. A copy of its issue of February has been sent us which contains a marked editorial against the work of obtaining signatures to the remonstrances against religious legislation and what the editor calls liberty. He refused to sign a remonstrance against religious legislation, or allow the petition to be circulated in his rooms. His ability to judge of what is liberty can be estimated from the opening sentence, as follows:—

> "A man came to our rooms recently with a petition to the Legislature, asking that the section in the Constitution of the United States in reference to the strict observance of the Sabbath be not inserted in the new charter for the State of Washington."

First, there is no section in the Constitution of the United States in reference to the strict observance or any observance of the Sabbath; and secondly, no such petition was ever circulated in Washington Territory. The petitions were that the Constitution of the United States should remain as it is. The *Frontier* had better get into the civilization of the district school.
