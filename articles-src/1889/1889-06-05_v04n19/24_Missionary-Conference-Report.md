The "Report of the Missionary Conference" held in London in 1888 is upon our table. It is in two volumes, of some 650 pages each. These volumes are full of live, interesting matter, and should be in the hands of all who are in any way interested in the spread of gospel truth in foreign lands. Every Christian should be intelligent in regard to what is being done for the evangelization of the world, and we know of no better source of information than these books, which can be had by sending $2.00 to the publisher, Fleming H. Revell, 12 Bible House, New York, or 148 and 150 Madison Street, Chicago.
