The National Reformers assume prerogatives and vested rights in the matter of Sunday legislation on the ground that first-day observers are largely in the majority as compared with those who adhere to the seventh day. Now we have always maintained that the issue is not between the claims of certain days to special consideration. It is a question as to whether the civil and religious liberty of all classes now guaranteed by the Constitution shall be maintained. Equal and exact justice to all men is the principle for which we contend, no matter what day they choose to keep, or whether they keep any day. Justice is not determined by majorities, but even if it were, that would nullify the assumed rights of the Reformers. Although Sunday-keepers are more numerous than the observers of the seventh day, both together—if we reckon by church membership—are but a small minority of the people of the United States. So, to be consistent with their own arguments, they should stop their clamor for religious legislation. They know very well the majority is against it. But, as we have before stated and often demonstrated, consistency is no part of National Reform.
