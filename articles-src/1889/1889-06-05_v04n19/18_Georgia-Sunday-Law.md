Georgia ought to be a paradise for National Reformers, for the law of that State provides that a fine for working on Sunday may be as high as $1,000, and that "all moneys arising from fines imposed for offenses, the gist of which consists in their being committed on the Sabbath-day, shall be paid to the Ordinary of the county, to be by him distributed for the purpose of establishing and promoting Sabbath-schools in the county." In addition to the fine the convicted person may be imprisoned for six months and worked in the chain-gang. No exemption is made in favor of those who observe a day other than Sunday. It should be remembered in this connection that it is urged in behalf of a National Sunday law that all that is wanted is simply to make State laws effective. But in the case of Georgia that would be a good deal more than any Christian would ask. Such a law is a disgrace to any State. And to seek to make it effective stamps any association, we care not how high its professions may be, as antichris- tian. Men who would seek to make such a law "effective" would use the rack and thumb-screws if they had the power.
