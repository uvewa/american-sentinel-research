The *Christian Union* of May 9 indulges in the somewhat favorite pastime of giving good advice to the Prohibitionists, especially in Massachusetts. It says:—

> "One cause of the reaction in Massachusetts has been the endeavor by some very unwise Prohibitionists to coerce temperance men into voting against their convictions, by charging them with being the allies of the liquor sellers if they vote according to their convictions. The American people are not easily bull-dozed, and of all the American people the people of Massachusetts are the least subject to bulldozing."

We do not know how true all this is; but we do know that the tactics which the *Christian Union* charges upon the Massachusetts Prohibitionists are just the tactics which are everywhere adopted to frighten timid people into the support of Sunday laws and other measures of religious legislation. Indeed, it seems to be "just the thing to do" for these zealous "reformers" to charge that all who oppose them are in league with infidels and liquor dealers.
