We are informed by a letter from our brother editor, A. T. Jones, now in the East, that the debate between Dr. Crafts and himself announced to take place in Chicago, June 12, 13, 14, has been declared off by Mr. Crafts, the challenging party, and that for no better ostensible reason than that the Chicago ministers refuse to interest themselves in the matter as fully as he feels that they should. This is quite a disappointment to us, and we doubt not that it will be also to the readers of the American Sentinel, as we proposed to give a verbatim report of the debate. Mr. Jones has written to Mr. Crafts protesting against his arbitrary action in the matter, and offering to meet him at some other time. We trust he will yet be able to make satisfactory arrangements with this champion of National Reform, and if so we promise our readers the full benefit of all that is said on both sides of the question.
