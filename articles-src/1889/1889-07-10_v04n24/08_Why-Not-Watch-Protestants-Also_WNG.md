# Why Not Watch Protestants, Also?

Rev. Makepiece Trueworthy, of Washington, D. C., is very much alarmed at the innovations of the Roman Church in this country. In a communication to the San Francisco *Occident *(Presbyterian), he says:—

> "In order to aid in exposing Romanism to the Americans, I have set to myself the task of an examination of some of the best writings lately from the press, and also to a careful examination of Rome's secret work here at the capital—a work which is startling in some respects. When the American people once open their eyes to things they will protest, to the shedding of blood, to this Romanizing of our country."

Of the new Catholic university being erected near Washington, he says:—

> "A great many calm men look with justifiable distrust upon this proposed great Catholic university at the seat of our Government. It is probably true that it is a part of a well-settled purpose to prosecute a great political propaganda from the seat of Papal authority in Rome. The late revival of Papal opposition to all things Protestant, whether religious, or the civil institutions growing out of Protestant thought, is indicative of a Papal purpose which Americans should watch closely."

The question naturally arises, in view of the persistent work of the National Reform Association and the National Sunday Union, Why not at the same time watch the purposes of these so- called Protestants? They are engaged in building an image to the same Papal power concerning whose secret work at the capital the Rev. Mr. True worthy is so much alarmed. All the historical oppressions and intolerance of the Papal Church have been under the privileges of Church and State Governments, whether in Europe or elsewhere. And the representatives of all the principal Protestant denominations in the United States, including the one to which Mr. True worthy belongs, have indorsed the efforts of the "Reformers" to create such a union in the Government.

Now if Rome is powerless, as history proves it to be, to fully carry out her designs without a Church and State Government, and the Protestant churches are laboring to bring about that condition of government under which her ultimate ends will be possible—which party is it that most needs watching? National Reformers are not only endeavoring to open the gates of religious legislation, but they avow a willingness to "join hands" with the Catholic Church in that work whenever the latter will accede to the coalition. Yes, the Reformers are not only willing to join Rome in such a scheme, but take the initiative in the movement, and favor "repeated advances" toward the Papal church for that purpose, even in the face of anticipated "rebuffs."

And the Catholic leaders understand the situation, evidence of which has been given in the American Sentinel in the past, notably in the case of the priest, who, when asked what his church was going to do in the matter of the Blair bills, replied that it was not doing anything in particular; "the Protestants are coming over to us," he said; "all we have to do is to wait." We see, then, that while Mr. Trueworthy and other vigilantes are watching the "Papal purposes" in this country, the Catholics are also watching Protestant progress Romeward, with evident satisfaction.

So those who have a care to guard the free institutions of our country from the scourge of church intolerance, will find it necessary to keep an eye on that professedly Protestant party whose avowed purpose is to make such a change in the Constitution as will open the door for church domination of political affairs. There is no more danger from the evil influences of the "beast" itself than from those of its "image." There is no reason to be any more afraid of out-and-out Roman intolerance than of the same spirit under the guise of Protestantism. W. N. Glenn.
