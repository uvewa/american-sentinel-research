The *Christian Nation,* a National Reform organ, expresses great astonishment at the moral weakness shown by Mr. Parnell in admitting that he told a lie in the House of Commons. The *Nation* says: "We have been a firm believer in, and friend of, Mr. Parnell, but we have only contempt for a man who can unblushingly play fast and loose with the truth. Unhappy Ireland, with such a leader!" If Ireland is unhappy with such a leader what must be the condition of the National Reformers? The *Nation* should remember Rev. W. F. Crafts, D. D., and that he is prominent in National Reform councils, and field secretary of the American Sabbath Union. There is one difference, however, between Mr. Parnell and Mr. Crafts, the former has been honest enough to acknowledge his prevarications, but the latter, though convicted repeatedly by the stern logic of facts, still persists in his evil ways. Unhappy Sabbath Union with such a leader!
