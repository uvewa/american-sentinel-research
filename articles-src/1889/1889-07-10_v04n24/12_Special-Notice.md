# Special Notice.

A newspaper clipping which we have just received from Arizona, states that one W. A. Cuddy, ex-chaplain of the Legislature of that Territory, is engaged in evangelistic work in Tucson, and that he is the representative of the American Sentinel. We have heard of Mr. Cuddy before, and we wish to state that he *does not represent* the American Sentinel. He has no authority whatever from us to represent this paper either as a business agent or otherwise. We wish all to make a note of this.

Elliott F. Shepard, president of the so- called Sabbath Union, is charged by the New York *Sun* with patronizing street-cars on Sunday. It seems to us that the man who is endeavoring to compel everybody to rest on Sunday should not encourage the “desecration” which he so persistently condemns in others.

Rev. W. D. Gray, secretary of the Missouri National Reform Convention recently held at Sedalia, said: “I* do not believe that Governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed, and so the object of this movement is an effort to change that feature in our fundamental law.”* The convention did not dissent from this declaration of purpose. Mr. Crafts, field secretary of the American Sabbath Union, and Mr. Gault, district secretary of the National Reform Association, were both present, and neither of them offered any protest.

The *Christian Cynosure,* speaking of the American republics, says: “On every hand they see the growing power of the people bursting the bonds of conventionality and the shackles of despotic power.” Then their eyes must be blinded to the work of National Reformers, which the *Cynosure* indorses. That work, as defined by Rev. W. D. Gray, secretary of the Missouri Convention, is an effort to change the feature in our fundamental law which recognizes that Governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed. If that movement succeeds, the “bursting of the shackles of despotic power” will be at an end.

The *Christian Nation,* a National Reform organ, expresses great astonishment at the moral weakness shown by Mr. Parnell in admitting that he told a lie in the House of Commons. The *Nation* says: “We have been a firm believer in, and friend of, Mr. Parnell, but we have only contempt for a man who can unblushingly play fast and loose with the truth. Unhappy Ireland, with such a leader!” If Ireland is unhappy with such a leader what must be the condition of the National Reformers? The *Nation* should remember Rev. W. F. Crafts, D. D., and that he is prominent in National Reform councils, and field secretary of the American Sabbath Union. There is one difference, however, between Mr. Parnell and Mr. Crafts, the former has been honest enough to acknowledge his prevarications, but the latter, though convicted repeatedly by the stern logic of facts, still persists in his evil ways. Unhappy Sabbath Union with such a leader!

When the National Reformers, after “repeated advances,” shall have succeeded in inducing the Catholics to “join hands” with them, they will find their much coveted acquisition a very unwieldy element. Much as the Catholics adore Sunday, they have their own peculiar ideas of its observance, and sometimes those ideas are not averse to quite noisy demonstration. The following complaint is entered against them by the *Christian Cynosure* of May 23:—

> “Last Sabbath the Catholic Church gave another evidence of its power over Chicago. Under the charge of the Romish order known as the Christian Brothers, an institution has been organized, called De La Salle Institute. The corner-stone was laid last Sabbath, with all the pomp, ceremony, parade, and desecration of the day possible, either for the Catholic Church, the Orangemen, or the Knight Templar Masons. An immense procession of Catholic societies, flags, banners, and regalia, with twenty-two brass bands, paraded the streets and filled the whole south side of the city with tumult, noise, and confusion from one o’clock till six. The reporters counted the crowds by the hundred thousand.”

When, under the anticipated millennium of National Reform rule, the nominally Protestant faction shall undertake to inaugurate “the ideal Sabbath of the Puritans,” there will undoubtedly be a conflict. Then the party that has been catered to all the way through will naturally expect that process to continue.

Through the kindness of a gentleman in Washington City we have received a copy of the “Notes of Hearings” before the United States Committee on Education and Labor on the Blair resolution, proposing an amendment to the Constitution respecting the establishment of religion in the public schools. This is the proposed amendment which is to guarantee the teaching of the principles of the Christian religion in the public schools—or, rather, what an assembly of ecclesiastics shall say are the principles of the Christian religion. The committee held two hearings, Febuary 15 and 22, 1889. The first seems to have been held in response to a request by the National Reform Association. T. P. Stevenson, of that association; James D. King, D. D., of New York, representing the American branch of the Evangelical Alliance; Geo. K. Morris, D. D., of Philadelphia; Rev. W. M. Glasgow, of Baltimore; J. N. McCurdy, D. D., of Philadelphia; C. R. Blackall, M. D., of Philadelphia; and Wm. S. Morris, M. D., of Philadelphia, presented arguments. At the second, there appeared a sub-committee of the Committee of One Hundred, of Boston, composed of Rev. Philip S. Moxom, Rev. Jas. B. Dunn, and Rev. J. H. Beard, urgently to plead for the adoption of the proposed amendment. There are quite a number of points that appear in the notes to which we shall call the attention of the readers of the American Sentinel from time to time. Because, as the readers of the Sentinel probably understand full well, in the very nature of the case, there was not a single valid argument presented in favor of the proposed amendment, for the very good reason that no such argument ever can be p resented. Yet the discussion is of great importance to the people to know just what is said in favor of it, and what efforts are being made to secure its passage.
