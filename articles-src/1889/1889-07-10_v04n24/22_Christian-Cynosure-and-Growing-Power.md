The *Christian Cynosure,* speaking of the American republics, says: "On every hand they see the growing power of the people bursting the bonds of conventionality and the shackles of despotic power." Then their eyes must be blinded to the work of National Reformers, which the *Cynosure* indorses. That work, as defined by Rev. W. D. Gray, secretary of the Missouri Convention, is an effort to change the feature in our fundamental law which recognizes that Governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed. If that movement succeeds, the "bursting of the shackles of despotic power" will be at an end.
