The *Pearl of Days,* the official organ of the American Sabbath Union, says:—

> "It is worthy of note that in the discussion of the Sunday question by the secular press the divine principles underlying that question are often incidentally conceded. This may be unintentional; nevertheless, the lesson taught us is most suggestive. We see from this fact that the Sunday question, considered only in its economic relations, can never be wholly divested of its moral basis."

It is also worthy of note, that, notwithstanding all of Field Secretary Crafts's twaddle about the civil Sabbath, that for which he and his co-laborers are working is the passage of a law which Mr. Crafts himself has declared "makes Sunday the ideal Sabbath of the Puritans; which day shall be occupied only by worship."
