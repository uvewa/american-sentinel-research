Rev. W. D. Gray, secretary of the Missouri National Reform Convention recently held at Sedalia, said: "I* do not believe that Governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed, and so the object of this movement is an effort to change that feature in our fundamental law."* The convention did not dissent from this declaration of purpose. Mr. Crafts, field secretary of the American Sabbath Union, and Mr. Gault, district secretary of the National Reform Association, were both present, and neither of them offered any protest.
