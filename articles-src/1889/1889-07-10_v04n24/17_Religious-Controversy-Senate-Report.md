Let the National Legislature once perform an act which involves the decision of a religious controversy, and it will have passed its legitimate bounds. The precedent will then be established, and the foundation laid, for that usurpation of the divine prerogative in this country, which has been the dissolving scourge to the fairest portions of the Old World.— *U. S. Senate Report, 1829.*
