*America* notices the fact that the bill in the New York Assembly to repeal all laws giving school money to religious or sectarian institutions in that State, was defeated by a majority of only one, and says that the "fact that the opponents of the un-American system of denominational appropriations mustered half the Assembly, should be an encouragement to continue agitations until every sectarian tub in the United States is compelled to stand on its own faith and not upon the pockets of the tax-payers at large."

This is, indeed, a consummation to be devoutly desired by all good citizens, but whether there are good grounds to hope for it or not is to be doubted. True, considerable feeling has been manifested during the past year against granting aid to Roman Catholic schools, but, on the other hand, there is quite a sentiment springing up among many so-called Protestants in favor of religious education in the public schools. And should this ever be realized, it can only be made effective by a division of the school funds, such as has long been asked for by the Catholics. So that while the action of the New York State Legislature may be good ground for hope in one direction, the growth of the sentiment referred to gives reason to fear that in this matter of giving public aid to sectarian institutions the Papists will soon have powerful allies in the several Protestant denominations which are advocating religious instruction in the public schools.
