# The Principles of the Christian Religion.

Among those who are exerting their energies to secure an amendment to the Constitution whereby instruction in the "principles of the Christian religion" shall be maintained in all the common schools, it is amusing to note the conflicting and absurd claims as to what constitutes the principles of the Christian religion. The latest of these to which the writer has listened was made in a public sermon by a Methodist minister of considerable ability and some local reputation. In order to allay the fears of his audience that the adoption of the Blair amendment would result in the establishment of a national religion, he said that the provision for instruction in the principles of the Christian religion "means simply that the children are to be taught the necessity of telling the truth, and to refrain from swearing." This explanation seemed to be intensely pleasing to those who favor the amendment, since it serves to quiet the apprehensions of the distrustful.

On this version of the amendment I submit the following points:—

1. There is not a school in the land where the pupils are not now taught the "necessity of telling the truth, and to refrain from swearing." Therefore no amendment of the Constitution is needed to secure such instruction.

2. If it is desired merely to teach the "necessity of telling the truth, and to refrain from swearing," why not say so in the amendment itself, and thus settle the question for all coming time. Or, better still, why not leave out all reference to the Christian religion, or any other religion? For the amendment provides for instruction in "virtue" and "morality," and anybody knows that these terms cover the principles of truthtelling, and refraining from swearing. The fact that the words, "and the principles of the Christian religion," have been added to the proposed amendment, shows that something is wanted which is not fully comprehended in the terms "virtue" and "morality," in the common acceptation of these terms; and for anyone to deny this is only to show either his stupidity or his lack of candor.

3. The most important, comprehensive, and fundamental truths of the Christian religion constitute the principles of that religion. Principles are necessarily comprehensive, and all really essential truths relating to any subject must be embraced in its principles. For example, the fundamental principle of God's moral law is *love. *This one word embraces every moral truth in existence. Any person who has always loved God with all his heart, might, mind, and strength, and his neighbor as himself, is a perfectly moral being. Likewise, anyone who conforms to the principles of the Christian religion is a Christian, and whoever believes in those principles is a believer in Christ and Christianity. Now if "telling the truth, and to refrain from swearing," constitute the principles of the Christian religion, it follows that whoever subscribes to these principles is a believer in Christ and Christianity, and that all who practice these principles are Christians. That many Jews, Mohammedans, and atheists practice these principles cannot be denied, while a still larger number assert their belief in them. Yet all of these people utterly repudiate Christ and every doctrine based upon his existence. By this it is demonstrated again that there is nothing distinctively Christian in these principles.

4. The "first principles" of the Christian religion are those truths best adapted to the comprehension of beginners. Paul calls such principles "milk," and the persons who have not mastered these principles he speaks of as being "babes." Heb. 5:12-14. Now, what did Paul teach first concerning the Christian religion?—"For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures; and that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the Scriptures," etc. 1 Cor. 15:3,4. Here, then, is one of "the first principles" (Heb. 5:12 -14) of the Christian religion according to the Scriptures. Are there any more of these principles? "Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God, of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment." Heb. 6:1, 2.

We have now found at least seven distinct principles of the Christian religion, and the last six are plainly declared to be "foundation" principles, and they are all "according to the Scriptures."

Now if the friends of this religious amendment, in order to quiet the fears of the people, can without a twinge of conscience warp and compress the principles of the Christian religion into something which has not the slightest trace of distinctive Christianity in it, what is to hinder them from swelling those principles into an elaborate creed, when once their amendment has been adopted? If they will multiply the signature of Cardinal Gibbons by 7,200,000, why will they not multiply the principles of the Christian religion to any desired extent? If the Blair amendment ever becomes a part of the National Constitution, there is little doubt that the same energy will be displayed in expanding these principles that is now employed in reducing them to the principles of common civility. A. Delos Westcott.
