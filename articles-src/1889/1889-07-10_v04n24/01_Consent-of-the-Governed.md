> *"I do not believe that Governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed, and so the object of this movement is an effort to change that feature in our fundamental law."* So said Rev. W. D. Gray, secretary of the Missouri National Reform Convention. And he was afterward elected secretary of the permanent State organization—the Missouri Sabbath Association.
