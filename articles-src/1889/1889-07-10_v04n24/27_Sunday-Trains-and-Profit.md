Ah! that accounts for it. In the circular letter sent to the press of the country by the general passenger agent of the New York Central and Hudson River Railroad, in regard to the cessation of Sunday trains on the Vanderbilt system, he says:—

> "This will give a large number of men an opportunity to attend church and secure a well-earned rest, and the railways interested are entitled to great credit for this movement."

This self-attributed glory will of course pass current in many circles, but the *Inter-Ocean,* unwittingly, very nearly spoils the "great credit" fancy, in the following prosaic sentence: "The railway companies are gradually coming to the conclusion that it is not only proper, but *profitable,* to observe the Sabbath and refrain from doing business on that day."
