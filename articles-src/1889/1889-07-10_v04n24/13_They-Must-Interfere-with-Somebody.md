# They Must Interfere with Somebody.

The San Francisco *Weekly Star,* of June 1, notes the fact that at a regular meeting of the Congregationalist Ministers’ Club, held on May 27, there was a discussion on the question of Sunday keeping. Says the *Star:—*

> “Opinion varies greatly, thus, Rev. J. Kimball wanted an old-fashioned Puritan Sunday and a Sunday law accordingly. Dr. W. C. Pond did not believe in a Sunday law. Rev. J. Powell also said he did not want a law to protect God’s rights, and he blamed Christians themselves for violating Sunday. Rev. J. G. Cruzan, besides showing how Christ violated the Sabbath laws of his times, argued that Sunday should be observed according to the times in which we live. Rev. H. H. Wikoff followed to the same effect, and even justified Sunday base-ball, provided the players are not Christians. But the club agreed to ask General Miles to prevent the military band from playing for parties on Sunday.”

It seems that while the ministers were not agreed as to how Sunday should be observed, or indeed as to whether it should be observed at all or not by some persons, they could not restrain their inherent disposition to interfere with somebody in regard to Sunday keeping, and as the laws of this State do not allow them to meddle with the private affairs of their fellow-citizens, they evidently intend to be satisfied for the present with seeing to it that the military band do not desecrate this day which the ministers are uncertain should be kept. We do not know just what Mr. Cruzan said, but it is certain that he did not show from the Scriptures that Christ violated the Sabbath laws of his time. The only Sabbath law then in existence, and the only divine Sabbath law ever in existence, was the fourth commandment, and Christ said explicitly, “I have kept my Father’s commandments.” If, in the face of this, any man will say that Christ violated the Sabbath law, he simply says he does not believe the words of Christ. We cannot think that Mr. Cruzan is ready to take that position.

Ah! that accounts for it. In the circular letter sent to the press of the country by the general passenger agent of the New York Central and Hudson River Railroad, in regard to the cessation of Sunday trains on the Vanderbilt system, he says:—

> “This will give a large number of men an opportunity to attend church and secure a well-earned rest, and the railways interested are entitled to great credit for this movement.”

This self-attributed glory will of course pass current in many circles, but the *Inter-Ocean,* unwittingly, very nearly spoils the “great credit” fancy, in the following prosaic sentence: “The railway companies are gradually coming to the conclusion that it is not only proper, but *profitable,* to observe the Sabbath and refrain from doing business on that day.”  [193].
