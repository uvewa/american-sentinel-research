# Special Notice.

A newspaper clipping which we have just received from Arizona, states that one W. A. Cuddy, ex-chaplain of the Legislature of that Territory, is engaged in evangelistic work in Tucson, and that he is the representative of the American Sentinel. We have heard of Mr. Cuddy before, and we wish to state that he *does not represent* the American Sentinel. He has no authority whatever from us to represent this paper either as a business agent or otherwise. We wish all to make a note of this.
