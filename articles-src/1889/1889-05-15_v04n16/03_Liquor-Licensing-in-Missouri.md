The St. Louis *Christian Advocate* says that "the Committee of State Legislature at Jefferson City reported a substitute for the bill that has been some time before the house, which is the most stringent in form and far-reaching in effect of any that has yet been presented. It refers to the licensing to sell intoxicating liquors. Under its provisions, license in St. Louis will be $2,000, and no person can keep a dram-shop who is a gambler, pugilist, or associate of lewd or disreputable persons, or who has ever been convicted of a felony, is of intemperate habits, or has been twice convicted of violating liquor laws."

From this it appears that the business of selling whisky is to be made the most respectable business in the State. If that bill passes, a man will need no other certificate of his right to mingle with the best society, than a liquor license.
