The following item is clipped from the Detroit *Free Press* of April 5:—

> "The Trades Council held its regular meeting last evening. The Blair Educational and Sunday bills were discussed in their bearing upon the labor question. Sam Goldwater said that he wanted his children to go to school and learn to love humanity, but that he objected to having them forced to study and believe any particular religious doctrine that might be selected by some one authority. Mr. Miller said that he believed in protesting not only against the Blair bills, but against most of the bills emanating from the United States Senate."

This is another blow to the oft-repeated claim of the Sunday-law agitators, that all the workingmen are clamoring for Sunday laws and religious  legislation in general; yet we have no idea that they will retract a single statement. The fact is that if it were not for the Woman's Christian Temperance Union leaders, and a few ministers, nothing would be heard of the needs of Sunday laws to protect the laboring classes. But the more that the laboring classes protest against such laws the more these people clamor, so that in the midst of the din it may be thought that the workingmen are clamoring too, instead of protesting.
