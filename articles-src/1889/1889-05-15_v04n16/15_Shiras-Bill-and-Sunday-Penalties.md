The Pittsburg *Gazette* of April 5 said: "The Shiras bill repealing the penalty clause of the act relating to the sale of commodities on Sunday was yesterday reported to the House with a negative recommendation. Under the act of 1794 any person guilty of performing worldly employment on Sunday, or engaging in sports or diversions on that day, are liable to a fine of $4.00 or in default thereof to an imprisonment of six days." The bill in question did not disturb the old act, but simply proposed the repeal of the supplement passed in 1855, which increased the penalty in Alleghany County to $25 fine, and imprisonment of not less than ten nor more than thirty days. As the *Gazette* says, "The negative recommendation of the committee may be taken as indicative of the action of the Legislature when the bill comes before it." Sunday-law makers know nothing of the scripture, "I will have mercy, and not sacrifice." Is it because they know not the one who uttered the words?
