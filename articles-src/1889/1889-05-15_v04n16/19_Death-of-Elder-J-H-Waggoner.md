The friends of the American Sentinel will be pained to learn that the founder and first editor of this journal is dead. This sad intelligence was flashed across ocean and continent, announcing, the 17th instant, in the briefest possible form, the sad fact that Elder J. H. Waggoner was no more of this world. He died in his sixty-ninth year, at Basel, Switzerland, where he was engaged in the production of some works of his own and the editing of others. He also continued to contribute to the Sentinel.

The deceased was a native of Pennsylvania, of Presbyterian parentage. When quite young he was converted and united with the Baptists, where he remained till 1851. He served his apprenticeship as printer, and was a contributor to the press at an early age. He edited and published for several years a political journal in Wisconsin. Of a broad and sympathetic mind, he could not be otherwise than a true American freeman. He believed not only in civil liberty, but religious liberty. He believed not only in liberty of conscience for himself, but he demanded liberty of conscience for others. He loved peace, but not so well as to obtain it by the sacrifice of liberty. These principles of liberty, of which he had a large share naturally, were no doubt strengthened by his connection for many years in the early part of his life, with the Baptists, many of whom had been for years champions of the rights of conscience. But these principles were fully confirmed, broadened, deepened, and purified by the Christianity of the Bible, which he embraced with all his heart. He saw that his neighbors were as much answerable to God alone for the way in which they regarded the divine Being as he was himself, and that they were entitled to the same privileges irrespective of race or religion.

Therefore, when the National Reform movement began in this country, he, seeing in its demands the principles of religious persecution and oppression, raised against it his voice and pen. As the movement progressed, he saw the need of some better means of defense, the need of some journal which would enlighten the masses as to the true aim of the National Reformers and kindred organizations, and also stand in the defense of the Constitution as it is. The result of his conceptions and efforts was the American Sentinel, which has been conducted on the lines he marked out to the present time. The success of the journal and the influence it has exerted demonstrate the wisdom of the mind which conceived it and comprehended the situation which demanded it.

Elder Waggoner was the author of various works, prominent among which are: "Christian Baptism," "The Spirit of God," "The Atonement in the Light of Nature and Revelation" (a comprehensive and masterful work, showing breadth of grasp and an analytical mind), and "From Eden to Eden," a work lately issued in French, at Basel, Switzerland. But the work which will probably have the greatest influence, which is moulding the minds of thousands to-day, is the American Sentinel, which, under God, is owing to him.

> "God buries his workmen but carries on his work." The friends of liberty who knew the deceased will mourn, but with submission and ever-growing faith they will carry forward the work begun by the warrior who has just laid down his life in the beginning of the conflict.

> "So let it be. In God's own might
> We gird us for the coming fight.
> And, strong in Him whose cause is ours,
> In conflict with unholy powers,
> We grasp the weapons He has given,—
> The Light, and Truth, and Love of Heaven."
