# The Aims of Rome.

By our form of government all the laws have their source, both theoretically and practically, in the will of the people, and are, therefore, of human origin. The Constitution of the United States was ordained and established by the people, “in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity.” Considered collectively, these objects include everything necessary to the happiness, prosperity, and elevation of a Nation; and, with the supreme and sovereign authority of the American people to preserve them for nearly a century, they have, thus far, proved to be much more conducive to these ends than any of the forms of government where kings, or popes, or potentates of any name or rank, have been regarded as the only “fountains of justice.” This belief cannot be delusion, in view of the present condition of the world and of the practical results before us. If it is, it is a delusion which the people of the United States have cherished, and will, it is hoped, continue to cherish, with all the fervor of the intensest patriotism. It would be unjust to say that among the number of those who do cherish it, there are not many Roman Catholic laymen, and now and then a priest, who have found shelter under our institutions from European misgovernment and monarchial oppression. There are, undoubtedly, many of this class who do not believe, when told, that the Papacy is now endeavoring, by the most active and persistent efforts, to substitute an ecclesiastical government for this government of the people—a grand “Holy Empire” for this free and popular republic which it has cost so much blood and treasure to establish and maintain. Restrained by the sincerity of their own intentions from suspecting others, they never stop a moment to inquire to what probable or possible point they may be led by the uninquiring obedience to their hierarchy which is demanded of them. And the hierarchy, taking advantage of their silence, and construing it into acquiescence, let no opportunity escape to build up an ecclesiastical power, comprehensive enough to absorb all those powers of the Government and the people which the Pope shall consider to be in opposition to the law of God!

These foreign-born ecclesiastics have moved forward in their work with great caution and circumspection. Whenever they have been enabled to employ the pen of a native citizen, they have done so, in order that, while secure in their own reticence for the time being, they could observe the effect produced. As early as 1849, Dr. O. A. Brownson—who had abandoned Protestantism under the pretense that it was necessary to human happiness that the whole world should be subjected to ecclesiastical government—did not hesitate to utter, in behalf of the Papacy, such doctrines as would, if established in this country, upheave the Government of the United States, and that of every State in the Union, from their foundations. In an article on “Authority and Liberty,” he pointed out the absolute and plenary authority of God over all things spiritual and temporal, and denied that any body or community of men, as men, “has any rightful authority either in spirituals or temporals.” As a consequence, he insisted that “all merely human authorities are usurpations, and their acts are without obligation, null and void from the beginning;” in other and more practical words, that the authority of the people of the United States over the Government is usurpation, and that all the constitutions and laws they have ordained and enacted by this authority “are without obligation, null and void from the beginning!” All “right to command,” whether of parent, pastor, prince, individuals, or communities, he centers in *the Pope, *as “the vicar of God” on earth, and in him alone. He insists that, through the Pope, and by virtue of his authority, “religion must found the State;” and that the only “absolute and unlimited freedom” consists in “absolute and unconditional subjection to God;” that is, to his vicar, the Pope, who alone is authorized to declare his will. Everything contrary to this—notwithstanding the Constitution of the United States and that of every State in the Union are contrary to it—he pronounces to be “nonsense, or blasphemy.”

This author is so much dissatisfied with the structure of the Government under which he was born, and by which he is allowed the liberty of speech and of the press, even to the extent of assailing its most cherished provisions, as to insist that the Papacy alone possesses the only divine authority ever conferred upon an earthly tribunal, to make laws for the government of mankind; and that in submitting to it we submit to God, *“and are freed from all human authority;”* because whatsoever it teaches and commands, in reference to all spiritual and temporal things, must be, and is, infallibly true. Therefore, “in the *temporal* order,” according to him, the authority of the Papacy “is nothing but the assertion *over the State* of the divine sovereignty,” which it represents. And hence, all the authority derived from the people which does not bring the State into this condition of obedience and subserviency to the Papacy “is despotic, because it is authority *without right,* will unregulated by reason, power disjoined from justice.” And, further pursuing the same idea in opposition to the fundamental principle of all popular and representative government, he continues thus:—

> “Withdraw *the supremacy of the church* from the *temporal* order, and you deprive the State of that sanction; by asserting that it does not hold from God, and is not amenable to his law, you give the State simply a *human basis,* and have in it only a *human *[126] *authority,* which has *no right to govern,* and which it is *intolerable tyranny to compel me to obey.”*

He then pursues another method of reasoning, which, under color of a single concession, brings him to the same conclusions, the main object, that is, the absolute and universal power of the Papacy, never being lost sight of. Agreeing that the State has some authority within the limits of the law of nature, he concedes to it the right to act “without ecclesiastical restraint or interference,” when, and only so long as, it confines itself within the scope of that law. But he puts such limitations upon even this restricted right as to render it of no avail for any of the purposes of an independent Government, by insisting that as the Papacy holds its authority directly from God, and exercises it under his revealed law, which includes the law of nature, it is, therefore, the only competent judge of infractions upon both the revealed and the natural law. Speaking of the church—and since the decree of Papal infallibility he, of course, means the Pope, who represents and absorbs all the authority of the church—he says:—

> “She is, under God, *the supreme judge of both laws, *which for her are but one law; and hence she takes cognizance, *in her tribunals,* of the breaches of the natural law as well as of the revealed, and has the right to take cognizance *by Nations* as well as of its breaches *by individuals,* by the prince as well as the subject, for *it is the supreme law for both.* The *State* is, therefore, only *an inferior court, bound to receive the law from the Supreme Court, and liable to have its decrees reversed on appeal.”*

These sentiments were not uttered from mere impulse, or in the heat of animated discussion; they were carefully formed and elaborated in the closet, and sent forth, with full deliberation and hierarchical sanction, to prepare the minds of the Roman Catholic part of our population for events which have since transpired, and which were then, doubtless, anticipated. They had, undoubtedly, the full approval of the highest authorities of the church in the United States; for so wonderfully perfect is the plan of Papal organization, that their author would not have acquired the distinguished position he has since reached in the church, if he had ventured to commit the Papacy wrongfully upon questions of so much delicacy and importance. Dr. Brownson had prepared himself for the adoption of these views by previous study of the Papal system, and was, therefore, as a native citizen, the most fit person to give them public utterance, it being very naturally supposed, no doubt, that the people of this country would silently submit to harsh criticism upon the principles of their government when made by a native, when the same criticism made by a foreigner would arouse their just indignation. An intelligent and educated mind like his could not fail to see that the principles he enunciated were diametrically opposed to the whole theory of American government, and that the logical consequence of their supremacy in the United States would be the end of popular government, by the substitution for it of one in the ecclesiastical form. He had, but a few years ago, announced that “the Roman Catholic religion assumes, as its point of departure, that it is instituted, not to be taken care of by the people, but to take care of the people; not to be governed by them, but to *govern them;*” and from this standpoint of deadly hostility to the institutions under which he was born, and which allowed him the liberty he was so unpatriotically abusing, it was but a single step to such bold and audacious avowals as the following:—

> *“The people need governing, and must be governed. . . . They must have a master. . . . *The religion which is to answer our purpose must be *above the people, and able to command them. *. . . The first lesson to the child is, *obey;* the first and last lesson to *the people, individually and collectively, is, obey;* and there is no obedience where there is no authority to enjoin it. . . . The Roman Catholic religion, then, is necessary to sustain popular liberty, because popular liberty can be sustained only by a religion free from popular control, above the people, speaking from above and able to *command them;* and such a religion is the Roman Catholic. ... In this sense, we wish *this country to come under the Pope of Rome.* As the visible head of the church, the spiritual authority which Almighty God has instituted to teach and *govern the nations,* we assert his *supremacy,* and tell our countrymen that we would have them *submit to him.* They may flare up at this as much as they please, and write as many alarming and abusive editorials as they choose, or can find time and space to do—they will not move us, or relieve themselves from the obligation Almighty God has placed them under of *obeying the authority of the Catholic Church, Pope and all.” . . .*

These matters are of sufficient import to arrest public attention; and it is time that the people of the United States understood the manner in which a foreign-born priesthood, educated for the purpose, are employing the freedom granted them by our institutions—what they mean when they write and talk about the freedom of their church —and what the end may be if they shall quietly and unresistingly submit to have replanted here the Papal imperialism which has been expelled from every enlightened Nation in Europe. When a Protestant talks of freedom, he means the self- government of the people in all their civil affairs; when the Papal hierarchy talk of it, they mean the freedom of the Papacy to govern the world, through the Pope and themselves, as his agents and auxiliaries. And when, in this country, we speak of the “liberty of conscience,” we mean that every man shall be permitted to worship God as his own personal convictions of duty shall dictate. But the Papal hierarchy have no such meaning, and intend nothing of this sort. With them “liberty of conscience” consists merely of *“the right to embrace, profess, and practice the Catholic religion,”* in a Protestant country; not the right to embrace, profess, and practice the Protestant religion in a Roman Catholic country! And why do they not concede this latter right, while demanding the former with such steady persistence? The answer with them is always at hand, when it is expedient to make it; because “i*nfidelity*” is “the last logical consequence of Protestantism;” and, therefore, Protestantism, being thus opposed to the law of God, cannot be tolerated, or compromised with, without sin, and must be exterminated!—*The Papacy and the Civil Power.*

The Pittsburg *Gazette* of April 5 said: “The Shiras bill repealing the penalty clause of the act relating to the sale of commodities on Sunday was yesterday reported to the House with a negative recommendation. Under the act of 1794 any person guilty of performing worldly employment on Sunday, or engaging in sports or diversions on that day, are liable to a fine of $4.00 or in default thereof to an imprisonment of six days.” The bill in question did not disturb the old act, but simply proposed the repeal of the supplement passed in 1855, which increased the penalty in Alleghany County to $25 fine, and imprisonment of not less than ten nor more than thirty days. As the *Gazette* says, “The negative recommendation of the committee may be taken as indicative of the action of the Legislature when the bill comes before it.” Sunday-law makers know nothing of the scripture, “I will have mercy, and not sacrifice.” Is it because they know not the one who uttered the words?

In the *Christian Statesman* of March 7, Rev. William Weir, district secretary of the National Reform Association, published an article entitled, “Politics without Christ,” in which he made an attack upon the Republican convention held last summer at Chicago. He referred to it as “a profane,” “Sabbath-desecrating,” “drunken convention,” and other such like gentle expressions in Christian, charitable estimates.

In the *Statesman* of March 7, Mr. J. G. Carson, who was “present at the convention and witnessed all the proceedings,” replied in a very just and temperate statement of facts in regard to the convention, and closed his article with these words:—

> “It only remains to say that if the spirit of uncharitable judging which characterizes the article of Mr. Weir, and which to a large extent is found in the organs (such as the *Voice),* and the leading writers and speakers of that party which Mr. Weir styles ‘the star of the morning,’ and ‘the new force in American politics,’—if these specimens of ‘its virus of political affairs and conduct of them’ are what is meant by ‘politics with Christ ’ or ‘Christ in politics,’ then it is to be feared that what he styles ‘the cure for politics without Christ,’ is worse than the disease.”

Our object here is not to express any partisan view or sympathy in regard to that convention because it was a Republican convention, but only to say that Mr. Carson’s conclusion is entirely just. That which the National Reform Association proposes as the cure for the corruption of politics as it now is, will be ten thousand times worse than the disease, as bad as it may be. Instead of curing any form of disease that now affects the body politic, it will create an untold number of new diseases from which the body politic has hitherto been entirely free, and must remain entirely free so long as our system of government shall remain as it is,—utterly separated from any connection with religion.

The Rev. Dr. Harcourt, of San Francisco, says a great many sensible things that his brother ministers of the Methodist Episcopal Church would do well to give heed to. On Sunday, April 14, he preached a sermon from the text, “Upon this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it,” in the course of which he said:—

> “There is no greater folly than that contained in the cry of many lazy Christians, ‘Oh, we can’t compete with the saloons!’ Such a statement is dishonoring to the cause of Christianity. We can compete with the saloons, and if ever men are drawn from the ways of sin it will be by and through the attractions of religious ways.”

This is in line with what we have often said, that if the churches would devote their time and energies to the preaching of the gospel, they would not feel the need of religious legislation by the State. The appeal for Sunday laws, and for the enforced teaching of the principles of the Christian religion, is a humiliating confession on the part of the church people making it, that they have wholly lost the power of the gospel.

Note.—No papers are sent by the publishers of the American Sentinel to people who have not subscribed for it. If the Sentinel comes to one who has not subscribed for it, he may know that it is sent him by some friend, and that he will not be called upon by the publishers to pay for the same.

The friends of the American Sentinel will be pained to learn that the founder and first editor of this journal is dead. This sad intelligence was flashed across ocean and continent, announcing, the 17th instant, in the briefest possible form, the sad fact that Elder J. H. Waggoner was no more of this world. He died in his sixty-ninth year, at Basel, Switzerland, where he was engaged in the production of some works of his own and the editing of others. He also continued to contribute to the Sentinel.

The deceased was a native of Pennsylvania, of Presbyterian parentage. When quite young he was converted and united with the Baptists, where he remained till 1851. He served his apprenticeship as printer, and was a contributor to the press at an early age. He edited and published for several years a political journal in Wisconsin. Of a broad and sympathetic mind, he could not be otherwise than a true American freeman. He believed not only in civil liberty, but religious liberty. He believed not only in liberty of conscience for himself, but he demanded liberty of conscience for others. He loved peace, but not so well as to obtain it by the sacrifice of liberty. These principles of liberty, of which he had a large share naturally, were no doubt strengthened by his connection for many years in the early part of his life, with the Baptists, many of whom had been for years champions of the rights of conscience. But these principles were fully confirmed, broadened, deepened, and purified by the Christianity of the Bible, which he embraced with all his heart. He saw that his neighbors were as much answerable to God alone for the way in which they regarded the divine Being as he was himself, and that they were entitled to the same privileges irrespective of race or religion.

Therefore, when the National Reform movement began in this country, he, seeing in its demands the principles of religious persecution and oppression, raised against it his voice and pen. As the movement progressed, he saw the need of some better means of defense, the need of some journal which would enlighten the masses as to the true aim of the National Reformers and kindred organizations, and also stand in the defense of the Constitution as it is. The result of his conceptions and efforts was the American Sentinel, which has been conducted on the lines he marked out to the present time. The success of the journal and the influence it has exerted demonstrate the wisdom of the mind which conceived it and comprehended the situation which demanded it.

Elder Waggoner was the author of various works, prominent among which are: “Christian Baptism,” “The Spirit of God,” “The Atonement in the Light of Nature and Revelation” (a comprehensive and masterful work, showing breadth of grasp and an analytical mind), and “From Eden to Eden,” a work lately issued in French, at Basel, Switzerland. But the work which will probably have the greatest influence, which is moulding the minds of thousands to-day, is the American Sentinel, which, under God, is owing to him.

> “God buries his workmen but carries on his work.” The friends of liberty who knew the deceased will mourn, but with submission and ever-growing faith they will carry forward the work begun by the warrior who has just laid down his life in the beginning of the conflict.

> “So let it be. In God’s own might
> We gird us for the coming fight.
> And, strong in Him whose cause is ours,
> In conflict with unholy powers,
> We grasp the weapons He has given,—
> The Light, and Truth, and Love of Heaven.”
The *California Christian Advocate* speaks of “Mr. M. A. Gault, who has been at work for the W. C. T. U. in Missouri.” Mr. Gault is actually in the employ of the National Reform Association; but since that association and the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union were married some time ago, according to the *Christian Statesman, *they are virtually one society, so that he who works for one works for the other.

A debate is to be held in Chicago, June 12, 13, 14, between W. F. Crafts, Field Secretary of the American Sabbath Union, and A. T. Jones, of the American Sentinel. The proposition is the petition that is being circulated for a National Sunday law, with, “Resolved, That this petition ought to prevail.” This discussion will doubtless attract much attention, and the readers of the Sentinel may expect at least a good synopsis of it, and we shall endeavor to procure the discussion in full to lay before them.

It is absolutely impossible for National Reformers and all other advocates of Sunday laws to take two positions that will not be contradictory. When they wish to clear themselves from a certain charge, they take a position which the more firmly fixes that charge upon them. Thus, they strenuously deny that they have any idea of uniting Church and State, and say that all that they want to have enforced is a “civil Sabbath.” But the word “civil” refers to the State, and the word “Sabbath” is religious, and is only a religious term; so that in the expression, “civil Sabbath” the union of Church and State is implied; and the very term which is used to hide their plans only advertises them. They will have to study up some new term and argument in order to make it appear that for the State to enforce strict Sunday laws is not to unite Church and State.

The New York *Tribune* asks the following very pertinent question:—

> “Isn’t the American Sabbath Union somewhat inconsistent when it demands the stoppage of all Sunday mails, but is willing that the telegraph offices should be kept open on that day? Is a telegraph operator of less value in the sight of the Sabbath Union than a railway employe or a post-office clerk?”

The so-called American Sabbath Union can never be anything else but inconsistent. It is working, professedly, for a “civil Sabbath” which is itself a contradiction of terms, the word “Sabbath” being purely a religious term. They say, also, that they are working to secure the proper observance of the “Christian Sabbath,” yet it is only the “American Sabbath” that they want enforced, implying that none but Americans are Christians. They do not intend to have the State enforce the observance of the day as holy time, but only in accordance with “the divine law of the fourth commandment.” Error cannot possibly be consistent, and so inconsistency will ever mark the course of all who work for State Sunday laws.

The Detroit *Commercial Advertiser* gives the following appreciative notice of “Civil Government and Religion:”—

> “This pamphlet, of 176 pages, is an instructive presentation of the arguments for and against Sundaykeeping by the force of legislative enactments. It explains the movement from its first inception years ago to its present form in the Blair Sunday bill, a measure that will be actively pushed in the present Congress when it assembles in regular session next December. It gives information every intelligent American citizen should possess. We heartily commend the book to every one of our readers, no matter which side they espouse.”

The *Christan Union* says that “Sunday labor is no more demoralizing than Sunday loafing.” We believe this, and we might add that it is no more wearing physically. Yet the Sunday-law people are determined to prohibit all labor on Sunday, so that thousands of people will be compelled to loaf. They propose to put thousands of people in the way of committing crime; for we believe that no one has yet proved false the old saying that Satan finds mischief for idle hands. When a man is forcibly restrained from legitimate employment, he will do something that is not legitimate. Perhaps our Sunday-law friends think that all the unemployed will go to church if they get a Sunday law. Perhaps they will, but it will only be because another law will be made compelling them to. The enactment of a Sunday law will not convert anybody. Those who go to church now will do so under a Sunday law; those who do not go to church now will not do so with a Sunday law, unless they are compelled. When the Government starts in on the paternal theory, it will find that it has its hands full keeping its children in the way that becomes Christians. Its police will have to be greatly multiplied, and given the same power that they have in Russia. [129]
