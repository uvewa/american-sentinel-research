The New York *Tribune* asks the following very pertinent question:—

> "Isn't the American Sabbath Union somewhat inconsistent when it demands the stoppage of all Sunday mails, but is willing that the telegraph offices should be kept open on that day? Is a telegraph operator of less value in the sight of the Sabbath Union than a railway employe or a post-office clerk?"

The so-called American Sabbath Union can never be anything else but inconsistent. It is working, professedly, for a "civil Sabbath" which is itself a contradiction of terms, the word "Sabbath" being purely a religious term. They say, also, that they are working to secure the proper observance of the "Christian Sabbath," yet it is only the "American Sabbath" that they want enforced, implying that none but Americans are Christians. They do not intend to have the State enforce the observance of the day as holy time, but only in accordance with "the divine law of the fourth commandment." Error cannot possibly be consistent, and so inconsistency will ever mark the course of all who work for State Sunday laws.
