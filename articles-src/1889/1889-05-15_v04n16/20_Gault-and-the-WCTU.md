The *California Christian Advocate* speaks of "Mr. M. A. Gault, who has been at work for the W. C. T. U. in Missouri." Mr. Gault is actually in the employ of the National Reform Association; but since that association and the Woman's Christian Temperance Union were married some time ago, according to the *Christian Statesman, *they are virtually one society, so that he who works for one works for the other.
