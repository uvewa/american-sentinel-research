# The Aims of Rome.

By our form of government all the laws have their source, both theoretically and practically, in the will of the people, and are, therefore, of human origin. The Constitution of the United States was ordained and established by the people, "in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity." Considered collectively, these objects include everything necessary to the happiness, prosperity, and elevation of a Nation; and, with the supreme and sovereign authority of the American people to preserve them for nearly a century, they have, thus far, proved to be much more conducive to these ends than any of the forms of government where kings, or popes, or potentates of any name or rank, have been regarded as the only "fountains of justice." This belief cannot be delusion, in view of the present condition of the world and of the practical results before us. If it is, it is a delusion which the people of the United States have cherished, and will, it is hoped, continue to cherish, with all the fervor of the intensest patriotism. It would be unjust to say that among the number of those who do cherish it, there are not many Roman Catholic laymen, and now and then a priest, who have found shelter under our institutions from European misgovernment and monarchial oppression. There are, undoubtedly, many of this class who do not believe, when told, that the Papacy is now endeavoring, by the most active and persistent efforts, to substitute an ecclesiastical government for this government of the people—a grand "Holy Empire" for this free and popular republic which it has cost so much blood and treasure to establish and maintain. Restrained by the sincerity of their own intentions from suspecting others, they never stop a moment to inquire to what probable or possible point they may be led by the uninquiring obedience to their hierarchy which is demanded of them. And the hierarchy, taking advantage of their silence, and construing it into acquiescence, let no opportunity escape to build up an ecclesiastical power, comprehensive enough to absorb all those powers of the Government and the people which the Pope shall consider to be in opposition to the law of God!

These foreign-born ecclesiastics have moved forward in their work with great caution and circumspection. Whenever they have been enabled to employ the pen of a native citizen, they have done so, in order that, while secure in their own reticence for the time being, they could observe the effect produced. As early as 1849, Dr. O. A. Brownson—who had abandoned Protestantism under the pretense that it was necessary to human happiness that the whole world should be subjected to ecclesiastical government—did not hesitate to utter, in behalf of the Papacy, such doctrines as would, if established in this country, upheave the Government of the United States, and that of every State in the Union, from their foundations. In an article on "Authority and Liberty," he pointed out the absolute and plenary authority of God over all things spiritual and temporal, and denied that any body or community of men, as men, "has any rightful authority either in spirituals or temporals." As a consequence, he insisted that "all merely human authorities are usurpations, and their acts are without obligation, null and void from the beginning;" in other and more practical words, that the authority of the people of the United States over the Government is usurpation, and that all the constitutions and laws they have ordained and enacted by this authority "are without obligation, null and void from the beginning!" All "right to command," whether of parent, pastor, prince, individuals, or communities, he centers in *the Pope, *as "the vicar of God" on earth, and in him alone. He insists that, through the Pope, and by virtue of his authority, "religion must found the State;" and that the only "absolute and unlimited freedom" consists in "absolute and unconditional subjection to God;" that is, to his vicar, the Pope, who alone is authorized to declare his will. Everything contrary to this—notwithstanding the Constitution of the United States and that of every State in the Union are contrary to it—he pronounces to be "nonsense, or blasphemy."

This author is so much dissatisfied with the structure of the Government under which he was born, and by which he is allowed the liberty of speech and of the press, even to the extent of assailing its most cherished provisions, as to insist that the Papacy alone possesses the only divine authority ever conferred upon an earthly tribunal, to make laws for the government of mankind; and that in submitting to it we submit to God, *"and are freed from all human authority;"* because whatsoever it teaches and commands, in reference to all spiritual and temporal things, must be, and is, infallibly true. Therefore, "in the *temporal* order," according to him, the authority of the Papacy "is nothing but the assertion *over the State* of the divine sovereignty," which it represents. And hence, all the authority derived from the people which does not bring the State into this condition of obedience and subserviency to the Papacy "is despotic, because it is authority *without right,* will unregulated by reason, power disjoined from justice." And, further pursuing the same idea in opposition to the fundamental principle of all popular and representative government, he continues thus:—

> "Withdraw *the supremacy of the church* from the *temporal* order, and you deprive the State of that sanction; by asserting that it does not hold from God, and is not amenable to his law, you give the State simply a *human basis,* and have in it only a *human *authority,* which has *no right to govern,* and which it is *intolerable tyranny to compel me to obey."*

He then pursues another method of reasoning, which, under color of a single concession, brings him to the same conclusions, the main object, that is, the absolute and universal power of the Papacy, never being lost sight of. Agreeing that the State has some authority within the limits of the law of nature, he concedes to it the right to act "without ecclesiastical restraint or interference," when, and only so long as, it confines itself within the scope of that law. But he puts such limitations upon even this restricted right as to render it of no avail for any of the purposes of an independent Government, by insisting that as the Papacy holds its authority directly from God, and exercises it under his revealed law, which includes the law of nature, it is, therefore, the only competent judge of infractions upon both the revealed and the natural law. Speaking of the church—and since the decree of Papal infallibility he, of course, means the Pope, who represents and absorbs all the authority of the church—he says:—

> "She is, under God, *the supreme judge of both laws, *which for her are but one law; and hence she takes cognizance, *in her tribunals,* of the breaches of the natural law as well as of the revealed, and has the right to take cognizance *by Nations* as well as of its breaches *by individuals,* by the prince as well as the subject, for *it is the supreme law for both.* The *State* is, therefore, only *an inferior court, bound to receive the law from the Supreme Court, and liable to have its decrees reversed on appeal."*

These sentiments were not uttered from mere impulse, or in the heat of animated discussion; they were carefully formed and elaborated in the closet, and sent forth, with full deliberation and hierarchical sanction, to prepare the minds of the Roman Catholic part of our population for events which have since transpired, and which were then, doubtless, anticipated. They had, undoubtedly, the full approval of the highest authorities of the church in the United States; for so wonderfully perfect is the plan of Papal organization, that their author would not have acquired the distinguished position he has since reached in the church, if he had ventured to commit the Papacy wrongfully upon questions of so much delicacy and importance. Dr. Brownson had prepared himself for the adoption of these views by previous study of the Papal system, and was, therefore, as a native citizen, the most fit person to give them public utterance, it being very naturally supposed, no doubt, that the people of this country would silently submit to harsh criticism upon the principles of their government when made by a native, when the same criticism made by a foreigner would arouse their just indignation. An intelligent and educated mind like his could not fail to see that the principles he enunciated were diametrically opposed to the whole theory of American government, and that the logical consequence of their supremacy in the United States would be the end of popular government, by the substitution for it of one in the ecclesiastical form. He had, but a few years ago, announced that "the Roman Catholic religion assumes, as its point of departure, that it is instituted, not to be taken care of by the people, but to take care of the people; not to be governed by them, but to *govern them;*" and from this standpoint of deadly hostility to the institutions under which he was born, and which allowed him the liberty he was so unpatriotically abusing, it was but a single step to such bold and audacious avowals as the following:—

> *"The people need governing, and must be governed. . . . They must have a master. . . . *The religion which is to answer our purpose must be *above the people, and able to command them. *. . . The first lesson to the child is, *obey;* the first and last lesson to *the people, individually and collectively, is, obey;* and there is no obedience where there is no authority to enjoin it. . . . The Roman Catholic religion, then, is necessary to sustain popular liberty, because popular liberty can be sustained only by a religion free from popular control, above the people, speaking from above and able to *command them;* and such a religion is the Roman Catholic. ... In this sense, we wish *this country to come under the Pope of Rome.* As the visible head of the church, the spiritual authority which Almighty God has instituted to teach and *govern the nations,* we assert his *supremacy,* and tell our countrymen that we would have them *submit to him.* They may flare up at this as much as they please, and write as many alarming and abusive editorials as they choose, or can find time and space to do—they will not move us, or relieve themselves from the obligation Almighty God has placed them under of *obeying the authority of the Catholic Church, Pope and all." . . .*

These matters are of sufficient import to arrest public attention; and it is time that the people of the United States understood the manner in which a foreign-born priesthood, educated for the purpose, are employing the freedom granted them by our institutions—what they mean when they write and talk about the freedom of their church —and what the end may be if they shall quietly and unresistingly submit to have replanted here the Papal imperialism which has been expelled from every enlightened Nation in Europe. When a Protestant talks of freedom, he means the self- government of the people in all their civil affairs; when the Papal hierarchy talk of it, they mean the freedom of the Papacy to govern the world, through the Pope and themselves, as his agents and auxiliaries. And when, in this country, we speak of the "liberty of conscience," we mean that every man shall be permitted to worship God as his own personal convictions of duty shall dictate. But the Papal hierarchy have no such meaning, and intend nothing of this sort. With them "liberty of conscience" consists merely of *"the right to embrace, profess, and practice the Catholic religion,"* in a Protestant country; not the right to embrace, profess, and practice the Protestant religion in a Roman Catholic country! And why do they not concede this latter right, while demanding the former with such steady persistence? The answer with them is always at hand, when it is expedient to make it; because "i*nfidelity*" is "the last logical consequence of Protestantism;" and, therefore, Protestantism, being thus opposed to the law of God, cannot be tolerated, or compromised with, without sin, and must be exterminated!—*The Papacy and the Civil Power.*
