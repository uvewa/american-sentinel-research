The *Christan Union* says that "Sunday labor is no more demoralizing than Sunday loafing." We believe this, and we might add that it is no more wearing physically. Yet the Sunday-law people are determined to prohibit all labor on Sunday, so that thousands of people will be compelled to loaf. They propose to put thousands of people in the way of committing crime; for we believe that no one has yet proved false the old saying that Satan finds mischief for idle hands. When a man is forcibly restrained from legitimate employment, he will do something that is not legitimate. Perhaps our Sunday-law friends think that all the unemployed will go to church if they get a Sunday law. Perhaps they will, but it will only be because another law will be made compelling them to. The enactment of a Sunday law will not convert anybody. Those who go to church now will do so under a Sunday law; those who do not go to church now will not do so with a Sunday law, unless they are compelled. When the Government starts in on the paternal theory, it will find that it has its hands full keeping its children in the way that becomes Christians. Its police will have to be greatly multiplied, and given the same power that they have in Russia.
