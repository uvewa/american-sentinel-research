# The Civil Sabbath.

Many persons make a distinction between the Sabbath as a day of worship and the Sabbath as a day of rest. As a day of worship, they say the Sabbath is religious, but as a day of rest, it is a civil institution. They declare that, while God requires its observance as a day of worship, the civil government should enforce it as a day of rest.

Now, as everyone knows, all Sabbath observance was originally based on the fourth commandment. The first part of this commandment reads: “Remember the Sabbath-day, to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work; but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God; in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates.”

Notice two facts: First, God requires rest, a cessation of labor. But it is religious observance that God requires, therefore the rest which he requires upon the Sabbath is religious observance. Secondly, cessation of labor is the only thing required by the commandment. No mention whatever is made of any religious worship in addition to, or apart from, the prescribed rest. Therefore if the required rest is not religious worship, then the fourth commandment does not require religious worship. It should be further remarked that, while rest from labor is the only thing required by the fourth commandment, the reason given in the commandment for such rest contrasts very pointedly with that assigned by the majority of writers and speakers on the subject, “Everyone ought to be compelled by law to rest upon the Sabbath; for in six days men get very tired and need a day of rest to recuperate and build up their physical energies.” This is man’s reason. Now listen to God’s: “For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day; wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath-day, and hallowed it.”

In this reason assigned by God, no mention whatever is made of any temporal advantage to be derived from keeping the Sabbath; and whoever observes it from such motives tramples upon its sacredness, and offers insult to God. It is no more the purpose of Sabbath rest to build up physical energy than it is of baptism to cleanse the exterior of the body; and to rest upon that day for a temporal object can be no more pleasing to God than it would be to labor with the same end in view.

The Sabbath is a memorial of God, represented in his creative work, and its weekly observance was designed as a constant reminder that the only true God is the one who created the heavens and the earth. Ps. 96:4, 5; Jer. 10:10-12; Ps. 19:1; 33:6-9; Eze. 20: 20. Since the Sabbath is a divinely appointed institution, by which men are to remember God through his wonderful works, it follows that when the Sabbath is forgotten or is used for any other purpose than meditation upon the great acts which distinguish the true God from all others, then will all memory of the Creator gradually fade from the mind, growing dimmer and dimmer until the last trace of connection is lost between himself and mankind. See Ex. 31: 16, 17; Ps. 78: 5-11; 111: 2-4; 19: 1; Eze. 20:20; 22:25,26; Jer. 23: 25-27; Judges 3:7.

The purpose of the Sabbath, then, is as far above physical benefits as the heavens are above the earth; and to compel its observance by civil law, as a day for temporal rest and recuperation, is to degrade it in the public mind to the level of other profane or common institutions. Such is the spiritual discernment of those who desire to place religious institutions upon a civil basis. They ought to know, if they know anything, that they can only be enforced as civil institutions and from temporal motives. In this way, religion soon loses its sacredness in the minds of the people, who come to regard it as only a cloak designed for the temporal necessities of the body. Instead of appealing to men’s faith and love for God, upon which depends their salvation, temporal advantages and civil penalties are the motives presented by these modern chief priests and Pharisees. Outwardly they appear righteous unto men, but within they are full of hypocrisy and iniquity. See Matt. 23.

What is here said of the seventh day must be pertinent in regard to Sunday, with all those who regard it as equally sacred with the original Sabbath.—*A Delos Westcott, in the La Crosse, (Wis.) Co-operator.*

The *Arkansas Gazette* of March 29 contains the following item, dated Chicago, March 28:—

> “The Rev. Geo. B. Starr, superintendent of the Central Bible School for Home and Foreign Missions, complains to the Associated Press that the Seventh- day Adventists are being horribly treated in the South. He received from Elder M. G. Huffman, of that sect, for transmission to the General Conference at Battle Creek, Michigan, the following letter written at Alparetta, Milton County, Georgia: ‘Brother D. Conkling, of Michigan, who, with his family, has lately moved into this neighborhood, has been reported to the grand jury, and a bill found against him for working on Sunday, and all he did was to cut a few sticks of wood to build a fire, just what I have seen many others doing since I came to the State. The penalty for violating any portion of the law in this [124] State is very severe. They have what is known in this State as a “chain-gang,” where those who violate the law are taken, and a ball and chain fastened to one leg, and they are made to work on the public roads and railroads, and those who are put there are many of them treated worse than brutes. Many have been whipped to death, and, doubtless, if he should be taken there for working on Sunday, he would be compelled to work on the Sabbath, or be whipped. What is your advice? Should we be beaten in the Circuit Court would you take the case to the Supreme Court? And if so, can you help us? We are all poor here.’”

The *Gazette* makes no comment, but simply heads the item: “Their Lot is a Hard One.” We are waiting very anxiously for some of the leading Sunday-law agitators, who claim that they do not want religious legislation, to denounce such persecution. We don’t very much expect to see anything of the kind, for not one of them has ever said a word against the Arkansas outrages, although they know all about them. In view of the fact that none but observers of the seventh day have as yet been molested for working on Sunday in States where rigid Sunday laws are enforced, are we not justified in saying that those who have no word of denunciation for such results, but go on the more vigorously to secure universal rigid Sunday laws, do so for the express purpose of inaugurating general persecution for conscience’ sake?
