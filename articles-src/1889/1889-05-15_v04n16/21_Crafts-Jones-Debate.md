A debate is to be held in Chicago, June 12, 13, 14, between W. F. Crafts, Field Secretary of the American Sabbath Union, and A. T. Jones, of the American Sentinel. The proposition is the petition that is being circulated for a National Sunday law, with, "Resolved, That this petition ought to prevail." This discussion will doubtless attract much attention, and the readers of the Sentinel may expect at least a good synopsis of it, and we shall endeavor to procure the discussion in full to lay before them.
