Herrick Johnson invokes the breath of the Puritan on the Sunday question. The National Reformers take up the strain; and M. A. Gault wishes that "it would rain Puritanism over this land for six months." We sincerely pity the rest of the people, though, when either Herrick Johnson or Mr. Gault shall receive the answer to his wish.
