The Detroit *Commercial Advertiser* gives the following appreciative notice of "Civil Government and Religion:"—

> "This pamphlet, of 176 pages, is an instructive presentation of the arguments for and against Sundaykeeping by the force of legislative enactments. It explains the movement from its first inception years ago to its present form in the Blair Sunday bill, a measure that will be actively pushed in the present Congress when it assembles in regular session next December. It gives information every intelligent American citizen should possess. We heartily commend the book to every one of our readers, no matter which side they espouse."
