The Rev. Dr. Harcourt, of San Francisco, says a great many sensible things that his brother ministers of the Methodist Episcopal Church would do well to give heed to. On Sunday, April 14, he preached a sermon from the text, "Upon this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it," in the course of which he said:—

> "There is no greater folly than that contained in the cry of many lazy Christians, 'Oh, we can't compete with the saloons!' Such a statement is dishonoring to the cause of Christianity. We can compete with the saloons, and if ever men are drawn from the ways of sin it will be by and through the attractions of religious ways."

This is in line with what we have often said, that if the churches would devote their time and energies to the preaching of the gospel, they would not feel the need of religious legislation by the State. The appeal for Sunday laws, and for the enforced teaching of the principles of the Christian religion, is a humiliating confession on the part of the church people making it, that they have wholly lost the power of the gospel.
