When ministers of the gospel preach against Sunday laws and religious legislation in general, they are doing strictly gospel work, as much so as when they preach against any other kind of hypocrisy and formalism. The true gospel of Jesus Christ knows of no other method of reaching men than by preaching, backed by the power of the Holy Spirit. "For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe." 1 Cor. 1:21. And it is "not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith the Lord." Zech. 4: 6. For the State to enforce religion or any part of religion, is to force men to have a form of godliness without any of the power. Vital godliness results only from the action of the Spirit of God on the heart. Hypocrisy and dead formality result from the use of force. No one can be a true preacher of the gospel unless he cries out against the latter.
