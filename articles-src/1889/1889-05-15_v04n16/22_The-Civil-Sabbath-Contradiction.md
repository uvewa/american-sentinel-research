It is absolutely impossible for National Reformers and all other advocates of Sunday laws to take two positions that will not be contradictory. When they wish to clear themselves from a certain charge, they take a position which the more firmly fixes that charge upon them. Thus, they strenuously deny that they have any idea of uniting Church and State, and say that all that they want to have enforced is a "civil Sabbath." But the word "civil" refers to the State, and the word "Sabbath" is religious, and is only a religious term; so that in the expression, "civil Sabbath" the union of Church and State is implied; and the very term which is used to hide their plans only advertises them. They will have to study up some new term and argument in order to make it appear that for the State to enforce strict Sunday laws is not to unite Church and State.
