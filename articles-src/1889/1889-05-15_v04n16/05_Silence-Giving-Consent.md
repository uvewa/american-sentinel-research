# Silence Giving Consent.

The manner of signing the petition for the Sunday law “by endorsement” still goes on. In Iowa, not long since, at a meeting, the minister said there were two ways of taking names; one way was by individual signers, and the other by taking a vote of the congregation; the shortest way was to take a vote, and he would do that. Not more than one-fifth of the people in the house voted for it, and quite a number voted against it; but the preacher secured the unanimous vote by saying that he thought those who voted against it were not members of the church. And although some of them were members of that church, and although quite a number of the membership of the church were not present, yet the whole membership, those who were not present, and those who were present and voted against it, were all counted in the unanimous vote of the church in favor of Sunday law. This was in the United Presbyterian Church at College Springs, Iowa.

In the Wesleyan Methodist Church at the same place, on Sunday, February 17, the pastor took a vote of the church on the same question. Three of the church-members voted against it, and many of them did not vote at all. Those who voted against it publicly questioned the propriety of such a method of signing the petitions; but the pastor explained that such were his orders, and, although he himself would prefer to take the names individually, he must “obey orders.” Then the question was asked if those who did not vote at all and those who were absent from the church, would be counted as signers, and the preacher answered, “Yes, silence gives consent.”

According to this rule, it is time that every person were finding out where he stands, and were making his open declaration, because, if nothing is said one way or the other, even though a man has not had an opportunity to say anything, silence giving consent, everyone who is silent may be counted in favor of the Sunday law. It seems to us, though, that at such methods as these carried on by the preachers, Satan must be laughing in his sleeves clear down to the wrist-band. And if they get out of it without greater contributions to his dignity and honor than they now dream of, they may count themselves exceedingly fortunate.
