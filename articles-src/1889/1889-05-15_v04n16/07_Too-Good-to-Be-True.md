# Too Good to Be True.

In the preface to Miss Frances E. Willard’s new book, “Glimpses of Fifty Years,” she says:—

> “The wise ones tell us that we utterly change once in every seven years, so that from the vantage-ground of life’s serene meridian, I have looked back upon the seven persons whom I know most about: the welcome child, the romping girl, the happy student, the roving teacher, the tireless traveler, the temperance organizer, and, lastly, the politician and advocate of woman’s rights!”

And then, without a break, without an intervening word, in the very next sentence she says:—

> “Since all these are sweetly dead and gone, why should not their biographies and epitaphs, perchance their eulogies, be written by their best-informed and most indulgent critic?”

What! is Miss Willard as the “politician and advocate of woman’s rights” sweetly dead and gone? It seems “too good to be true.” We feared from the circumstances of the case that Miss Willard, as the politician and organizer of woman’s rights, so far from being sweetly dead and gone, was just in the prime and vigor of her political and woman’s rights career.

But since herself has recorded, with her own hand, that she, as the politician and advocate of woman’s rights, is indeed sweetly dead and gone, we gratefully accept the statement. Yet, for all this, we cannot avoid a lingering sense of doubt and mystification about it all.

Let not anyone misconstrue anything here said in the slightest degree as the expression of a wish that Miss Willard, her actual, real self, were dead and gone, either sweetly or otherwise. All that we mean is that we are glad to have the statement under her own hand that that part of her which she describes as the “politician and advocate of woman’s rights,” is sweetly dead and gone. We sincerely hope that it may indeed be true.
