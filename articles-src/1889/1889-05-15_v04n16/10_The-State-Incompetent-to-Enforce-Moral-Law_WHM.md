# The State Incompetent to Enforce Moral Law.

The Blair Sunday bill and Religious Educational Amendment were smothered in the last Congress, but they will certainly be resuscitated in some form early in the next session. There will be but a short respite, in which the people may acquaint themselves with the religious and constitutional questions at issue.

In the discussion of the subject it is between the moral law, the divine institution, and the civil law, the human institution, that the discrimination should be made, and where the distinction exists. The intent of religious legislation is declared, in the language of its defenders, to be the establishment of law, "for the suppression of immorality." In this they confound the immorality which is sin against God with that immorality which is crime against man.

To rob and to murder is immoral and sinful, but besides being immoral, murder and robbery are crimes which the civil law takes cognizance of for the protection of society. The murderous thought which exists before, and leads to, the taking of human life, is immoral, a breaking of the moral law; the coveteousness which impels the thief is immoral, but can the statute law, man's civil law, take notice of these impulses of the heart? When does the infraction of the moral law come within the jurisdiction of the civil law?—Clearly when the sinful impulse has become an overt act, which works injury or injustice to the criminal's neighbor, and then, manifestly, the civil law only steps in for the protection of the neighbor, and by the necessity of the case cannot usurp the place of the eternal Judge and Lawgiver, and mete out and administer to the iniquitous the due and final penalty of his deeds.

The watch-word of the religious legislation party is, "Christ the Ruler of this world," but Christ said, "The man that looketh upon a woman to lust after her, hath committed adultery with her already in his heart." Adultery is punishable by imprisonment. If, then, Christ is the ruler, and there is no distinction between civil and moral law, who will build penitentiaries to hold the criminals, and from whence shall judge and jury be drawn to decide these cases. "Let him that is without sin cast the first stone." The civil law cannot consider the immorality until by the overt action it becomes a civil crime. Where then does the civil law have concurrent jurisdiction with the Almighty in legislating upon the rules of conduct contained in, "Thou shalt have no other gods before me," "Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain," or, "Remember the Sabbath-day to keep it holy," or, "Honor thy father and thy mother," or, "Thou shalt not covet"? Here is the distinction between the moral and the civil law.

The promoters of this religious legislation are in the habit of declaring that "we need moral laws." Can it be possible that the moral law of the ten commandments has become inadequate for the moral government of this enlightened Christian age? Have the American people become so inflated with self-importance as to believe that they can amend, supplement, and improve the eternal moral law of the omnipotent and omniscient Jehovah, and so, like Constantine the Great, make themselves co-legislators with Him?

Throughout all the thought and literature of the so-called National Reform party, and the promoters of the Sunday movement, there is an inextricable confusion between the religious and the legal, moral, and civil views of the subject; the religious, as to which day is the Sabbath, God's Sabbath or Constantine's Sunday; and the legal and religious question in the supposition that the religious observance of the day is a proper subject of legislation and legal enforcement. The point as to the day or any day is not necessarily within the scope of this discussion at all; and it is an interesting line of thought to the candid thinker to mark the reasons for its continual introduction. The true issue is "religious legislation" in the abstract, without reference to any particular belief, creed, or dogma. All well-informed and thoughtful persons know what the history of such legislation has been, and that human nature is so constant a factor that we cannot expect much different results from similar conditions in whatever land or age they may arise.

Let no one think this matter of light importance. Study it. The injunction of the apostle Paul to Timothy, "Study to show thyself approved unto God, rightly dividing the word of truth," is peculiarly apt in the consideration of this issue, and combines practical, political, and religious sense in a high degree. The question itself is as broad as the principles of religious liberty, and as deep as the foundation of civil government.— *W*. *H. McKee, in Omaha World.*
