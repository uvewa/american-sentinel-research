In the *Christian Statesman* of March 7, Rev. William Weir, district secretary of the National Reform Association, published an article entitled, "Politics without Christ," in which he made an attack upon the Republican convention held last summer at Chicago. He referred to it as "a profane," "Sabbath-desecrating," "drunken convention," and other such like gentle expressions in Christian, charitable estimates.

In the *Statesman* of March 7, Mr. J. G. Carson, who was "present at the convention and witnessed all the proceedings," replied in a very just and temperate statement of facts in regard to the convention, and closed his article with these words:—

> "It only remains to say that if the spirit of uncharitable judging which characterizes the article of Mr. Weir, and which to a large extent is found in the organs (such as the *Voice),* and the leading writers and speakers of that party which Mr. Weir styles 'the star of the morning,' and 'the new force in American politics,'—if these specimens of 'its virus of political affairs and conduct of them' are what is meant by 'politics with Christ ' or 'Christ in politics,' then it is to be feared that what he styles 'the cure for politics without Christ,' is worse than the disease."

Our object here is not to express any partisan view or sympathy in regard to that convention because it was a Republican convention, but only to say that Mr. Carson's conclusion is entirely just. That which the National Reform Association proposes as the cure for the corruption of politics as it now is, will be ten thousand times worse than the disease, as bad as it may be. Instead of curing any form of disease that now affects the body politic, it will create an untold number of new diseases from which the body politic has hitherto been entirely free, and must remain entirely free so long as our system of government shall remain as it is,—utterly separated from any connection with religion.
