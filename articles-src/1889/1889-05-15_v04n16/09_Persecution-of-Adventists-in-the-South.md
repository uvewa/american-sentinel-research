The *Arkansas Gazette* of March 29 contains the following item, dated Chicago, March 28:—

> "The Rev. Geo. B. Starr, superintendent of the Central Bible School for Home and Foreign Missions, complains to the Associated Press that the Seventh- day Adventists are being horribly treated in the South. He received from Elder M. G. Huffman, of that sect, for transmission to the General Conference at Battle Creek, Michigan, the following letter written at Alparetta, Milton County, Georgia: 'Brother D. Conkling, of Michigan, who, with his family, has lately moved into this neighborhood, has been reported to the grand jury, and a bill found against him for working on Sunday, and all he did was to cut a few sticks of wood to build a fire, just what I have seen many others doing since I came to the State. The penalty for violating any portion of the law in this State is very severe. They have what is known in this State as a "chain-gang," where those who violate the law are taken, and a ball and chain fastened to one leg, and they are made to work on the public roads and railroads, and those who are put there are many of them treated worse than brutes. Many have been whipped to death, and, doubtless, if he should be taken there for working on Sunday, he would be compelled to work on the Sabbath, or be whipped. What is your advice? Should we be beaten in the Circuit Court would you take the case to the Supreme Court? And if so, can you help us? We are all poor here.'"

The *Gazette* makes no comment, but simply heads the item: "Their Lot is a Hard One." We are waiting very anxiously for some of the leading Sunday-law agitators, who claim that they do not want religious legislation, to denounce such persecution. We don't very much expect to see anything of the kind, for not one of them has ever said a word against the Arkansas outrages, although they know all about them. In view of the fact that none but observers of the seventh day have as yet been molested for working on Sunday in States where rigid Sunday laws are enforced, are we not justified in saying that those who have no word of denunciation for such results, but go on the more vigorously to secure universal rigid Sunday laws, do so for the express purpose of inaugurating general persecution for conscience' sake?
