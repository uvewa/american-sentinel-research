The Prohibitionists are displeased at Senator Blair, because, notwithstanding all his aforetime protestations of temperance principles, he remained away from the State during the recent campaign in New Hampshire, and did nothing for the proposed amendment. It seems that the W. C. T. U. has power to manipulate the Senator only in the direction of Sunday laws and other religio-political measures.
