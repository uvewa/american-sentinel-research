The *Christian at Work* (New York) says:—

> "The rector of a church in this city announces that he has discontinued his usual Sunday evening services because of the invasion of the neighborhood by persons of vicious character, and he expects to be compelled to move the church away altogether. His respectable parishioners, he says, dare not bring their wives and daughters out after dark for fear of exposing them to contact with immoral women, if not to actual insult. He therefore gives up the struggle to maintain religious worship against this opposition, and will retire from the field as soon as he can find a more respectable location."

We have never heard of such a case in this State, yet we have no Sunday law, while New York has.
