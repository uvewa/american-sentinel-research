Under the heading of "The Puritan Sabbath" M. A. G. intimates that Sunday match-making is unlawful, and gives as a reason for the increase of divorces, "Perhaps too many of these contracts are made on the Sabbath." When therefore our National Reform friends have made this a "Christian" (?) nation, we may reasonably expect that Sunday match-making will become a criminal offense, punishable by fine and imprisonment.— *W., in Prohibition Journal.*
