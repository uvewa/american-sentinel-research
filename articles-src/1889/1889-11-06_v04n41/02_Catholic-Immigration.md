The most important action taken at the convention of the Central Roman Catholic Society in Cleveland, was a decision to encourage the immigration of Catholic foreigners to the United States. It is proposed to pay especial attention to farmers, who will be sent to join the Catholic parishes in the West, or they will be banded together to form new parishes. The work of colonizing the United States for the purpose of the Roman Catholic Church, goes bravely on.—*America.*
