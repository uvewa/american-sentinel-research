An Eastern paper has the following:—

> "A former railway commissioner of Iowa, Mr. L. S. Coffin, has put forth a plea in behalf of railroad employes which ought to secure attention. Mr. Coffin especially dwells upon the necessity of securing automatic brakes, and of reserving Sunday as a rest-day for employes.

> "As to Sabbath rest, the demand for it among railway and other employes is increasing, so that it would seem impossible but that the railroad companies should yield to the feeling that the Sabbath was made for railway employes as well as for other men. We hope practical results will follow Mr. Coffin's praiseworthy efforts."

Certainly every man who wants to rest upon Sunday, or upon any other day, should have the privilege of doing so; and why do they not rest? If it was a matter of wages, or of the employment of an obnoxious man, or some other matter of that kind, the railway employes would find some means of bringing the companies to terms, but as it is we suppose the State will be asked to interfere and secure rest for those who want it—and for everybody else as well. Those who are willing to relinquish their Sunday wages can rest now if they really want to do so.
