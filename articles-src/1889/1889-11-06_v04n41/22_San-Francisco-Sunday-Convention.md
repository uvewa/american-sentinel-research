A convention was held recently in San Francisco to see what could be done toward organizing a movement in the interests of Sunday observance. Dr. R. H. McDonald, of San Francisco, and C. C. Clay and William Cubery, of Oakland, were appointed a committee to endeavor to raise $25,000 as a campaign fund. Just how the money is to be applied we have not seen stated. An effort is also being made to secure the services of W. F. Crafts to assist in the work in this State.
