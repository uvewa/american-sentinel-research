The New York *Examiner* (Baptist) says: "The Catholics will not listen for a moment to the Protestant proposition to give general instruction in morality in the schools without reference to any particular religious sect. This they claim to be impossible." And again: "What the Romish Church wants is, in brief, her own way, and she will accept no compromise." Here is a plum for the National Reformers and the American Sabbath Union, both of whom are catering for the assistance of the Catholics in the special schemes of the respective associations. Rome will no doubt unite with them when her way is clear to control the objects sought. We are glad this leading Baptist organ sees the situation; but the question arises, Will it and its denomination have the sagacity to keep clear of the meshes into which the Reformers and Sabbath Unionists are endeavoring to lead the Protestants of the country? "A prudent man foreseeth the evil and hideth himself, but the simple pass on, and are punished."
