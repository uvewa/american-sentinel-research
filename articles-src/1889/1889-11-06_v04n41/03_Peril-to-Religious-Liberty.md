The *Christian Witness* remarks that—

> "There is no peril to religious and political liberty in this country so great as that which popery, by the aid of Jesuits, if not averted, is sure to bring upon us. We may sneer at the possibility of such a result, but the history of the ages supports the supposition, and should arouse the Christian people of the nation to the approaching peril."

A living image to a bad thing is as bad as the thing itself. And when degenerate Protestantism advocates measures of the same nature as those upon which "popery" rose and made itself hideous for centuries, why is it not as great a "peril to religious and political liberty in this country" as popery itself? Peril is a principle, and not merely a name. Like causes, no matter how designated, produce like effects.
