# Rome and the Republic.

Hon. William J. Armstrong, of Washington, D. C., who last winter had the honor to be invited by all the leading members of Congress to deliver one of his lectures before that body, lectured recently in the First Methodist Episcopal Church of this city, on “Rome and the Republic.” Mr. Armstrong prefaced his remarks by saying that it was not his purpose to assail the followers of the Roman Catholic faith. That would be shamefully un-American, and altogether too much like a revival of the middle ages. What he objected to, and would make the essence of his theme, was the attempt of the head of the Roman Catholic Church to inculcate the infallibility of the pope, and that all the temporal affairs of man must subserve his religious belief. When the Catholic Church suffers its followers to worship without restraint according to their own convictions, let there be no interference. But when the church attempts to teach that the pope is mightier than God, and would have this doctrine made the prevailing element of all civil law, then it is time for a liberty-loving people to object.

The Roman Church, said the speaker, has demanded for a thousand years, and does to-day, the subordination of citizenship to its temporal power. That church has always maintained that whatever is for man’s best welfare should rule; religion is of greatest importance to him, therefore religion should rule. In short, the church first, the citizen afterward. This has been the argument that has filled an ignorant, groping world with so much human suffering.

After considering the papal theory and its consequences, Mr. Armstrong contrasted it with the American doctrine of total separation of Church and State. “Washington,” remarked the speaker, “said the State should not legislate on matters concerning the conscience of man. Pope Leo XIII. says we should make all civil laws conformable to the church, and to regulate religious thought. Here we have the authority of Washington and the pope on a very important question. It is needless to ask which Americans will accept. Against the interference of the church in all civil affairs, the State, clothed in the white garment of religious freedom, has set its face forever and forever.”

He argued that the government has no business to interfere with religion. It is only one step between a religious government and the religious Inquisition.

Mr. Armstrong then quoted the *Catholic Review,* and Cardinal Manning, to show that Rome is the sworn enemy of republican institutions. “But,” he added, “the pope of Rome and the Catholic Church are not the only dangerous enemies of our government.

> “There sits in the Senate of this nation an old, straight-laced, narrow-minded, bigoted, theocratic Puritan who represents one of the New England States, but in spirit represents the medieval ages. He has no vices, but he is one of that kind who would burn a soul to save it. At a late session of Congress he introduced an amendment to the Federal Constitution to establish a system of free schools in which should be taught the common branches and the ‘principles of the Christian religion.’ The amendment also provided that Congress should have power to enforce that amendment by appropriate legislation.”

The speaker said that right in the wake of this remarkable amendment that was proposed there was formed what is known as the National Reform Association, advocating the establishment of a common and uniform religion, to be woven into, and become, in fact, the substantial part of, the organic law. This was to be brought about by a convention of all the creeds in the nation, which the speaker characterized as a motley, loveable gathering of harmony let loose.

> “This, my countrymen,” thundered Mr. Armstrong, “is Protestant Romanism, and, if anything, it is more infamous than Catholic Romanism. This is the same way that religious persecution was planted in the fourth century, and saddled on Europe for more than a thousand years. Right here to-day, under the shadow of the American flag, there is an attempt to establish a Protestant Rome. Think of it!

> “And there are thousands of misguided cranks outside the National Reform Association who are supporting the movement.”
Here the speaker referred particularly to the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union. He told of their late National Convention, how they got into a passion for passing resolutions, and among other absurd things passed a set of resolutions approving of the sentiments and course of the National Reform Association, and also a resolution that the religion of Christ should be the fundamental element of our civil law.

> “Poor, misguided creatures,” said he, “they are victims of misplaced zeal. With their resolutions they are worse than the curse they pretend to wage war against. Just one taste of a silly resolution, like the red flame in the cup, gives them a burning desire for more, and they seldom stop short of a regular debauch, that, if it don’t destroy the soul, at least destroys common sense. They are a body who doubtless mean well, but are, like all other cranks, stirred and impelled by conviction instead of intelligence. My advice to them is to stop imbibing resolutions and go home. Let the affairs of State alone, at least, and, if they must do something, let them continue their warfare against King Alcohol.”

Jonathan Edwards he characterized as a religious fanatic. Edwards said, and adhered to it, “We want a State religion and we are going to have it.”

All these circumstances, the speaker thought, were like the realities stepping out of one of the medieval pictures, life size, into the present time. He thought, however, it would be some time yet before the changes threatened would come to pass.

Altogether the lecture was a masterly arraignment of both Roman Romanism and Protestant Romanism, and of all who are aiding and abetting the schemes of the National Reform Association.

Nothing is so galling to a people not broken in from the birth, as a paternal, or, in other words, a meddling government, a government which tells them what to read, and say, and eat, and drink, and wear. Our fathers could not bear it two hundred years ago; and we are not more patient than they.—*Macaulay. *[335-336]

Note.—No papers are sent by the publishers of the American Sentinel to people who have not subscribed for it. If the Sentinel comes to one who has not subscribed for it, he may know that it is sent him by some friend, and that he will not be called upon by the publishers to pay for the same.

*The Rural Californian,* “a journal for the suburban and country homes,” published by Heintz & Lipe, Los Angeles, Cal., is a worthy magazine of more than usual value. No one who contemplates settling in Southern California can do better than to subscribe for and read this journal. It will acquaint you with the State in advance of your coming. It can be had six months for seventy-five cents; single number, fifteen cents.

Professor Blackie, the eminent Scotch scientist, visited Oakland a short time ago, and since his return to his native land has published, in the *Free Church of Scotland Monthly,* his impressions of California, and more particularly of Oakland and San Francisco. Referring to the fact of this State living without a Sunday law, the Professor says:—

> “Unfortunately, unlike the other States, California has no Sabbath law. Nor will it be easy to secure such a law. In Oakland, which is to San Francisco what Birkenhead is to Liverpool, a meeting was lately held on the subject of a Sabbath law. When the meeting divided, one hundred and five were against any such thing, and only ninety-six in favor.”

Thus the fame of “Mr. Crafts’ Surprise Party,” as one of our local papers called it, has spread abroad even to Scotland, making known the fact that California had the independence to vote their convictions even in the face of one of the apostles of National Reform, so called. We say one of the apostles of National Reform, because, in effect, the American Sabbath Union, which, on the occasion referred to, was represented by Mr. Crafts, is in effect auxiliary to, and a branch of, the National Reform Association.

The New York *Tribune* says, and says truly: “It is a singular fact that California has no Sunday law. There was such a law, but it was repealed in 1883; yet it cannot be said that there is any less observance of Sunday since the repeal of the law. On the contrary, an investigation shows that Sunday is observed more as a sacred day the present year than it was the year the law was repealed.”

The field secretary of the American Sabbath Union insists that that for which the organization is working is “a civil Sabbath,” that is, Sunday rest enforced by law, not for religious reasons, but for the physical well-being of the masses. How does that correspond with the telegram received by the president of the constitutional convention at Bismarck, Dakota, from the president of the American Sabbath Union in New York City, urging the adoption of a provision “protecting and encouraging Sabbath observance” by forbidding “work or trades” on the first day of the week, and requiring the Legislature to “pass laws regulating and encouraging the observance of the holy Sabbath by all the people.” This was urged upon the convention that the constitution of the new State might be laid “upon the sure foundation of the divine word.”

The secretary’s denial that what they demand is really religious legislation, will, we imagine, go for very little in the face of such an avowal from his superior officer. We fear that, while the secretary evidently has much of the wisdom of the serpent, he lacks the harmlessness of the dove. The president seems to be sadly deficient in both.

The *Bible Echo,* Melbourne, Australia, of October 1, has the following:—

> “A large and influential meeting of the citizens of Melbourne was convened at the Federal Coffee Palace to protest against the action of the government in so summarily refusing to sanction the publication of a Sunday paper. The meeting was addressed by Mr. W. H. L. Bailey, the prime mover in the enterprise, who stated that the government had granted him a copyright and received his money for the same. At the conclusion of the meeting, resolutions were adopted protesting against the action of the Lord’s Day Observance Society in representing that they expressed the voice of the people, and viewing with alarm the encroachment of the government upon the rights and privileges of private citizenship.

> “It certainly does not commend the inherent strength or stability of a religious institution that it must be sustained by such strict legal enforcements against the evident wishes of the community at large, nor will such an institution thus upheld ever exert a salutary influence over the morals of those who are so restrained.”
There lives in our city of Oakland a National Reformer of the most ultra type. He wants a man-made theocratic government in the United States, and his principal reason seems to be in order that the people who work on Sunday may be summarily dealt with. Because under a real theocracy it was lawful to put men to death for Sabbath breaking, he can’t see why it would not be right under a counterfeit theocracy to put men to death for refusing to religiously observe Sunday. He wanted to advocate this theory through the medium of the Sentinel. And now he feels that he has been unfairly treated because we do not give him the use of our columns *ad libitum, *in which to further his wicked scheme. In the *Christian Statesman* of the 24th ult., referring to the Sentinel, he uses this language:—

> “It is not only a fiery foe to Sabbath legislation, but it is so far from being a free journal it is cowardly. Occasionally it has permitted me to be heard in its columns; but time after time, for years, it has refused articles and communications in reply to their false positions and unfair charges against Reformers. Its editors are afraid to give a hearing to the truth.”

> “Cowardly,” forsooth! “Afraid to give a hearing to the truth!” Any journal which declines to open its columns to the advocacy of a governmental policy which, if fully carried out, would put to death its editors and publishers, must be *cowardly* indeed! This is simply another specimen of characteristic National Reform logic. How many of that kind of “communications in reply to their false positions and unfair charges” would either of the National Reform organs publish to accommodate their opponents? Echo answers, How many?
One of our last-page notes was utterly spoiled last week by the transposition of a line in making the final correction on the page proof. We therefore reproduce the note printed correctly, as follows:—

The following is the Sunday plank from the Prohibition platform of the Massachusetts Prohibition convention:—

> *“Resolved,* That we hold the religious liberty of our people among its highest possessions, and that chief among the blessings to be secured are the rest and peace of the Sabbath.”

We find it somewhat difficult to classify this utterance. It is certainly one of two things, either the result of a compromise, or it is an exceedingly awkward attempt to make it appear that religious liberty demands the passage and enforcement of Sunday laws! But, in the very nature of the case, such laws do, of necessity, infringe religious liberty. Suppose that the Catholic Church were to insist on the passage of a law forbidding labor on good Friday, would not every Protestant say that it was an infringement of religious liberty?—Certainly; but it would not be nearly so much so as is a Sunday law, for Good Friday occurs only once a year, while Sunday is a weekly festival, and it is just as much a religious institution as is Good Friday. They both belong to the church, and it is just as oppressive to enforce the observance of one as of the other.

A correspondent of the London *Daily Telegraph,* in his report of the proceedings of the recent Paris Sunday Congress, says:—

> “It will, undoubtedly, be a difficult task for any congress to bring about the general cessation of Sunday labor on the continent. Of late years, however, it must be confessed that Paris has been showing a good example to the provinces in this matter, but it is to be regretted that Sunday observance in the capital has not increased the attendances in the churches, but has rather been productive of more fun and frivolity.”

Commenting upon this, another English paper (a religious journal, by the way) says:—

> “It is in this, as in all matters of religious practice, the person who can be led by the moral argument does not need a law to compel him to follow out his convictions; and he who is not influenced by moral arguments is only cursed by coercion of conscience. A Christian cause never seeks to gain its end by such means.”

This is sound and wholesome doctrine, and it would be well for our zealous Sunday-law friends to make a note of the facts so candidly recognized by our English cousins.

Romish priests and editors are busy trying to make it appear that this is a Christian nation; also the Protestants, who are clamoring for Congress to enact a Sunday-observance law. Will someone tell us how a State, a corporation without a soul, can be Christian? We can readily understand how the people of a nation can call themselves Christian, but suppose all the people of the United States were believers in Christ, would that make the State, which has neither entity, soul, or conscience, Christian? The State is the community formed for the protection of its citizens in their civil rights, to prevent crime, and afford all equal rights.— *Western American.* [337]
