Ayer's Newspaper Annual for 1889 is the finest and most complete directory of the kind which we have ever seen, and we do not believe that its equal has ever before been published. No newspaper office and no advertiser should be without it. It is not only a complete directory of every periodical of every kind published in the United States and Canada, but it gives the circulation of each, and the population of the town or city in which published. It contains 1,126 pages and sells for $5.00, carriage paid. For sale by the publishers, N. W. Ayer & Sons, Philadelphia, Pa.
