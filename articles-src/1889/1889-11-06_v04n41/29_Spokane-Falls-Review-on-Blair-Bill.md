The Spokane Falls *Review* says:—

> "Those well-meaning people who are going about the country circulating petitions to Congress not to pass the Blair Sunday bill are throwing away their time, and might as well tear up their documents and engage in other work. There is not the slightest probability of the passage of that bill, and nobody knows it better than Mr. Blair himself. He would not be Mr. Blair, however, unless he had a hobby. Congress tolerates his persistent efforts to legislate the people into heaven on the principle that it seems to please him and does not interfere with anybody else."

Does the *Review* understand fully the situation? Does it know that there was presented to the last Congress petitions purporting to represent over 14,000,000 people of the United States praying for a National Sunday law? In the fancied security in which hundreds of thousands rest lies the danger to liberty which the *Review* thinks is wholly imaginary. "Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty."
