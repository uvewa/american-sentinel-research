The Tucson *Star* says that Columbia "offers to pay the traveling expenses of everybody from here who will settle there, give him $6.00 a month, 250 acres of land, a cow, two pigs, a plow, and help him build a house." Yet there was a bigger rush to Oklahoma in one day than in 365 days to Columbia. If Columbia would adopt our national Constitution just as it is, before the National Reformers get hold of it, offering the free exercise of religion, it would not take long to fill up her valleys. The human mind values liberty of conscience far above pigs and cows!—*Moral and Scientific Companion. *
