Certain advocates of Sunday legislation are accustomed to "bear false witness," by asserting that Seventh-day Baptists and Seventh-day Adventists join with saloonists in opposing Sunday laws. Those who know the facts, know that they are uncompromising foes of the saloon, advocating its total destruction. We oppose Sunday legislation on religious grounds; we oppose the saloon on all days, and condemn the folly of legalizing its existence on six days of the week, and then attempting to close it on its most profitable day upon the false plea that that day is sacred. It is wicked to lie about small things even. Brethren, tell the truth about us for the sake of your own reputation, if for nothing else. *—The Outlook.*
