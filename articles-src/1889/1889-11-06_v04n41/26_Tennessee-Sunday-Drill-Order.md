The adjutant-general of Tennessee has issued an order forbidding competitive or exhibition drills on Sunday; commanding officers not to order out or to permit their commands to assemble for any duty or military maneuvering on Sunday, other than that permitted and required by the regulations while the forces are in camp under orders. The order is said to be issued by the direction of the governor.

The American Sabbath Union will doubtless point with great glee to this; but, unfortunately, it does not coincide with their declaration that the soldiers are demanding release from Sunday parades, for the soldiers are displeased with the order, Lieutenant Patterson saying that it is a severe blow to the military of Tennessee.
