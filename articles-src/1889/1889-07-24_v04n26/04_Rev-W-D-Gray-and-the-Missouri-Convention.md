Keep it before the people, that Rev. W. D. Gray, secretary of the Missouri National Reform Convention, recently held at Sedalia, said: "*I do not believe that Governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed, and so the object of this movement is an effort to change that feature in our fundamental law."* The convention did not dissent from this declaration of purpose, but elected Mr. Gray secretary of the permanent State organization.
