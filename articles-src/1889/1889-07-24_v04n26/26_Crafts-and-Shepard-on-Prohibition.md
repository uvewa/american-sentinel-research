Rev. Wilbur F. Crafts, field secretary of the American Sabbath Union, says that "the assaults of intemperance upon liberty and the home, call for national constitutional prohibition." *{Herald of Reform, Cleveland, Ohio, June 15.) *And Elliott F. Shepard, president of that union, says that "constitutions are not made for such purposes and they cannot be used in that way without bringing our system of government under written constitutions into inefficiency and trouble." (*New York Mail and Express, June 21.*) These eminent reformists (?) are, however, agreed that Congress should recognize Sunday as the Christian Sabbath, and enforce its observance by adequate penalties. The demand for religious legislation is, it seems, common ground upon which prohibitionists and anti-prohibitionists can meet and unite.
