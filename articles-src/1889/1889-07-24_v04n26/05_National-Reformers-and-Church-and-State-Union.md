The National Reformers wish in a general way to deny any idea of establishing a Church and State Government. This they do because of the well-known prejudice in this country against such a policy. But neither their writers nor their public speakers are able to disguise the real character of the movement. One of the latest admissions is found in the address of Rev. T. H. Tatlow, before the Missouri Sabbath Convention:

> "The party of carnal policy protests, and cries out that this is uniting Church and State. The Christian replies: It is indeed a union, but limited, and applies only so far as two separate jurisdictions—the one spiritual and *primary* and the other secular and *secondary*—exercises each one its own appropriate authority, within its own individual province, to secure a twofold good to the two-fold life of man."

This sentiment admits all that we have ever charged against the National Reform advocates, as aiming to establish Church and State union. It admits a union, with the spiritual jurisdiction as *primary,* and the secular jurisdiction as *secondary,* each one exercising its own appropriate *authority.* With such a union once established, who can fail to see that the "appropriate authority" of the "primary" jurisdiction of the Government would be the *supreme* authority? It is about time for that party to stop denying that their aim is a union of Church and State.
