# Romanism and the Republic.

The following is from the pen of M. Leon Borland, in the *Forum.* The statements that it contains, coming from the source they do, are worthy of more than ordinary attention:—

> “Let us be Catholics,” said Bossuet, “but let us be Gallicans.” It is in the spirit of this great. French preacher that I, a Frenchman by birth and education, would presume to offer a brief criticism upon the Roman Church and its relations to the American republic. Let us be Catholics, but let us be Americans. Is it possible to be, at the same time, loyal Roman Catholics and loyal American citizens? I believe that it is not, and shall endeavor to give the reasons underlying this belief. “If the liberties of the American people are ever destroyed, it will be by the hands of the Roman clergy.” When Lafayette spoke these words there seemed to be nothing whatever in the actual state of things to give them warrant. The Roman hierarchy was very weak and very poor in these United States, and the churches were, for the most part, small missionary stations, widely scattered over an almost boundless territory. Power and influence it had none; but it had a system which Lafayette knew well, and he saw in that system a potency which made him fear for the liberties of the Nation which he had done so much to establish with his treasure and his sword.

He had seen it in his well-beloved France, as a mighty serpent, coiling itself around the national life, and choking out the liberties of the people.. This monster serpent, Ultramontanism, had crawled up out of the deep, dark, Roman sea many years before, and, as in the case of the loyal Trojan priest, Laocoon, had wound itself around the Gallican priest at the altar, and was slowly, but surely, strangling the priest and his faithful children, the sons of France. No native- born American could have seen danger when Lafayette saw it. No one but a Roman Catholic, born and brought up in a Roman Catholic country, could possibly have seen any danger to the American republic in the few missionary priests whom the Roman Church had sent over to the New World in such a modest guise.

A good-natured contempt for such danger seems almost universal among the citizens of this great republic. I do not like the role of an alarmist, but I believe I see danger ahead, and am willing to expose myself to some ridicule in the hope of arousing my fellow-citizens to a sense of danger, which, as I believe, threatens the American Nation from the Roman Church.

Look about you and see what the few poor missionary stations, in which Lafayette saw cause for alarm, have become. Behold the innumerable churches, cathedrals, monasteries, nunneries, seminaries, colleges, and universities which cover the American continent from east to west, and from north to south. See the army of priests, bishops, archbishops, and cardinals, all thoroughly trained under the most perfect discipline, and swearing implicit obedience—to the Constitution of the American republic?—No; swearing obedience, [204] in all things temporal and spiritual, to an Italian pontiff, who lives in Rome and issues his orders from a palace called Vatican. Leo XIII. sits in the Vatican at Rome and commands his army of priests and prelates in America and Ireland with as much absolute authority as any Cesar ever commanded his loyal legions in their subjugation of the nations of the earth. Lafayette saw but a few straggling outposts; we see the mighty army in solid column, with banners flying, marching with firm step and steady eye, conquering and to conquer. But someone may say that they are the conservators and guardians of law and order, rather than a danger to the peace and safety of the liberties of the people. But is not this a comparative rather than a positive blessing? Is it not fair to ask why it is that the great majority of the dangerous classes are subject to the control of the Roman Church? Is it not because they are her own children, the products of her system, if not of her teaching? Examine the police record of this or any other great American city, and I think you will find that at least seventy-five per cent of the criminals are of Roman Catholic parentage. Is it, then, unreasonable to expect from the Roman Church some restraining influence over her own followers? If, then, the non-Roman churches exercise little control over the dangerous classes, is it not because, for the most part, these classes have been born and brought up beyond the influence of their teaching?

I have no reason to doubt that the great majority of Roman Catholic priests in America mean to be, and believe themselves to be, good citizens of this republic. But they belong to a system in which free agency is impossible. They are members of an army in which the strictest discipline is enforced, and the most prompt and perfect obedience is required. The commander-in-chief of this Roman army is naturally and most fittingly a Roman, not an American. What does the Pope of Rome care for the blessings of American liberty or American citizenship? The ambition of the Pope, whoever he may be, is, always has been, and ever must be, universal conquest. In taking command of the Roman Church he takes this oath. The Vatican claims absolute and supreme authority in all things temporal as well as spiritual; and every priest, bishop, archbishop, and cardinal throughout the world takes an oath of perfect submission and obedience to the Pope as the supreme lord and master of all things. This being true—and let any priest or bishop affirm that it is not—is it not quite certain that the priest, whatever his private or personal opinions and feelings may be as an American citizen, must support the church—the Ultramontane system—as against the State, at all times and under all circumstances? Witness the case of the distinguished priest, the late pastor of St. Stephen’s Roman Catholic Church, New York. He was not permitted even the small privilege, as an American citizen, of being present at a political meeting of which his superiors did not approve. Do we not see, then, that the personal intentions and feelings of the Roman priest, however good, count for nothing when we are considering the attitude of the Roman Church toward the State?

The American Constitution says that all men shall be free to worship God according to the dictates of their own consciences. The Vatican says that liberty of conscience is “a pest of all others to be most dreaded in a State.” It is hardly necessary, I imagine, for me to enlarge upon this point, as all who know anything about the Roman Church know perfectly well that “heresy,” according to that church, is the greatest of all crimes, greater than murder or adultery. Free speech and a free press are also among the fundamental principles of the American republic, but nothing is more offensive to Rome. Where she has the power of control she has never tolerated, and she never will tolerate, either free speech or a free press.

The late cardinal archbishop of New York said:—

> “Catholics in this republic are as strongly devoted to the sustenance and maintenance of the temporal power of the Holy Father as Catholics in any other part of the world; and if it should be necessary to prove it by acts, they are ready to do so.”

This, to a Frenchman, is pretty plain English. And these bishops speak as men having authority. Is one, then, to be laughed at as an alarmist for sounding out a note of warning, when bishops and cardinals representing a vast army of millions of communicants, speak out against the Constitution of the republic in such threatening words?

The Roman Catholic vote has already become so important an element in politics as to decide the fate of parties. Every Roman Catholic is in duty bound to enter politics as a Roman Catholic, not as an American citizen. The press of this country understands perfectly well that if it would have the support of the Roman Catholics it must say nothing in criticism, but everything in praise, of the Roman Church, so that even now there is a practical restraint, if not a positive check, upon the freedom of the press.

The Roman Church claims, in fact, to be a theocracy, and, true to this idea, she enforces, when she can, obedience to her authority in all things, social, political, and economic, as well as in things religious, so-called. Has she not, within the past few weeks, asserted this political power in Ireland in the most positive and high-handed manner? Can there be any question as to the meaning of the Vatican Rescript, coming as it does in the midst of a fierce struggle of an oppressed people for political liberty?
