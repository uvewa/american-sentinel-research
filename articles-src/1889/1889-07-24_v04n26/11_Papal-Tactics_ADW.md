# Papal Tactics.

Doctor Crafts, field secretary of the American Sabbath Union, seems to understand the tactics of those who in past ages have been engaged in work identical with his own. He stigmatizes as "insignificant," "hair-brained," "woolly headed," "fanatics," "Saturdarians," etc., those who protest against being placed on a roll of heretics, to be punished by the civil power, simply because they will not allow him to dictate to them their religion. It was the same in the sixteenth century, during the reign of Philip II. This king "declared that he would lose a hundred thousand lives rather than see any of his dominions severed from the ancient church." "Death to heretics" was his order; and when "many nobles and citizens leagued themselves to demand a retraction of the hated edicts," the imperial council branded the petitioners as a "pack of beggars." Although the council had enough of school-boy puerility, and not too much self-respect, to call names, yet they appeared satisfied with a very limited assortment compared with the elaborate list employed by Doctor Crafts. They applied to the humble petitioners for civil and religious liberty only one epithet of opprobrium, while Mr. Crafts exhausts human language to such a degree that he is obliged to go into the manufacturing business to supply his demand. But perhaps he can grind out "strategems," "duplicate" the names of petitioners, and manufacture new words all at the same time, and with the same machinery. Who knows? A. Delos Westcott.
