> "My name is Legion, for we are many." Truly this may be said of Mr. Crafts' Sabbath. He wants a "civil Sabbath," an "American Sabbath," a "Christian Sabbath," and "the ideal Sabbath of the Puritans," whichever he thinks will best suit the ever-varying circumstances of his campaign. We have not been able to quite understand the variation in definition, inasmuch as he wants them all on Sunday, until explained by placing the Missouri and Minnesota conventions side by side. In Missouri, Mr. Crafts said he was advocating an American, rather than a Christian, Sabbath; and when they organized their State branch of the American Sabbath Union, they adopted the following as the first article of its constitution:—

> "The object of this Association shall be to preserve the Christian Sabbath, or Lord's day, as a day of rest and worship."

But in Minnesota he advocated a Christian Sabbath, and declared that the convention was a "State Convention of those who represent the Christian Sabbath." So the first section of the constitution of the permanent State organization was made to read as follows:—

> "The object of this Association shall be to preserve the Christian Sabbath, or Lord's day, as a day of rest and worship."

We are glad this matter has beep made plain, so the people may understand just what the Reformers mean when they present the various features of their chameleon Sabbath. There is nothing like having all these obscure points well defined. It is fair to presume, however, that Mr. Crafts' doctrine of the "ideal Sabbath of the Puritans" expresses the design of the above-quoted sections when fully carried out.
