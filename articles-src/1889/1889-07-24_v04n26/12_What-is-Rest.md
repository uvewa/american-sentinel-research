# What is Rest?

What is known as the “Sunday-rest” movement is again coming to the front, and the public may confidently expect a well-organized lobby to precipitate itself upon Congress early in the next session, and through its spokesman in the Senate, urge the passage of a rigid national law embracing its views of the proper observance of Sunday. . . . .

These “Sunday-rest” advocates try very hard to avoid the charge that their movement is an attempt to secure State interference with religion, and their arguments are ingenious and plausible; but they are not likely to mislead men who are fit to represent the people. . . . The claim is made that legislative interference for the observance of Sunday would be good for the bodies and minds of the public, and that this divests it of its religious character; but so long as Sunday, the day upon which the majority of people worship God, is singled out for legislative experiment, the conviction will remain that it is an effort to connect Church and State—something that the Constitution expressly repudiates, and the past horrors of which should be a sufficient warning to intelligent people.

To restore the “Puritan Sunday” throughout the United States might have the effect of increasing church membership, but it is very doubtful if there would be a corresponding increase of sincere religion. Those who would be driven into the fold under the operation of an oppressive law would be like the conscripts forced to fight against their principles—a leaven of dissatisfaction to corrupt the entire army.

But may not the people, after all, have as just and sensible ideas of the way to worship God and regulate their own conduct on Sunday as these self-constituted guardians? There are many, possibly a large majority of the inhabitants of the United States, who sincerely believe that God is better pleased with the innocent enjoyment of his creatures, even on Sunday, than with their enforced torture, under the guise of rest and respect for the day. What is rest? Can one who is compelled to work during the week be said to rest on Sunday if he has to go unwillingly to church? . . . Do the nerves take on a healthy tone, the muscles regain their elasticity, or the mental faculties expand, because the spade or pick-axe is cast aside, or the weary toil of the counter is temporarily abandoned? There will be relaxation, of course; so there is in the unstrung bow, but unless the archer bends the latter in the opposite direction, its strength and springiness soon pass away.

Rest means change, as well as relaxation. Those who advocate Government interference with Sunday can rest whenever they please. They are not confined to one day in the week, but can vary their pursuits and pleasures to suit their whims or necessities, and they are unable to appreciate the longing of the hard-worked toiler for one day in seven when he can do as he pleases without the intervention of bosses and superintendents, or the equally irksome provisions of a tyrannical law, provided he does not interfere with the rights and privileges of his neighbor. To suppose that God grudges him his rest or his innocent enjoyment is to deny the attributes of the Most High. The man who goes to church on Sunday morning is none the worse for rational enjoyment in the afternoon and evening, and whether he is or not, the Government has nothing whatever to do with it.— *Sedalia, Mo., Bazoo, June 23, 1889. *[207-208]

Note.—No papers are sent by the publishers of the American Sentinel to people who have not subscribed for it. If the Sentinel comes to one who has not subscribed for it, he may know that it is sent him by some friend, and that he will not be called upon by the publishers to pay for the same.

We publish in this number of the American Sentinel an article entitled, “A Lutheran Minister on National Reform,” for which we ask a careful reading. The article consists of extracts from an essay read before the Lutheran Conference at Loudonville, Ohio, January 15. It is well worthy of a careful perusal. We will send the entire essay in pamphlet form to any address, post-paid for 3 cents.

The *American Catholic News,* published in New York, accuses Col. Elliott F. Shepard of hypocrisy in the matter of Sunday-keeping as follows:—

> “He [Col. Shepard] owns the Fifth Avenue stages and has refused to run them on Sunday on the ground of his unwillingness to ‘desecrate the Sabbath? It is now known that the editor of that sycophantic sheet [the *Mail and Express*] also owns the stages that run in Central Park, and not only does he run these on Sunday, but also the Fifth Avenue stages, too. The truth is that there is no money in running the Fifth Avenue stages on Sunday; so they are employed in Central Park, where the demand on ‘the day of rest ’ is greater than the stages run there on week days can accommodate.”

The following item from the South Bend (Ind.) *Tribune* of June 1, is a suggestive commentary on Sunday laws, and on the claim of W. F. Crafts and his co-workers that the laboring men are clamoring for permission to rest on Sunday

> “The agreement among the barbers of Indianapolis to test the Sunday law was begun last Sunday by the keeping open of the Bates House tonsorial rooms, and barber Knox was promptly arrested. Tobacco stands in this State are allowed to keep open under a Supreme Court decision that tobacco is a necessity, and the barbers believe that, if their case is properly presented, a favorable decision will be rendered. The saloons were all closed Sunday, but the drug stores were open and whisky can be bought by the quart at most of them.”

And what a victory for temperance it must be to have saloons closed and drug stores selling liquor by the quart! Great is Sunday; and past finding out are Sunday laws!

Mr. Crafts, the field secretary of the so-called American Sabbath Union, is still swinging around the circle in the interests of National Reform, and as he goes is strewing his inuendoes and misrepresentations everywhere. In his recent visit to Denver, in the interests of his so-called reform, he attempted to carry things with a high hand. We are informed that he was very much incensed because the American Sentinel was distributed very extensively in that city while he was there. A number of copies of the Sentinel were given out from the office of the leading paper in Denver, and Mr. Crafts learning of this fact went to the office and secured an interview with the proprietor, demanding that no more papers should be circulated from that office. The proprietor of the paper very properly refused to be dictated to in such a matter, and the circulation of the Sentinel continued. We do not wonder that Mr. Crafts writhed under it, for the number of the Sentinel which was circulated on that occasion contained arguments which Mr. Crafts did not care to encounter, and which he is entirely unable to answer.

Rev. A. Fasanotti, D. D., a Catholic priest of San Francisco, recently delivered a sermon on the subject of Sunday picnics. He stated, among other things, that his church did not object to picnics being held on Sunday, provided the parties “attend divine service before departing on the trip.” Just so; and this same principle is largely responsible for the efforts being made at present by the National Reformers. It is not, after all, the sanctity of the Sunday Sabbath which they so much desire to bring about, as it is a desire to fill the pews of their churches. They greatly lament the fact that Sunday is being so universally “desecrated,” but the principal reason for their grief is not because the sacredness, as they term it, of Sunday, is being violated, but it is because this so-called desecration draws the multitudes away from the church, and for this reason they say that it must be stopped.

Rev. Wilbur F. Crafts, field secretary of the American Sabbath Union, says that “the assaults of intemperance upon liberty and the home, call for national constitutional prohibition.” *{Herald of Reform, Cleveland, Ohio, June 15.) *And Elliott F. Shepard, president of that union, says that “constitutions are not made for such purposes and they cannot be used in that way without bringing our system of government under written constitutions into inefficiency and trouble.” (*New York Mail and Express, June 21.*) These eminent reformists (?) are, however, agreed that Congress should recognize Sunday as the Christian Sabbath, and enforce its observance by adequate penalties. The demand for religious legislation is, it seems, common ground upon which prohibitionists and anti-prohibitionists can meet and unite.

> “My name is Legion, for we are many.” Truly this may be said of Mr. Crafts’ Sabbath. He wants a “civil Sabbath,” an “American Sabbath,” a “Christian Sabbath,” and “the ideal Sabbath of the Puritans,” whichever he thinks will best suit the ever-varying circumstances of his campaign. We have not been able to quite understand the variation in definition, inasmuch as he wants them all on Sunday, until explained by placing the Missouri and Minnesota conventions side by side. In Missouri, Mr. Crafts said he was advocating an American, rather than a Christian, Sabbath; and when they organized their State branch of the American Sabbath Union, they adopted the following as the first article of its constitution:—

> “The object of this Association shall be to preserve the Christian Sabbath, or Lord’s day, as a day of rest and worship.”
But in Minnesota he advocated a Christian Sabbath, and declared that the convention was a “State Convention of those who represent the Christian Sabbath.” So the first section of the constitution of the permanent State organization was made to read as follows:—

> “The object of this Association shall be to preserve the Christian Sabbath, or Lord’s day, as a day of rest and worship.”

We are glad this matter has beep made plain, so the people may understand just what the Reformers mean when they present the various features of their chameleon Sabbath. There is nothing like having all these obscure points well defined. It is fair to presume, however, that Mr. Crafts’ doctrine of the “ideal Sabbath of the Puritans” expresses the design of the above-quoted sections when fully carried out.

*Fair Play,* a paper published in Valley Falls, Kansas, refers to the Blair Sunday-Rest bill and the Blair Educational Amendment bill, as “Christian bills,” but why, we are unable to say. Certain it is that we have repeatedly shown that these measures are the very opposite of Christian. Christianity teaches that men should render unto Cesar the things that are Cesar’s and unto God the things that are God’s. The Blair Sunday- Rest bill, should it become a law, would require men to render unto Cesar that which is God’s. Again, Christianity teaches individual responsibility to God, and that man owes the highest duty to God. The Blair Educational Amendment, which provides that the principles of the Christian religion shall be taught in the public schools, would destroy that responsibility and place the Government in the place of God; because if the principles of the Christian religion should be taught in the public schools, the Government must define what are the principles of the Christian religion. And, if we recognize the State as having the right to decide this question for us, we virtually agree to stand by that decision. That is, we agree to accept as Christianity whatever the State may declare to be such. And to agree to such a thing is simply to deny the authority of God and of his word, and to apostatize from the true Christian faith. Every good citizen will obey every law of the State which does not interfere in any way with his duties to God; but no Christian can yield obedience to the State in matters which pertain alone to his duty to God. The apostles taught that we should be subject to the powers that be, but when arraigned before the magistrates and commanded not to teach any more in the name of Jesus, they said, “whether it be right to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye, but we cannot but speak the things which we have heard.” The Blair bills are not Christian but anti-Christian, for the reason that they are subversive of the very principles of Christianity.

Let the National Legislature once perform an act which involves the decision of a religious controversy, and it will have passed its legitimate bounds. The precedent will then be established and the foundation laid for that usurpation of the divine prerogative in this country which has been the dissolving scourge of the fairest portions of the Old World.— *U. S. Senate Report, 1829*. [209]
