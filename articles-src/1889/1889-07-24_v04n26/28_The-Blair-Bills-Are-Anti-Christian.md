*Fair Play,* a paper published in Valley Falls, Kansas, refers to the Blair Sunday-Rest bill and the Blair Educational Amendment bill, as "Christian bills," but why, we are unable to say. Certain it is that we have repeatedly shown that these measures are the very opposite of Christian. Christianity teaches that men should render unto Cesar the things that are Cesar's and unto God the things that are God's. The Blair Sunday- Rest bill, should it become a law, would require men to render unto Cesar that which is God's. Again, Christianity teaches individual responsibility to God, and that man owes the highest duty to God. The Blair Educational Amendment, which provides that the principles of the Christian religion shall be taught in the public schools, would destroy that responsibility and place the Government in the place of God; because if the principles of the Christian religion should be taught in the public schools, the Government must define what are the principles of the Christian religion. And, if we recognize the State as having the right to decide this question for us, we virtually agree to stand by that decision. That is, we agree to accept as Christianity whatever the State may declare to be such. And to agree to such a thing is simply to deny the authority of God and of his word, and to apostatize from the true Christian faith. Every good citizen will obey every law of the State which does not interfere in any way with his duties to God; but no Christian can yield obedience to the State in matters which pertain alone to his duty to God. The apostles taught that we should be subject to the powers that be, but when arraigned before the magistrates and commanded not to teach any more in the name of Jesus, they said, "whether it be right to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye, but we cannot but speak the things which we have heard." The Blair bills are not Christian but anti-Christian, for the reason that they are subversive of the very principles of Christianity.
