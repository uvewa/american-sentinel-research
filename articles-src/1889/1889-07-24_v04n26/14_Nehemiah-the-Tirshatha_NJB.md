# Nehemiah, the Tirshatha.

The National Reform people cite the action of Nehemiah, in disallowing traffic on the Sabbath at Jerusalem, as a reason why labor and business should not be allowed on Sunday in this Nation. They say:—

> "The merchants of Tyre insisted upon selling goods near the temple on the Sabbath, and Nehemiah compelled the officers of the law to do their duty and stop it. So we can compel the officers of the law to do their duty."—*Elgin Convention, 1887.*

Nehemiah lived and acted during the theocracy of ancient Israel, the only true theocracy the world ever had or ever will have. Our Reformers propose a state of things similar in its practical workings. Notice:—

> "Every Government, by equitable laws, is a Government of God. A republic thus governed is of Him, through the people, and is as really a theocracy as the Commonwealth of Israel."—*Cincinnati National Reform Convention, 1872.*

Here we have it; they want a theocracy—a union of Church and State, although to a man they stoutly deny it, but they "let themselves out" now and then and stand self-convicted.

Now in working for a theocracy, and one as truly such as was "the Commonwealth of Israel," and taking up the work of Nehemiah under the ancient theocracy, we can draw our conclusions as to what they expect to do when they get things "fixed" in this Nation. Nehemiah not only compelled the keeping of the Sabbath, but instituted other reforms.

In the thirteenth chapter of the book of Nehemiah we are informed as to his work. It is recorded in verse 10 that he found that "the portions" or allowances of the Levites and singers had not been given them, so they had left their work and gone "every one to his field." Then he "contended" with the rulers and said, "Why is the house of God forsaken!" Then he has them all return and take their places, verse 11, and he arranges to have the tithe of corn, wine, and oil brought into the "treasuries" and appoints "faithful" officers to see that it is properly distributed; verses 12, 13. Nehemiah does this "for the house of God."

Now do the Reformers propose to tax the people to support the church under their theocracy? Mind you they hold up the work of Nehemiah in Sabbath reform under the theocracy of Israel, and they tell us there will be one as "really" as was the ancient one of Israel. It will be just like it in practical working. I repeat, do they propose to tax the people to support the church should they get the power? It looks very much like it, and to make certain of it I need only to cite the reader to the *Christian Statesman,* National Reform organ, of February 21, 1884, in which Rev. J. M. Foster, one of the leading district secretaries, says, "the Nation's duty" is to provide the church "funds out of the public treasury for carrying on her aggressive work at home and in the foreign field." These people do not want Church and State. Oh, no, not they, but they want to help themselves out of Uncle Sam's treasury to carry on their schemes, and are not willing to have church property taxed either! They want everybody taxed to support the church, but don't want the church compelled to pay its share of the public revenues. They are all *take *and *no give!*

Nehemiah continues his reforms, and the national schemers propose to follow on and do likewise. He found that improper marriages had been contracted. The Jews had been marrying foreigners. He shows them the wrong of this and "contended with them, and cursed them [pronounced judgment], and smote certain of them and plucked off their hair," etc. Neh. 13:25. Do our national theocrats intend to say who shall and who shall not marry? Do they mean to allow no marrying with outsiders—no marriages with any but church members? Or do they expect to compel everybody to join the church, that there be no restricted marriages? Do they mean to imitate the zeal of Nehemiah and smite and pull out the hair of those who do not choose the right kind of life partners? If so they will be vigorous reformers indeed! Do they expect to make it lively for preacher's sons who marry Ammonites and Moabites! How far away do they expect to "chase" such unlucky bridegrooms as marry "strange wives"? Neh. 13: 28.

This subject should by no means be treated lightly, but with gravity and sincerity. Nehemiah was working under a divine theocracy and therefore under divine instructions. The "good hand of God was upon him" and his work was right and God approved of it. He was the Tirshatha (governor) appointed of God. The would-be Reformers are self-appointed. They can show no credentials as could Nehemiah that the hand of God is upon them for any such purpose; his frown will rather rest upon them. They are self-constituted rulers—tirshathas—of their own appointing, and they will signally fail in building up the house of God and in glorifying his name. They should remember that Nehemiah lived under the only true theocracy that ever existed, and acted as civil and religious ruler. Under the Christian dispensation Church and State are wholy separate. They should beware of building again those things that were destroyed. They should also remember particularly that the Sabbath of Nehemiah was the Sabbath of the seventh day—which they so despise—and not the first day of the week. If they propose to follow him in Sabbath reform why don't they do it? N. J. Bowers.
