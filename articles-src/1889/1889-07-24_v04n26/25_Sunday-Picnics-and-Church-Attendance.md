Rev. A. Fasanotti, D. D., a Catholic priest of San Francisco, recently delivered a sermon on the subject of Sunday picnics. He stated, among other things, that his church did not object to picnics being held on Sunday, provided the parties "attend divine service before departing on the trip." Just so; and this same principle is largely responsible for the efforts being made at present by the National Reformers. It is not, after all, the sanctity of the Sunday Sabbath which they so much desire to bring about, as it is a desire to fill the pews of their churches. They greatly lament the fact that Sunday is being so universally "desecrated," but the principal reason for their grief is not because the sacredness, as they term it, of Sunday, is being violated, but it is because this so-called desecration draws the multitudes away from the church, and for this reason they say that it must be stopped.
