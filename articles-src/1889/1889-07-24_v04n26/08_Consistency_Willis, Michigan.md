# Consistency.

In the *Michigan Christian Advocate* for June 1, Rev. Wilbur F. Crafts, D. D., has an article entitled, “Petitions against National Sabbath Rest Law,” in which he appears to be very much exercised in mind to think that a “thousand or less” of the seventh-day worshipers were able to secure 230,000 individual signatures to a petition against the Blair bills in about two months.

That which troubles the doctor more than anything else seems to be the foresight of the originators of this counter-petition, in furnishing it in duplicate to the Senate and House of Representatives, and in so wording it as to cover everything in the line of religious legislation for all time to come. And so the good doctor exhausts himself in vituperation and spite against “the little contingent of Seventh-day worshipers who form seventenths of one per cent of the population,” because of their diligent effort against the Blair bill.

The doctor says: “There is a question of conscience involved in this Sunday-Rest law, but it does not relate to the thousand or less of seventhday people who would not come under its jurisdiction.”

Now we would like to know what this question of conscience is, and why seventh-day people would not come under its jurisdiction. The doctor explains: “In the mail and military service and in interstate commerce, no Seventh-day worshipper can be consistently engaged.” That is equivalent to saying that everybody else *can* be consistently engaged in such service. What is there about such service that makes it inconsistent for a seventh-day worshiper to engage in it? — simply this, it requires seven days’ work in the week, and seventh-day worshipers are so consistent in their belief in the binding obligation of the Sabbath commandment that they will engage in service or labor of any kind only during six days in the week; while those who do engage in such service, either do not believe in the binding obligation of the Sabbath commandment, or else they are inconsistent in their profession.

The doctor proceeded to explain the question of conscience. He says, “The real question of conscience is, whether the two million of our people who are now required to do on the Sabbath, work for gain which is not in any sense work of necessity or mercy, shall be required to continue working against health and conscience, or whether by the proposed National Sunday-Rest law and the influence that would follow it, their rights of conscience and their right to rest shall be protected.”

The doctor talks as if we were living in a condition of slavery. Just as though these two million men had not voluntarily placed themselves in the situations which they occupy. Every man of them, from the commander-in-chief of the army down to the third-class postmaster, used every influence at his command to secure the position which he holds, and that, too, with a full understanding of what the duties of the situation required of him. If they had any conscientious scruples in regard to the observance of Sunday, why did they voluntarily place themselves in a situation where they could not keep it? The facts are, these men have no conscience in the matter. But Dr. Crafts says, “there is a question of conscience involved in this Sunday-Rest law,” and we would particularly like to know who has this conscience. The men who require service to be performed on Sunday evidently have no conscience in the matter, and those who perform the service have none, so Dr. Crafts proposes to have Congress make a law which will give them all consciences for Sunday; and not only this, but the proposed law is to give physical health as well as consciences to those who are required to disregard a Sabbath commandment for which they now have no regard. The writer is at a loss for a term by which to designate such a performance. It does not come entirely under the head of theology, medicine, or political economy. But inasmuch as it has to do with each, he would suggest as a fitting title for the proposed law, *The Political- Theological - Psychological- Physiological- Sunday-Best Law.*Eugene Leland.
