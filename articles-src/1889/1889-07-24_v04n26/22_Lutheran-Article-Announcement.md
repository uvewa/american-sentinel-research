We publish in this number of the American Sentinel an article entitled, "A Lutheran Minister on National Reform," for which we ask a careful reading. The article consists of extracts from an essay read before the Lutheran Conference at Loudonville, Ohio, January 15. It is well worthy of a careful perusal. We will send the entire essay in pamphlet form to any address, post-paid for 3 cents.
