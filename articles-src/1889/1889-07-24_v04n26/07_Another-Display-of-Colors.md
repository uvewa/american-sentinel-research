The Chicago District Committee of the American Sabbath Union have undertaken the work of advising the Postmaster-General as to his duties. From an "open letter" of the committee to Mr. Wanamaker, we clip the following:—

We submit to your consideration the following points as some of those on which orders or recommendations from you ought to bring the postal service more fully into harmony with the proper uses of the civil Sabbath as a day on which the Government should protect its citizens against interruptions of their rest and worship:

1. No post office to be opened at the usual hours of worship.

2. No postal employes required to be on duty at hours that would take from them the opportunity to attend church.

3. Stamp clerks to be entirely free from Sunday work.

4. Mail bearing special delivery stamp to be uniformly held in the office as other mail, unless personally called for.

5. No mail matter except letters to be stamped or sorted on the Sabbath.

6. Any postoffice to be wholly closed on the Sabbath where a majority of the people of legal age petition for such closing.

It is not so much the language of the suggestions as the fact of their being made, to which attention is called. This "open letter" is a mild attempt to operate on the line marked out by Rev. Sam Small, an ardent National Reformer and popular "revivalist." His idea of a Reform Government is thus expressed:—

> "I want to see the day come when the church shall be the arbiter of all legislation, State, national and municipal; when the great churches of the country can come together harmoniously and issue their edict, and the legislative powers will respect it and enact it into laws."

Of course the Postmaster-General has not legislative powers, but the principle is the same. And then, as Mr. Crafts said on the occasion of the drafting of the committee's open letter, "it is a fact that the Postmaster-General has the most autocratic powers of any officer under the United States Government, and he could order the complete cessation of labor in all departments of the mail service on the Sabbath, but such an order would not be permanent as would a law of Congress." The Reformers, knowing that they have a strong sympathizer in the person of an officer holding "autocratic powers," cannot forego the experiment of trying the influence of the church. So with every favorable turn in their affairs, the real spirit of their movement becomes more and more manifest.
