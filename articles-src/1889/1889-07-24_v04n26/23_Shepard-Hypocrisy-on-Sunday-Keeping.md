The *American Catholic News,* published in New York, accuses Col. Elliott F. Shepard of hypocrisy in the matter of Sunday-keeping as follows:—

> "He [Col. Shepard] owns the Fifth Avenue stages and has refused to run them on Sunday on the ground of his unwillingness to 'desecrate the Sabbath? It is now known that the editor of that sycophantic sheet [the *Mail and Express*] also owns the stages that run in Central Park, and not only does he run these on Sunday, but also the Fifth Avenue stages, too. The truth is that there is no money in running the Fifth Avenue stages on Sunday; so they are employed in Central Park, where the demand on 'the day of rest ' is greater than the stages run there on week days can accommodate."
