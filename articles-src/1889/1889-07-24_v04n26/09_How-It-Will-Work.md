# How It Will Work.

The New Haven *Register* of June 9, 1889, under the heading, "A Rational Reform Law Demanded," quotes the following little story from the current number of the pictorial *Judge,* under the caption "C*ui Bono?"*—for whose good:—

*First Workingman—"*Let's go to the Art Museum." *Second Workingman*—"Closed on Sundays, you know."

*Third Workingman*—"Well, let's take a ride in the stage up Fifth Avenue."

*Second Workingman—"Don't run on Sundays."*

*First Workingman*—"Gad! then let's go in Von Bier's back door and fill up."

The *Register* remarks that "there is a deal of philosophy in this story which our good friends, the members of the Sunday Observance Club, will do well to think over." It follows with lengthy comments in a similar strain, which we have not space to quote. But the supposed incident shows very clearly one thing, and that is, that if the National Reformers cannot see how their desired Sunday law would work, others can see it, without any dimness of vision whatever. Enforced idleness upon those who have no conscience as to a day of rest, is simply enforced demoralization and crime. Unless the law to rest shall be supplemented by a law that all shall attend church, the majority will drift into the back door of some saloon and fill up. And even if they did compulsorily attend church, there would be time enough for the saloon visitation after that. Instead of making this a Christian nation, the Sunday movement will only make it more unchristian.—*Review and Herald.*
