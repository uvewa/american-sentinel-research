# The Sunday Question in Cleveland.

The Cleveland, Ohio, Secular Union has become somewhat stirred up over the Sunday question because of the efforts of the ministers in that city to enforce the observance of the day upon all classes. We have no sympathy whatever with the religious views of these secularists, but we do claim that so far as man is concerned they have as good a right to their views as anyone else; the fact of their being infidels should not place them outside the protection of the laws nor deprive them of the enjoyment of citizenship with all its privileges. Neither should a man be made an offender for a word, or for his faith.

But erroneous as are the views held by these men, they have evidently arrived at a pretty thorough understanding of this Sunday question. We quote a single paragraph from their open letter to the ministers of Cleveland. They refer these gentlemen to the fact that according to the Scriptures, Sunday is not the Sabbath, and that according to the same authority the seventh and not the first day of the week is sacred. They then say:—

> "Sunday was set apart for the sabbath simply as a matter of convenience. You will not deny this, we are sure. That being admitted, then what binding force should it have on those who do not care to observe it? Is it not a direct wrong for a certain class of citizens to try to oblige other citizens to observe their religious days? Is it not a violation of individual rights for a religious sect to endeavor by law to force other sects or systems to observe their ceremonies?"

The only fault we have to find with this paragraph is the implication that if Sunday were indeed set apart by divine authority it would be proper to enforce its observance by civil law. This is a grave error. To admit that the State has a right to enforce any religious observance is to admit the whole question; for if it has a right to enforce those things which are of divine appointment it must of necessity have a right to decide what things are of divine authority. The true principle and the only tenable position is, that the State can of right have nothing whatever to do with either defining or enforcing religious duties.
