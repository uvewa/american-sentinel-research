# What is Rest?

What is known as the "Sunday-rest" movement is again coming to the front, and the public may confidently expect a well-organized lobby to precipitate itself upon Congress early in the next session, and through its spokesman in the Senate, urge the passage of a rigid national law embracing its views of the proper observance of Sunday. . . . .

These "Sunday-rest" advocates try very hard to avoid the charge that their movement is an attempt to secure State interference with religion, and their arguments are ingenious and plausible; but they are not likely to mislead men who are fit to represent the people. . . . The claim is made that legislative interference for the observance of Sunday would be good for the bodies and minds of the public, and that this divests it of its religious character; but so long as Sunday, the day upon which the majority of people worship God, is singled out for legislative experiment, the conviction will remain that it is an effort to connect Church and State—something that the Constitution expressly repudiates, and the past horrors of which should be a sufficient warning to intelligent people.

To restore the "Puritan Sunday" throughout the United States might have the effect of increasing church membership, but it is very doubtful if there would be a corresponding increase of sincere religion. Those who would be driven into the fold under the operation of an oppressive law would be like the conscripts forced to fight against their principles—a leaven of dissatisfaction to corrupt the entire army.

But may not the people, after all, have as just and sensible ideas of the way to worship God and regulate their own conduct on Sunday as these self-constituted guardians? There are many, possibly a large majority of the inhabitants of the United States, who sincerely believe that God is better pleased with the innocent enjoyment of his creatures, even on Sunday, than with their enforced torture, under the guise of rest and respect for the day. What is rest? Can one who is compelled to work during the week be said to rest on Sunday if he has to go unwillingly to church? . . . Do the nerves take on a healthy tone, the muscles regain their elasticity, or the mental faculties expand, because the spade or pick-axe is cast aside, or the weary toil of the counter is temporarily abandoned? There will be relaxation, of course; so there is in the unstrung bow, but unless the archer bends the latter in the opposite direction, its strength and springiness soon pass away.

Rest means change, as well as relaxation. Those who advocate Government interference with Sunday can rest whenever they please. They are not confined to one day in the week, but can vary their pursuits and pleasures to suit their whims or necessities, and they are unable to appreciate the longing of the hard-worked toiler for one day in seven when he can do as he pleases without the intervention of bosses and superintendents, or the equally irksome provisions of a tyrannical law, provided he does not interfere with the rights and privileges of his neighbor. To suppose that God grudges him his rest or his innocent enjoyment is to deny the attributes of the Most High. The man who goes to church on Sunday morning is none the worse for rational enjoyment in the afternoon and evening, and whether he is or not, the Government has nothing whatever to do with it.— *Sedalia, Mo., Bazoo, June 23, 1889. *[207-208]
