Every argument which Mr. Crafts has ever attempted in favor of a National Sunday law has been repeatedly met and refuted, nevertheless he continues to deal them out to his various audiences, making no attempt to answer counter arguments except by denials, and by denouncing all those who do not agree with him in his pet schemes for religious legislation. A favorite argument with him is, that the principle opposition outside of liquor dealers comes from Seventh-day Adventists, Seventh-day Baptists, and Jews, who, he says, together form about seven-tenths of one per cent of the population. This, to Mr. Crafts' mind, is a sufficient reason why their wishes and rights should be entirely ignored. But, with the man who loves liberty, the rights of a single individual are as sacred as the rights of any number. Neither will justice seek to invade the rights of any; but in effect Mr. Crafts insists that these people have no rights in this matter.

Mr. Crafts defines personal liberty as "the space within the circle bound on all sides simply by the rights of others." But this is not the personal liberty which he demands, or which he is willing to accord to others. He sneers at the minority who conscientiously observe the seventh day of the week, and is demanding legislation which would practically compel all such to refrain from labor also upon another day, thus depriving them of one-sixth of their God-given time for earning a livelihood and a support for those who are dependent upon them. He insists that whenever one rests on Sunday, all must rest; but that this is not necessary is demonstrated by the fact that thousands of conscientious observers of the seventh day do rest absolutely from all secular labor upon Saturday, the busiest and noisiest day of the week.

The personal liberty which Mr. Crafts advocates is such personal liberty as was granted some two years since in Arkansas, when the exemption clause in the Sunday law was repealed by the Legislature of that State. Under the law as it then stood for two years, conscientious Christian men, men who would not knowingly wrong their neighbors in any way or take a cent that did not belong to them, were fined and imprisoned for doing such ordinary and quiet labor upon the first day of the week as digging potatoes, painting buildings, and plowing in fields at a distance from any public road. The same personal liberty is also enjoyed in Georgia, where for doing any kind of labor upon the first day of the week any person may be fined and imprisoned, the fine to go to the support of the Sunday-schools. Such examples show conclusively the innate wickedness of Sunday laws.

Mr. Crafts professes to favor an exemption clause in the National Sunday law which he is demanding, but the only exemption which he is willing to grant is of persons doing ordinary labor on Sunday which will not interfere in any way with others who wish to rest upon that day. For instance, he would prohibit a seventh-day worshiper from keeping his place of business open on Sunday, because that, he says, would compel other people to keep their business places open or else they would suffer from the competition of the man who kept open on Sunday. He forgets that the seventh-day worshiper doing business on Sunday would close his store upon Saturday, which is, as every business man will testify, the best day of the week for business; but Mr. Crafts' theory is that a part cannot rest unless all do, therefore the seventh-day worshiper must close his place of business on Sunday. Following this same logic no ordinary work should be permitted upon the first day of the week, the carpenter, the bricklayer or the plumber would also be prohibited from carrying on their vocations for the same reason, and Mr. Crafts' exemptions would amount to nothing.

But seventh-day worshipers want no exemption clause. They protest against Sunday laws of all kinds for the reason that Sunday is a religious institution, and they deny the right of Government to recognize it in any manner. They object to it for the same reason that the German princes objected to the protest against the repeal of the Edict of Spires, namely, "because it concerns the glory of God and the salvation of souls, and that in such matters we ought to have regard above all to the commandments of God, who is King of kings and Lord of lords, each of us rendering him account of himself without caring the least in the world about majority or minority." And further, that to yield the individual judgment in such matters "would be to deny our Lord Jesus Christ and reject his holy word, and thus give him just reason to deny us in turn before his Father, as he has threatened."

To admit that the Government has the right to establish by law the keeping of any day, is to destroy individual responsibility to God; it is in fact to put the Government in the place of or instead [202] of God. For, if it is right that the Government should establish the observance of days, then all good citizens ought to obey the laws of the Government and observe such days; and if the Government has the right to establish the observance of a day, then it has a right to change that observance and to place it upon some other day. Would Mr. Crafts and his co-workers in the so- called National Reform movement be willing to keep Wednesday or Friday if the Government should require it? Certainly not. They would immediately insist with great vehemence that their religious liberty was infringed, but it would no more be infringed than is the liberty of the seventh-day worshiper who is also required to rest on Sunday.

But it may be urged, and it is urged, that if an exemption clause is inserted in the bill, nobody's liberty is infringed. But this cannot be admitted for a moment. If the State has a right to require the man who has no conscientious regard for any day to rest upon a certain day, then it has the same right to require the man who has a conscientious regard for one day to rest upon some other day. In matters of conscience there must be absolute equality. We cannot say that because a man is an infidel he has not as good right to his convictions, or to his doubts, if you please, as the man who is either professedly or virtually a Christian; for if the Government has a right to discriminate and to say that Christians have certain rights that non-Christians have not, it follows that the Government must decide who are Christians, and who are not Christians; but in order to arrive at such a decision, the Government must first establish a standard of Christianity, and that would be simply to establish a State religion; which is in fact the very thing the National Reformers demand. Thus, it appears, that looking at it from any standpoint whatever, Sunday laws are unjust and oppressive. They destroy personal responsibility to God, put the Government in the place of God, and infringe the personal rights of the subject.C. P. Bollman.
