# National Reform in Tennessee.

Obion, Obion County, Tenn., June 28, 1889.

Editors American Sentinel: I send you the following copy of the steps taken against R. M. King, for working on Sunday:—

State of Tennessee, Obion County,

To any Lawful Officer of the State:

W. W. Dobbins having given information on oath to me, that R. M. King did, on the 23d day of June, 1889, it being Sunday or the Sabbath- day, and in State and county as aforesaid, and District No. 9, did publicly plow in his field, in violation of the law. You are therefore hereby commanded to forthwith arrest the said R. M. King and bring him before me, or some justice of the peace for said county, to be dealt with as the law directs.

Given under my hand, this June 24, 1889.

J. A. Parks.

State of Tennessee, Obion County.

This day personally appeared before me, J. A. Barker, an acting justice of the peace for said county, W. W. Dobbins, and made oath in due form that one R. M. King did, on the 23d day of June, 1889, it being Sunday or the Sabbath-day, in Obion County, Tennessee, District No. 9, publicly plow in his field.W. W. Dobbins.

Sworn to and subscribed before me, this June 24, 1889

J. A. Barker, J. P.

The trial is set for July 5, 1889. The recent heavy rains have placed farm crops in such a condition that farmers feel that it is necessary to work every hour they can in order to save their grain and growing crops. R. M. King is a strict observer of the seventh day of the week, and had rested on June 22 as he conscientiously believes it to be his duty to do, so on the 23d, being the first day of the week, he went quietly about his work cultivating corn. He says he was in fact very quiet; the corn was tall and he was almost hid from view, and made no disturbance whatever.

The Sunday before, one of his neighbors who makes no profession of religion cut wheat from 9 A. M. till the close of the day with a self-binder machine, with several hands, yet no one complained about it, although he had not rested the day before. Just three weeks before R. M. King did the plowing (cultivating) for which he is to be prosecuted, one of his neighbors rafted logs all day on Sunday, working seven or eight hands and making much noise. This man is a member of the Presbyterian Church in good standing, and in good worldly circumstances.

Mr. W. W. Dobbins is a member of the Methodist Church. One of his brethren drove the reaper a part of the day on the Sunday before R. M. King plowed in his field. Yet Mr. Dobbins made no complaint about a member of his own church working on Sunday. He did not complain about his Presbyterian neighbor’s rafting logs on Sunday and working mules in order to get the logs to the water. These men made the usual amount of noise that teamsters make in drawing timber. The timber was not in danger of being swept away by the water, but they simply took advantage of the stage of the water in order to save time and do a big day’s work. The owner of the timber told R. M. King that he worked on Sunday in order to take advantage of the water, as he desired to get the timber out before the water would fall in the bottom. Wm. Covert.

The *Christian Nation,* a National Reform organ published in New York City, intimates that Dr. Vincent, recently strangled to death by an apparatus for the treatment of spinal disease, with which he was experimenting, and also Mindreader Bishop, were the victims of divine displeasure because they both experimented on Sunday. Would it not be well for the *Nation* to first show that God himself has any special regard for Sunday before jumping to the conclusion that he is sending judgment upon those who fail to observe it according to the National Reform order? And while our contemporary is about it we would like to have it account for the fact that not a few ministers have dropped dead while preaching on Sunday, and also that no longer ago than May 26, a minister was struck by lightning in his pulpit on Sunday at the New Liberty Christian Church, in Fountain County, Indiana.—*Signs of the Times.*

The morality as derived from religion which the State needs will be best supplied by the confinement of its agency to things temporal and the entire omission on the part of any attempt to administer things spiritual. The State can do religion no favor so great as to have nothing to do with it, and itself no favor so great as to let religion alone. The moment the two are put in alliance with each other both are injured.—*Spear.*
