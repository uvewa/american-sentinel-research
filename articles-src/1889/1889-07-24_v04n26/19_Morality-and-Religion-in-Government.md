The morality as derived from religion which the State needs will be best supplied by the confinement of its agency to things temporal and the entire omission on the part of any attempt to administer things spiritual. The State can do religion no favor so great as to have nothing to do with it, and itself no favor so great as to let religion alone. The moment the two are put in alliance with each other both are injured.—*Spear.*
