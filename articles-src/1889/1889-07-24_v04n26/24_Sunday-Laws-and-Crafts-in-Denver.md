The following item from the South Bend (Ind.) *Tribune* of June 1, is a suggestive commentary on Sunday laws, and on the claim of W. F. Crafts and his co-workers that the laboring men are clamoring for permission to rest on Sunday

> "The agreement among the barbers of Indianapolis to test the Sunday law was begun last Sunday by the keeping open of the Bates House tonsorial rooms, and barber Knox was promptly arrested. Tobacco stands in this State are allowed to keep open under a Supreme Court decision that tobacco is a necessity, and the barbers believe that, if their case is properly presented, a favorable decision will be rendered. The saloons were all closed Sunday, but the drug stores were open and whisky can be bought by the quart at most of them."

And what a victory for temperance it must be to have saloons closed and drug stores selling liquor by the quart! Great is Sunday; and past finding out are Sunday laws!

Mr. Crafts, the field secretary of the so-called American Sabbath Union, is still swinging around the circle in the interests of National Reform, and as he goes is strewing his inuendoes and misrepresentations everywhere. In his recent visit to Denver, in the interests of his so-called reform, he attempted to carry things with a high hand. We are informed that he was very much incensed because the American Sentinel was distributed very extensively in that city while he was there. A number of copies of the Sentinel were given out from the office of the leading paper in Denver, and Mr. Crafts learning of this fact went to the office and secured an interview with the proprietor, demanding that no more papers should be circulated from that office. The proprietor of the paper very properly refused to be dictated to in such a matter, and the circulation of the Sentinel continued. We do not wonder that Mr. Crafts writhed under it, for the number of the Sentinel which was circulated on that occasion contained arguments which Mr. Crafts did not care to encounter, and which he is entirely unable to answer.
