# A Lutheran Minister on National Reform.

> “Would the success of the National Reform movement lead to a union of Church and State?” is the title of an essay read by Rev. Carl Ackermann, before the Lutheran (Conference at Loudonville, Ohio, January 15, 1889, and published by request of the Conference in the *Lutheran Standard,* Columbus, of April 27, May 4, and May 11, from which we take the following extracts which are worthy, as is indeed the entire essay, of a careful perusal:—

Both Church and State have important fields of action in the affairs of men, and both are divinely ordered. . . . God himself has instituted the powers that be. “Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God; the powers that be are ordained of God.” Rom. 13: 1; compare Prov. 8: 15, 16. The principles underlying the foundation of government are as immutable as the Almighty himself—they are the principles of right and justice, and have their origin in God. And the application of these principles defines the sphere of the State’s activity. Professor Schuette in his “State, Church, and School,” defines this activity as follows: “The object and duty of the State may be designated as that of protection. The Government must secure the individual subject against injury to his person, property, reputation, and business; establish the limits of free action and protect him in the enjoyment of it within the lines so marked out. It must defend him against all undue interference with the exercise of his religion and with the government of his family. It must insure to him safety and liberty of action in his social and religious connection and intercourse. . . .

From this definition it is clear that the province of the State’s activity is the defense of man in his outward relations to his fellow-man, to protect him from harm and injury which may be inflicted on him, and to demand that, in all his actions, he take cognizance of the rights and privileges of others. It takes into consideration his relation to society. . . . The work of the State is to supervise the life of citizens and to legislate and enforce those things which are necessary for upholding right and punishing crime.”—*Rev. J. A. Scolt Jr., in Christian at Work.*

> “The civil law extends over the body of man, his property, and whatever is external on earth— no farther.”—*Luther.*

The sphere of activity for the church is upon a different plane. She takes into consideration the spiritual wants of man. . . . For that purpose God has also given the church the necessary means. By inspiration he guided the prophets and apostles to record his holy will. And by his Spirit he makes that inspired Word a power of God to break the heart of stone and new create it unto life and immortality. But it must be proclaimed, and to proclaim and teach the Word for the above purpose, is the Godgiven sphere of the church’s activity. Her commission was: “Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature” (Mark 16: 15), and that same commission stands to-day. With the Word as the sword of the Spirit she is to do her work, and with it alone. “After that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of of preaching to save them that believe.” 2. Cor. 1:21. To the church alone belongs this office. She is to Christianize men, not by force of arms or human agencies, but by and through the Word. Force may bring forth a confession of Christianity, but only the Word can change the heart. Word and sacrament are the only means of grace, and therefore the only means which the church can and dare use in her work of grace. “Her career lies within the kingdoms of earth, but is not of them.”

As already stated, then, both Church and State are of divine origin, and have at least in so far a common object that they both seek the welfare of man and the glory of God. But “one is established by God as the Creator, and is therefore preeminently a dominion of his creative power and of providential wisdom and goodness; the other is established by God as the Redeemer, and is therefore a kingdom in which his grace and sanctifying power especially preponderate.” “The ministry of the one is to sanctify and save man in soul and body; the ministry of the other is to protect him in his outward relations, actions, possessions—to prosper him in his earthly calling.”

When we come to apply these principles to the work of the National Reform Association, we are met at the outset with a denial of any intention on their part of a union of Church and State, a denial which has been reiterated time and again. . . . But let us hear what National Reformers understand by Religion and State:—

> “Church and State is always an unmixed evil; but religion and State is another thing. That is a good thing—and that is what we aim to make a feature of our institutions, and we are going to have it.

> “It is just possible that the outcry against Church and State may spring rather from hatred to revealed religion than from any intelligent patriotism. But where is the sign, the omen, of such Church and State mischief coming upon us? Who will begin and who will finish this union of Church and State? If you think the Roman Catholic can do it in spite of the watchfulness of Protestants; or that one Protestant sect can do it amid the jealousy of all the other sects; or that all these sects will combine to effect a joint union with the State, you have a notion of human nature different from what I have. Church and State in union, then, are forever impossible here, and were it ever so easy, we all repudiate it on principle. There are enduring, ever valid reasons against it. But religion and State is another thing. That is possible. That is a good thing—and that is what we aim to [203]make a feature in our institutions.”—*Dr. J. Edwards, Minutes National Convention, N. Y., 1873, pp. 59, 60.*
> “Constitutional laws punish for false money, weights and measures, and of course, Congress establishes a standard for money, weights and measures. So Congress must establish a standard of religion, or admit anything called religion, as it already has the Oneida Community in New York, the Mormons in Utah, and the Joss House in California.”—*Professor Blanchard, Minutes Pittsburg Convention, 1874, P. 71.*
> “If our nation will accept God as the source of all authority, Christ Jesus as the nation’s king, and his law as of supreme authority over them, its creed is orthodox.”—*Rev. J. C. K. Milligan, in Christian Statesman, March 21, 1884.*
> “It is the duty of the State, as such, to enter into alliance with the church of Christ, and to profess, adhere to, defend and maintain the true religion.”—*J. M. Foster, in Statesman, 1884.*
> “This religion as understood by Protestants, tending by its effects to make every man submitting to its influence a better husband, parent, child, neighbor, citizen and magistrate, was by the people [of Massachusetts] established as a fundamental and essential part of their Constitution, and ought, we claim, to be likewise established by the people of the United States, as a fundamental and essential part of their Constitution.”—*Hon. T. H. B. Patterson, Minutes Pittsburg Convention, 1874, P. 89.*
> “We want State and religion—and we are going to have it. It shall be that so far as the affairs of State require religion, it shall be revealed religion, the religion of Jesus Christ. The Christian oath and Christian morality shall have in this land ‘an undeniable legal basis.’ We use the word religion in its proper sense, as meaning a man’s personal relation of faith and obedience to God.”—*Dr. Edwards, Minutes New York Convention, 1873, p. 60.*
From these extracts, which might be multiplied, it is certainly clear that when, in Article II. of their Constitution, one of the chief objects of this Society is stated to be, “To secure such an amendment to the Constitution of the United States as will declare the Nation’s allegiance to Jesus Christ and its acceptance of the moral laws of the Christian religion, and so indicate that this is a Christian nation, and place all the Christian laws, institutions and usages of our Government on an undeniable legal basis in the fundamental law of the land,” nothing less can be meant than that the statutes of our Government be so amended as to insert a confession of the religion of Jesus Christ in so far as the concensus of the evangelical Christian religion will permit, and make the holy Scriptures the formal rule of civil Government; yea, that our Government “enter into an alliance with the church of Christ and profess, adhere to, defend, and maintain the true religion,” and that all who will be citizens of this new commonwealth must submit to this “legalized Christianity.”

What tyranny and persecution followed the introduction of such a state of affairs in Massachusetts, every reader of history knows. And has man so changed that it would be less so now?

There are many who seem to think that a recognition of the Christian religion in the National Constitution is surely not to be deplored, and that is all, they say, the National Reformers want. The above extracts already disprove such claim. But they have spoken on this point also. The Rev. G. P. Stevenson, one of the inaugurators of the movement and its corresponding secretary, and with Dr. Mc. Allister, founder and coeditor of the *Christian Statesman,* says in an editoral, June 1, 1869:— ‘

> “The design of the pending movement of National Reform is not to secure mention of God in the National Constitution merely because such mention would be decent and becoming. It is not, in the view of its most earnest supporters, to express a sentiment which the nation already feels, and to exhibit a Christian character which as a nation we already possess. The necessity for the reform lies far deeper than such arguments would imply. The success of our cause would have a far more momentous effect. Our labors are an attempt to bring this nation into subjection to God; and the conviction that we are not as a nation in allegiance to the King of nations, but in rebellion against him and so in imminent danger of destruction, is the real impulse of the movement.”

The object then is not simply the insertion of the name of God into the Constitution, but to bring the nation “into subjection to God” by force of law—of legalized Christian institutions and usages.” And does not that subvert the principles enunciated above? Does it not place powers into the hands of the State which are beyond its appointed sphere? We have seen that the work of the State is to protect men in their rights, and that everything which defines their relation to their God is the work of the church. National Reformers would Christianize the land, as it were, by legal enactment (see Minutes Pittsburg Convention, 1887, etc). It would make all who would be full subjects of these United States to confess God and his Son Jesus Christ—to confess him, if not from conviction yet with the lips. The result would be, we will have a race of hypocrites, and civil rulers and magistrates who are in heart servants of Satan will become the interpreters of Scripture, and will be called upon to decide what is and what is not the religion of the Constitution. And that is one of the most objectionable features of a union of Church and State. But, say the Reformers:—

> “The State and its sphere exist for the sake of and to serve the interests of the church;” and “we will not allow the civil Government to decide between the churches and to ordain church doctrines, ordinances and laws.”—*Christian Statesman, Feb. 21, 1884.*

Be it so. The National Reformers will then decide what that “Constitutional religion,” that “National Christianity” is, and what “Christian institutions and usages” are legalized, while judges and civil rulers will be called upon to enforce them. But when that time comes, we will have retrogressed to the period of the Dark Ages, the arrogance of the popes of those terrible days will have full sway, and no element will be lacking to a perfect union of Church and State.
