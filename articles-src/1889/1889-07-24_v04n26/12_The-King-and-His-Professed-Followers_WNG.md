# The King and His Professed Followers.

One of the battle-cries of the National Reformers is that Christ shall be king of the Nation. Now no one can reasonably object to Christ being king of the Nation when he himself chooses to take that position. But there is serious objection to *taking him by force* to make him king. When he was on earth, and some fanatical persons were going to forcibly make him king, he promptly resented the act by eluding their insane design. On another occasion he said, "My kingdom is not of this world;" then, either he has changed his mind or the National Reformers are chasing a phantom.

But even if Christ were a candidate for political honors in this Nation, it is evident that his self-appointed representatives are sadly misrepresenting him. He laid down as a leading principle, "Whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you, do ye even so unto them;" but the religious legislation champions propose to compel men by law to do whatsoever the Reformers would have them do. Christ taught his followers to love their enemies, but the Reformers propose to "disfranchise" and even banish those who will not eventually fall in with them. Christ has plainly intimated that hypocrites have no place in his kingdom; but the Reformers count largely for success on those office-seekers who will fall in with them when their movement becomes popular.

Then, as to the Sabbath question, over which such an ado is being made, Christ recognized the Sabbath of the commandment, and expressly disregarded the "traditions" which the National Reformers of his day had attached to it. If he were on earth to-day he would no doubt do just as he did then, for he is "the same yesterday, today and forever." But the Sunday-law clamorers reverse the order by ignoring the Sabbath of the commandment and setting up a traditionary institution, in support of which they ask the State to issue a counter commandment. And all this in face of their claim that the law of God must be the supreme law of the land.

Again, the apostle Paul, who had his commission direct from Christ, especially enjoins Christians "to be subject unto the powers that be;" but the National Reform party wants the powers that be to be subject to the church,— which, being interpreted, means the church of the Reformers. When Peter would defend his Master with a sword, the Lord told him to put up his sword, saying, "they that take the sword shall perish by the sword." But the National Reformers, through District Secretary M. A. Gault, declare their intention, if necessary, to use "the sword and the bullet."

Christ taught his disciples, by both precept and example, to practice self-denial for the truth's sake. But in advocating Sunday observance, the Reformers propose to help out their Sundaykeeping allies by not allowing them to lose anything on account of their faith; therefore, because they want to keep Sunday, everybody else must be made to close business. Says Rev. George S. Mott, D. D.:— [205]

> "The person who keeps the law must not be put out and disadvantaged thereby. . . . The merchant who closes his store might find that his neighbor who keeps open on Sunday was drawing away a trade which belongs to him. Now we must not permit the Sunday-keeping merchant to be the loser because he regards the law, and so must it be with all kinds of labor."

Thus it is, no matter which way we turn to view this climax of wickedness, the so-called National Reform, we find it directly antagonistic to every principle inculcated by Him whom they professedly represent, and whom they would nominally proclaim king of the Nation. W. N. Glenn.
