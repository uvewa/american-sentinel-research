Two evenings after Mr. Shepard delivered his lecture entitled, "Does the Sabbath pay?" in which he set before the people the pecuniary advantages of Sunday rest, stating that the manufacturer who closed his business on Sunday would make thirty-six per cent more than the one who worked, we heard the manager of a small railroad say before the same audience that the lecturer had converted him, and that the preceding Sunday was the last Sunday that trains would run on his road. At this the congregation applauded immoderately, and we, remembering the inducements that the redoubtable Colonel had set forth, could only think of the words of an ancient writer: "Men will praise thee when thou doest well to thyself."
