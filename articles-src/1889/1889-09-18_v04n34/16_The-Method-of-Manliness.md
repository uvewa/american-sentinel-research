# The Method of Manliness.

Francis Murphy, of Pittsburg, is one of the greatest of the temperance apostles of our day. From a recent address we quote this passage: "It is time for the church of God to pause and cease running to the Legislature to save them from their sins. Acts of the Legislature, like Moses, always die within sight of the promised land. This is an age of reason, of thought, of education. A man who doesn't drink liquor because he cannot get it does not deserve any praise. A man who does not steal because he has no opportunity deserves no praise as an honest man. Every brave man who has stood up under the sky has been developed in the face of great temptation." It is singular indeed th at there should be persons of intelligence who suppose that temperance is the restraint of law, not self-control.— *Oregonian.*
