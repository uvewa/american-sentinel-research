Thursday night and Friday, August 15, 16, there was held in San Francisco a convention to organize a Sunday-law Union for Northern California auxiliary to the National Sunday-law Union. As usual in these meetings great sympathy was professed for the workingman. The workingman was mentioned often. The kind of Sabbath that the workingman needs, was the subject of one of the principal speeches. Yet for all this there was not a workingman there as delegate or as representative from anywhere. There was not a workingman to make a speech in all the convention. There was not a workingman made a member of the Executive Committee, which was large. The only interest the workingmen showed in the convention was to send letters telling the managers that the Sunday-law crusade is "only an effort of their preachers to fill their pews." It seems strange that a movement that is so universally favored by the workingmen as the Sundaylaw managers would have it to be believed this is, should be so doubted and scouted by the workingmen as this is. In other words the facts prove that on this point the claim of the Sundaylaw managers is a fraud.
