# What Next in the Fight for Religious Liberty?

New and startling developments in the work of those whose efforts threaten the religious liberty of our Nation, tell us that they do not think for a moment of giving over the struggle as long as they have a single opponent in the field. They are tireless in their exertions and free with their means, to secure influence and patronage. Every expedient within their reach is being utilized to the furtherance of their ends.

First, they send a general agent into every State and Territory, to work up conventions, to which the local clergy are invited and there instructed. These, in turn, go to their respective churches, and work up the matter, by organizing local societies. The members of these societies are not only expected to sign a petition to Congress for a Sunday-Rest bill, but are also expected to interest all others in that work by putting reading matter into their hands.

This is the work they have been engaged in since Congress adjourned last March. Their activity in the matter shows that they do not consider their cause a hopeless one, by any means. On the other hand, their earnestness means that when Congress assembles the coming winter, they intend to be fully organized for effective work, and to have many millions of petitions to Congress in behalf of a Sunday bill.

When Congress adjourned last spring, the friends of the Blair bill sent out the following: "Congress has adjourned, but not without giving the petitioners a good omen, by ordering the publication of 42,000 copies of the hearing upon it. *. . . The gathering of signatures and indorsements to the petitions should not be abated in the leastfl* From this it is plain that instead of feeling that their previous work was a failure, they believe it was a success, and are working with might and main to be prepared to carry the matter through the coming session of Congress.

More than this, Mr. Crafts said in the presence of the writer this summer, that Mr. Blair had consented to revise his rest bill and make it more stringent, according to the request of the friends of the bill, and that when it came up again, it would be more in accordance with their minds. The writer also heard Mr. Blair say that all the testimony taken last winter for and against his bills would be available in the next Congress. These things are stated to show the reader that none of the friends of that measure consider the Sunday bill dead.

Many of the leading politicians of the country are of the opinion that a special session of Congress will be called next November. This is one month earlier than it usually meets. In this case, the friends of Sunday legislation will be on hand fully organized, and have a bill brought up as early in the session as they can, and then stay by to push it as fast as possible. This is the end they are working to, and the friends of religious liberty ought to be on the alert to enlighten the masses, and check as far as possible such movements.J. O. Corliss.
