Bishop Hearst of the M. E. Church says that "The Germans who land on our shores do not know what the Sabbath is—they never saw it. They want to be presented with such a Sabbath as national legislation can give." But the Germans who land here, in a little while become important factors themselves in the matter of legislation, both State and national. Then will not the Sabbath that is given by legislation bear much of the blemish of those who it is confessed know not what it is? We would inquire of the Bishop and his Sunday-law co-workers, whether it would not be a good plan for the churches of this country to present to the Germans and all others such a Sabbath as the genuine religion of Christ can give? This would be an ambition worthy of their sincerest endeavors.
