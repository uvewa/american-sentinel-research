The president of the American Sabbath Union, Elliott F. Shepard, insists properly enough that if men will keep the Sabbath they will get a blessing. And he also insists that all who do not keep it must be compelled to keep it by a National Sunday law. But will people get that blessing who will not keep it without being compelled to? In other words can you force the blessing of God upon men? and that by civil law?
