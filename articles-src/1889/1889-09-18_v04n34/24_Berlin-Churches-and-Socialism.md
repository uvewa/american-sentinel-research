At the Washington City Sunday-law convention last winter, Dr. Conrad said that "thirteen years ago Berlin had 800,000 inhabitants, now it has double that number, yet only one church has been built in that time, and that is the only church built there in fifty years. The Church has lost her power over the people. Many, though confirmed in the Church, are freethinkers in religion, and as citizens are Socialists." This is a lesson worth the learning by those statesmen (?) who want religion forced by law into the public schools *for* the benefit of the State. Such a thing is a damage both to religion and the State.
