The *Times* of this city is in favor of teaching the principles of our Constitution and the Declaration of Independence in our common schools. It would certainly be a step in the right direction, but would no doubt be bitterly opposed by those who denounce our Constitution as atheistic, and who contend that governments do not "derive their just powers from the consent of the governed." But the fight against the principles of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution as it is, is on, and we may as well meet the issue squarely; and we know of no better way of doing this than by teaching the rising generation to love our free institutions.
