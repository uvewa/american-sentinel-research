In an article in the *Christian Statesman* of August 31, 1881, Rev. Sylvester Scovel, writing of the desirability of uniting with Roman Catholics for the purpose of securing so-called national reform, said:—

> "We may be subjected to some rebuffs in our first proffers, and the time has not yet come when the Roman Church will consent to strike hands with other churches, as such; but the time has come to make repeated advances, and gladly to accept cooperation in any form in which they may be willing to exhibit. It is one of the necessities of the situation."

And again in the same line the *Christian* *Statesman* of December 11, 1884, said -editorially:—

> "Whenever they [the Roman Catholics] are willing to co-operate in resisting the progress of political atheism, we will gladly join hands with them."

And now comes the Baltimore Catholic Congress, which closed its session in that city on the 11th inst., and says in its platform:—

> "There are many Christian issues in which the Catholics could come together with non-Catholics and shape civil legislation for the public good. In spite of rebuff and injustice, and overreaching zealotry, we should seek an alliance with the non-Catholics for proper Sunday observance."

At present we leave our readers to draw their own conclusions, and forecast the probable results of this Roman Catholic National Reform alliance now as good as formed.
