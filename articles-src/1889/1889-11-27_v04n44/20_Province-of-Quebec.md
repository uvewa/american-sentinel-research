> "To-day the Province of Quebec is," says the *American Citizen,* "under the exclusive control of the Roman Catholic Church. The public officers are Roman Catholic, the religion is Roman Catholic, and it has just been shown that the courts are equally Roman Catholic."

The Province of Quebec is, then, Mr. M. J. Foster's ideal State: it has, in the common acceptation of the term, no established church, but "the State and its sphere exist for the sake of, and to serve the interests of, the church." This is just what Mr. Foster says should be, and it is just the condition of affairs which lie would like to see in this country.
