# Correct Principles Stated.

It is contrary to the teachings of Christ, as well as treasonable to free government, to legislate at all with regard to the Sabbath or any other religious institution, whether spurious or genuine. People differ in opinion on religious subjects, and each has a right to enjoy and be protected in the exercise and expression of his views. Those who believe it to be their duty to observe Sunday as a day of sacred obligation, whether in recognition of the authority of the Creator or that of the pope, have a perfect right to do so, and are accountable to God alone in the matter; but those who believe it to be their duty to accept the Bible as the only rule of faith and practice, and to “remember the Sabbath-day to keep it holy,” according to the Creator’s specific direction, and for the reason he has given, have an equally valid right to similar protection in the enjoyment, exercise, and expression of their views, and neither has any right, either moral or civil, to interfere with the other. If the activities of the Sunday observer may not legally be restrained on the seventh day in recognition of a belief in its sanctity by one class of citizens, then the activities of the seventh-day observer may not legally be restrained on Sunday in recognition of a belief in its sanctity by another class of citizens. Neither may the activities of the nonobserver legally be restrained on either day, because his rights are involved equally with the others, and he is equally with them amenable to God.

If a man is irreligious, Christians are commissioned to preach the gospel to him, and, as embassadors of Christ, to persuade and beseech him to repent; they are instructed to pray for him, and are commanded to treat him in all respects as they would wish to be treated, but they have no authority to judge and punish him for sin against God, nor to compel him to act as if he were a Christian when he is not one. Majorities should rule in all matters which may properly be submitted to their action, but the rights of minorities must always be protected by constitutional limitation of the power of majorities, and our Constitution wisely withholds from Congress the power to enact any religious legislation, because such legislation would inevitably violate the rights of conscience. Let every man who believes in free government upon the basis proclaimed in the Declaration of Independence, no longer remain inactive. Let no Christian who loves the Lord with all his heart, and his neighbor as himself, longer remain silent. It is time that all should recognize the fact that this National Reform-Sunday-enforcement scheme is a revival of papal ideas, using papal methods to compel governmental recognition and enforcement of Sunday, and that a confederacy of nominal Christians, claiming to represent all the Protestant Evangelical [364] denominations, but who are so utterly destitute of the Spirit of Christ, and so entirely controlled by lust for civil power to persecute those who differ from them, that they openly court alliance with Rome and brazenly avow their treasonable and wicked intentions. It is time that every conscientious person should study carefully the relations of civil government and religion, and be prepared to defend these inseparable gems of gospel truth—human equality in civil matters and individual accountability to God alone, morally.—*Ira D. Blanchard, in Western American, Chicago.*
