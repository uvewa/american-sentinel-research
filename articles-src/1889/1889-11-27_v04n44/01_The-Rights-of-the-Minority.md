# The Rights of the Minority.

[This article, which we take from the *Light of Home* (Seventh-day Baptist), is worthy of a careful reading. It is a just criticism upon Mr. Crafts’ position as stated in his book, “The Sabbath for Man.” The writer has, however, made a mistake in not showing that the State has no right to require anybody, either Christian or infidel, to keep any day whatever.]

The advocates of Sunday legislation are compelled to “talk both ways,” whenever the ques- of proscription, or the rights of the minority, are under consideration. On the one hand, they loudly assert that they do not seek legislation in favor of Sunday as a religious institution, nor do they intend to infringe upon the conscientious rights of those who observe the seventh day; that they believe in the largest religious liberty, etc. Thus they assert, when confronting those who oppose their plans and purposes. On the other hand, when left to state their position entire, they lay down a program which, though mildly worded, has in it the essential elements of medieval persecution. For example: Dr. Crafts, field secretary of the American Sabbath Union, in his “The Sabbath for Man,” extracts from which appear in *Monthly Document,* No. 2, of the publications of that Union, asserts that Sunday laws are consistent with liberty, opening his discussion with the following paragraph:—

> “Sabbath laws are consistent with liberty in the same way as other laws for the protection of institutions deemed, by the majority of the people, important to the welfare of society, such as the setting apart of the fourth of July and the twenty-second of February for the culture of patriotism.”

That is sheer sophistry. The laws which make these national holidays do not compel abstinence from labor, business, or recreation; they specially encourage the latter. Turning to the Jews, Mr. Crafts treats his readers to the following:—

> “But how is it consistent with liberty that those whose religion requires them to rest on the seventh day should be compelled by law to give up public business and public amusements on the first day also?

> “The case of Jewish immigrants is not as difficult as many have thought. Every Jew who determines to come to Great Britain or the United States knows, or might know, that while his religion forbids him to do business on the seventh day, the laws of the countries to which he proposes to go, forbid the same on the first day. If he cannot do more business in five days in Great Britain or in the United States than in six days elsewhere, he is free to remain elsewhere. If when he has come into Great Britain or the United States he finds, by experiment, that ‘a conscientious Jew cannot make a living,’ the world is all before him to choose where he will dwell. Jews seem to forget that their Mosaic laws compelled not only native Israelites to rest on the seventh day, but also their servants, native or foreign, and ‘the stranger within their gates.’ It is passing strange that a people whose ancient law compelled the Gentile worshipers of the sun, who happened then to be in Palestine, although they kept the first day of the week for their worship, to rest on the seventh day also, out of respect to the prevailing religion, should object to Great Britain and the United States following the example of their fathers, only making the rule work the other way.”
If this enunciation of the doctrine of religious liberty, by the apostle of modern Sunday legislation, be analyzed, the following elements appear:

1. The religious convictions of the Jew deserve no recognition at the hands of the civil law. If he is bigoted enough to rest on Saturday because God commands him to do so, let him take his chances amid the bustle of the world’s business, and get rest, and attain worship if he can, surrounded by the roar of Saturday’s hubbub. Since they are in the minority, the civil law can make no recognition of their rights to protection in the matter of rest and worship. On the other hand, those who thus place the Jews outside the protection of the law, as to their religious convictions, insist that all others, Jews and non-Christians alike, must be compelled to remain quiet on Sunday, lest they disturb those who desire to observe the day religiously. Here then is the first glaring inconsistency in Mr. Crafts’ position, viz., that the *conscience of the majority* only is to be recognized by civil law. Injustice and illiberality are further shown in the statement that—

> “Every Jew who desires to come to Great Britain or the United States, knows, or might know, that while his religion forbids him to do business on the seventh day, the laws of the country to which he proposes to go, forbid the same on the first day. If he cannot do more business in five days in Great Britain or the United States than he can in six days elsewhere, he is free to remain elsewhere. The world is all before him to choose where he will dwell.”

Narrow bigotry could scarcely go further than this statement. It says to the Jew, If you desire to live in Great Britain or the United States, you can do so, under the penalty of having your religious conviction concerning the Sabbath disregarded, and being compelled to obey man in the observance of Sunday, after you have obeyed God in observing the Sabbath. If you do not like that state of things, the world is before you; go where you will. The bitter prejudice born of Roman paganism has evidently been transferred to the writer of this *Monthly Document,* No. 2, in no small degree.

Still further does Mr. Crafts attempt argument by claiming that, under the Jewish theocracy, “the Gentile worshipers of the sun, who happened to be in Palestine, although they kept the first day of the week for worship [were compelled] to rest on the seventh also,” and therefore the Jews in the United States ought not to complain if they are compelled to keep Sunday. That is illiberalism worthy of Russian despotism. To make legislations concerning religious liberty [362] which were necessary when the Jews were surrounded by most corrupting forms of heathenism, the standard by which to determine the application of the same principles under a Christian republic, is a step backward, worthy of the darkest period of the middle ages. According to this document, might is right in religious matters. And while the writer insists, in another part of the same document, that the law has no right “to enforce upon anyone the religious features of the day,” he here assumes that the first religious features of the day, viz., cessation from *secular business,* must be enforced, even upon those who conscientiously regard another day. Mr. Crafts’ illiberalism does not stop with the Jews. Christians who observe the Sabbath are placed in the same category, and their rights are openly ignored in a similar way.

Witness the following:—

> “The one or two very small sects of Christians who worship on Saturday, holding, as they do, that the observance of one day in seven for rest and worship is necessary for personal and political self-preservation by a law of God as old as the race, are not less inconsistent than the Jews in seeking to break down such an observance in all who will not observe the day which their method of Bible interpretation has pointed out. The tendency of legislatures and executive officers toward those who claim to keep a Saturday-Sabbath, is to overleniency rather than overstrictness. For instance, the laws of Rhode Island allow Seventhday Baptists, by special exception, to carry on public industries on the first day of the week in Hopkinton and Westerly, in each of which places they form about one-fourth of the population. This localoption method of Sabbath legislation, after the fashion of Rhode Island or Louisiana, if generally adopted, would make not only each State, but the nation also, a town heap, some places having two half-Sabbaths, as at Westerly, some having no Sabbath, as at New Orleans, to the great confusion and injury of interstate commerce, and even of local industry. Infinitely less harm is done by the usual policy, the only constitutional or sensible one, to let the insignificantly small minority of less than one in a hundred, whose religious convictions require them to rest on Saturday (unless their work is of a private character such as the law allows them to do on Sunday), suffer the loss of one day’s wages rather than have the other ninety-nine suffer by the wrecking of their Sabbath by public business.”

Here it is asserted that the tendency of civil government toward Seventh-day Baptists is to “overleniency” rather than to overstrictness, and because, in two townships in the State of Rhode Island, Seventh-day Baptists are permitted to carry on public business on the first day of the week, Dr. Crafts apprehends great danger to the interests of the nation, lest by an extension of this policy the nation will become a “town heap, some places having two Sabbaths, as at Westerly, some having no Sabbath, as at New Orleans, to the great confusion and injury of interstate commerce and even of local industry.” In view of such an appalling danger to the nation, he declares that it is infinitely less harmful “that the insignificantly small minority of less than one in a hundred” should “suffer the loss of one day’s wages rather than for the other ninety- nine to suffer by the destruction of Sunday.” How terribly dangerous to the welfare of the nation this insignificantly small minority of “less than one in a hundred” is! How evident it is that the permission granted to the Seventh-day Baptists in Hopkinton and Westerly has produced widespread Sabbathlessness in the United States. True, few people knew anything about Hopkinton or Westerly until the appearance of Dr. Crafts’ book. But who can fail to see that Sunday trains, Sunday newspapers, the crowds at Coney Island, the riotings in the beer-gardens of Cincinnati, the theater-going which abounds in New Orleans, and the bull-fights in Spanish Mexico, have arisen directly from the influence of this “local-option” method of permitting the Seventh-day Baptists, in two towns in the State of Rhode Island, to enjoy their God-given rights under the civil law? Where is the school-boy who is not able to trace the under-ground currents by which the baneful influence of these Rhode Island Seventh-day Baptists (for they have been there for more than two hundred years), has crossed the continent, passed under the Rockies, and brought about the repeal of the “California Sunday law.” How is it possible not to see, on the other hand, that if the “insignificantly small minority” of Seventh-day Baptists, Seventh-day Adventists, and Jews, were wholly deprived of their civil rights, so far as the Sabbath is concerned, and were compelled to fold their hands in idleness on Sunday, all interstate commerce on Sunday would cease, the enormous issue of the Sunday newspaper would soon be a thing of the past, and universal quiet, peace, and religious worship would obtain, “where’er the sun doth his successive journeys run.”

While there is no other way to meet such bigotry as is set forth in Mr. Crafts’ utterances, the brush of sarcasm is yet not sufficient to paint the medieval bigotry which is contained in his high- sounding sentences. If the principle enunciated by him, that the majority alone is to be protected as to conscience, were enforced, the scene would change at once, and the comparatively few who now seek religious services on Sunday, would be compelled to desist therefrom, lest their expression of religious regard might throw too somber a shade over the jollity and pleasure seeking of the masses.

Every effort to sustain the position set forth in this *Document,* No. 2, reveals the fact that the just province of the civil law is to grant uniform protection to all worshipers, at any time, and on any day when they seek rest and worship. On no other ground can the doctrine of religious liberty be sustained. The fact that the great evils complained of in connection with Sunday desecration exist, wholly independent from, and beyond the influence of, the Christians who keep the Sabbath, and ask the privilege of treating Sunday as an ordinary secular day, destroys all foundation for the assertions that if Sabbathkeepers be granted their constitutional rights, injury will accrue to the commonwealth. Worst of all, this sneering at the “insignificant minority” is the language of bigotry and tyranny. It shames this century of Protestant history.

The *Christian Commonwealth* of July 25 relates that the Moslem preacher of Liverpool publicly rebuked the Prince of Wales for teaching the Shah of Persia to gamble. He had never known the vice till it was taught him by a so- called Christian prince. The above journal says:

> “It seems to us extremely disgraceful that just at the time when the Church of England is waking up to the enormity of this vice, and is becoming sensible of the extent of its spread, the future head of that church should be teaching a Mohammedan how to add another vice to the list of those which he habitually practices.”

And this shows the beauty of an established religion. According to law the Prince of Wales, should he become king of England, would be the head of the Established Church; but law can never make Christians.—*Signs of the Times.*
