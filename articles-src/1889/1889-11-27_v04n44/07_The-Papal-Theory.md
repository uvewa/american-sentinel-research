# The Papal Theory.

[This article, taken from the “Progress of Religious Freedom,” by Dr. Schaff, is of special interest just now in view of the professions of attachment to the principles of our government recently made by the Catholic Congress in Baltimore. The evidence is conclusive that the Romanist who is really attached to our free institutions feels that attachment, not because he is a Catholic, but in spite of that fact, for the utterances of the popes and the traditions of “the church” are all against liberty of conscience or of worship.]

The principle of intolerance is held by the Roman Church to this day. She claims the monopoly of Christian truth, and can tolerate no departure from it, but will punish it to the extent of her power. Liberal Catholics, in obedience to the better spirit of the age and the charitable instincts of the human heart, disown persecution and all civil punishments of spiritual offenses, as belonging to a by-gone age and inconsistent with the modern structure of society. But the official Roman Church does not and cannot give up the theory of intolerance without forfeiting her claim to infallibility. Every progress in favor of toleration and liberty during the last three centuries has been made in spite of her, and against her express protest. She has repeatedly denounced toleration and reasserted the principle of intolerance, which implies persecution under favorable circumstances. And these declarations proceed from the highest seat of authority, whose decisions the Vatican Council of 1870 has made infallible and irrevocable.

Pope Gregory XVI., in an Encyclical of August 15, 1832, identifies religious toleration with the liberty of error and indifferentism, and condemns it as “the most fruitful cause of evils with which the church is at present afflicted,” and goes on to say: “From this noxious fountain of indifferentism flows that absurd and erroneous opinion, or, rather, that form of madness, which declares that liberty of conscience should be arrested and maintained for everyone. For this most pestilential error, that full and immoderate liberty of opinion paves the way which, to the injury of sacred and civil government, is now spread far and wide, and which some, with the utmost impudence, have extolled as beneficial to religion.”

The Papal Syllabus of 1864, issued by Pius IX., the first infallible pope, condemns among the eighty errors of the age the following propositions, which are among the fundamental principles of the government of the United States:—

> “Every man is free to embrace and profess the religion which he believes to be true according to the light of reason.” Sec. 3, 15.

> “The Church ought to be separated from the State, and the State from the Church.” Sec. 6, 55.
> “In the present day, it is no longer expedient that the Catholic religion shall be held as the only religion of the State, to the exclusion of all other modes of worship.” Sec. 10, 78.
The Encyclical “I*mmortale Dei”* of Pope Leo XIII., concerning the “Christian constitution of States,” issued November 1, 1885, is a moderate and prudent explanation, but not a retraction, of the doctrine of his predecessors; it expressly and approvingly refers to the Encyclical of Gregory XVI., of August 15, 1832, and to the Syllabus of Pius IX., and adds: “From these decisions of the popes it is clearly to be understood that. . . it is a crime of private individuals and a crime for States to make no account of the duties of religion, or *to treat different kinds of religion in the same way. . . *. The church judges it not lawful that the various kinds of divine worship should have the same right as the true religion.”

In a more recent Encyclical, “L*ibertas prœstantissimum naturœ donum,”* issued June 20, 1888, the same pope—one of the wisest, most moderate, and most liberal of modern times— reiterates the same doctrine even more strongly. He begins by praising liberty as the most excellent gift of nature, which belongs only to intellectual or rational beings, but he makes true liberty to consist in submission to the will of God, as expressed in an infallible church with an infallible head. He expressly condemns what he calls the modern liberties, (1) of worship, (2) of speech and of the press, (3) of teaching, and (4) of conscience, because they tacitly assume the absence of truth aS the law of our reason, and of authority as the law of our will. He first caricatures or misstates the liberal theory, which he seems to know only in the form of infidel radicalism, and then denounces it. In the same document he incidentally calls the separation of Church and State a “pernicious maxim.” And he concludes: “From what has been said, it follows that it is in no way lawful to demand, to defend, or to grant promiscuous freedom of thought, of speech, of writing, or of religion, as if they were so many rights which nature had given to man.”

Cardinal Manning, in a preface to the English translation of this Encyclical, fully approves of these sentiments, and predicts that “the pontificate of Leo XIII. will be known in history at the time when, upon a world torn and tossed by antichristian and antisocial revolutions, the abundant seeds of divine truth sown broadcast, revived the conscience of Christendom.” He also predicts that the two Encyclical Letters to which we referred “will be recorded as the pronouncements which have vindicated the political order of society from confusion, and the liberty of men from the license of liberalism.” But we venture to say that Pope Pius IX. and Pope Leo XIII. have seriously injured the cause of the Roman Church by placing her in open antagonism to the irresistible progress of history, which is a progress of liberty. By declaring the separation of Church and State a “pernicious maxim,” Leo XIII. has unwisely as well as unjustly condemned the Constitution of the United States, which makes such separation the law of the land, not from indifference or hostility to religion, but from respect for religion, and which secures to the Roman Catholic Church a greater amount of liberty and prosperity than she enjoys in Italy or Spain or Austria or France or Mexico or Brazil. The highest American dignitary of that church, Cardinal Gibbons, of Baltimore, who attended the centennial celebration of the Constitution at Philadelphia, September, 1887, said in his letter of acceptance: “The Constitution of the United States is worthy of being written in letters of gold. It is a charter by which the liberties of sixty millions of people are secured, and by which, under Providence, the temporal happiness of countless millions yet unborn will be perpetuated.” The same cardinal, in a communication to the New York *Independent* of November 29, 1888, thus eulogizes the condition of this free country as compared with others: [366] “Assuredly we have many reasons to praise ‘the Giver of all good gifts’ for the blessings we enjoy as a nation and as individuals. We are in profound peace, while other nations are preparing for war. We are enjoying unexampled prosperity, while other people are struggling for the means of subsistence. Above all, we possess the luxury of liberty tempered by law and justice, while other races are bound by the yoke of tyranny.”

The logic (granting the Romish premises) is on the side of the pope, but the facts are on the side of the cardinal. The facts ought to rectify the logic, not *vice versa;* for facts are stubborn and cannot be undone.
