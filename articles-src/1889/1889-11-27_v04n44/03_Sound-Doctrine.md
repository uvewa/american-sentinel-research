# Sound Doctrine.

There has been a great hurrah made during the past few days over the agitation of the Sunday-Rest movement. . . . Perhaps it would be well in the midst of this agitation to pause and inquire who is back of this movement, and what its real object is. The people at large have never made a demand for a law of this kind, and no complaint has ever been heard because of the absence of such a law, from anyone except a few religious fanatics. These are the people that are back of this movement, and their object is not so much to give the poor workingman a rest as to close every avenue of recreation and amusement and give the church a monopoly of Sunday entertainments. They are making the first effort for a union of Church and State, and their next one will be to introduce God into the Constitution, which is already planned.

This movement, under the thin disguise of making Sunday a day of rest for laboring people, is an outrage and an imposition which a purely secular government like ours should never tolerate for a moment, and never will if the people awake to their danger. We have seen the effect of Sunday laws and religious tyranny in the past, and the Puritan Sunday is something we don’t wish to revive. We don’t want such restrictions placed on us as our ancestors had, or any laws enacted like the following from the blue laws of Connecticut:—

> “No man shall run on the Sabbath, or walk in his garden, or elsewhere, excepting to and from meeting.

> “No woman shall kiss her child on the Sabbath or fasting-day.
> “No one shall travel, make beds, sweep houses, cut hair, or shave, on the Sabbath-day, etc., etc.”
These are laws we don’t want resurrected, but the Blair bill is a long step in that direction, and the warning cannot be sounded too soon or too loud. “Let Church and State be forever separate,” said General Grant, and every student of history knows the evil effects of their union. With countless religious sects at war with each other, and unable to harmonize on creeds and systems, it does not need remarkable perspicuity to perceive the total unfitness of the religious element in politics. There is no law in existence which prevents a man from keeping the Sabbath and worshiping God as he sees fit, and while there isn’t it would seem that religious people have all the rights and privileges they need, and no Sunday laws are needed, unless they desire to restrain and coerce those who differ from them in their religious views.

While perfect freedom exists for a man to attend church or remain away, and stringent laws are in force against disturbing any religious assembly while at worship, I for one see no need of other Sunday laws. While religious people are protected in their rights and no restraints are placed upon them, every non-religionist under a purely secular government should have equal freedom to conduct himself as his conscience directs and approves. To say that a man shall not work on Sunday if he so desires, and that he shall “engage in no play, game, amusement, or recreation,” is an unjust infringement on his natural rights.

Let this government enact such a law on any other day than Sunday, and a protest would go up from millions against it. Now, if Church and State are separate and intended to remain so, why is a religious day chosen in the enaction of such a law?

The moment Sunday legislation is made to restrict in any manner the rights of the people, that moment there is a virtual union of Church and State, and I for one rise to protest long and loud against it.

Says Mr. Crafts: “The right arm of the American Sabbath Union is the promotion of the religious Sabbath. These two things—the Christian Sabbath on the one hand and the American Sabbath on the other hand, are as distinct as my two arms, that resemble and co-operate, and yet by no means the same. This distinction is itself an answer to the objections to Sunday laws.” Let us dissect this delusion. What does a secular government know or care about a Christian Sabbath? And what better is a civil Sabbath than a civil Saturday? Does a secular government know any distinction?—No! Then to legislate for the preservation of enforced rest on Sunday, is to exceed the authority of the Constitution on which the government rests. This cannot be successfully denied or disproven, and if a Sunday law is passed the strong arm of the secular government, instead of the power of the American Sabbath Union, will be used to enforce it. We have laws establishing legal holidays, but no penalty is prescribed for a failure to keep such days, and one can work or play as conditions or inclinations lead, without being punished, but on Sunday the proposed law will inflict penalties for a failure to refrain from work or recreation. Again I say this is a virtual union of Church and State, and it is time that every man who loves his liberty was awake to the dangers that lurk in the movement just inaugurated in our city, but actively at work all over our country.— *Channing Severance, in Los Angeles Tribune, September 5, 1889.*
