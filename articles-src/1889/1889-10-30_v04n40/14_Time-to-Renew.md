# Time to Renew.

Quite a number of subscriptions to the American Sentinel expire during the months of November and December. Please look at the date on the address label opposite your name, and if your time has expired, or is about to expire, *please renew at once* and thus avoid missing any numbers. Price, $1.00 per year. If you will send us four *new* subscribers at $1.00 each, we will send *you* the Sentinel for one year *free*. Now is the time to work. Are you ready? [329]
