# Look Not to Civil Laws.

The "Sunday observance" movement inaugurated last Sunday evening in this city, bids fair to bring in contact the positive and negative opinions of a common people, and to bring upon true Christianity an influence more antagonistic and baneful than infidelity itself. It has been clearly demonstrated that no amount of law can compel a change of convictions firmly imbedded in the mind of the average American. If moral suasion and precept has no influence on his habits, which are not against the laws of the land, to use coercion would be fatal to any possibility of success, and engender the most radical views and influence in the opposite extreme. "Christians" will do well to remember that their fight in this matter is not conducted against ignorant and superstitious foreigners, but against an intelligent and comparatively well-educated people—a people capable of forming an opinion based upon sound sense and justice, and who will not permit dictation from an egotistical and warped minority.

The element conspicuous in this movement are favored by wealth, position, or business, and can go to the beach on week-days, or can afford to remain there during the entire season. They do not lose their position or the pay for a day while there, as do those who may go Sunday and against whom they declare war. A man's right, moral and physical, to go about on Sunday, cannot be successfully combated. Any religious movement to suppress an inherent right in the non-church-goer will not meet defeat, but will bring about legislation in retaliation detrimental to the church and its interests and from which it will never recover.

Custom has favored Sunday as a day for religious observance, but there is no biblical law for it, nor is there anything said relative to its observance, as many would have us suppose.

> "Christians" declare that Sunday is a day of rest and quiet; yet they raise more bedlam by the clanging of their bells from five to eleven o'clock in the morning, and by their bass drum parades, than do all the people who visit the beaches and whom they have disturbed from their sleep on the only morning in the week in which they are able to rest, and virtually driven them from home to escape from their noise and confusion.

> "Brethren," attend to your legitimate business; continue your work of Christianity as your Master began it, and when you begin to feel that you require aid from the civil authorities, know that your faith has weakened and that there is something radically defective in your own composition and with your personal religion.—*A. G. J., in Los Angeles Tribune, Sept. 5.*
