The *Christian Standard* (Cincinnati) criticises the so-called American Sabbath Union thus:—

> "It is unfortunate that so respectable an association, organized for the very laudable aim of securing proper Sunday observance, should have adopted a name suggestive of something both theologically and historically obsolete. It will be impossible to establish proper Sunday observance in the name or interest of Sabbatarianism, and the Union starts out heavily handicapped by its very title. Outsiders will be opposed to any Sunday legislation which is suspected of being urged in the interest of religion; while thousands of sincere Christians know that calling Sunday 'the holy Sabbath ' has no warrant whatever from Christ or his apostles.

> "There is nothing in the letter or spirit of Christianity which makes any honorable labor or innocent recreation of *any* day a sin for a Christian, or improper for an outsider. But since custom and law have united to set apart the first day of the week as a day of rest from secular employments, and since a weekly rest of this sort is good for man and beast— especially for the poor—both Christians and philanthropists may and can, might and could, unite to secure legislation and organize a public sentiment which shall enforce such an observance of Sunday as will promote all good interests. It will never be done, however, by a 'Sabbath' Union, or 'Sabbath' Association, or 'Sabbath ' anything else. It is too suggestive of church interference with matters of State, and all sorts of suspicions will scent something."

It is somewhat significant that the *Standard *does not express the opinion that "Christians and philanthropists" *should* unite in a demand for Sunday laws. Nobody doubts that they "can, might, and could," but the question is, Is it right for them to do it? We think not.
