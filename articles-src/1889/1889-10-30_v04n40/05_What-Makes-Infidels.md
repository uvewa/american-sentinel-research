# What Makes Infidels.

We fully believe the statement of the apostle, that the "carnal [or natural] mind is enmity against God," but it is nevertheless true that very many who might otherwise be converted, are led to the utter rejection of the gospel by the crimes against justice which are perpetrated in the name of Christianity. Infidelity fattens upon just such injustice and devilish wickedness as that related as follows in *Fair Play,* Valley Falls, Kansas, of a case of persecution under the Georgia Sunday law:—

> "The father is in the chain-gang. He had the audacity to insult Rev. Illiterate by digging a ditch to carry off the foul water from his cellar instead of attending church on Sunday. On Monday he was arrested on complaint of the offended Sunday monopolizer, tried before a superstition-saturated magistrate, and sentenced to a year's companionship with thieves and assaulters. There is no mercy for him. He is poor and so can get no justice or favor. In vain his wife intercedes for him, in vain his children cling to papa's knees as he is driven away in disgrace. Christianity is the State religion.

> "The poor mother must now toil alone to support her little ones. She can do no extra work, nor can she pay others to do it. The slime in the cellar breeds foul miasma. Sickness comes as the sequel of the violation of natural law. The little golden-haired Jessie is laid low with fever. There is no money to get the doctor, and the distracted, overworked mother can do but little. The days drag on; the malaria- tainted blood courses in fluctuating currents through the burning body of the little sufferer; she cries piteously for 'papa,' 'papa,' and stretches her tiny hands pleadingly forth, but, woe the crimes of Christian men, he comes not, he hears not his darling's plaintive call. He sweats and groans under the lash of the heartless task-master beneath the August sun. He has wronged no man nor woman nor child, and yet his limbs wear the manacles of the felon-slave, and his baby daughter's lisping lips must close in death without the chrism of the father's kiss; the once sparkling eyes must fade into oblivion unblessed by the sight of 'papa's ' worshiped face.
> "A fresh little grave on the hill-side, above which the crow caws ominously. A heart-broken mother who sits among her other and half-famished children in the cheerless home. An iron-weighted father who starts fitfully and murmurs brokenly in his convict's sleep upon the wet, cold ground.
> "A sleek dragoon of the church who sits in his comfortable room and. . . rubs his hands in gleeful satisfaction as his imagination pictures John Clark chained in the convict camp, and he thinks how closely he and his parishioners are following in the footsteps of the 'chosen people.'
> "Here in his Northern home Rev. M. A. Gault reads of this Southern murder for the church's sake, and grimly smiles as he confidentially whispers in the ear of Wilbur F. Crafts:—
> *"' Just wait until we get the Blair bill through and many a profaner of the Sabbath on these prairies and in these valleys shall, as does John Clark, of Georgia, feel the chastening hand of the Lord's anointed. *We are the Lord's anointed.'"

And who can wonder that infidels multiply, or blame men for being infidels, when such outrages are perpetrated in the name of Christianity?
