# Avoiding the Appearance of Church and State.

Mrs. Bateham, the representative of the National Woman's Christian Union before the Senate Committee, in the hearing on the Sunday- Rest bill, said that it was the desire of that organization, that "promote" in the title of the bill should be changed to "protect." This was asked, she said, "so that it should have no appearance of what all Americans object to, any union of Church and State."

It seems to be the motto of every organization that is working for a Sunday law, to avoid all appearances of their real object. The National Reform Association, and all who affiliate with them, know that every true American is opposed to any union of Church and State, and if the real inwardness of their movement should come to the surface, their object would be defeated. So of course they must deny all charges of working to unite the Church with the State. They say, "We are opposed to any union of Church and State." How are they opposed?

In this way: They do not design that any one denomination shall make use of the civil power to further its own sectarian aims, or have them favored in any way by it; but they are in favor of a union of the churches on what they claim to be the fundamental principles of religion, or Christianity, and in favor of a union of this union with the State. In other words, they are in favor of the union of *Churches* and the State.

In order to successfully disguise designs they claim that they only wish to enact a Sunday law on civil grounds, and that more as a sanitary regulation than for any other purpose. They very well know that if they should plead for it to be enforced as a religious institution, the whole scheme would be defeated, for the people are radically opposed to such legislation. But everyone who is working for the Sunday law from a civil standpoint, ought to know that the Sunday is an ecclesiastical institution, and that to enforce an ecclesiastical institution by civil power is a union of Church and State, whether it be done to "promote," or "protect," the observance of the day as a day of religious worship or not.

Every little while this National Reform wolf, clothed in sheep-skin, is disclosed to those who are watching the movement. In a paper before the Senate hearing entitled, "The Relation of Sunday Amusements to Sunday Work," Mr. Crafts said: "Casting out religion from the Sabbath they cast out rest." Now if they want Sunday enforced as a day of physical rest, and cannot get the rest without religion, and have to call on the civil power to enforce the rest, what else is it but the State enforcing religion by law? And what would you call that but a union of Church and State? E. Hilliard.
