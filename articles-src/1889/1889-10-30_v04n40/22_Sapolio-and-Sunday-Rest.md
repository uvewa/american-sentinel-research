Possibly we are too sanguine, but a recent advertisement which appeared in an Eastern religious journal has suggested to us a new solution of the much-vexed Sunday-rest question. Those who are foremost in agitating for a national Sabbath law claim that what they want is a general Sunday rest. Now as the advertisement to which we refer says that "Sapolio used every week-day gives rest on Sunday," it might not be amiss for the American Sabbath Union, National Reform Association, *et al.,* to do a little missionary work with this wonderful cleansing compound. It could certainly do no harm to try it, and if the experiment should prove successful they would not be under the necessity of again troubling Congress about the matter.
