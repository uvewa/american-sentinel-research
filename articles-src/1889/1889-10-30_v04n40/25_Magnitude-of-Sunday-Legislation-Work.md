Some idea of the magnitude of the work done during the past few months in the interests of Sunday legislation may be gathered from the following item of news, which we take from the *Cynosure:—*

> "Rev. Wilbur F. Crafts, field secretary of the American Sabbath Union, has traversed thirty-four States and Territories in his transcontinental tour, lecturing in the chief cities and organizing Sabbath Associations and Sunday Closing Leagues in States, counties, and cities. Three years ago but two States were organized, namely, Maryland and New Jersey. There were also city organizations in Philadelphia, New York and Chicago. When the American Sabbath Union began its work at the opening of this year, there had been added to the list of organized States, Illinois, Iowa, Dakota, and Kentucky. The American Sabbath Union's field secretary has since assisted in organizing Ohio, Virginia, Missouri, Minnesota, Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, Washington, California, New Mexico, and Kansas, besides two county and ten city associations. He has also arranged conventions for organization in Louisiana, Arkansas, Wisconsin, Utah, Oregon, and Arizona, besides several counties."

The advocates of Sunday laws are terribly in earnest, and those who suppose that they are only a lot of "cranks," with no hopes or prospects of success, certainly have given the matter very little attention. Bigots many of them may be, but they are neither fools nor sluggards, and they mean to succeed.
