Rev. J. M. Foster, one of the district secretaries of the National Reform Association, has written a letter to the *Christian Nation* in which he attempts to justify the persecution of Seventhday Baptists and Seventh-day Adventists under color of the Arkansas Sunday law some three years ago. He says: "The old man and his son of seventeen whose horse was sold for $27, and the man whose young wife and child died while he was in prison, brought that evil on themselves by breaking the law." Certainly they did; and so did the Christians in the days of pagan and papal persecution bring all the trouble on themselves "by breaking the law." Is it any wonder that infidels abound when men professing to be ministers of Christ boldly defend such wicked cruelty in the name of religion? Secretary Foster and men of his ilk lack only the power to make them persecute as cruelly and as wickedly as did the Spanish Inquisitors.
