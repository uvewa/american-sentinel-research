A correspondent asks us to give the numerical strength of the National Reform Association, the American Sabbath Union, and the Woman's Christian Temperance Union. This we cannot do with any great accuracy. The so-called Sabbath Union "was," in the words of Senator Blair, "officially constituted by official action of the General Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church, the Home Missionary Society of the Baptist Church, the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church (North and South), and the Synod of the Reformed Church, five denominations, whose membership together is 5,977,693. The Woman's Christian Temperance Union numbered, a year ago, 185,521: but the number of National Reformers we cannot give; they are, however, included almost wholly in the American Sabbath Union. Of course it must be borne in mind that very many of the 5,977,693 persons belonging to the five denominations forming the American Sabbath Union, are under the age of twenty-one years.

Another fact to be remembered is that the members of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union are also very largely members of those five churches. Indeed, the real working strength of the three bodies, namely, the so-called Sabbath Union, the National Reform Association, and the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, is very much smaller than it appears to be; but the leaders are energetic, and are sparing neither time nor means to secure official recognition of Sunday by the general government.
