# An Un-American Movement.

Those well-meaning but narrow-minded people who are always troubling themselves by an undue interference with the business of their neighbors, are particularly active in the city at the present time. The point on which they are now expending their surplus energies is a Sunday law. It was very plainly demonstrated in 1882 that California does not want a Sunday law. The Democracy at that time swept the State on an antiSunday law platform, and rolled up a majority of tremendous proportions for General Stoneman.

In a series of resolutions passed last night, it is said that the lack of such a law is a shame to this State, and it is remarked that France is the only other State in the civilized world where no such law is in force. The position of California in this respect may be unique in this Federation of States; but if so then we are uniquely American. No principle is more broadly and solidly laid down by the founders of this government than the one which sought forever to decree an absolute divorce between Church and State. The principle carried out to its fairly logical results would forbid the passage of any law in regard to Sunday, beyond such provisions as will guarantee to all men the right to worship as they see fit; and that guarantee includes the right not to worship at all. This is the whole of the American principle in relation to religion. A dozen volumes of comment will add nothing to that simple statement, and no amount of argument will do away with one iota of the force of this germinal idea.

The work of Christianity by all the teachings of its founder, and by all the explications of its apostles, is a purely moral one. The church is work is upon the inside of a man, and must be done in his heart. The appeal to civil powers to aid in this has always proved to be the most fatal weakness of the churches. It is the appeal to the sword, which, Christ said, must prove fatal to him that makes it. It makes the kingdom to be of this world.

As to France, any American State may well be proud of being found in line with that progressive nation. France has always been the fecund mother of broad, of advanced, of humane principles. She is the only prominent State in Europe which has yet thrown off all sorts of Old World notions, of ties that fetter the human mind, heart, and conscience, and that, like our own great republic, proclaims the sovereignty of manhood as the sole basis of right to rule in human affairs. The divine rights of kings, the guarded privileges of birth, and other un- American ideas that are supreme in all European States, are dead and buried in France. Shall we go back to these? shall we undo the noble deeds of the fathers? shall we roll the centuries backward and align our laws with those of Russia and Austria because it is a shame to be in line with France? Well, hardly!

In the interest of religion, as the best thing for the churches, as the surest stay for the existence of the Christian Sunday, we say in all kindness and sincerity to these well-meaning but erring enthusiasts, Mind your own business. Attend duly to your own religious duties. Enjoy in peace your Sunday rest and other privileges. Trust to the good example of your lives, to the logic of your cause, to the power of the omnipotent God, to draw erring men to your side. Avoid all semblance of coercion or worldly influence to do this work. Let the people you think to be wrong spend their Sundays as they think best, if you wish to be unmolested in your rights. It is too late in the day to carry out your plans, and America has not the soil where your ideas will germinate and grow. Be content to be secure in your own rights, and give others the same rights as you enjoy.—*Los Angeles Herald.*
