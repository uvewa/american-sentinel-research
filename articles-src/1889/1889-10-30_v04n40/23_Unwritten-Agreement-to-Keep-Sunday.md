In a recent communication to the *Christian Statesman* one of the National Reform secretaries says:—

> "This country was settled by Christian men who believed in keeping the first day of the week as the Sabbath. It was by them incorporated in our civil institutions as a part of the common law of the land. Our Seventh-day brethren came here with this understanding. There was an unwritten agreement between them and this government when they came here that they would abstain from common labor on the first day of the week. It may be a cross for them, but they cannot charge us with oppressing their consciences. When they came they agreed to respect our consciences so far as to abstain from common labor on the Lord's day."

Then the Quakers and Baptists that were whipped and hanged in Massachusetts had no just cause of complaint. The Puritans came there and established their religion by law, and when the Quakers and Baptists came among them it was with the tacit understanding that they would obey the laws of the colony; when any violated the law, and thus the tacit agreement, they forfeited all their rights, and were properly punished. Do the National Reformers believe it? If not, why not? Such arguments would justify all the persecution which the world has ever seen. To see such things in a paper calling itself *Christian* is enough to make one feel that the history of the Dark Ages has been written in vain.
