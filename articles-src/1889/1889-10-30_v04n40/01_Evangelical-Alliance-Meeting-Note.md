As appears from the program, which we publish elsewhere, for the meeting of the Evangelical Alliance to be held in Boston early in December, considerable time is to be given to the discussion of the question of Sunday legislation. All of Thursday is, it seems, to be devoted to this subject, and if we mistake not, something will be said on the same subject on Wednesday and Friday evenings. We shall watch the proceedings of the Alliance with interest.
