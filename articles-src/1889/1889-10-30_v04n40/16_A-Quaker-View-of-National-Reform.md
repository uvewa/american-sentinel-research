# A Quaker View of National Reform.

As our readers are well aware, the Blair Sunday-Rest bill, and also the Blair resolution for the amendment to the Constitution, are dead; but the agitation which gave rise to them is not dead, hence the following article from *the Friends' Intelligencer and Journal* (Philadelphia) is not out of season, though written while these measures were still before Congress. We would commend the article especially to those who imagine that only infidels and liquor sellers oppose Sunday laws, and remind them that Friends are neither one nor the other, but very worthy Christian people. We print the article entire, as follows:—

> "Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty." Realizing the full force of this statement, and feeling that there is great need for the guardians of that priceless boon to mankind, "liberty of conscience," to be on the alert, we desire in as few words as possible to call the attention of Friends to a threatened danger.

A bill to regulate the strict observance of the first day of the week as the Sabbath-day, has been introduced into the United States Senate, by Senator Blair, and an effort is also being made to make it compulsory to teach "the principles of the Christian religion" in the public schools. This is to be accomplished by an amendment to the Constitution of the United States, the object being to make our nation "a Christian nation" by a union of the Church and State.

A petition, signed by a million and a half of names, urging the passage of the bill, has also been presented, and we are informed that the friends of this legislation are exceedingly active in its behalf. It is warmly advocated by men and women of high position and great influence, who, undoubtedly, have the welfare of the human race at heart; but, as is so often the case, their zeal has outrun their judgment, and one might almost say, their Christianity; for where the spirit of intoleration is, there the Spirit of Christ cannot dwell, neither is it with those who arrogate to themselves infallibility.

There are several religious sects who honestly believe (and who would uphold their belief with their lives), that it is required of them to observe the seventh day as the Sabbath-day. Now, shall these Christians, professing the name of Christ, obey the mandates of self-righteous men who presume to say, "This day shalt thou keep"? or shall they obey the "voice" within their own souls?

The advocates of this bill say, "Obey this law which we have made," and think by this means to build up a Christian nation.

Will any forced observance of moral law be accepted of God, or accounted unto the doer for righteousness? The temple was built of freewill offerings only. Can we raise up a nation of Christians by simply compelling an outward semblance of religion?

We might say, There is nothing to prevent anyone from keeping the seventh day if they want to do so, but we must remember that their pecuniary circumstances may not be such as to permit them to observe *both* days as days of rest.

Again, one might suppose that the clause, "to the disturbance of others," so limited the operation of the law as to render it less harmful; but when we remember the bitter persecution of Friends for acts in themselves quiet and peaceable, we cannot doubt that very many religious fanatics will be very easily disturbed by any observance of the day not strictly in accord with their views.

In regard to the other point, it would at first seem as though we could all unite on a willingness to have the *principles* of the Christian religion taught in the public schools. But who is to decide precisely what constitutes the essentials of the Christian religion or its principles?

The highest civil tribunal is the Supreme Court. Can that body decide the question so as to satisfy the Catholic and the Protestant, or even the various sects among the latter? An attempt to unite the Church and State has always proved disastrous. Turn back the pages of history and we shall find that the bloodiest wars that have stained our annals, were waged in support of religious belief. Recall what the early Friends suffered, comparatively a short time ago, in order to maintain "liberty of conscience."

The spirit of intolerance is only sleeping. Would we, as Friends, be satisfied to have any body of men decide what our children should be taught as "the Christian religion"? Many of the warmest advocates of these measures utter the most severe denunciations of all religions not in harmony with their own, showing a spirit that would crucify the Christ within their brother's soul, while professing to follow his voice speaking in their own. "Woe unto you, hypocrites!"

It was through the influence of a Friend that liberty of conscience was secured by the Constitution, and they have always stood foremost in the fight when it has been assailed, and we take this means of calling everyone to the duty of the hour, reminding one and all that "eternal vigilance is the price of liberty."

While using every effort to prevent the taking of this step in the wrong direction, we would not be understood as denouncing, personally, the author of the measure, or the signers of the petitions, or their motives; but even great and good men make very grave mistakes, and it is the duty of each one of us to guard with exceeding care this priceless gift of God unto the children of men, both from the attack of enemies and the harmful abuse of *overzealous* friends.

No one could be more desirous than we to see the day when Christ shall rule the world, but this proposed step is a retrograde movement, and when one of its supporters would say, "The government has the right to command the consciences of men," it is full time to call a halt.

This is the first step. The second will be to secure the erasure of the word *principles;* and the next, the insertion of the name of that religion holding the balance of power.

Ah, Friends, it would be impossible to fully comprehend the danger until we are caught within its toils.

May our Father in Heaven guide and protect us.
