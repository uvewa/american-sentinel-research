A letter from a friend now in Rome informs us that he has visited all the principal churches on Sunday, and was surprised to find but a few women and the priests and attendants present. He says that when the pope ruled they were crowded. In this connection we take from a Roman paper the words of a priest, giving evidence that the Roman machine has but little honor in its home. Father Phelan, of the St. Louis *Watchman,* writing from Rome, says:—

> "Three-fourths of the people of Rome do not go to church on Sunday. They are on a vacation. Under the popes they were not only obliged to go to church but had to go to holy communion once a year. . . . The old families are true to the core. The little shop-keepers talk of the 'good old days under the popes,' and wonder if they will ever return. Rome had 165,000 people under papal rule; now she has about 400,000. The majority of the present population is anti-papal."

It is not strange that Mr. Pecci is anxious to emigrate to some land where his corporation is doing business after the old style.—*Western American.*
