# Cardinal Gibbons Heard from Again.

In their blind zeal for a Sunday law the American Sunday Union and Woman's Christian Temperance Union cannot see that they are just playing into the hands of Rome. What a glorious victory they thought they had when Cardinal Gibbons indorsed their Sunday-Rest bill, and yet it was just what Pope Leo XIII. exhorted all his subjects to do in his Encyclical published in 1885. We will quote:—

> "All Catholics must make themselves felt as active elements in daily political life in the countries where they live. They must penetrate wherever possible in the administration of civil affairs; must constantly exert the utmost vigilance and energy to prevent the usage of liberty from going beyond the limits fixed by God's law. All Catholics should do all in their power to cause the constitutions of States and legislation to be modeled to the principles of the true church."

But says one, "What has this Sunday law to do with modeling legislation to the principles of the Catholic Church?" We answer, "Very much." Sunday as a day of rest is not based upon the law of God, and is purely a traditional observance, and an institution of the Roman Catholic Church. After having read a copy of Cardinal Gibbons' letter indorsing the Sunday- Rest bill, the writer wrote to the Cardinal in regard to his position on the Sunday institution and received the following reply:—

> Dear Mr. Franke: At the request of His Eminence the Cardinal, I write to assure you that you are correct in your assertion that Protestants in observing the Sunday are following, not the *Bible,* which they take as their only rule of action, but the *tradition* of the church. I defy them to point out to me the word *Sunday* in the Bible; if it is not to be found there, and it cannot be, then it is not the Bible which they follow in this particular instance, but tradition, and in this they flatly contradict themselves.

> The Catholic Church changed the day of rest from the last to the first day of the week, because the most memorable of Christ's works were accomplished on Sunday. It is needless for me to enter into any elaborate proof of the matter. They cannot prove their point from Scripture; therefore, if sincere, they must acknowledge that they draw their observance of the Sunday from tradition, and are therefore weekly contradicting themselves.

Yours very sincerely,

M. A. Reardon.

The reader will notice here that Cardinal Gibbons, in indorsing the Sunday-Rest bill, virtually consented to force Protestants to weekly contradict themselves, and was perfectly consistent with Pope Leo's Encyclical.

How is this, Brother Crafts? do you believe what Cardinal Gibbons and the 7,200,000 Catholics have to say? If not, why not?

We would suggest that the American Sunday Union pin a copy of this letter to the one received by Mr. Crafts indorsing the Rest bill, and keep it for reference.

Mrs. Bateham, and National Reformers, please make a note of this. E. E. Franke.
