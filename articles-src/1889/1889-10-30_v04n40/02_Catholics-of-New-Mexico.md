The Catholics of New Mexico are very indignant because the new State constitution provides that public schools be maintained on a nonsectarian basis. In other words, they have got the American-Sabbath-Union ideas of religious despotism, and accordingly want their Roman creed taught in the State schools to Protestants and unbelievers alike—they certainly don't mean by "sectarian" that Protestantism shall be taught. But why don't they wait until Blair's amendment to the U. S. Constitution carries. That will inaugurate the scheme on a legal basis, under which the children will be compelled to imbibe a corrupt State religion.—*Moral and Scientific Companion.*
