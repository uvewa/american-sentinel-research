# Romanizing the Public Schools-

Rev. J. R. Kendrick, D. D., has a very strong article in the *Forum,* strenuously opposing any concession whatever toward dividing the publicschool money and allowing Roman Catholics, or any other sects, any share to be used for sectarian purposes. He cites the case of Poughkeepsie, N. Y., where an arrangement was made, several years since, whereby, in certain school-houses, the Roman Catholics are allowed to give religious instruction out of regular school hours; and then follow these comments:—

There is one obvious test by which to try the Poughkeepsie plan. Is it suitable for general adoption? Is it a good working and workable theory for the country at large? Suppose the Jews, or the Methodists, or the Episcopalians of any community, were to erect and equip school buildings, and say to educational boards, “We offer you these on the simple condition that when you do not want them for your own special purposes we may use them as we please, reserving in particular the right in other than school hours to instruct all comers in our peculiar tenets,” what would be the result? Clearly, sectarian schools supported by the State; or, if not exactly these, ecclesiastical establishments engaged in sectarian propagandism maintained from the public treasury. Suppose a society of Comtists should do the same thing, only stipulating for the privilege of making their edifice a temple for the religion of humanity, would not the State, in accepting the offer, contribute direct aid and comfort to this class of philosophers? The tendency of the Poughkeepsie policy, if not its sure effect, would be to gather children in schools according to denominational affinities, and thus virtually establish the sectarian lines of division, which it is important to efface.

On the whole, it seems to me that this innocent-looking Poughkeepsie plan is a veritable Trojan horse. By its provisions, or almost necessary implications, Roman Catholics adroitly obtain what they clamor for—State support for sectarian education. This concession, however disguised and by whatever specious advantages recommended, would in the end prove fatal to our American public-school system.—*Congregationalist.*
