The *Silver Gate,* an excellent little paper published in San Diego, this State, and from which we have several times quoted, is no more, having given place to a seven-column quarto, the *San Diego County Reporter.* The former publisher has taken in two partners, thus forming the firm of Davis, Vestal & Peebles, editors and proprietors of the new paper. They announce that all patrons of the *Silver Gate* (subscribers and advertisers) will be served with the *Reporter* in future.

We wish the new paper success, and hope that it will be as sound on the question of the proper relation of Church and State as was its predecessor.
