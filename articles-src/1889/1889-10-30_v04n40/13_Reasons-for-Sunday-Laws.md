# Reasons for Sunday Laws.

*Mr. Q.*—Do you favor religious legislation?

*Mr. R.*—I do not, except upon the subject of the Sabbath. I believe the State should make and enforce Sunday laws.

*Mr. Q.*—Will you be so kind as to tell us why you would single out this particular point of religion and make it a subject of State legislation?

*Mr. R.*—Although Sunday is a religious institution. I do not regard a Sunday law as a law upon the subject of religion. The State only enforces it as a civil institution.

*Mr. Q.*—Will you please to tell us by what process of reasoning you can prove that labor on Sunday to be uncivil?

*Mr. R.*—Yes, sir. Common labor on Sunday disturbs the quiet of the day, and it is wrong.

*Mr. Q.*—Will you please to tell us whether Sunday is more quiet than other days in the week as far as nature itself is concerned?

*Mr. R.*—Of course it is not. But you know that Sunday is the day upon which people rest from their work and attend meeting.

*Mr. Q.*—But why do they choose this particular day for rest and worship?

*Mr. R.*—Because they believe the Scriptures require them to do so.

*Mr.* Q.—Do you think it is a religious duty that you owe to God to do this, or is it only a civil duty that you owe to the State?

*Mr. R.*—You have the advantage of me as you have given the subject more thought than I have. But if we had no Sunday law we could not hold religious service on Sunday at all.

*Mr. Q.*—Why could you not hold services even if some persons were at work?

*Mr. R.*—Because the noise that their labor would make would disturb us so we could not peaceably hold our meetings.

*Mr. Q.*—You say the *noise* would disturb your worship. I would ask you if the worshipers do not sing and the minister talk quite loud? Would you have the State make a law to prohibit this noise?

*Mr. R.*—No, sir, that *kind* of *noise* does not disturb us. That is an essential part of the worship.

*Mr. Q.*—Do you have family worship each day? If so would you have the State make a law to have all business stop a certain hour each day so people could have a quiet hour for family worship?

*Mr. R.*—The other days in the week are secular and of course *noise* on those days does not disturb us in our devotion.

*Mr. Q.*—Does your church hold protracted meetings some times in which you hold religious services every day in the week?

*Mr. R.*—Yes, sir. What of it?

*Mr. Q.*—Do you have everybody in the community cease all business while your protracted meetings continue?

*Mr. R.*—You have the advantage of me.

*Mr. Q.*—Then you see that the *noise* of common toil is not uncivil on any day of the week except on the day you think should be religiously observed. As you see this then, you can see that your objection to common labor on Sunday arises wholly from your religious convictions, and that all Sunday laws are religious laws and relate wholly to an establishment of religion.

*Mr. R.*—I may have been wrong in presenting the subject from the standpoint that I have. I see that I have been favoring a Sunday law wholly from a religious consideration, and that I was doing this because of the idea that the day is a sacred day.

*Mr. Q.*—I have observed the seventh day of the week as the Sabbath of the Lord for more than twenty-one years. During all this time I have gone to the house of worship regularly on that day, and yet I have never asked my neighbors to refrain from labor on that day because I went to worship on that day.

*Mr. Q.*—But there were so few of you.

*Mr. R.*—Yes, sir. We are not many, and because we are few, there is all the more people at work making a noise while we are at worship. Yet we keep the day to the Lord, and our worship is not disturbed, for we realize that we are rendering unto God the things which belong to God, and if others do not choose to do so it is none of our business.

We have often been puzzled to understand how it is that the conscience of a person can be so badly disturbed because he may happen to see or hear someone working on Sunday, and yet that same person makes no scruple about disturbing his neighbor who keeps another day, although he professes to observe the golden rule and love his neighbor as himself.

*Mr. R.*—I had not thought of the matter from that standpoint. I will give this subject more careful thought.

The Tucson *Star* says that Columbia “offers to pay the traveling expenses of everybody from here who will settle there, give him $6.00 a month, 250 acres of land, a cow, two pigs, a plow, and help him build a house.” Yet there was a bigger rush to Oklahoma in one day than in 365 days to Columbia. If Columbia would adopt our national Constitution just as it is, before the National Reformers get hold of it, offering the free exercise of religion, it would not take long to fill up her valleys. The human mind values liberty of conscience far above pigs and cows!—*Moral and Scientific Companion. *[327-328]

Note.—No papers are sent by the publishers of the American Sentinel to people who have not subscribed for it. If the Sentinel comes to one who has not subscribed for it, he may know that it is sent him by some friend, and that he will not be called upon by the publishers to pay for the same.

If you are about to write for this paper with a lead-pencil, please don’t. Use pen and ink and ruled paper; then avoid crowding. If you cannot act in harmony with these suggestions, do not be surprised if your matter is not printed. It may be, but the chances will be against it.

The Prohibitionists are displeased at Senator Blair, because, notwithstanding all his aforetime protestations of temperance principles, he remained away from the State during the recent campaign in New Hampshire, and did nothing for the proposed amendment. It seems that the W. C. T. U. has power to manipulate the Senator only in the direction of Sunday laws and other religio-political measures.

A convention was held recently in San Francisco to see what could be done toward organizing a movement in the interests of Sunday observance. Dr. R. H. McDonald, of San Francisco, and C. C. Clay and William Cubery, of Oakland, were appointed a committee to endeavor to raise $25,000 as a campaign fund. Just how the money is to be applied we have not seen stated. An effort is also being made to secure the services of W. F. Crafts to assist in the work in this State.

Ayer’s Newspaper Annual for 1889 is the finest and most complete directory of the kind which we have ever seen, and we do not believe that its equal has ever before been published. No newspaper office and no advertiser should be without it. It is not only a complete directory of every periodical of every kind published in the United States and Canada, but it gives the circulation of each, and the population of the town or city in which published. It contains 1,126 pages and sells for $5.00, carriage paid. For sale by the publishers, N. W. Ayer & Sons, Philadelphia, Pa.

A correspondent of the New York *Observer, *writing of the late Paris Sunday convention, says:—

> “The subject was treated chiefly from an economic and sanitary point of view, though the moral and religious advantages of Sabbath-keeping were not lost sight of. . . . The main resolutions, which were adopted after full discussion, favored the observance of the Sabbath by all companies and manufacturing establishments, as well as by private individuals, and urged that in cases where the business required continuous labor, arrangements should be made to allow all employes entire rest for one-seventh portion of time.”

Thus it seems that a rather more liberal spirit prevails in France in regard to Sunday than in our own country. Here the one great and all- absorbing object of Sunday-law advocates is to protect the day, while there it appears that a regular weekly rest is the great thing. Nevertheless, the day cannot be separated from the religious character which has been given to it, and legislation must touch it very lightly if it does not afford one class an opportunity to oppress another for failure to conform to their ideas of propriety upon that day.

The *Christian at Work* (New York) says:—

> “The rector of a church in this city announces that he has discontinued his usual Sunday evening services because of the invasion of the neighborhood by persons of vicious character, and he expects to be compelled to move the church away altogether. His respectable parishioners, he says, dare not bring their wives and daughters out after dark for fear of exposing them to contact with immoral women, if not to actual insult. He therefore gives up the struggle to maintain religious worship against this opposition, and will retire from the field as soon as he can find a more respectable location.”

We have never heard of such a case in this State, yet we have no Sunday law, while New York has.

The adjutant-general of Tennessee has issued an order forbidding competitive or exhibition drills on Sunday; commanding officers not to order out or to permit their commands to assemble for any duty or military maneuvering on Sunday, other than that permitted and required by the regulations while the forces are in camp under orders. The order is said to be issued by the direction of the governor.

The American Sabbath Union will doubtless point with great glee to this; but, unfortunately, it does not coincide with their declaration that the soldiers are demanding release from Sunday parades, for the soldiers are displeased with the order, Lieutenant Patterson saying that it is a severe blow to the military of Tennessee.

The New York *Examiner* (Baptist) says: “The Catholics will not listen for a moment to the Protestant proposition to give general instruction in morality in the schools without reference to any particular religious sect. This they claim to be impossible.” And again: “What the Romish Church wants is, in brief, her own way, and she will accept no compromise.” Here is a plum for the National Reformers and the American Sabbath Union, both of whom are catering for the assistance of the Catholics in the special schemes of the respective associations. Rome will no doubt unite with them when her way is clear to control the objects sought. We are glad this leading Baptist organ sees the situation; but the question arises, Will it and its denomination have the sagacity to keep clear of the meshes into which the Reformers and Sabbath Unionists are endeavoring to lead the Protestants of the country? “A prudent man foreseeth the evil and hideth himself, but the simple pass on, and are punished.”

The following is the Sunday plank from the Prohibition platform of the Massachusetts Prohibition convention:—

> *“Resolved,* That we hold the religious liberty of our people among its highest possessions, and that chief among the blessings to be secured are the rest and peace of the Sabbath.”

We find it somewhat difficult to classify this utterance. It is certainly one of two things, either the result of a compromise, or it is an exceedingly awkward attempt to make it appear that religious liberty demands the passage and enforcement of Sunday laws! But such laws do, in the very nature of the case, of necessity infringe religious liberty. Suppose that the Catholic Church say that it was an infringement of religious liberty? were to insist on the passage of a law forbidding labor on good Friday, would not every Protestant Certainly; but it would not be nearly so much so as is a Sunday law, for Good Friday occurs only once a year, while Sunday is a weekly festival, and it is just as much a religious institution as is Good Friday. They both belong to the church, and it is just as oppressive to enforce the observance of one as of the other.

The Spokane Falls *Review* says:—

> “Those well-meaning people who are going about the country circulating petitions to Congress not to pass the Blair Sunday bill are throwing away their time, and might as well tear up their documents and engage in other work. There is not the slightest probability of the passage of that bill, and nobody knows it better than Mr. Blair himself. He would not be Mr. Blair, however, unless he had a hobby. Congress tolerates his persistent efforts to legislate the people into heaven on the principle that it seems to please him and does not interfere with anybody else.”

Does the *Review* understand fully the situation? Does it know that there was presented to the last Congress petitions purporting to represent over 14,000,000 people of the United States praying for a National Sunday law? In the fancied security in which hundreds of thousands rest lies the danger to liberty which the *Review *thinks is wholly imaginary. “Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty.”

Certain advocates of Sunday legislation are accustomed to “bear false witness,” by asserting that Seventh-day Baptists and Seventh-day Adventists join with saloonists in opposing Sunday laws. Those who know the facts, know that they are uncompromising foes of the saloon, advocating its total destruction. We oppose Sunday legislation on religious grounds; we oppose the saloon on all days, and condemn the folly of legalizing its existence on six days of the week, and then attempting to close it on its most profitable day upon the false plea that that day is sacred. It is wicked to lie about small things even. Brethren, tell the truth about us for the sake of your own reputation, if for nothing else. *—The Outlook.*
