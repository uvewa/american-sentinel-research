The advocates of Sunday laws are not noted for consistency. Thus Doctor Herrick Johnson, of Chicago, argues as follows, that none should insist upon keeping the seventh day:—

> "Now, let us look at the impracticability of the question raised here and see where this matter of conscience rests. It is now half-past ten in Chicago. It is half-past eleven here (Washington, D. C.). If one of the Seventh-day Baptists should start west from Chicago to go around the world, always keeping each successive seventh day, when he got back to Chicago he would be keeping Friday instead of Saturday as the Sabbath; and another Seventh-day Baptist who went the other way around the world would be keeping Sunday instead of Saturday for the Sabbath when he got back. That is what comes of making a fetich of the letter."

But how is it that this has no effect on Sunday? Mr. Johnson professes to believe that it is a sin to work on any part of Sunday, but how can that be if it is impossible to keep track of the day? Or does he wish to be understood as holding that, whereas Sunday can be identified the world over, the day immediately preceding it cannot be? Such a cavil might to some minds have considerable weight as against the obligation to keep any day, but to us it seems to be out of the question that any rigid Sundaykeeper can honestly use it.
