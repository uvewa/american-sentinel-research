A Toronto (Canada) dispatch of the 14th ult. says:—

> "The Baptist congress to-day discussed Sabbath observance. The trend of thought was very liberal. It was contended by many speakers that the solution of the problem of how best to achieve Sabbath observance is found in the amelioration of the condition of the masses in cities. Sunday street-cars, newspapers, and railway travel were all condemned."

Toronto now has, it is said, the most stringent Sunday laws of any city on this continent, and we can't see what more the friends of that day want unless indeed it is a law compelling people to go to church; and without street-cars how can many of them go? Possibly, however, if they have not Sunday papers to read, time would hang so heavily on their hands that they would be willing to walk over long distances to hear preaching.
