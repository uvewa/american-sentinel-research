The following, from the *California Prohibitionist* of August, is sensible:—

> "If Cincinnati wants to settle the contest with the saloons in the easiest manner, let her close the saloons every day in the week as well as Sunday. There is no sense in allowing the traffic six days in which to get up muscle with which to fight the law on the seventh."

It is refreshing to find a Prohibition organ that is consistent on this point. There is really no more relation between Sunday laws and Prohibition than Sunday laws and tariff reform. We are glad to find our contemporary a consistent *Prohibitionist.*—*Signs of the Times.*
