The *Lever* is the leading third-party prohibition paper in the West, and one of the two leading third-party prohibition papers in the United States. It is one of the leading papers of a party which passes as the repository of the morality, purity, and gentleness that are to regenerate and save this nation. From the editorial columns of the *Lever* of October 24, 1889, we have clipped the following, entitled, "How Can Ye Escape?" and printed it here as it was printed there:—

> "A prominent member of a South Side Methodist Church is such an intense Republican that he abhors the word 'anti-saloon.' A few days ago he refused to sign a petition for Sabbath observance. Shades of John Wesley! Such hatred for Prohibitionists that he is willing to defend the saloon. Shame on such church members, and what a pity that there are thousands of them. What does the Bible say of such men? Hear Christ:—

> "'For they [the politicians] bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay them [license laws] on men's shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers.'

> "'Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay tithe of mint and anise, and cummin, and have omitted the *weightier* matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith: These ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.'

> "'Ye blind guides, which strain at a gnat and swallow a camel!'

> "'Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees *[Republicans and Democrats'],* hypocrites! for ye are like unto whited sepulchers [*high license saloons*] which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men's *[drunkards']* bones, and of all uncleanness.'

> "'Wherefore ye [Sioux City, Jackson, Miss., and Greenville, O.] be ye witnesses unto yourselves, that ye are the children of them which killed the prophets.'

> "'Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye escape the damnation of hell?'"

We rest perfectly assured that none of the organs of either of the political parties mentioned by the *Lever* have yet descended so low as this extract shows the *Lever* to be. Whenever any of them do so, it will certainly be time for the rise of a third party; and it will just as certainly be necessary that it shall be a party of better political principles than is the third-party Prohibition party, and its organs will have to show more respect for the Scriptures and for man, to be worthy the respect of men.
