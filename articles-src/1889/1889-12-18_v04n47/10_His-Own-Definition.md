# His Own Definition.

> "Out of the Fog," M. A. G. lifts his voice to say, "Each of the ten commandments is a civil law." We would like to ask how civil government can enforce the commandment, "Thou shalt not covet"? Civil government deals with the *actions* of men. It cannot touch the *thoughts;* but every one of the ten commandments reach the thoughts. He who hates his brother is a murderer. 1 John 3:15. To lust is to break the seventh commandment. Matt. 5: 28. With the *mind* we keep the law of God. Rom. 7: 25. Unless civil government by torture or some similar means can wrench from the unwilling mind its most secret thought, it cannot enforce the moral law. He who proposes that the ten commandments be enforced by our government, in other words, that man shall stand in the place of God to execute his laws, proposes the establishment of an American papacy, and must logically insist upon the re-establishment of the holy Inquisition, with its rack and thumb-screw.

If the ten commandments is the civil law, will our brother tell us what is the ecclesiastical law? He says, "Ecclesiastical law pertains to the doctrines, worship, and government of the church; these are never to be enforced by the civil penalties and laws of the State." We ask if Sunday keeping is not a doctrine of the church? Then, according to the quotation above, it can never be enforced by civil penalties. But Brother Gault wishes to have Sunday laws enforced. Thus, according to *his own definition* of a union of Church and State, he is in favor of it. He says "the ten commandments was the civil constitution Christ gave the nation of Israel," and advocates the adoption of the same constitution for *our* nation. But Israel was a theocracy—a union of Church and State. Then again we ask if Brother Gault is not in favor of a union of Church and State? The only difference between Israel's theocracy and the one proposed by M. A. G. is that the government of Israel was a God-made theocracy, but the one he proposes will be a *man-* made theocracy. Our government punishes murder, not because it is irreligious, but because it is uncivil. Webster's definition of civil is, "Pertaining to a city or State, or a citizen in his relation to his fellow-citizens or to the State." The definition of religion is, "The recognition of God as an object of worship, love, and obedience." With these definitions it is clearly seen that civil government can never make or enforce religious laws.—*W., in Prohibition Journal.*
