It was confidently stated some days since that the stability of the republic of Brazil was assured, because the papal benediction had been bestowed upon it. From one standpoint this would seem to be a favorable circumstance for the new government; and yet it is doubtful if, in the long run, the friendship of a power which never ceases to intrigue for political supremacy is really the best thing for any State. Should the Jesuits decide to take a hand in Brazilian politics, as they undoubtedly will, they will be a destructive element, as they are in Mexico, and as they have long been in other South American republics, as well as in the monarchies of Europe. Ecuador has long enjoyed the papal benediction, and the condition of that country proves that more than the favor of the Papacy is essential to good and stable government.
