# An Appeal to the Baptists.

Baptists can boast no ordinary ancestry. Wycliffe, Huss, the Waldenses, Albigenses, and hosts of noble men and women reaching into the earliest ages of the Christian era, were Baptists. They held the truth on more points than that of baptism. Says Benedict in his "History of the Baptists," they were "always found on the side of *religious liberty."* This is, perhaps, too little understood. Jesus first introduced it to the world in the land of Judea, when he said, "Render therefore unto Cesar the things which are Cesar's; and unto God the things that are God's." Matt. 22:21. Civil power belongs to Cesar; that which pertains to the conscience belongs to God.

Civil government may be illustrated as follows. A dozen men emigrate to some wild land together. Every one of these men has certain personal "inalienable rights." Suppose each one stands guard over his own rights from the encroachments of the other eleven, as well as from the attacks of surrounding foes. Think you there would be much chance for real union and brotherly kindness among them? Tired at length of living with his hand against every man, and every man's hand against him, each one of these twelve concludes to delegate his power to some one of their number, whom they unanimously choose. Accordingly, they draw up a declaration of rights, agree upon rules of conduct, define the penalties for their violation, and delegate to their chosen representative the executive power. All these colonists unite their powers for mutual assistance. Everyone now has twelve times as much protection as he had before, with none of the cruel suspicion, care, and selfishness, and with a far wider sphere of usefulness and happiness.

How much power has he who is elected head or ruler?—Just as much and no more than the eleven had to give to him. Such is civil government. The Lord has a moral government over all his creatures, a moral law for them, *i. e.,* the ten commandments, with power to enforce its obedience under penalties which in his own time will be inflicted. It is sacrilege for a civil government to touch in any way God's government, compelling man to obedience. God himself does not do this. While he *invites* the sinner, he does not *force* him to obey, and he has never authorized man to do so. He leaves each one free to believe, or to disbelieve and perish. This is *religious liberty.*

Has man any right whatever to change the plan of God? Baptists have always said, No; yet there is a people in our midst who are endeavoring most earnestly, with influence and means, to bring about such a change in the Constitution of these United States that laws may be made to compel the conscience of men, thus uniting civil with ecclesiastical power.

They had a trial of this unholy union in the early settlement of New England. "Religous freedom and religious intolerance governed respectively the adjoining colonies of Boston and Plymouth. The settlers at Plymouth were organized as a church before they left Holland, and as such they landed on our shores. This church was formed on the principle of entire separation from, and independence of, all human authority. Another principle adopted by the church at Plymouth was that ecclesiastical censories are wholly spiritual, and not accompanied with temporal penalties. The first settlers at Boston and vicinity belonged, for the most part, to the other class of non-conformists who did not, while in England, separate wholly from the Established Church, though they opposed her corruptions. When at length they embarked for America, they came as members of the Church of England. (It will be remembered that this church has always held to the union of civil and religious power.) It is a well-known fact that most of the persecuting measures which disgraced those Anglo-Puritans, and were for ages a source of vexation and annoyance to all dissenters from their petty hierarchy, were carried on by the Boston Company and their descendants; while in all the region of the Plymouth settlers, a mild, benignant toleration, with scarce an exception, was always enjoyed."—*Benedict's History, pages 427, 428.*

Baptist ministers, writing from these colonies, said: "It seems strange that Christians in New England should pursue the very same persecuting measures which they fled from old England to avoid."—*Ib., p. 387.*

In the case of Sir Roger Williams, the same historian says: "But the most obnoxious position, and indeed the heresy of all others the most dangerous and pestilential in the estimation of the Puritan Fathers, was that the civil magistrates had no right to punish breaches of the first table, or, to vary the expression, to legislate in matters of conscience and religion."—*P. 432.* Governor Winthrop testifies of Roger Williams: "It thus appears that the object of the government in directing his immediate apprehension at the time, was to prevent the establishment of a colony in which the civil authority should not be permitted to interfere with the religious opinions of the citizens." Sir Roger Williams was *a Baptist.* His broad, clear-minded views, his self-sacrificing adherence to the right, did much in moulding New England and giving her a world-wide fame for staunch integrity, though Connecticut retained her sacro-secular power till 1818, and Massachusetts till 1833. On this subject see "Emancipation of Massachusetts" and similar works.

It was in view of the fearful results of uniting civil with ecclesiastical power in New England, that the far-seeing, noble men who framed the Constitution of the United States purposely left out of it all mention of God or his worship. We have prospered under this Constitution into the greatest nation in the world; is the next chapter in our history to be a religious despotism?

I am a Baptist, the child of a Baptist as far back as I can trace my lineage, through Newport, Rhode Island, to New England. Shall we prove recreant now to the principles for which our fathers suffered? Can we cry, with Rev. Herrick Johnson, of Chicago, while interfering with God's government in trying to enforce Sunday rest, "Oh for one breath of the Puritan!" ? Will we not seize the already drooping colors of American religious liberty and bear it aloft in this crisis, in the eyes of a gazing world and an approving heaven?—*M. E. Steward, A. M., in Florida Baptist Witness, August 21, 1889.*
