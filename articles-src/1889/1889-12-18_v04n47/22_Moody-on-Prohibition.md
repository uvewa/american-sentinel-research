The New York *Independent* says that Dwight L. Moody believes in prohibition but not in the third-party prohibition, and then adds that "this is another testimony of the large common sense attributed to the great evangelist," to which we add our hearty assent. We hope that all such persons will remain thus sensible to the last. As great an evil as the liquor traffic is, it is not so great as would be a system in which the principles of the third-party Prohibition party should dominate.
