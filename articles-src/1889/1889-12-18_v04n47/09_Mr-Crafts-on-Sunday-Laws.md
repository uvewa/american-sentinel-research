# Mr. Crafts on Sunday Laws.

The following letter from an occasional correspondent in Philadelphia explains itself and contains several items of interest:—

Editor Sentinel: The City of Brotherly Love, a city in which there is the best Sunday observance in the country, was honored recently with the presence of Rev. Wilbur F. Crafts, field secretary of the American Sabbath Union, who preached in Bethany Presbyterian Church, on the “American Civil Sabbath.” Your correspondent went to hear him, and as he was to speak on the “American Sabbath,” I expected that he would take his text from some history of America, which would tell of the time when the Americans made America, when they rested from their work, and made the “American Sabbath” to commemorate the work. But lo! he did nothing of the kind, but took a text from the Bible (Nehemiah 13), and started off by telling us that these people in Nehemiah’s time were engaged in *Sunday* trade, which I couldn’t believe, as I was always taught that Sunday is the first day of the week, and this trading occurred the day previous.

He said that museums and art galleries should not be allowed to open on Sunday, not even those of a high order, because if those of the highest order were allowed to open, then it would be impossible to close the vile ones, as the law could not discriminate, and thus the morals of the people would be corrupted. Great is Sunday! These low museums corrupt the morals of the people if allowed to be open on Sunday, while on other days they can be in full blast, and not a word is said against them by our Sunday-law friends.

Confectionery shops, Mr. Crafts said, must be closed, because one Sunday he made it a special point to watch the children on their way to his Sunday-school in New York, and he calculated that at least $5.00 of the children’s money had gone into the coffers of the confectioners, thus depriving, as he said, the church and the missionary of money that belonged to them. This he said was teaching the children to be embezzlers. What is his remedy? Teach the children at their homes, in the church, in the Sunday-school, that it is wrong to do this?—Not a bit of it. He would have a Sunday law that would shut the candy shop and compel the children to bring their pennies to the Sunday-school. But has it come to this that the professed church of Jesus Christ has not got enough power to compete with the little candy shops?

Seventh-day observers should not be allowed to open their shops on Sunday, said the speaker, as it would interfere with the Sunday rest-day. If they couldn’t get along with having them open five days, they should seek some other occupation. Truly they ought to get down on their knees and thank these would-be lords of creation that they allow them to live at all, or even take a walk on Sunday to get a mouthful of fresh air! John Quinn.
