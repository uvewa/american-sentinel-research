The editor of the New York *Journal of Commerce,* a professed Protestant, has gone over to the Catholic view of the public-school question. In a recent editorial he says:—

> "If we are asked whether we favor the appropriation of the public money to such sectarian schools, we answer with a decided negative. But we do say that if a Romanist is taxed to support a school which is a stench in his nostrils, and the godless character of which is essential to the fairness of the system, then he is justly entitled to a proportion of the fund thus raised for the school, which, by all that he holds sacred, he is compelled to patronize. The common school outgrew its usefulness, and its right to exist at the public expense, at the moment it ceased to give the young committed to it a training in the fear of God."

This is strange language. If it does not mean the appropriation of money for sectarian schools it certainly means the destruction of the common-school system, but it does mean the division of the school fund; it can mean nothing short of it. It has been explained many times why the public schools cannot teach religion, and indeed it would not be necessary for the public schools to teach religion if it were taught in the church, the home, and the Sabbath-school, as it was taught within the memory of men now in the prime of life. The trouble is not in the schools but in the homes and in the churches. Many have the form of godliness but deny the power thereof, and having itching ears they are heaping to themselves religious teachers after their own lusts, and because their pernicious example, and the wishy-washy teachings of the modern pulpit, react on their own children, they want the State to step in and make them Christians by law.

The decline of morals is not confined to our own country, nor is it confined to those governments that exclude religion from the public schools. Germany supports a system of public schools; and in these religious training is made a prominent feature, and yet in that country infidelity is more prevalent than in any other country, with the possible exception of France. Rationalism abounds, and Christianity has degenerated for the most part to the merest form. Even if logic fails to convince the advocates of religious teaching in the public schools that it is not a panacea for infidelity, the strong logic of the naked facts will in time demonstrate so plainly that none can fail to see the point. A knowledge of Christianity cannot be communicated to the student as can the science of mathematics or a knowledge of the languages.
