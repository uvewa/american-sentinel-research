Our good National Reform friend, Rev. N. R. Johnston, does us the kindness to announce to the readers of the *Christian Statesman* that the American Sentinel is to be moved to New York City as the place of publication. When the Sentinel reaches New York City, Jan. 1, 1890, and thenceforward, we shall show our appreciation of Mr. Johnston's kindness by making the columns of the Sentinel as interesting as possible to the readers of the *Christian Statesman.* And being then so much nearer to the seat of the *Statesman,* we hope to make these things proportionately interesting and profitable both to the *Statesman* and its readers.
