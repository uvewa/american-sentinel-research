# Some Points of Interest.

It seems that the Sunday-law fever has struck Riverside, this State, and the city council has been asked to pass a Sunday ordinance which shall supply, at least to some extent, the lack of a State statute upon the subject. Referring to this movement, the *Press and Horticulturist,* the leading paper of that thriving Southern city, says:—

> "Although we have the highest respect for those who urge this step, we cannot feel that such an act would be expedient. We have already too many laws, and are endeavoring to secure by statute that which should be the voluntary act of the citizen. It is not known to just what length it is desired to go in this matter, but if it is merely to prevent things which are evil there is a more effectual way of reaching them, and one which can have less doubt regarding its constitutionality or propriety. We allude to restrictions as to time of closing of places of business under a business license. Such a method will not make it a crime to take a ride or other innocent entertainment with one's family, nor attempt to interfere with the freedom of the individual in other directions. It will be aimed alone at an evil it desires to cure. No local Sunday law can reach those who privately indulge in billiards and cards on Sunday. But a police regulation may prevent them where they are publicly carried on, as well and possibly better— better because it would have almost unanimous public sentiment to back it—than a religious ordinance.

> "It is too generally assumed that it is the atheistic and irreligious classes alone who object to a Sunday law. Such is not the case. There are those who ask in the name of their religion that Sunday be not made a religious day, because they hold that another day is the one which should be observed. It is true that this element is a small minority but its rights should be held no less sacred than those of such as believe Sunday to be the holy day.

> "Rowdyism and immorality are more objectionable when obtrusive on a day which a large majority of the people hold in reverence; and yet majority should not rashly legislate in matters of conscience."

There are a few points of interest in these paragraphs which we wish to notice. It is true, as the *Press* says, that no Sunday law can reach those who privately play cards and billiards on Sunday, but there is one thing that Sunday laws can do, they can and do cause a great deal of private gambling, drinking, and other abominations on Sunday. To foster idleness is to foster immorality in those not restrained by strong religious convictions, hence not only the folly but the wickedness of civil laws requiring people to keep a Sabbath. Those who have a conscientious regard for any day will keep it without a law, while those who have no such convictions, though they may be compelled to abstain from labor, business, and public amusements, will be all the more likely to engage in objectionable private practices.

As the *Press* remarks, the atheistic and irreligious classes are not the only ones who object to the Sunday laws; but suppose they were; has the State a right to require an atheist to observe Sunday, or any other day, simply because he is an atheist? We have no right to say that because the atheist is in error he has no rights. The State cannot decide who is in error, or if it does so decide, where shall it stop? If it can decide between the Christian and the atheist, it has an equal right to decide between the several sects of Christians, and there is no place to stop short of the Papacy.

Rowdyism should be prohibited on all days; but immorality, unless carried to the point of incivility, does not come within the purview of human laws. Probably, however, by "immorality" the *Press* means only such things as might properly be forbidden by civil law, that is, things which in their very nature are uncivil.
