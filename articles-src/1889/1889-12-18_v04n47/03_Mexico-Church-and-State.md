The republic of Mexico is an example showing how mischievous is a union of Church and State. The president of that government has recently issued a circular calling attention to the fact that the Church and State are independent of each other, and that no laws can be dictated either favoring or prohibiting a religion; but, strange as it may seem, the State forbids the establishment or maintenance of monastic orders. The reason is not far to seek. It is because these communities are hot-beds of revolution. In Mexico, as elsewhere, the Romish Church is loth to relinquish the power which it once held. Hence, in self-defense, it is necessary for the government to prohibit monastic orders, and so it appears that Church and State, like any other malignant growth, is exceedingly hard to cure. There the knife has been repeatedly applied to the cancer, and yet its roots remain.
