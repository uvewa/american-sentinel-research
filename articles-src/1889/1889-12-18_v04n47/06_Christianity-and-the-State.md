# Christianity and the State.

The bishop of Peterborough presided at the diocesan conference at Leicester yesterday. Summing up a discourse on Socialism, the bishop said they must be careful, while knowing that many of the advocates of Socialism held doctrines which were very dangerous, that they give full credit to the nobility of motive and tenderness of sympathy with suffering and wrong which had stirred many of those persons.

Christianity, however, made no claim to rearrange the economic relations of men in the State and in society, and he hoped he would be understood when he said plainly that it was his firm belief that any Christian State carrying out in all its relations the sermon on the mount could not exist for a week.

It was perfectly clear that a State could not continue to exist upon what were commonly called Christian principles, and it was a mistake to attempt to turn Christ's kingdom into one of this world. To introduce the principles of Christianity into the laws of the State would lead to absolute intolerance. The law of Christianity was self-sacrifice, impelled by love; the principle of the State was justice, impelled by force. The State had to do justice between man and man, and to restrain violence; the duty of the church was clear, namely, not to voice Christian principles on the statute-book, but to inculcate in the minds of men, both capitalist and laborer alike, to do unto others as they would others should do unto them; to infuse into the minds of men the great principles of justice, to try to make labor just toward capital, and capital just and fair toward labor—*London Standard.*
