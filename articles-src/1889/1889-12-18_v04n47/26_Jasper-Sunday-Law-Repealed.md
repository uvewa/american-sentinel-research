In the latter part of October the leaders of the Catholic, Methodist, and Lutheran Churches of Jasper, Dubois Co., Ky., banded together and presented a petition to the town authorities to enact a Sunday law for that place. Accordingly, the authorities adopted an ordinance requiring all the saloons, confectioneries, and bakeries in the place to remain closed on Sunday. This was not according to the wish of the majority of the citizens of that place, and they resented the action by staying away from church. As a consequence, for three successive Sundays the congregations were exceedingly slim. In fact, the report says that the preachers were compelled to talk to empty benches. Before the fourth Sunday came around that Sunday law was repealed. Query: Did those leaders of the churches have anything to do with that repeal? Echo answers, *Didn't* they?
