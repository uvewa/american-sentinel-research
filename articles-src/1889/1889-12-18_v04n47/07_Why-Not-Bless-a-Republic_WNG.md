# Why Not Bless a Republic?

Some people seem surprised that a Catholic archbishop should give his blessing to the New Brazilian republic, as though the Catholic Church was necessarily opposed to republican governments. The form of government is not of so much consequence to Rome as her opportunity to manipulate the government for the benefit of the church. True, the Roman Church is an absolute monarchy so far as church government is concerned, but she is shrewd enough to make the most of every situation. And while the popular voice in Brazil was for a republic, it was characteristic of Jesuitical policy to ride in with the tide, and be present at the christening. It would have been poor policy for "the church" to have taken any chances on losing its prestige in the country at such a crisis. We may rest assured that the "blessing" in this case was, first, for the benefit of the church and its establishment in the new order of things.

But we must not forget that Romanism finds many good opportunities in a republic which she does not find in some monarchies, especially in those monarchies where the State churches are anti-Catholic. There is no doubt that the emissaries of Rome find far less hindrance to their aggressive work in the United States than in Russia, Germany, England, or, we might say, Italy, Catholic as it is. The key to the favorable opportunities which a republic offers to Catholicism is found in the following sentiment expressed in *La Patrie,* published in Montreal:—

> "Nothing in the Constitution of the United States prevents a Canadian Catholic from entering the White House, while, so long as the sovereign who ascends the British throne is compelled to take an oath of Protestantism, so long will our religion stand at a disadvantage under the British flag. Is not this sufficient to point out many advantages that would accrue to our nationality were we once to be enrolled under the starry banner? There were Catholics sitting in the American Congress long before the gates of Parliament were opened to them in Great Britain. All this should point out to every true Canadian the course he should pursue. Further, let us proclaim the United States of Canada, or seek our proper refuge beneath the protecting wings of the American eagle."

There is no power on earth so quick as that of Rome to recognize the force of the motto displayed upon the American Sabbath Union letterheads, namely, "Office is opportunity." Catholics are specially enjoined by the pope to "penetrate wherever possible in the administration of civil affairs." In 1885 Pope Leo XIII. issued the following Encyclical:—

> "We exhort all Catholics who would devote careful attention to public matters, to take an active part in all municipal affairs and elections, and to further the principles of the church in all private services, meetings, and gatherings. All Catholics must make themselves felt as active elements in daily political life in the countries where they live. They must penetrate wherever possible in the administration of civil affairs; must constantly exert the utmost vigilance and energy to prevent the usage of liberty from going beyond the limits fixed by God's law. All Catholics should do all in their power to cause the constitution of States and legislation to be modeled to the principles of the true church. All Catholics and journalists should never lose for an instant from view the above prescriptions. All Catholics should redouble their submission to authority, and unite their heart and soul and body and mind in defense of the church and Christian wisdom."

Catholics in the United States have been remarkably persistent and successful in carrying out the designs of the Vatican government as above expressed. They have been more successful than they could have been under any other form of government, for the very reason advanced by *La Patrie,*—that there is greater opportunity for them to get into official position.

A republic may enact and enforce statutes inimical to religious liberty just as rigidly as a monarchy, provided the majority are in favor of such legislation, or provided a majority in the law-making bodies may be influenced in any way to legislate in such a manner. And those religionists who favor church domination in civil affairs are never conscientious as to whether the majority are pleased or not, so long as the desired end is accomplished.

It has been demonstrated in several States of this "land of the free," that religious persecution of a most cruel nature may find legal sanction, aided and abetted by even Protestant churches, and that so late as the year 1889. It is no argument that a church power, whether Roman Catholic or Roman Protestant, may be safely intrusted with the helm of state because the government is republican in form. If the Constitution or the statutes declare for any religious dogma, and there be penalty attached for violation of the law, a republic may go just as far in the execution of that penalty as the most absolute monarchy. The same spirit that demands and has power to enforce such legislation, will see that it is enforced, no matter what the form of government. And imprisonment, confiscation of property, and death, are no milder penalties under a republican government than under a monarchy; and these things are the ultimatum of all unrestrained religious dogmatism, wherever there are those who refuse to bow to its mandates.

The great strength of the National Reform schemes in the United States lies not in the fact that the majority favor such measures, but in the fact that the majority are resting in the delusion that such legislation as is proposed never can be enforced in a republic. They argue that the people would rise in their might in defense of their liberties. But a people who will quietly stand and look on while the shackles are being riveted upon them, will not afterwards make a very formidable resistance.

But what ground is there for indulging the delusion that there is no danger of persecution for conscience' sake in a republic? Do not laws which, if carried out, would work such results, already exist in many of the States of this Union, merely awaiting a like action on the part of the general government to give full vent to their intolerant provisions? Are the people of the United States any different in their temperament from the people of the individual States? When nearly all the States are indulging in Sunday laws, is it reasonable to maintain that the general government cannot be turned into the same channel? The same influence that carries all the States singly, when combined may fairly expect to carry the whole lump. And no religious hierarchy or other religious combination aiming for civil power ever yet knew where to stop when once it was able to set the ball in motion.

There need be no surprise that Rome would bless the republic of Brazil. She would bless anything for the sake of getting a leading influence. She would even bless the excommunicated king of Italy, were he to restore the temporal power of the pope. Nor need we feel secure against the spirit of religious intolerance merely because we live in a great republic. "Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty," no matter what the character of the government. It matters not whether the church be Catholic or Protestant, or whether the State be monarchical or republican,—the union of Church and State is death to the liberties of the people. W. N. Glenn.
