# A Sound Opinion.

The Atlanta *Constitution* of Nov. 22, 1889, gives an account of a divorce case in Texas involving the question of religious liberty. The petitioner for the divorce set forth as the ground of his petition that a band of religionists calling themselves "sanctificationists" held, among other things, that it was sinful for a female sanctificationist to live with a husband that did not believe in the doctrine of sanctification; that his wife had become a sanctificationist; and thus a "destroyer had crept into his home and made desolate all that was once happy." It seems that the case was presented to a jury, and the jury granted a decree of divorce. The wife appealed the case to the Supreme Court. There the decree was promptly set aside. The court gave the following reason for its decision:—

> "In view of the constitutional provision securing to 'all men the right to worship almighty God according to the dictates of their own conscience,' and asserting that 'no human authority ought in any case whatever to control or interfere with the rights of conscience in matters of religion,' we do not think that the question as to the doctrines or practices of the sanctificationists ought to have been permitted to enter to any extent into the trial.

> "It was defendant's right to have any religious belief, or none, as best suited her. If her conduct as a wife was such as to furnish her husband grounds for divorce, the acts themselves would be the only proper subjects to investigate, without any regard to the religious connections which led to them. If her conduct was blameless it was useless to allege and prove that her religious connections inculcated evil views and practices."

That decision is sound. The distinction made between actions and religious profession is clear and distinct. This is the genuine American doctrine. We wish all the courts in the country would see this question in as clear a view as did the Texas Supreme Court in this case.
