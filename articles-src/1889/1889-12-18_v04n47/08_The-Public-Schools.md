# The Public Schools.

The following communication from Mr. G. F. B. Leighton, president of the Horticultural and Pomological Society of Norfolk, Virginia, to the *Public Ledger* of that city, puts the matter of the total separation of religion and the public schools in a way so pointed and plain that no one can fail to see it:—

In a recent issue of your paper, I noticed remarks from eminent divines as to the feasibility of introducing religious instruction in our public schools. As your columns are open to all phases of subjects, I offer the views of an outsider in this matter.

We are commanded to work six days. From time immemorial, with civilized nations schools have been established for the purpose of training youths for the most intelligent performance of that work—schools formed and freely sustained by tax in country, town, city, and State, showing that their importance is appreciated throughout the land.

One-seventh of the time is set apart for another purpose, giving rest from the school rotation, and directing the mind to moral and religious education in the establishment of Sunday-schools as auxiliary to pulpit instruction.

Should a teacher in the Sunday-school make the diversion of demonstrating a problem in geometry he would be driven from his position for introducing a subject at variance with the object of the school, yet no more out of place than the introduction of religious training in our public schools.

The parents of our scholars are made up of many religious sects, each believing that their church is nearest right. Should a majority of any school district be of a particular persuasion, such views would be inculcated as would suit them, resulting in the overthrow of the usefulness of the school system.

When one-seventh of our time devoted to moral and religious education, assisted by the Sunday-school, the pulpit, and the home, proves inadequate to the best interests of our country, we must admit that we are in a most deplorable condition.

I regard the preservation of our Constitution, under which we have passed a century of prosperity, to the fact that we have had two great political parties to watch each other; but also in part to the multiplicity of religious demonstrations, which strenuously oppose the connection of Church and State, which some parties apprehend at a future day.

Let our schools remain free from the stain of religious dissensions, and continue to form the bulwark of American freedom, demonstrating to other nations that we have a spot where all religious sects are protected in the full exercise of their peculiar tenets, and their children instructed in what pertains to the duties of the six days’ work, leaving for the seventh day the duties as aforementioned.
