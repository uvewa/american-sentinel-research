# Mrs. Bateham and the Sunday Newspapers.

The regular services at Dr. Goodwin's church Sunday last were diversified by a discourse from Mrs. Josephine C. Bateham, of Columbus, Ohio, on the question of Sunday Observance. Mrs. Bateham, in the course of her declamation, picked out the Sunday newspaper, made Saturday, as the arch-agency which fills the home "with worse than demoralizing thoughts and influences," and demanded that it be "stamped out of existence." Upon this point the secular *Tribune* would reason a little with Mrs. Bateham.

If Mrs. Bateham desires to "stamp the Sunday paper out of existence" there is but one way in which she has any right to do the stamping. Mrs. Bateham may exercise her authority in her own home. She may forbid her husband to take the Sunday paper. This she may do—if she can. She can gather her sons together, if she has any, and coerce them to the same extent, and if her authority is as complete as it should be, and the family has been kept in the proper subjection, she will succeed in banishing the Sunday paper from the Bateham house. She also has the right to go to other women and induce them to exercise their rights as family bosses, and to the extent that the Sunday paper is suppressed the degree of discipline which their families are under will be demonstrated. To this extent Mrs. Bateham has the undoubted right to go in "stamping the Sunday paper out of existence," but no farther. She has no authority to use carnal weapons in her warfare in order to inaugurate a more somber course of reading on Sunday. So far as her own family is concerned her limitations are clearly defined. But there is nothing in the Constitution or laws which forbids a man from reading a newspaper Sunday. She has neither divine right nor constitutional right nor any other right to enforce any regulation on people outside of her own household with regard to Sunday newspapers. If she has authority enough to coerce her husband and sons, and influence enough to induce other women to boss their husbands and sons, that is her privilege. There are some women in Chicago who share Mrs. Bateham's sentiments. If they can coerce their husbands and sons, that is their right. But there are 200,000 men of adult age here in Chicago, and almost as many women, who want to read the Sunday papers, and will insist on the privilege. How are they to be prevented? and who will do it?—*Chicago Tribune.*
