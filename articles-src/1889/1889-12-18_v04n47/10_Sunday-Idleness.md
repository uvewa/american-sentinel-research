# Sunday Idleness.

A couple of weeks ago a lecturer named Wilder addressed the people of Summerville in opposition to the movement now on foot to exact a forced observance of Sunday by means of the laws of the United States. That any number of American citizens have become sufficiently alarmed to put lecturers into the field to resist this church movement against individual liberty, proves that the danger is not so imaginary as one might think. That there are lecturers in the field is sufficient to awaken the vigilance of all thoughtful citizens. After some investigation it may be taken as correct that Washington is the only portion of the United States where Sunday idleness is not enjoined. The Legislatures of other States and Territories have on their statute-books laws calculated to enforce idleness on Sunday, and the courts of last resort in the great majority of cases have sustained their constitutionality. It may be conceded that these acts of the Legislatures and the construction given by the courts are responsive to the sentiments of the vast body of American citizens. The reasons for this condition of affairs may be divided, like Gaul, into three parts.

The first class consists of those who regard Sunday laws as sanctions of the institution of the Christian religion, and that such laws enable many Christians to enjoy Christian privileges and prevent others from interfering with them.

The second class holds that the individual is the subject of the law’s concern, and that his spiritual welfare is promoted.

The third class take the position that it is for the citizen’s bodily benefit that a day of rest is established. Sunday laws are very peculiar laws, to say the best of them. They are the only laws known in the United States directed against “sin” and not against a “crime.” The courts in enforcing these regulations are concerned not so much with the statutory prohibition as with the religious duty of the citizen. If industry is a commendable virtue, and idleness a vice reprimanded by holy writ itself, and despised by the useful and energetic American, idleness should never be encouraged, or, at least, not become a subject of legal enactment. The compulsion of idleness on Sunday, from a historical point of view, is a comparatively new thing under the sun. The institution of the “American Sunday” was unknown until about two hundred years ago, and is unknown now to all other Christian and civilized or uncivilized nations except the British Empire and the United States of America. Cromwell and his followers were the founders of the modern legislation. By means of the fourth commandment taken from the Jews, they transferred the Sabbath from Saturday to Sunday. The Jews had a Sabbath-day’s journey. The Puritans converted Sunday into a day of gloom and solemn inspection, and tried to compel all others to conform to their pet notions and self- righteous rules. It is not as surprising to see British subjects, who adhere to the doctrine of the divine right of kings, giving their assent to unauthorized Sunday legislation, but that pliant, if not hypocritical, Legislatures in America should hang such a superstitious regulation around the necks of free Americans, is difficult to understand. Let such a union of State and Church be severed, and let no unnatural legislation at least be enacted in such cases.—*Summerville ( Oregon) Annotator, Sept. 6, 1889. *[358]
