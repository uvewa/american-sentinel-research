The *Christian Nation* says: "This nation can never become a Christian nation in any true sense of the word until the men who carry on the government are honest and trustworthy." We do not believe that the men who carry on the government are either dishonest or untrustworthy. We believe that the men who carry on the government are as honest and trustworthy as the men who carry on private enterprises. It must be so, because the men who carry on the government are chosen from the people, that is, from among those who carry on private enterprises; and we do not believe that those who are so chosen necessarily become dishonest and untrustworthy by the fact of being called to carry on the government. But even though they were all dishonest and untrustworthy, as the *Christian Nation* argues, it would still remain true that the principles of the *Christian Nation* and its party are utterly false and untrustworthy, because an amendment to the Constitution declaring that this is a Christian nation would not make the men who carry on the government either honest or trustworthy. Men cannot be made honest and virtuous by law. Nothing but the gospel of Christ can accomplish that, and the merits of the gospel are not made available by political methods.
