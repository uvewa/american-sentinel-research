The *Union Signal* of October 24 complains because the South American delegates to the congress of American powers spent four days in Chicago and didn't visit Evanston, and "the home of Miss Willard," to "look upon her home, and herself, then carry the story to the women of their home land." Yes, what a wonderful story it would have been if these delegates could only go back to their home-land and report that they had seen a woman and the house that she lives in. It is altogether likely that every one of them would have been promoted to the very highest honors in the gift of their several States. This no doubt was the supreme moment in the tide of their affairs, which, taken at the flood, would have led on to fortune. But woe worth the day that they should be so lost to all sense of the importance of opportunity as to miss the critical moment and so be left high and dry, stranded, amid the wrecks of time, an awful warning, etc., etc.!! It is barely possible, however, that the gentlemen referred to have not yet joined the Mutual Admiration Society to which the *Union Signal* belongs.
