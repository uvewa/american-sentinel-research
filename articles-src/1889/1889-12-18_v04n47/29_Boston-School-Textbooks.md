A leading Catholic paper notices the fact that the tables have been turned in Boston upon the matter of text-books. It seems that now Protestants are dissatisfied with a school history which they think is unfair. It would certainly be a relief, not only to Boston but to the people at large, if the good folks of that city could only agree among themselves to run their public schools upon a proper basis, that is, to teach the arts and sciences alone, and leave special religious instruction for the private schools, for the church, and for the home. Religion has no business with the public schools, because when once admitted somebody must decide what religion shall be taught. Then there is trouble.
