In his pastoral letter before the centennial celebration Catholicism in America lately held, Cardinal Gibbons said that the Catholic population of the United States is "about nine millions." This we refer to the American Sabbath Union; they can enlarge their petition for a national Sunday law by two millions, in less than a minute, if they still continue that business in the same old way.
