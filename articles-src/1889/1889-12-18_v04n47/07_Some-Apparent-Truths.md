# Some Apparent Truths.

> “America is not the only country,” says the *Sunday School Times* of October 24, “that is vexed and perplexed by the problem of religious education in public schools. France has been making an experiment in this matter, within the last half dozen years, that is well worth noting. In 1882 the law was passed completely withdrawing the public schools from the influence of the clergy, and substituting ‘moral instruction’ in the place of religious, without defining in detail what the authorities understood by. such ‘morality.’ One of the features of the present exposition is a massive volume, compiled by the well-known Protestant theologian and dean of the Paris faculty, Dr. Fr. Lichtenberger, from 558 official reports of school directors and inspectors sent in, by order of the government, for the purpose of learning how the law has been working. The result is severely disappointing to the advocate of purely secular education and of the substitution of vague and general principles of morals for positive religion.

It is impossible to systematize the answers given; but it is clear that endless confusion prevails as to what ‘moral instruction’ is, and that, in any shape or form, it cannot take the place of religious training. Positive Protestants, like Lichtenberger and Edmund de Pressensé, acknowledge the failure of the secularization of the schools, but do not advocate a return to the old system, lest the Roman Catholic clergy be given once more the absolute control which they formerly possessed. But Pressensé in his *Revue Chrétienne* declares that a morality not based upon a positive Christian foundation is absolutely valueless, and urges that this new ‘moral instruction ’ be banished from the schools; that the instruction in general be made as moral as possible; that religious instruction be imparted outside of the regular school hours in the school buildings themselves; and that, in general, the training of the coming generation in the principles of Christianity be advanced in every possible manner. It is exceedingly doubtful whether the authorities will take any steps in this direction.”

The *Catholic Review* of November 9 quotes this, and says, “Some truths that even the blind could see are rapidly coming home to Protestants.” Certainly, and one of those truths which ought to be apparent, is that no system of education [357] which is practicable among people of mixed creeds, can ever take the place of the church and the home, or furnish the instruction which should be given by parents and spiritual advisers. It is true that “morality” cannot be inculcated without religion; and it is equally true that religion cannot be taught without a creed, for a creed is simply that which is believed. If religion is to be taught in the schools it must be defined, and that definition will be somebody’s creed, and if it is adopted by the State it will be the established creed of the State. The only possible solution of the religious educational question without making the schools sectarian is for Christian parents to do their duty toward their children in the home, and for all Christians to do their duty toward all classes as opportunity may offer. The State cannot teach religion unless it has a religion to teach; and State religions have never resulted in anything but evil. The history of Europe and of the South American Republics and Mexico proves this.
