The *Christian at Work* says:—

> "The governor of Ceylon, Sir Arthur Gordon, has shocked the sensibilities of many religious—or shall we say sectarian?—people of India by approving a measure which gives government money to Buddhist priests; and it is said the matter is to be brought before Parliament. Buddhism is more an ethical system than a religion, and the overwhelming mass of the Cingalese are adherents of the doctrines of Buddha. The Protestants number some 30,000, and the Roman Catholics, 250,000. Under the circumstances, it would be best that each body of religionists should support its own priest or clergy. If the people of Ceylon are taxed for the support of any one religion, they should in equity be taxed for the support of all."

Would it not be best under any circumstances that "each body of religionists should support its own priest or clergy"? Would not the evils of a State establishment of religion be even greater with three established churches than with only one? And if taxing Roman Catholics and Protestants for the support of Buddhism is an injustice, would it not be equally unjust to tax for church purposes any who stood aloof from all of the established churches?

The trouble is that State establishments of religion are both corrupting and unjust. Be the minority who stand aloof from the established religion or religions ever so small, their rights are just as sacred as are the rights of the majority, and if it is wrong to tax the whole people for the support of a religion held by only four-fifths of them, it is just as wrong to tax them for that purpose, even though the majority constitute nine hundred and ninety-nine ten-thousandths of the whole population.
