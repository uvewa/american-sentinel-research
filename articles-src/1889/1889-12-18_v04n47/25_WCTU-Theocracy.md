The Woman's Christian Temperance Union still goes on with its idea of a theocracy in this land. It sets forth now that God is the proprietor of all the land in this country; that he "intended the land for the people;" and indorses "the movement for restoring to the people their divinely intended heritage in the land." But it is only the Lord's people who inherit the Lord's land. Then if the Lord is the proprietor of all the land, all who have a share in it will have to be the Lord's people. To make this a fact, however, presents no difficulty in the case, for do they not intend to have a constitutional amendment declaring that this is a Christian nation and the kingdom of God?
