In his speech everywhere for the last six months the secretary of the American Sabbath Union has spent a goodly portion of his time in denouncing Seventh-day Adventists as the chiefest opponents of the national Sunday law for which he is working. Now it is a fact that at the Washington City Convention of the American Sabbath Union last December, and at the hearing before the Senate Committee at the same time, the Seventh-day Adventists were not referred to by a single word in naming the opponents of the Sunday law. So far as any of the statements of the union went on either of the occasions referred to, nobody could suspect even the existence of any such people, and yet within six months from that time they are everywhere denounced as the chiefest opponents of the Sunday bill. Now did these Seventh-day Adventists come up, like Jonah's gourd, "in a night"? Did they all spring into existence since December 13, 1888? or did the American Sabbath Union intentionally ignore them at the Washington Convention and at the hearing before the Senate Committee? Will the union tell how this is?
