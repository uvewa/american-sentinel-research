# Religion and the Majority.

The following editorial article from the St. Louis *Republican* is worthy of a careful reading, as it contains much food for serious reflection:—

> “In his essay on ‘The Policy of the Massachusetts Colonists towards Quakers and Other Dissenters,’ Mr. Henry L. Southwick, of Boston, states, with the precision of a lover of historical truth, facts that will never cease to have a contemporaneous interest while there remains a possibility of oppression through public opinion expressed in legislative enactment. These facts have been often examined. It is well enough known that very soon after landing on Plymouth Rock the ‘Pilgrims ’ banished John and Israel Brown for being Episcopalians; that they drove out Roger Williams, elder of Salem church, for declaring ‘the new and dangerous doctrine’ that ‘the magistrates should restrain crimes and not control opinions;’ that Mrs. Hutchinson was also banished for a similar offense of dissent; that when the Baptists proclaimed that ‘Christians ought to tolerate Christians,’ Obadiah Holmes was whipped for the heresy; that Clark, Crandall, Gorten, and many others, were fined or banished; that under the general acts against Quakers they were to be arrested on their entrance to the colony, ‘committed to the house of correction,’ ‘severely whipped,’ ‘kept constantly at work, and none suffered to converse or speak with them during their imprisonment;’ that under a still severer law, every Quaker returning from banishment should, ‘for the first offense, suffer the loss of one ear; for the second offense, the loss of the other ear, and for the third offense, have his tongue bored through with a hot iron;’ [356] and that under these and similar laws Mary Dyer, William Robinson, Marmaduke Stevenson, and William Leddra were hanged, while others, men and women, were whipped, branded, and maimed.

> “The impartial examination of this record shows that the question back of it was that of the difference between ‘liberty of conscience ’ and ‘license.’ The political principle asserted was the absolutism of the majority to decide where liberty ends and license begins. This principle is still practically asserted in our politics—even in our constitutions made for the express purpose of denying the existence of absolute or inherent right in the majority. And it is curious that these expressions, wherever found, relate to matters of religion. The constitutions adopted during the first fifty years of the Union tend more and more towards that of Virginia, in which there is no qualification whatever of Roger Williams’ declaration that it is the duty of magistrates to restrain crimes, not to control opinions.
> “The rise of Mormonism in the West checked this tendency and caused a reaction towards the opinion that the majority is absolute judge of what is or what is not religious license. The opinion is expressed in the constitutional qualification that ‘liberty of conscience shall not be so construed as to excuse acts of licentiousness, nor to justify practices inconsistent with the good order, peace, or safety of the State.’
> “This limitation is inserted in American constitutions of most recent adoption. It may, therefore, be called the more modern view of religious liberty in distinction from the unqualified declaration of the old Virginia bill of rights, but it must not be forgotten that it is precisely the view of the practical assertion of which the Puritans have been so generally condemned. It makes the public opinion of the majority the judge of what constitutes 4 licentiousness,’ and endangers society. The Puritans thought that it endangered society for the Quakers to be ‘moved by the spirit’ to speak from the benches in church. They considered all acts inconsistent with their own views of liberty as nothing more than licentiousness, dangerous to civil peace and religious order.
> “While we retain their theory, it is inconsistent to condemn their practice. It is unwise, because it is untruthful, to assert that we have outgrown their theory when we revive it and embody it in our constitutions and bills of rights, where it is only innocuous for lack of an issue to vivify it with the strength of a persecuting public opinion.”
There is a danger and a difficulty, as intimated by the *Republican.* But is it not possible to draw the line at a point where it will neither trench upon the rights of conscience nor endanger the well-being of the State? It certainly is possible. “We hold these truths to be self-evident,—that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; that to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men.” These words from the immortal Declaration of Independence set forth the only proper function of civil government, namely, to secure to all their natural or “inalienable” rights. To this end the weak must be protected from the aggressions of the strong, the person, property, and reputation of rich and poor must be alike guarded; but here proper government ends; civil law can of right go no further. But it may be asked, Is it not within the province of civil law to forbid and punish adultery, and to prohibit prostitution? Certainly it is, but only because these things cannot be practiced without infringing upon the rights of some whom the government is bound to protect. Adultery is a violation of the marriage contract; therefore it is not only the right, but it is the duty, of the State to forbid and to punish it. Likewise fornication imposes upon the community criminals and paupers, besides unnameable evils; therefore the State must forbid and punish it. It has been truly said that “liberty is a circle bounded on every side by the rights of others,” and when anyone oversteps those bounds it is the province of the government to restrain him, but not otherwise.
