We object to the teaching of religion in the public schools, not because religion is not a good thing, neither because it is not a necessary thing, but because it is not necessary that it should be taught in the public schools, and because from the very nature of the case it cannot be so taught. In the first place, before any religion can be taught it must be embodied in a creed. That creed will of course reflect the opinions of the majority. But while majority rule (not majority creed) is the correct principle, that which the majority decrees is not always right, it is not always justice. Many examples of this might be cited. Majorities have no right to interfere where God has left man free. Every man has certain inalienable rights; among them are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. To interfere with a man's religion is to deprive him of these rights. God has set before men light and darkness, life and death, and has left them free to choose. It is not for others to say what they shall choose, and every parent has a right to say in what religion his children shall be instructed. Therefore it is not the province of the State to teach religion, neither indeed can it be.
