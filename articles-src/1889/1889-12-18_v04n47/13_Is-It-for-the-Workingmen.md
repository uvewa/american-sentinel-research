# Is It for the Workingmen?

If anyone doubts that the advocates of Sunday law are actuated primarily, yea, almost solely, by a zeal to secure a day of rest for workingmen, let them read the following preamble and resolutions adopted not long since by a Methodist conference in Wisconsin. It is true that no mention is made of the “civil aspect of the day,” and that it is treated as a wholly religious question, but this is easily accounted for by the fact that those who framed the resolutions had not been properly educated in American Sabbath Union tactics. The preamble and resolutions, which were adopted without debate, are as follows:—

> “We are pained to notice that there has been a growing disregard for its observance and sacredness, which we believe is largely occasioned by foreign immigration, the avarice of large corporations, and the insatiable desire of the people for amusement and pleasure.

> “If something is not done immediately, we fear that a continental Sabbath, with all its evils, will be the result. Its sacred observance is demanded by the laws of our land, and no law should be allowed to be broken with impunity, especially one which is so intimately connected with the well-being of our people. Thus the laws of our land, as well as the laws of God, are being violated by the publication of the Sunday newspaper, the running of Sunday trains, Sunday excursions, picnics, base-ball games, opening of saloons and beer-gardens on the Lord’s day, with many other things, which are only winked at by many of our city authorities, who are more desirous of reelection than they are to see our laws enforced. Finally, it is a source of alarm to us that our government sets an example in violating the sanctity of the Sabbath by requiring that post-offices be opened for the delivery of mail, thus keeping an army of workmen from enjoying their God-given rights; therefore,
> *Resolved,* That, as ministers of this Conference, we will discountenance any violation of the sacredness of this day, by example as well as by precept, and we will aid to the extent of our ability all those who are striving to have righteous laws enacted for its proper observance, and who are also seeking to have these laws enforced which are already upon the statute- book.
> *Resolved,* That the publication of a Sunday newspaper is becoming a great factor in the destruction of the sacredness of this day, and that we will show our disapproval of this growing evil by neither reading nor advertising in those papers which publish a Sunday edition.
> *Resolved,* That, as a church, we disapprove of the course of our government in requiring the distribution of the mail on the Sabbath-day, and that we will do all in our power to have this evil removed.
> *Resolved,* That the open saloon and theater, picnics, excursions, and base-ball games, are violations of the sanctity of the Sabbath, and as such Christian people should be united in their efforts to have them removed from our midst.
Daniel Dougherty, in his address at the Baltimore centennial, said that in colonial times “the only religious martyrs in America were Catholics. They were spurned, slandered, villified, and the highest honors of the republic denied them by a prejudice as strong as a constitutional enactment.” It is true that the Puritan governors of Massachusetts, Belcher and Endicott, persecuted the Catholics, but the Puritans persecuted the Quakers even to the extent of hanging some of them. Anne Hutchinson and Mary Dyer were persecuted by the Puritans; Roger Williams was driven into exile, and Corey was pressed to death by the Puritans for refusing to testify. There was nothing done to the Catholics in colonial days that was worse than these cruelties. In later times a Catholic religious asylum was burned by a mob in Charleston, Mass.—a foul deed but not worse than the sacking of the home for colored children by the Catholic mob during the draft and riots of 1863. The truth is that the bigotry, ignorance, and brutality in America have not been confined either to Protestant or Catholic circles. Abner Kneeland was mobbed and jailed in Boston for editing a deistical newspaper; Garrison was mobbed for publishing an anti-slavery journal. Both in Europe and America bigotry, brutality, superstition, and ignorance have committed awful crimes, and neither the Protestant nor Catholic Church -can show clean hands in this respect. Where power and opportunity have been present persecution has done its work in both churches.— *Oregonian.*

The first aniversary of the American Sabbath Union will be held in New York City from December 9 to 11. From its deliberations may be expected to go forth a grand raid on Congress for Sunday legislation, encouraged by the decision of the late Catholic congress at Baltimore to join anti-Catholics in the Sunday crusade.

Note.—No papers are sent by the publishers of the American Sentinel to people who have not subscribed for it. If the Sentinel comes to one who has not subscribed for it, he may know that it is sent him by some friend, and that he will not be called upon by the publishers to pay for the same.

The field secretary of the so-called American Sabbath Union has a new grievance against the friends of the Sentinel. It is that “they circulate a petition which gives no hint that it is in the interests of the *Saturday Sabbath.”* And pray why should it give any such hint when it has no more to do with the “Saturday Sabbath” than it has with any other day? Does the worthy secretary discover something in that petition which is not stated upon its face? How in the world can it be in the interests of the “Saturday Sabbath” if it gives no hint of it? Surely Mr. Crafts is getting a little “rattled” because of opposition to his pet scheme for national religious legislation.

In his annual report Governor Thomas, of Utah, says:—

> “I do not hesitate to say that any temporizing policy which leaves the ‘church ’ in a position to control the political policy of the Territory is only delaying the final settlement, and that future legislation should be aimed at the political power of the church, which has been the main pillar of its strength in Utah.”

And political power will make any church dangerous to a free State. We do not mean by this that Christians can take no part in the affairs of government, or that men should not act conscientiously in political matters, but simply that churches and ministers have no right to meddle with politics as churches and ministers. An intriguing, wire-pulling, scheming, political church of any great numerical strength is a curse to any country.

Some time since the Los Angeles *Tribune,* in giving some report of a sermon by Rev. S. J. Carroll, said: “In speaking of a national Sunday law he maintained that the mixture of religion and government had resulted in evil from the time of Constantine down to the Puritans.” We thought the sentiment good and quoted it, but along comes the *California Christian Advocate* with a protest, and an explanation that Mr. Carroll didn’t say it, or didn’t mean it if he did. It says:—

> “The truth is that Mr. Carroll incidentally made a remark to the effect that he was opposed to any union of Church and State, but he very urgently plead in the same sermon for the American National Sunday, and he strongly pleaded for the right of every laboring man to one undisturbed Sunday, protected by law both from the greed that would drive him to toil and the desecration and tumult of excursions, picnics, base-ball, etc.”

Well, Mr. Carroll has then just what he wants. There is now no law in any State in this Union to compel any man to work on Sunday if he doesn’t want to, and as for excursions and baseball, he need not so much as see either of them. If he don’t go on the excursions they need not trouble him, and if he don’t go to the ballgrounds, and don’t read the base-ball news the next morning, he need not so much as know that people are playing ball on Sunday. If Mr. Carroll is really opposed to Church and State he cannot afford to favor Sunday legislation, for in it are the seeds of such union.

According to Ex-Governor Sherman, of Iowa, Sunday laws contributed to the result of the late election in that State. Of course the liquor men are fast to claim that the anti-prohibition sentiment did it, but after mentioning other causes, the ex-governor is reported to have said:—

> “Many liberal-minded American-born citizens voted the Democratic ticket in resentment of their liberties by the enactment of stringent Sunday laws.”

For the present politicians in Iowa and Ohio will be a little shy of religious legislation, even as they have been in California since 1882, when General Stoneman was elected governor of the State on the anti-Sunday-law issue.

Notwithstanding representations to the contrary, the American Sentinel is strictly nonpartisan and non-sectarian. Its object and principles are clearly set forth in the prospectus printed at the foot of this page, and it has never turned aside either to set forth the religious opinions of its editors or to attack the opinions of others, farther than has been necessary in defending the Constitution as it is, so far as regards religion or religious tests, against the attacks of those who are seeking to have it changed in the interests of their sectarian schemes. The editors of the Sentinel have decided opinions upon all religious questions, but that fact does not make the paper a denominational organ, as everybody of intelligence who is acquainted with the paper knows, and every fair- minded man who has read it must admit. Representations to the contrary are falsehoods set afloat for the purpose of exciting prejudice by those who find themselves unable to answer the Sentinel’s arguments.

In an impassioned plea for a Sunday law a correspondent of the Riverside, Cal., *Press* says:

> “No human Sabbath legislation deals with a citizen’s private life. Until he does that which interferes with the comfort, peace, happiness, or prosperity of another, no human hand can touch him.”

Let us examine this statement a little and see what it is worth. We happen to have before us reports of over twenty cases of Sunday-law prosecutions and convictions in Arkansas, and in almost every case the only offense committed was doing some quiet work, such as plowing in a field, digging a few potatoes for dinner, hoeing in the garden, painting a building, gathering peaches, etc., etc. Possibly these things do not belong to private life, but if they don’t we would like to know what does.

Only recently the papers have reported similar cases from Georgia and Tennessee. In the former State one man was fined $25 and costs, amounting in all to $46, for cutting some stove-wood on Sunday; while another man was sent to the chain-gang for a year, for digging a ditch on Sunday to drain the water out of his cellar. In this case a so-called minister of the gospel was the complaining witness. Only a few months ago a man in Massachusetts was arrested and fined for hauling a load of hay on Sunday to save it from a threatened rain.

These are only a few of many cases, not properly of prosecution for violation of law, but of persecution for conscience’ sake, for the real offense of most of these men was not in working on Sunday (for others in the same neighborhood who work habitually on that day were not molested), but in not working upon the preceding day. They were, with two or three exceptions, Seventh-day Baptists and Seventh-day Adventists, and their real offense was daring to differ from their neighbors in faith and practice. And yet of a law which makes such things possible, the correspondent of the *Press* before referred to says, “It is not a ‘religious ordinance,’ but a civil one, inasmuch as it deals alone with the *civil* Sabbath or ‘rest-day.’” We are sick and tired of such twaddle. When shall we hear the last of it?

We learn from the Oakland *Times* that Rev. N. R. Johnston, of this city, together with Rev. Dr. Briggs, of Pacific Grove, and Rev. A. Calhoun, of San Jose, have been appointed a committee of the American Sabbath Union to organize local and auxiliary unions for the revival and enforcement of Sunday legislation. Mr. Johnston announces that he will “answer calls for service in public Sabbath-law meetings, or to preach on the Sabbath question.”

A personal acquaintance with one of these gentlemen, Mr. Johnston, justifies us in expressing the opinion that no better man could have been selected as a member of this committee. Though socially a very estimable man, this gentleman is a thorough National Reformer, with all that the term implies. Though exceedingly mild and gentle in private conversation, he is so biased by his religion, inherited from the Covenanters, that he can see no reason why if a theocracy was good for the Jews it would not be equally good for us; nor why if it was right anciently to put men to death for Sabbath-breaking, it would not be the proper thing to do now. In short, Mr. Johnston cannot see the difference between a divinely established theocracy, administered by inspired men, and a man-made theocracy, so called, administered by uninspired, and too often narrow and bigoted, or even evil and designing, men. It is certainly fit that he should be a member of this committee.

The story has been telegraphed from New York and published in some of the daily papers, that Col. Elliott F. Shepard, of the New York *Mail and Express,* offered some years ago to bribe the sultan of Turkey for $1,000,000 to turn Christian. The story is scarcely credible, and yet the idea is no more absurd than is the National-Reform-American-Sabbath-Union scheme of making men moral and the country Christian by civil law.

We have received from A. L. Anthony, Yountville, Cal., a copy of “The Ideal,” one of the most complete pocket memorandum books and business guides which we have ever seen. “The Ideal” is accurately described in an advertisement on the *seventh* page of this paper. [361]
