It is argued by the advocates of Sunday laws that what they call the "continental sabbath" is exceedingly demoralizing and fends greatly to crime. France is frequently referred to as a country which has suffered a great deal from this "continental sabbath." On this point the following testimony from the late Dr. Guthrie of Edinburgh, who, by the way was a strict Presbyterian, is worthy of note. He says:—

> "I counted on one occasion in Paris thirty-three places of amusement open on the Sabbath-day. Coming home, in one hour I saw in London and Edinburgh, with all our churches and schools of piety, more drunkenness than I saw in five long months in guilty Paris."

This is significant, when we consider that Paris has no Sunday law, while Edinburgh has a strict Sunday law, and is noted for its Sunday-keeping; and while London is referred to as an exemplary city as to Sunday laws.
