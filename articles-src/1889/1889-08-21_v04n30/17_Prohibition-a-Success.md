The *Christian Nation* of July 24,1889, says:—

> "The history of America is the history of the success and beneficence of the principle of prohibition."

Well, if prohibition is a success, why is such a contest waged to get constitutional prohibition State and national? But if it be only the *principle* of prohibition; without the prohibition itself, that is a success, then we should like to know how the principle can be a success without carrying with it the fact.
