The following letter from a minister to one of our correspondents in Maine, is of interest:—

> "I am much pleased to receive the paper you so kindly sent. I am in full harmony with its antiChurch and State sentiments, and have for many years worked on that line of thought, ten years ago getting fifteen hundred names to a petition to Congress to move for a Constitutional amendment prohibiting all States and municipalities from any and all religious legislation and from any sectarian use of money. I always preach of this in every place where I live, as I have here.

> "The Sentinel has given me very desirable information and thus helped me to better work. I wish it was in every family in the country. It has so clearly exposed the bad methods and falsehoods of those who are trying to bring the country into that worst of bondage, ecclesiastical."
May this brother's number increase mightily.
