# A “Theological Trust.”

The subject of trusts is attracting considerable attention at present, owing to the number of new trusts being formed in addition to those already in operation. Briefly speaking, a trust is a monopoly; because it is an attempt upon the part of those concerned in it, be they one or many, to secure the control of any certain article upon which they have previously agreed, and by means of this control, to force those desiring the article in question to obtain it solely at the hands of the corporation or organization representing the trust. This is why we have coal trusts, sugar trusts, gas trusts, salt trusts, oil trusts, etc.

The latest trust, however, and one which, by the way, indicates much more in the direction of evil results than those which have just been mentioned, is the associating together of certain individuals and organizations for the formation of a grand religious trust. Of course, they don’t designate their work by such a name, but this is just what it amounts to in the outcome.

The most active factor in this arrangement is the National Reform Association, which for years has been laboring to bring about a condition of affairs in which all the *Christian* laws, institutions, and usages of this government should be placed “on an undeniable *legal basis* in the fundamental law of the land.” It has recently been joined in its work by the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union, and by the Prohibition party; the American Sabbath Union has also shown strong proclivities in this direction. Under the stimulus of these combined influences, a trust of gigantic magnitude is appearing, which, in its Heaven-daring attempt to coerce the consciences of men manifests more of the spirit of monopoly in this direction than has been witnessed since the Great Romish trust of the Middle Ages suspended active operations.

But the particular feature in which this afore said religious trust proposes to distance all its worldly competitors is this; While they design simply to supply the demand as fast as created, these self-appointed custodians of public morals propose to force their religious wares upon the market, and then, through the power of civil law, to compel everybody to become purchasers.

This is an era of trusts, and the Americans are a “trusting” people, It is possible, however, to become too confiding in such cases as this. Unless American citizens are tired of liberty of thought and freedom of conscience, it will be well for them to turn a deaf ear to all the pleadings of the National Reformers and their allies, who seek to accomplish by religious legislation what they are powerless to perform through moral suasion. True religion and true Christianity have no need of a political “combine” in order to reach the hearts pf the people. Down with all trusts in general, and the Religious Political National Reform trust in particular. J. W. Scoles [239-240]

Note.—No papers are sent by the publishers of the American Sentinel to people who have not subscribed for it. If the Sentinel comes to one who has not subscribed for it, he may know that it is sent him by some friend, and that he will not be called upon by the publishers to pay for the same.

At a mass meeting held in the First Congregational Church, Oakland, Cal., Monday evening, August 5, which was addressed by Dr. Wilbur F. Crafts, the petition for a National Sunday law was defeated instead of being endorsed.

August 3 to 5, Dr. W. F. Crafts spent in San Francisco and Oakland. He spoke at Howard St. M. E. Church at 11 a. m., and at United Presbyterian Church at 8 p. m., Sunday; and to the San Francisco pastors at the Y. M. C. A. Hall, Monday, at 3 p. m., and at First Congregational Church, Oakland, Monday evening. We shall notice his speeches in future issues of the Sentinel.

The *Christian Nation* of July 24,1889, says:—

> “The history of America is the history of the success and beneficence of the principle of prohibition.”

Well, if prohibition is a success, why is such a contest waged to get constitutional prohibition State and national? But if it be only the *principle* of prohibition; without the prohibition itself, that is a success, then we should like to know how the principle can be a success without carrying with it the fact.

It is argued by the advocates of Sunday laws that what they call the “continental sabbath” is exceedingly demoralizing and fends greatly to crime. France is frequently referred to as a country which has suffered a great deal from this “continental sabbath.” On this point the following testimony from the late Dr. Guthrie of Edinburgh, who, by the way was a strict Presbyterian, is worthy of note. He says:—

> “I counted on one occasion in Paris thirty-three places of amusement open on the Sabbath-day. Coming home, in one hour I saw in London and Edinburgh, with all our churches and schools of piety, more drunkenness than I saw in five long months in guilty Paris.”

This is significant, when we consider that Paris has no Sunday law, while Edinburgh has a strict Sunday law, and is noted for its Sunday-keeping; and while London is referred to as an exemplary city as to Sunday laws.

The *Christian Nation* of July 24, has the following:—

> “The government of the United States is a grand government. The rich young ruler who came to Christ was also a model young man, and the Lord loved him, but said to him: ‘One thing thou lackest.’ And so we, remembering our allegiance to a power that is above all human authority, are compelled to say to our government, adopting the Lord’s words to the young ruler,* ‘One thing thou lackest; put away thy interests in the American saloon and prohibit it forever, and thou shalt be saved.”*

There is so much evil in this paragraph that we have not the time nor the space to expose the half of it. And not by any means the least wicked thing about it is its outrageous assumption of the place of Christ, premising salvation; and in addition to that, exalting itself above Christ in promising salvation by works. The whole National Reform system is only the Papacy over again.

The following letter from a minister to one of our correspondents in Maine, is of interest:—

> “I am much pleased to receive the paper you so kindly sent. I am in full harmony with its antiChurch and State sentiments, and have for many years worked on that line of thought, ten years ago getting fifteen hundred names to a petition to Congress to move for a Constitutional amendment prohibiting all States and municipalities from any and all religious legislation and from any sectarian use of money. I always preach of this in every place where I live, as I have here.

> “The Sentinel has given me very desirable information and thus helped me to better work. I wish it was in every family in the country. It has so clearly exposed the bad methods and falsehoods of those who are trying to bring the country into that worst of bondage, ecclesiastical.”
May this brother’s number increase mightily.
