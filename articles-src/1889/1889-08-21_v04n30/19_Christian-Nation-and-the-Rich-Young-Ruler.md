The *Christian Nation* of July 24, has the following:—

> "The government of the United States is a grand government. The rich young ruler who came to Christ was also a model young man, and the Lord loved him, but said to him: 'One thing thou lackest.' And so we, remembering our allegiance to a power that is above all human authority, are compelled to say to our government, adopting the Lord's words to the young ruler,* 'One thing thou lackest; put away thy interests in the American saloon and prohibit it forever, and thou shalt be saved."*

There is so much evil in this paragraph that we have not the time nor the space to expose the half of it. And not by any means the least wicked thing about it is its outrageous assumption of the place of Christ, premising salvation; and in addition to that, exalting itself above Christ in promising salvation by works. The whole National Reform system is only the Papacy over again.
