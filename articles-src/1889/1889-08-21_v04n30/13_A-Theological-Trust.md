The subject of trusts is attracting considerable attention at present, owing to the number of new trusts being formed in addition to those already in operation. Briefly speaking, a trust is a monopoly; because it is an attempt upon the part of those concerned in it, be they one or many, to secure the control of any certain article upon which they have previously agreed, and by means of this control, to force those desiring the article in question to obtain it solely at the hands of the corporation or organization representing the trust. This is why we have coal trusts, sugar trusts, gas trusts, salt trusts, oil trusts, etc.

The latest trust, however, and one which, by the way, indicates much more in the direction of evil results than those which have just been mentioned, is the associating together of certain individuals and organizations for the formation of a grand religious trust. Of course, they don't designate their work by such a name, but this is just what it amounts to in the outcome.

The most active factor in this arrangement is the National Reform Association, which for years has been laboring to bring about a condition of affairs in which all the *Christian* laws, institutions, and usages of this government should be placed "on an undeniable *legal basis* in the fundamental law of the land." It has recently been joined in its work by the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, and by the Prohibition party; the American Sabbath Union has also shown strong proclivities in this direction. Under the stimulus of these combined influences, a trust of gigantic magnitude is appearing, which, in its Heaven-daring attempt to coerce the consciences of men manifests more of the spirit of monopoly in this direction than has been witnessed since the Great Romish trust of the Middle Ages suspended active operations.

But the particular feature in which this afore said religious trust proposes to distance all its worldly competitors is this; While they design simply to supply the demand as fast as created, these self-appointed custodians of public morals propose to force their religious wares upon the market, and then, through the power of civil law, to compel everybody to become purchasers.

This is an era of trusts, and the Americans are a "trusting" people, It is possible, however, to become too confiding in such cases as this. Unless American citizens are tired of liberty of thought and freedom of conscience, it will be well for them to turn a deaf ear to all the pleadings of the National Reformers and their allies, who seek to accomplish by religious legislation what they are powerless to perform through moral suasion. True religion and true Christianity have no need of a political "combine" in order to reach the hearts pf the people. Down with all trusts in general, and the Religious Political National Reform trust in particular. J. W. Scoles [239-240]
