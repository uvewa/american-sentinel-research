A State Sunday convention was held in Cleveland, O., December 16 and 17, by the Cleveland Ministers' Union and the Ohio Sabbath Union. It is significant that in the program Mrs. Bateham's address was preceded by an address by the editor of the *Catholic Universe,* on "Roman Catholic Co-operation in the Sunday-Rest Movement."
