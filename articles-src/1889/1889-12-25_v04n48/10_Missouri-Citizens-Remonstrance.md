A Washington dispatch of December 4 says:—

> "Senator Cockrell to-day presented a memorial of citizens of Ralls and Pike Counties, Missouri, remonstrating against the passage of any bill for the observance of Sunday or any other religious institution or rite, and also against any amendment to the Constitution providing for religious instruction in the public schools. It prays that the government be kept strictly secular, and that Church and State be entirely separate."

Those Missouri people give evidence of a just conception of what civil government should be.
