The effort to secure a national Sunday law which will result in the revival of the methods of the Inquisition, is gaining strength. Although the Blair Sunday-Rest bill died with the last Congress, the work of circulating Sunday-law petitions has been pushed with redoubled energy. The advocates of the movement are more thoroughly organized than ever, and opposition has tended only to make them more determined and more unscrupulous, although more discreet in their methods. If the present Congress does not witness the passage of a Sunday bill more stringent, yet more plausibly worded, than that introduced by Senator Blair, it will not be from lack of determination on the part of the National Reform Association, the American Sabbath Union, and allied organizations.
