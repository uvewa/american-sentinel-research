> "A few years ago," says the *Press and Horticulturist,* of Riverside, this State, "we fought a hard fight to prevent the abrogation of the State Sunday law, largely, it is true, because it gave us the only State restriction of the liquor traffic which we had. It was lost, mainly through the failure of radical temperance people to see the practical value of the law as a temperance measure, and no party can afford to champion its restoration, in view of that experience."

Probably the reason why "radical temperance people" failed "to see the value" of the California Sunday law "as a temperance measure," was that it had no value in that direction. And yet with characteristic consistency, some of those same "radical temperance people" accuse us of being in league not only with the saloons, but with every other evil, because we oppose Sunday laws.
