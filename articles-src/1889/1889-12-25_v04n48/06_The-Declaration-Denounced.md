# The Declaration Denounced.

The object of the American Sabbath Union, whose work was practically indorsed by one of the resolutions passed by the W. C. T. U. of this county at its late session, is clearly stated by Rev. W. D. Gray, Secretary of the Missouri Sabbath Union, as follows:—

> “I do not believe that governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed, and so the object of this movement is an attempt to change that feature of our fundamental law.”

Can patriotic, fair-minded American citizens indorse such doctrines? Are we to practically resign the political and religious liberty bought by our forefathers at the price of so much blood and treasure? If the present combination among a vast number of religious and quasi-political organizations shall be successful in passing some such law as the Blair Sunday-Rest Bill, it may be justly feared that the future measures of this government will soon be controlled by the same influence. All religious despotisms originate by combination and influence, and when that influence begins to be felt in the politics of a country the civil power soon bends to it.

The results of such action in other nations furnishes to us an awful example of the consequences. Do religious enthusiasts, who are working for such a law, realize that they are surely drifting towards the dogma of the “Divine right of Kings,” instead of upholding the grand principles of the Declaration of Independence, which asserts that “Governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed?” When one of the leading advocates of such a measure sees clearly that the work they are doing conflicts with the very fundamental principles on which our government is based, it is time that fair-minded Christian people pause and take their bearings. Religious and civil liberty are guaranteed by our Constitution, and the American is not a good citizen who seeks to subvert either.—*Daily Humboldt Standard. *[255-256]

At the Young Men’s Christian Association rooms, 3 p. m., August 5, the Ministers’ Association of San Francisco were addressed by the American Sabbath Union on organization. In the opening prayer, it was prayed that the Lord would “hasten the time when all Sabbath desecration shall be stopped and the time when this shall be a nation whose God is the Lord.” Now desecrate is defined to mean “to divest of a sacred character or office; to divert from a sacred purpose or appropriation; to treat in a sacrilegious manner. Neither that prayer nor the definition of the term used in the prayer can be made to fit onto a civil Sabbath.

The American Sabbath Union argues that all Sunday mails can be absolutely stopped because such “emergency letters” as would have to be delivered on Sunday, may go by telegraph on Saturday and such as would have to be sent on Sunday to reach their destination on Monday, can go by telegraph on Monday morning. But this does not meet the case of such emergency letters as could reach their destination, say one hundred or one hundred and fifty miles, within the Sunday hours, and to meet this demand the American Sabbath Union says he would have “one telegraph operator sitting with his family, but within reach of a bell so that he could easily be called.” But in such a system as this, there is such an assumption of overlordship as does not comport well with the spirit of free institutions.

What kind of a religious worship do the Sunday-law workers intend shall be protected by their national Sunday law? Is it the Chinese religious worship? Would the Chinese be allowed to conduct their idolatrous worship, by noisy processions with dragons and Chimeras dire? It is certain that that would not suit the ideas of the Sunday-law workers as comporting with the proper observance of the day. But that is religious worship. And if it should be objected against as not being the kind of religious worship contemplated in the Act, the United States courts would be forced into the necessity of settling religious disputes, and of deciding what is religious worship. And if it should be pleaded, what is manifestly designed in the Act, that it is Christian worship only, that is contemplated, and that is to be protected, and the courts should so decide, then there is an established religion at once. Which proves again that the establishment of a national religion will be the inevitable result of a national Sunday law.

When it is proposed to stop all Sunday trains, boats, and means of distant transportation, a great many people have asked the question involved in the suggestion of President Ledyard of the Michigan Central, that if your son or daughter, or wife or husband, were lying at the point of death, and you were on the way to be with them in their last moments and the train which was carrying you should stop at midnight, Saturday night, and lie there for twenty-four hours, you would be ready to say that such Sunday laws were not the best thing in the world. The American Sabbath Union meets this suggestion by saying:—

> “It is true, the dying one might lose some sentimental comfort by your not being there, but your presence could not prolong his life even if you had been able to reach him, and therefore no great harm would be done.”

This shows that the Sunday-law managers have degenerated into the hard, unfeeling spirit of the Pharisees of Christ’s day, who forbade his healing the sick and ministering to the afflicted on the Sabbath. And it is time that these were learning the direction of Christ to those, “Go ye and learn what that meaneth, I will have mercy and not sacrifice.” Matt. 9:13.

At the Ocean Grove and other great campmeetings and places of religious resort, Sunday is always the greatest day. The best speakers are expected to speak then, the best meetings are expected to be had, the most solemn and lasting impressions made, but yet the gates are rigidly shut. No person from the outside can come in at all.. People who are busily engaged at their work all the week are shut away from the meetings on Sunday. However impressive the services, however grand the sermons, none of it is for them. It seems that at those places the effort and the expectation is to call only the righteous to repentance. Sinners can shift for themselves. If it were sinners that they wished to call to repentance assuredly Sunday is the day when the gates should be widest open and the richest welcome extended to all. That is the day when more people can be reached than any other; because by the Sunday laws they are compelled to be idle. But instead of doing this, the managers of the great religious meetings closely shut all approaches on Sunday. They compel the wicked to be idle, then shut the gates so they can’t go to the meetings and then declaim against the increasing Sabbath desecration. How can it be otherwise? The wicked are not allowed to work on Sunday, they are not allowed to go to the meetings on Sunday. They have to fill up the time some way, and if they fill it with dissipation who is most to blame? It would be well for the managers of these places of religious resort to bear in mind that the work of the gospel of Christ is “not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.”

Not long since there was considerable agitation for a little while over the Press dispatches from Korea, stating that Mrs. Hattie Heron, late of Jonesboro, Tennessee, was under sentence of death in Korea for teaching the doctrines of Christianity. Upon this, a correspondent sent us the following brief remarks, which we think the reader will appreciate in more ways than one:—

> “Inasmuch as ‘the powers that be are ordained of God,’ and as every soul is counseled to be ‘subject unto the higher powers,’ I suppose that those people who hold to the theory that civil government has a right to enter the realm of religion and enforce, under pains and penalties, its conceptions of purely religious requirements, and that we can therefore never be justified in refusing to obey its mandates in this respect, would have advised Mrs. Heron, and would still advise others of similar Christian zeal, to stop preaching Christ in Korea, and to absolutely refuse to carry out the Lord’s commission, ‘Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature,’ until such time as ‘the powers that be,’ might see fit to look upon it more favorably.”

We think so. And we might add, that if only our States were independent powers the persecution of this Tennessee lady in Korea might offset the persecution of those people in Tennessee who choose not to keep the “Christian” Sabbath. And if that in Korea can be counted persecution, what is this in Tennessee?

The *Voice* of October 3, 1887, said:—

> “Every department of life must be made to conform to the principles of Christianity. The Saviour refused the kingdoms of the world on Satan’s terms. He will have them on his *own* terms. For this conquest the clergy are needed. They lift the governments of earth with a leverage that has for its fulcrum the throne of God.”

That is all true as it stands, but it is not true as the *Voice* intends it; because it presently inquired, “Why should the clergy lose interest in secular things?” thus showing that it is by political agitation and legislation—religious prohibition “civil” Sabbath observance, etc.,—that they are supposed to lift the kingdoms of the world. But it is not by legislation that any such thing as that can ever be accomplished.

It is true that this is to be done by the power of God, but this power is exerted by his holy Spirit and not by legislatures. It is manifested through the gospel and not through law.

Here is a quotation that is worth reading just now:—

> “Nations and kingdoms are to be the servitors of the church, with its Bible, its sanctuary, and its Sabbaths. Human governments and races and generations are to be the enginery and the apparatus, the forces and influences through which the church shall ascend to dominion over the world, and those nations and kingdoms that refuse this grand service to the church of God shall perish and be utterly wasted.”

Some of our readers may think that this is quoted from some Roman Catholic bishop or priest or paper or book, but it isn’t. It is quoted from Rev. Byron F. Sunderland, D. D., of Washington, D. C., a Presbyterian, and a member of the American Sabbath Union, in a sermon preached in Washington City, and printed in the *Christian Statesman* of June 27, 1889. Then after nearly two pages of the same sort, he closed up with this:—

> “Over the chasm of a century, I see a mighty arch. On that arch must be graven an inscription. What shall it be? ‘This is the gateway to the favor of God and all human felicity?’ or this other mournful epitaph which the world shall read with sorrow of despair: ‘Here sank the American Republic, the most favored, the proudest, the grandest of all the unions of the earth because she derided God, and despised the service of his ever-living church’?”

And that shows plain enough what all *his* demand for Sunday legislation is for. He wants this government to serve the church.
