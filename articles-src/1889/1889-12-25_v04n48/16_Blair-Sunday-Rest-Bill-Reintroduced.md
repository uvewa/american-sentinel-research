Senator Blair is on hand with his little grist of bills for Congress. On the 9th inst., he introduced a bill "to secure to the people the privileges of rest and religious worship, free from disturbance by others, on the first day of the week." We quote from the newspaper report. It will be noticed that this bill was introduced the same day that the American Sabbath Union met in its first annual convention in New York. It is fair to suppose that the bill which Mr. Blair introduced is one which had received the approval of his employers, and that they will lobby for it without any mental reservation. If the above quotation gives the substance of the bill, it is a most hypocritical fraud; for there is not a man who does not know that in this country every man has the privilege of resting and worshiping on the first day of the week if he wishes to. Mr. Blair seems to be thoroughly imbued with the medieval idea that government is only for the majority.

The Rev. Dr. Dorchester, from whose book, "Romanism *versus* the Public-School System," we have quoted at length elsewhere in this paper, says (p. 227) that if all classes are to use the public schools, several conditions must be observed, among which he cites the following:—

> "There must be no religious instruction in them. If attempted it will be likely to savor of some particular sect. To attempt it would be inconsistent with the American system of government, and perilous to the successful administration of the school system. A purely secular basis is the only basis on which all citizens can unite. Then no one's doctrines are assailed or slurred. There is abundant opportunity for parents, Sunday-schools, and churches, to look after the religious education, the public school occupying only about one-sixth of the hours of the year. The public school can succeed only on a completely nonsectarian absolutely secular basis. On any other plan it is doomed."

According to this, and it cannot be denied, Senator Blair, although the professed friend of education, is working for the overthrow of our public-school system. This is a fact, although he is doubtless sincere in his work. The country has less to fear from plotting Jesuits than from professed Protestant National Reformers.
