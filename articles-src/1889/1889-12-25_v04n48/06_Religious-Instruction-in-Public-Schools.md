# Religious instruction in Public Schools.

The following from "Romanism *versus* the Public School System," a book written by Daniel Dorchester, D.D., and published by the Methodist Book Concern, Phillips & Hunt, New York, although directed especially against the teaching of Catholic doctrine in the public schools, applies equally well to Protestant teaching. We bespeak for it a careful reading:—

The provisions of the National and State Constitutions are such that the matter of religious exercises in the public schools is restricted within very narrow limits, specific instruction being ruled out.

The Constitution of the United States says:—

> "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof."

Massachusetts says: "No subject shall be hurt, molested, or restrained in his person, liberty, or estate, for worshiping God in the manner most agreeable to the dictates of his own conscience, or for his religious profession or sentiment."

Its Bill of Rights says also: "All religious sects and denominations demeaning themselves peaceably and as good citizens of the commonwealth, shall be equally under the protection of the law; and no subordination of any one sect or denomination to another shall ever be established by law."

A statute, in the same spirit, forbids the introduction of any text-book "favoring the tenet of any particular sect of Christians." These are in harmony with the act of the people which, in 1833, finally destroyed the power of towns or the State to tax the people for the support of churches.

## An Able Discussion.

Said Rev. A. H. Quint, D.D. (*Congregationalist,* July 26, 1888), after quoting the foregoing:—

> "These provisions declare a perfect equality of religious denominations, that no one shall be put in power by law, and that no tenet of any sect shall be favored. This necessarily rules out of the schools religious instruction, if it is consistently carried out. A Romanist cannot impose his tenets upon a Protestant child, and a Protestant teacher cannot impose his tenets upon a Catholic child. A Baptist teacher cannot teach immersion, and a Congregational teacher cannot teach endless punishment. Whether we like this or not, it is he fact. No 'common law' even, no theory of some unwritten power in the State, can override the constitutional fetters which the American Revolution produced. No clearer authority is needed than that of Judge Story, in his opinion in the great Girard will case, where he declares this new limitation, and where he says, of the equality stated in the Pennsylvania Bill of Rights (like others), that 'the language must have been intended to extend equally to all sects, whether they believe in Christianity or not, whether they were Jews or infidels.'

> "It is not the spirit of American government for the State to select and pay, from public taxes, ministers of the gospel to preach even sound doctrine, however much it might be for the public good. On the same principle, it is not for the State to employ schoolteachers at the expense of the tax-payers to teach the gospel of Christ to children; and any religion less than that is not worth fighting over.
> "It has been said that the State has inherent right and duty to determine what the education of children shall be. There is much truth in this, but it needs very careful limitations. Did the Protestant world approve when the Catholic authorities in Italy (if I remember), seizing from his parents the Jewish boy Mortara, educated him in the Romanist faith? The truth is, the State must insist, for its own existence and welfare in a republic, on the instruction of children in all needed branches, and for the diffusion of general intelligence as against ignorance. This grand idea demands the school system; but let it stop when it interferes with religious faiths."
From these premises Dr. Quint reasons very conclusively that—

> "Any satisfactory religious instruction in public schools is absolutely impracticable, and we may as well acknowledge it. An avowedly secular system is far better for religion than a formal sham. We cannot teach the distinctive tenets of any Christian denomination. Then, without tenets, what is there to teach? Our own churches cannot consent to the Romanist papal authority as a tenet on one hand, nor to the denial of Christ's divinity on the other; and neither of these will leave the field to us, nor to all the denominations combined who hold the 'doctrines commonly called evangelical.' There is no possible common ground. Eliminate all except what all hold in common—Romanist, Protestant, indifferent, Jew, freethinker—and the remainder. Are majorities to rule? There is nothing more dangerous than majorities unfettered by constitutions.

> "It may be said that we have the Bible read in schools. A law of 855 required it, and a law of 1880 forbade any 'note or comment,' and excused from it all pupils whose parents objected to it. How much Bible is that? One teacher reads of Moses in the bulrushes and of David and Goliath; and another reads colorless psalms. Suppose the law be changed, and note and comment be made lawful—whose doctrine is to be taught by the teacher to our children?
> "No. The safest way, the wisest way, is to secularize the schools. It is simply asserting the American principle, that no church or anti-church shall use for its own purpose the public schools maintained by the taxation of the people. It makes them no more irreligious than a State blacksmith shop would be. It would teach the ordinary branches at the public expense, and leave religious teaching to parents, where God himself placed it. God established the family; men established the public-school system.
> "It must not be understood that secularizing the schools excludes teaching and training in the moral virtues. These lie at the basis of all beliefs or no beliefs. They enter necessarily into the government of every school, and the daily intercourse of one pupil with all other pupils. They cannot by any possibility be put out of sight. They are proper subjects of direct instruction. The Massachusetts Constitution, which prohibits so plainly the tenets of every sect and denomination, expressly directs all teachers to 'inculcate the principles of humanity and general benevolence, public and private charity, industry and frugality, honesty, and punctuality in their dealings; sincerity, good-humor, and all social affections and generous sentiments among the people.' Nor is there any doubt that this subject should be emphasized even farther than it now is."
It is plain that if all classes are to use the public school there must be no specific religious instruction. It cannot be imparted consistently with the American system of government. If religious instruction is given, it will be almost certain to savor of some particular sect; and moneys raised by taxation upon the whole people cannot be rightfully used for that purpose. Religious education must be taught elsewhere—in the church and the home. Neither the State, nor the church, nor the home singly, can do the whole. work, the complete work, of education.

The following from the *Christian Union* of December 12 will throw light upon the editorial elsewhere quoted from the *Catholic News,* and is worth reading on its own account at this time when there is a movement to give the church the chief control of the public schools:—

> "If it be true, as currently reported, that the Roman Catholic hierarchy, represented by such influential dignitaries as Bishops Ireland and Riordan, and even Cardinal Gibbons, are resisting the appointment of General Morgan as Indian commissioner and Dr. Dorchester as superintendent of Indian schools, on the ground that these gentlemen are hostile to the Roman Catholic Church, and are removing from office Roman Catholic appointees, the fact furnishes another argument against the anomalous system which has grown up in the Indian Bureau of *quasi*-partnership between the federal government and the churches in the work of education. It makes little difference in their bearing on that system whether the charges are true or false. If they are true, that an Indian commissioner can by virtue of his office work against a particular denomination is a serious objection to the system; if they are false, the fact that he can be subjected to groundless suspicions and false accusations in the faithful discharge of his duty, and that church influence can be brought to bear for the retention in office of incompetent officials, is an equally conclusive objection to the system. The contract school system is impaled on either horn of this dilemma. That system has grown up naturally, and cannot, probably, be abolished at a blow without serious injury; but the fact that it introduces sectarian strife in political administration should be of itself enough to make our Congress resolve to provide, at the earliest possible moment, in lieu of it, a system of education wholly under federal control and maintained at federal expense, leaving the churches independent of the State, and disentangled from all alliances with it, to do their religious work without either help or hindrance from the national government."
