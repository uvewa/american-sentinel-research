In the *Christian at Work's* report of the late meeting of the Evangelical Alliance, we find the following:—

> "Beginning with the first great need of the city, 'religious awakening,' Professor Ely, in a most admirably classified address, spoke at length on what he called a 'Renaissance of Nationalism.' 'The government,' he said, 'is a God-given agency for which we must work, and through which we must work, if ever we are to regenerate mankind. Of all the work that has been done, of all that can be done, for the elevation of humanity, the most successful work is legislative work.'"

This is a speech to fill the heart of the National Reformer with delight. The *Christian Nation* has told about *suppressing wickedness by law,* and now we are told about *regenerating humanity by law.* What use such folks have for the Bible we cannot see, for it knows of no means of regeneration except the Spirit of God. And yet National Reformers call themselves Christian, and their work a Christian reform!
