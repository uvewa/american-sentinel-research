The persecutions that have already taken place under the Sunday laws of Georgia, Tennessee, and Arkansas, give an intimation of what will result when a national Sunday law is enacted, the object of which, as Senator Blair says, is "to make efficient the Sunday-Rest laws of the States." These intimations are emphasized by the fact that leading National Reformers do not apologize for these persecutions, but uphold them as righteous acts.
