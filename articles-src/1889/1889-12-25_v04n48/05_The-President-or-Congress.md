# The President or Congress?

Under the above heading, the *Catholic News* of December 11 gives editorial utterance to the following, which contains some good points:—

> "Where does the power lie under the Constitution of the United States, in the President or in Congress? In clause after clause we find the powers of Congress expressed or restricted. As to the President, we find little. The amendments to the Constitution, among other things, enact that Congress shall make no law establishing a religion. This is definite. Then the question is whether the President can practically, without law or constitutional authority, make an established religion. Religious tests are abolished, but if the President can remove all office-holders of one religion, he violates the Constitution virtually, makes a religious test, and an established religion. Nor can the President escape responsibility by appointing a subordinate to do this work. To make an established religion it is not necessary to make the doctrines of one Protestant denomination the religion. It suffices that the mass of doctrines (including hostility to, and protest against, Catholicity) known as the Protestant religion is virtually established. This certainly has been done by Mr. Harrison so far as the Indian Department is concerned, and it is a constitutional question whether in this he does not lay himself open to impeachment. It may be said that the Protestant religion is not a recognized body of doctrines, or a sect, with government and organization. The reply is clear. This is not necessary. The term, 'the Protestant religion,' is one recognized in the statute- book and the legal decisions of nearly all the original thirteen States, and was understood perfectly by the men who framed the Constitution of the United States, and by men who called for the amendments. The first constitution of the State of South Carolina established the Protestant religion in distinct terms. No one was eligible to either House 'unless he be of the Protestant religion,' and it enacted in express terms: 'The Christian Protestant shall be deemed, and is hereby constituted and declared to be, the religion of this State.' North Carolina excluded from office every person 'who shall deny the truth of the Protestant religion.' New Hampshire required the governor and legislators to 'be of the Protestant religion.' The term was thus- fully recognized and understood.

> "Now, Mr. Harrison, acting through Messrs. Morgan and Dorchester, has actually made 'the Protestant religion' the religion of the United States, and made adherence to that religion a test. Both these steps are in direct violation of the Constitution of the United States, and a usurpation of powers not conferred upon him by that organic instrument. It remains to be seen whether this question shall be raised, and his conduct arraigned. If any of the patriotic feelings of our ancestors of 1789 remain, he will be called to a strict account. There must be no established religion in the United States, no religious test required of anyone fitted to hold office. The question is not a mere trifling one about one person in office or another, it touches the very essentials of the government under the Constitution of the United States."
If we could believe that the writer of the above was sincere, we could applaud him; but we are compelled to believe that the cause of his grievance is that President Harrison is inclined to favor the Protestant religion rather than the Catholic. We know that there are Catholics who are really Americans, who want no establishment of religion of any kind whatever in the United States; but we are certain that no Catholic newspaper would say a word against any exaltation its church might receive at the hands of the State. But the *News* is shrewd enough to see that a union of Church and State does not necessarily imply State recognition of some one denomination. It says: "To make an established religion it is not necessary to make the doctrines of one Protestant denomination the religion. It suffices that the mass of doctrines (including hostility to and protest against Catholicity) known as the Protestant religion is virtually established." This is true. And it is just as true that the recognition of so feeble a caricature of the Christian religion as would be exhibited by such a union of Protestants and Catholics as is proposed by National Reformers and many Protestant leaders, and by the Catholic laymen's congress, would be an establishment of religion, and a violation of the Constitution.
