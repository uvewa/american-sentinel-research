# Sunday Laws.

Rev. Wilbur F. Crafts of New York, field secretary of the American Sabbath Union, has been lecturing in Oakland and endeavoring to arouse a sentiment favorable to a national law prohibiting labor and traffic on the Sabbath day. Mr. Crafts argues it is “a theft and an outrage to steal a man’s Sabbath away from him.” Why more “a theft and an outrage” to steal a man’s Sabbath than to steal any other day? Further- more, why should the Sabbath of any particular sect be chosen as a day for compulsory rest? Under a democratic form of government every citizen is guaranteed the right to “life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.”

It is possible that if a national Sunday law is enacted many citizens would be deprived of privileges which now enable them to achieve happiness in the manner best suited to their convenience and desire. Such a law would certainly curtail their liberty. Why should the Jew and the Seventh-day Adventist be compelled by law to observe the Christian Sabbath as set apart in the calendar by a portion of the Christian churches?

Mr. Crafts might perhaps hold that the Christian Sabbath is, under the present régime, the most generally observed both as a religious form and as a day of rest from labor. Then what is the necessity for a national law? Those who prefer to devote Sunday to the worship of their God are privileged to do so; those who desire to wander out into the fields and the woods, or to congregate where music and rational recreation is offered as a relief from the cares and worry of the week, should not be deprived of that right. And it would seem from the tenor of Mr. Crafts’s arguments that it is this latter class who are to be forced to observe a day set apart by the Sabbatarians. It is not because the toiler is weary with his labor and needs rest one day in seven that this national Sabbath is to be established, but it is a step at least in the direction of compelling the toil-weary laborer to seek his rest in the churches of the Christian denominations, whether his inclinations are that way or not.

There is a tinge of puritanical tyranny in this effort to establish a national Sabbath, and it is an effort not in consonance with our institutions or the genius of the government under which we are living. Moreover, the proposition is sumptuary in its character and will not be approved by the majority of the people, as was evidenced by the vote of the congregation who had listened to Mr. Crafts’s arguments. The proposal that all traffic shall cease on the national Sabbath is one indication of the drift of the law. This would compel large numbers of people living in cities who now seek their Sunday recreation in the country to remain at home. The closing of all places of business and secular amusement on this particular day, deprives citizens of all opportunity to enjoy themselves unless they can find compensation for the deprivation in the churches or by pedestrian rambles perhaps, through the streets of the city in which they live or along the highways and by ways of their country homes.

As regards Mr. Crafts’s argument that a national Sunday law would put a stop to Sunday dissipation and riot, that is entirely beside the question. Dissipation and riot is no worse on one day than on another, and there are laws prohibiting such misdemeanors and crimes whenever committed. The police are paid to enforce the laws and on this score at least there is no necessity for a national Sunday law. Certainly if the Sabbatarians cannot offer better arguments than those advanced by Mr. Crafts, they have very little prospect of ever being able to convince honest, fair-thinking men and women of the justice of their cause.— *Oakland Morning Times, August 7, 1889.*
