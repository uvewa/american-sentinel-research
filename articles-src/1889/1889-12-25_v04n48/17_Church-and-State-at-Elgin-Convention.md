In the Elgin Convention, November 8, 1887, Dr Mandeville said on the subject of Sunday laws:—

> "When the church of God awakes and does its duty on one side, and the State on the other, we shall have no further trouble in this matter."

Yes, we remember how it was before when the Church and the State were united. The gentle Albigenses in Southern France greatly disturbed the church. But the church was wide-awake, for Innocent III. was pope. Philip Augustus was king of France; and the church awoke the State with the cry, "Up, most Christian king! up, and aid us in our work of vengeance!" And thus, with the energy of the pope on one side, and of Philip on the other, the soldiers of Philip marched down upon the Albigenses, and swept them from the earth. And as "the church did its duty on one side and the State on the other," there was no further trouble in that matter.
