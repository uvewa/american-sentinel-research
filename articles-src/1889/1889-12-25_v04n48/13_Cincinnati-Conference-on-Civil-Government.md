A call has been issued for a conference on "the Christian Principles of Civil Government," to be held in Cincinnati, January 21, 22, 1890. The call states that it is the imperative duty of Christians and patriots to "band themselves together to banish vice and immorality from our land." It also says that the enemy is coming in like a flood, and that "it is high time to lift up a standard against him." Our Bible says that when the enemy comes in like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him; but National Reformers arrogate to themselves, and to civil law, the offices and power of the Spirit of God. The call is issued by a large number of ministers, and the Woman's Christian Temperance Union will co-operate. Among the subjects to be discussed are "The Limitations of Personal Liberty," "The Civil Sabbath," "The Sunday Newspaper," "The Sabbath Movement in Cincinnati," "The Sabbath and the Laboring Man," "The Place of the Bible in Civil Laws," "The Moral Legislation Needed in Ohio," and "The Moral Accountability of Nations."
