> "Every sin, secret or public, against God, is a sin against our country, and is high treason against the State."—*Christian Statesman, August 9, 1888.*

Every sin, whether "secret or public," being "high treason" against the State, the State must punish it, even secret sin. But how shall the State discover secret sins except by an Inquisition? This again confirms the logic of the theocratical theory of earthly government—that the Inquisition is the inevitable consequence. And so far as the National Reformers are concerned, it is certain that they are ready to use the power which they are doing their best to secure.
