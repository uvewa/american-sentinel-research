# "IS THE SABBATH SUNDAY?"

This is the question that was asked by the vicar of St. Michael's, Folkestone, in a sermon preached at that place on Sunday, February 3, and which is printed in a local paper. No doubt our readers will be interested in hearing how a churchman answers the question. Here is the question and answer:—

Is the Sabbath Sunday? If a speaker gets up and says it is, attach no weight to his remarks, for either willfully from prejudice, or else unintentionally from lack of education, he is ignorant of the subject upon which he is so ready to speak.

Let us first of all think of the Sabbath. It was of divine institution, which, so far as we know, cannot certainly be said of the Sunday. If we refer to the second chapter of Genesis, we shall find there the account of the institution of the Sabbath day. "On the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made. And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made." Now you see that the seventh day of the week was to be specially set apart as a day commemorative of rest—of God resting from his work of creation, and we find him bestowing a special blessing upon the seventh day.

Referring then to the man who desires to see Sunday strictly observed as a rest day, whom he erroneously called a "Sabbatarian," the speaker added:—

And the Sabbatarian gets up and says, in a triumphant tone as if the whole question was settled at once, "That's what we claim for the Sabbath day now—rest." Pardon me, sir, you do nothing of the sort. You break the Sabbath day every week of your life. God did not rest from his work on the first day of the week, which is our Sunday, but on the seventh day of the week, which is our Saturday.

But this is not all. Later on in the same discourse the clergyman proceeded to emphasize the case still more strongly, thus:—

I see there is a public announcement in the papers that our great and venerable late prime minister has written an article on "The Lord's Day," which is to appear in the March number of a magazine. But this much I may prophesy—that with all his great genius, and all his deep and reverent knowledge of the Holy Scriptures, he will not be able to quote a single passage in the New Testament which states that the Christian Sunday is a substitution for the Jewish Sabbath.

And yet people wonder that anybody keeps the seventh day! The real cause for wonder is that any professed follower of the Lord Jesus Christ should keep Sunday. The whole Sabbath question centers round one point, namely, whether or not the Bible is the perfect and only guide for Christians. If it is, then the seventh day, and that only, must be kept as the Sabbath by Christians. The fourth commandment is the test as to whether men will heed the Word of God, or whether they will reject it for the traditions of men.—Present Truth, London.
