# A ROMAN CATHOLIC PARTY.

The spirit of persecution that prevailed so generally against the Protestants for long centuries, has not been quenched as many suppose. Word comes to us of the formation, in Hungary, of a new political party, called the Roman Catholic People's Party. Its object seems to be opposition to the Protestant population. It seems this league is growing rapidly, especially among the ignorant classes. One writer says: "About fifty-two per cent. of the whole population of Hungary is Roman Catholic, and about twenty per cent. is Protestant. This twenty per cent. constitutes, as a rule, the better educated portion, and if there is to be a religious conflict, it will unquestionably be bitter and deep." Our sympathies are with this persecuted people. We do not look for anything but opposition and persecution from Rome, this side the coming of Christ. Meanwhile this people have our prayers that they may be kept in this evil time. Deliverance is near. . . . What a blessed day it will be to the weary, waiting people of God! The Lord hasten it in his time.—Herald of the Coming One.
