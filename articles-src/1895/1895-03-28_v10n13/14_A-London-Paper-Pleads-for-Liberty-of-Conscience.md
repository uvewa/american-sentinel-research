# A LONDON PAPER PLEADS FOR LIBERTY OF CONSCIENCE.

The case of the Seventh-day Adventists who were fined at the Clerkenwell police court on the 13th ult. is one in which it is to be hoped the Home Secretary will intervene. The secretary of their publication department was summoned under the factory act for employing two women and one young person at the printing works on Sunday. It is a leading principle of the society to observe Saturday as the Sabbath, and this is done with great strictness, the printing works being closed from Friday noon to Sunday morning. The Home Office inspectors offered the Seventh-day Adventists the opportunity of applying for exemption from the factory act so far as Sunday labor was concerned as is done by the Jews, and as though they were Jews, but as the Adventists are Christians they felt that such a course would be a denial of Christ and therefore refused to take it. The secretary was fined £3 18s., and intimated that he should refuse to pay. It is obvious that the Adventists observe the spirit of the factory act, and it is certain that the act was never designed to coerce consciences. We can hardly, under the circumstances, suppose that Mr. Asquith will allow conscientious people to suffer by a legal accident.—The Church of To-day (London), March 1.
