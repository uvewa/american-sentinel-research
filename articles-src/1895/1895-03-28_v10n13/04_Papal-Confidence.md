# PAPAL CONFIDENCE.

There is an effort on foot to have the National Government establish a national university at Washington. The *Western Watchman* (Roman Catholic), of March 14, speaks thus of the project:—

A mighty effort is being made to induce the Government to establish a national university. The Government will never do it. The only national university Washington will ever know is the one recently founded in that city by Leo XIII.

It is thus confidently that papists speak of their power in national affairs. So confident are they of their capture of the American Republic that they already speak of their university as the "only national university."
