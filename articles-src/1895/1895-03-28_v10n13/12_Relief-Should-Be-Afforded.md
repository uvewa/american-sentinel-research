# RELIEF SHOULD BE AFFORDED.

The prosecution of the Adventists in this county has raised a question in the minds of many as to the proper course to pursue to afford relief to this people. That they have been a benefit to the county in material progress is beyond question. Property at Graysville has been much enhanced in value by the improvements which they have made there, and to drive them from the county would be not only an injustice to an inoffensive people, but would be a serious mistake from a business standpoint.

It has been suggested that the legislature be asked to afford some relief. To this it is objected that two years ago the Adventists protested against the enactment of an exemption clause. It is true that such a protest was presented, but it was not by residents of this State. Moreover, it was not done in a spirit of bravado or for the purpose of defying the State of Tennessee, but simply from loyalty to a principle. The Adventists were mentioned by name in the bill in question, and they say that they cannot consistently ask for an exemption clause because that would be to grant the right of the State to legislate upon a religious question; and that they would thereby be asking for a law which would affirmatively compel believers in Sunday to observe that day, and that would negatively require all others to observe the seventh day; because under such a law one who would not keep Sunday would be compelled to keep Saturday, or else be liable to prosecution.

A parallel to the position of the Adventist upon this question is found in the attitude of the Quakers and Mennonites in Virginia in 1785. A bill was before the legislature of that colony, providing for the taxation of all property for the support of teachers of the Christian religion, each tax-payer to decide what denomination should receive the benefit of the tax paid by him. The Quakers and Mennonites were exempted, and concerning them James Madison said: "As the bill violates equality by subjecting some to peculiar burdens, so it violates the same principle by granting to others peculiar exemptions. Are the Quakers and Mennonites the only sects who think a compulsive support of their religions unnecessary and unwarrantable? Can their piety alone be entrusted with the care of public worship? Ought their religions to be endowed above all others with extraordinary privileges by which proselytes may be enticed from all others? We think too favorably of the justice and good sense of these denominations to believe that they either covet preeminence over their fellow-citizens, or that they will be seduced by them from the common opposition to the measure."

The same principle is involved in this Sunday question; and because of this, Adventists do not seek legislation in their behalf. They regard the observance or non-observance of a Sabbath as purely a religious question with which the State has of right nothing to do, and therefore they will not ask the legislature to enact any law requiring anybody to observe any day.

But this need not prevent the State of Tennessee from affording them relief in some manner. It would be better to repeal the Sunday law entirely than to oppress good citizens. We trust that the legislature will consider this question, and take such action as seems to them to be wise under all the circumstances. Certainly the State of Tennessee cannot afford to persecute the Adventists and drive them from the State.—Dayton (Tenn.) Republican, March 16.
