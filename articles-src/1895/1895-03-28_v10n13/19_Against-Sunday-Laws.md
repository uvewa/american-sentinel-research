# AGAINST SUNDAY LAWS.

Senators Allen and Sevatson presented numerously signed petitions and protests against the passage of Sunday legislation. Senator Allen's petition comes from Wadena. It recites that the petitioners embrace their right of protest and petition, adopting and adapting the words of James Madison, as follows:—

"We believe that religion is essentially distinct from human government and exempt from its cognizance, and that a connection between them is injurious to both.

"We also believe that there are causes in the human breast which insure the perpetuity of religion, including the observance of the Sabbath, without the aid of law.

"For these reasons, therefore, we respectfully, yet decidedly, protest against the passage of House File 183 and Senate File 323 or any other Sunday bill that may be presented to your honorable body, as subversive of those very principles.

"We would respectfully suggest that every act of legislation tending to exalt one day above another as a day of rest, is because of some idea of sacredness attached, and is therefore religious legislation. We do therefore earnestly petition that you have nothing to do with any such legislation; but that you adhere to the true American principles of entire disunion of religion and the State, leaving religion and religious observances to the individual conscience; and that every man be protected in the exercise of the God-given right to make choice for himself as to how he shall spend his time, provided that he infringe not the equal rights of any other man."
