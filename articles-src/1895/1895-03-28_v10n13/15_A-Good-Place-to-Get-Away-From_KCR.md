# A GOOD PLACE TO GET AWAY FROM.

The East Randolph (N. Y.) Enterprise, under date of March 7, 1895, published an article entitled, "Religion In Germany." The writer says that Germany will be a good place to get away from, and that quickly, if the bill which Dr. Rintelen will try to have passed in the Reichstag, should become law. Dr. Rintelen proposes to punish with a fine of $150 and imprisonment for two years, anybody who, in a public speech, or writing, denies the existence of the Deity or the immortality of the soul, etc. The writer continues by extolling America as a model of religious liberty, thus implying that it would be a land of promise for the oppressed of Germany to flee to when they are obliged to leave their native land. Evidently the writer is not acquainted with the recent developments in Germany and her neighboring republic, Switzerland, along the line of religious intolerance.

The readers of the SENTINEL are familiar with the arrest and imprisonment, for three weeks, of Pastor H. P. Holzer, for permitting, as proprietor, employment on Sunday, in the Seventh-day Adventist publishing house, in Basel, Switzerland, and the prospect of serving another term because of a refusal to pay more fine for the same offense(?).

The school laws in Germany are such that they compel the attendance of children of seventh-day observers on Saturday. Some five different families have recently been fined for refusing to allow their children to attend the public school on the day that they hold sacred.

All of this is the result of laws as iniquitous as the proposed legislation forbidding the public denial of the church dogma of the natural immortality of the soul, which originated with Satan, taught by heathen philosophers to pagan bishops of the first centuries of the Christian era, and handed down to professed Protestants by the Roman Catholic Church.

It will be readily seen from the foregoing, that Germany is, and has been, "a good place to get away from" for some time. But what about America being an asylum for those who are persecuted in Germany?

Space will permit only a brief reference to the situation in this country of which we once could sing—

"My country, 'tis of thee,
Sweet land of liberty."

For nearly forty years religious zealots of this country have been persistently working for a state of things even worse than that which exists in Germany and Switzerland. The result is, that such an influence has been brought to bear upon our Federal jurists that they have declared this to be a Christian nation; and since which time most wicked legislation is being proposed and enacted in different States. Also there is a revival of old State Sunday laws that have ever been a blot on our statute books. These old relics of a State-church polity are now springing into new life, and are being used to arrest and imprison, as felons, God-fearing men for quietly working on Sunday after obeying the law of their God, by observing, as sacred, the seventh day of the week.

In view of the situation here, can it not be said that this country, too, is "a good place to get away from?" Since it has been inferred that America would be a good land for the oppressed of Germany to flee to, the query might arise, to what land shall Americans flee who do not propose to bow down to laws that abridge the rights of conscience? The National Reform party has already, through one of its vice-presidents, Rev. E. A. Graham, suggested voluntary exile as follows:—

We might add in all justice, if the opponents of the Bible [with whom seventh-day observers are classed] do not like our Government and its Christian features, let them go to some wild, decolate land, and in the name of the devil, and for the sake of the devil, subdue it, and set up a government of their own on infidel and atheistic ideas; and then, if they can stand it, stay there till they die.

But it is plain to be seen that false Protestantism and Roman Catholicism are demitating every civilized land, so that even the lands which were once freedom's boast, are now becoming the most oppressive, hence rendering the entire world "a good place to get away from." The gospel is designed for the very purpose of getting mankind from this world to a better one. The apostle expresses it thus in Gal. 1:4: "W!o (Christ) gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of God and our Father."

The deliverance is from sin, self, the world, and every thing that is unholy. "Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you." 2 Cor. 6:17. "Know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? who soever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God." James 4:4. "Come out of her, my people." Rev. 18:4. When we leave our home and citizenship here, God in Christ makes us "fellow-citizens with the saints, and of the household of God." Eph. 2:19. "For our citizenship is in heaven; from whence also we wait for a Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ." Phil. 3:20. (R. V.)

Dear reader, may we all get away from this world by fleeing to Christ, the Great Deliverer.

K. C. RUSSELL.
