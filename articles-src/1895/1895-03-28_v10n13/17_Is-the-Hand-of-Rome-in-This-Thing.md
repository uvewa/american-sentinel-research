# IS THE HAND OF ROME IN THIS THING?

It is a startling fact, pointed out by the AMERICAN SENTINEL, that the present craze for military instruction in the schools is not only not opposed by Rome, but so far as her voice has been [heard] it has been in favor [of it]. The Catholic Club of Newark, N. J., at a recent meeting, passed resolutions asking the legislators: "to make provision for the introduction of military drill into the public, parochial, and other schools within the State, in which boys are taught." The spirit of the Catholic Church has always been and is now, essentially military. The blood-stained pages of history tell us how well she can use carnal weapons, and as the SENTINEL suggests, "All this militarism is directly in her line of things."

The Lafayette Post of the G. A. R. in New York City has started the boom for military instruction in the schools, and secured the endorsement of forty-seven States and Territories. Commander Adams states that there are in the schools of the United States 2,800,000 boys between twelve and eighteen who are able to handle a cadet rifle. Can anyone suppose that these boys will grow up thus trained by regular military instructors without longing for an opportunity to put their knowledge to practical proof in real war, and ready to rush to arms instead of submitting the point at issue to the slower methods of arbitration? But they will grow up defenders of the flag. Stop and think. Mow many of our public school children does Rome claim? and on which side will they be likely to array themselves in the event of a religious struggle? How many of foreign parentage are there whose attitude would be likely to be as uncertain as to the foreign political vote to-day?

What is the effect of this military training? Prof. Sutton said at a recent meeting of the leading educators of fifteen States gathered in council at Galveston, and reported in the Journal of Education:—"The obedience taught by military tactics is not inspired from within, it is mechanical. It is character we need in the United States, not cannon. If there is anything that this nation stands for, it is to scatter ideas of peace and fraternity. The great purpose of the schools is to develop self-activity of the head, not of the foot. The nearer you get a soldier to allow some one else to do his thinking, the better soldier he is. His business is to die. The more you teach a child to think the better for it."

Even France, the very embodiment as a nation, of the military idea, is now turning over a new leaf. Says Dr. J. Baldwin, of the State University of Austin, Texas: "France is now engaged in the development of the greatest manhood and womanhood the nation has ever seen. Is it military training? By no means, but scientific training from babyhood."

When even France has cast off the false ideal of education for her future citizens, shall America take it up? Which do we prefer, character or cannon?

The Advocate of Peace, in commenting on this subject, well says: "The G. A. R. has no right whatever to be interfering with the school system, any more than the Catholic Church or any other organization has. The school boards and superintendents and principals ought to have independence enough to resist all efforts to thrust into their work a kind of instruction so utterly antagonistic at bottom to the humanizing, intellectual, and moral purposes of our educational system."—The Woman's Voice (Boston), March 2.
