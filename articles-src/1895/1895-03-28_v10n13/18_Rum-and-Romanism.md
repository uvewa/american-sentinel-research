# RUM AND ROMANISM.

The Christian Advocate is authority for the following facts:—

Sixty-five per cent. of the manufacturers of alcoholic liquors for beverage in the city of Philadelphia are Roman Catholics, and of the brewers seventy-five per cent. are Roman Catholics, are communicants, and pay revenue to the Roman Catholic Church.

In the city of Philadelphia there are 8,034 persons in the retail liquor business, selling liquor over the bar for drinks, as follows:—

- Chinamen, 2.
- Not Roman Catholics.

- Jews, 2.
- Not Roman Catholics.

- Italians, 18.
- All Roman Catholics.

- Spaniards, 140.
- All Roman Catholics.

- Negroes, 265.
- 200 Roman Catholics.

- British, 160.
- 125 Roman Catholics.

- French, 285.
- All Roman Catholics.

- English, 568.
- 543 Roman Catholics.

- Germans, 2,179.
- All Roman Catholics.

- Irish, 3,041.
- All Roman Catholics.

- Americans, 205, who communs nowhere, but a majority of those are of Roman Catholic parentage.

Of this number 3,696 are women, all foreigners but one, as follows:—

- German, 1,104.
- All Roman Catholics.

- Irish, 2,558.
- All Roman Catholics.

Of this 8,034, 6,418 have been arraigned for crimes.

These facts explain why the Roman Catholic Church deals so gingerly with the liquor question.
