# STOP THEM ALL THE TIME.

The esteemed Advertiser says that during the investigation of Sunday concerts by the police board last fall, it was proved that the performances in certain places were "horribly, unspeakably, unprintably indecent," and more, too. If this be true of the Sunday evening shows, is it not true of them on other evenings? And what sort of guardianship of public morals is that which confines itself to one-seventh of the time, leaving the other six-sevenths to corrupt all they can? If what the Advertiser says was proved about these performances is the truth, there is no need for any new laws to enable the authorities to punish the guilty and stop such shows on any evening of the week, and they are disgracefully false to their duty if they do not do so. And least of all can Boston afford to have the impression go abroad that lewd and indecent shows can be seen on Sunday evenings, but not on any others. It would seem to be too far along in the evolution of morality for men to proceed as if on the assumption that one day in the week condemns an act which all the other six days permit. A theft or a murder on Sunday is no whit worse than the same acts on any other day. If society has any right to stop this kind of exhibitions—or any other kind—on Sundays, it has precisely the same right to stop them every day. If they are demoralizing on Sundays—and beyond doubt they are so when they are not nauseating—they are demoralizing every day. It is fantastic foolishness to hold otherwise. Nay, it is worse, for it is itself demoralizing.

Moreover, it is easier, in one sense, to stop these rotten exhibitions altogether than to stop them for one day and let them flourish for six days. If it becomes known among their purveyors and managers that in a given city they can flaunt themselves undisturbed for six days, provided they'll keep out of sight the seventh, and that in another given city they are not safe any day in the week from sharp and sudden punishment, which of the two cities, think you, will they avoid?

If the shows complained of are not lewd, obscene, indecent, etc., they cannot be stopped for being so on Sunday any more than on any other day. If they are so, they can be and should be stopped on Sundays and on all other days, and the officers who fail to do so are false to their trust. But, on the other hand, if the reason why we want them stopped on Sundays resides in the day, and not in the shows—if it is because of the Sunday, and not because of the character of the shows, let us be manly and honest, and say so. A false accusation of indecency can really injure only the accuser, and it is utterly impossible that anything which is not lewd or indecent on any other day can be so on Sunday.—Boston Traveller, March 11.
