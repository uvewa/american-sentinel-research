# The Ministerial Union.

As foreshadowed last week, the Ministerial Union, embracing all evangelical denominations, met on Monday morning in the Presbyterian assembly room. Dr. DeBow of the Methodist Episcopal Church, read a paper entitled, "A Psychological Study of Revivals." The paper was discussed by several members.

Rev. Dr. Fernley, chairman of the Sabbath committee, reported as usual, recommending that the fine for violating the Sabbath law of 1794 be raised from $4 to $25. The report was adopted. H. L. Wayland moved the following resolution:

"That it is the sense of this body that the law of 1794 be not used for the violation of religious liberty in the person of quiet and conscientious citizens, who, after observing the seventh day as a day of rest and worship, pursue their vocations on the first day, without interfering with the observance of that day by their neighbors." After some discussion, the president ruled that, according to the by-laws, the body had already adjourned.—Special Dispatch from Philadelphia to the Examiner (Baptist).
