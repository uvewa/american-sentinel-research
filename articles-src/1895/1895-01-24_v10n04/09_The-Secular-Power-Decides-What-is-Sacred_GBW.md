# The Secular Power Decides What is Sacred.

The folly and wickedness of religious legislation were illustrated in Boston recently, at the hearing before the police commissioners for the purpose of closing the Sunday evening concerts at the theaters. The petition against these concerts was made by the Massachusetts Sunday Protective League and other religious organizations, on the ground that they did not meet the requirements of sacred concerts. The judgment of what was sacred and what was secular was left to the police commissioner to decide for the people of Boston. I quote the following from the Boston Globe of Dec. 6. Speaking of General Martin, chairman of the Board of Police, it says:—

He was not called upon to decide the relative merits of Patti and Melba, but was asked to say whether the length of Mamie Gilroy's dress, or the strength of Maggie Cline's voice, went beyond the dividing line between sacred and secular performances. He and his colleagues were also called upon to interpret the meaning of sundry jokes and conundrums, and to say whether or not they bore out the dictionary meaning of the word sacred.

What was sacred and what secular was discussed with all the gravity of a church council. During the discussion the question was asked whether the petition against these Sunday concerts was on the ground that they were criminal of themselves, or because they did not conform to the ideas of Sunday sacredness held by the petitioners. After that there was not so much said about Sunday sacredness, and much more about the immorality and wickedness of these shows. I quote the following from the Boston Herald, to show the folly of their position:—

The hearing before the Board of Police last week, anent the propriety of permitting concerts to be given in the theaters on Sunday evening, brought forth much in the way of showing how performances that are innocuous on week days become fraught with dreadful consequences when given on Sunday. Much stress was laid on the many young people who were seen at these shows, and it would seem that the very worthy people who have instituted charges against these Sunday entertainment imagine that Mamie Gilroy, attired in a gown that reached no lower than the knees, might sing her songs harmlessly on Monday, but that on Sunday the same songs and the same attire become something very dangerous to public morals.

The president of the Massachusetts Protective League was asked at the close of the hearing, why they did not close the theaters and stop the immorality and wickedness seven days in the week instead of only one. The reply was that they intended to do that, but was beginning with Sunday. A strange way to begin to stop vice.
