# Societies to Enforce Law.

A LEXOW COMMITTEE witness swore, on Thursday, that he had paid $1,000 to Anthony Comstock as a bribe for securing the quashing of an indictment for "green-goods" business. A second witness swore he saw the money paid.

Whether this charge is true or false, it reflects what is an easy possibility, and it ought to call public attention sharply to a danger point in our system.

It is obvious that if Mr. Comstock chose, he could employ the powers he possesses for the levying of blackmail as freely as police captains have used theirs in that way. He could make a fortune in a few years by exacting tribute from vice and crime.

It is very dangerous to intrust such a power as this to anybody. It is especially dangerous to intrust it, as our laws do, to whomsoever there may be that chooses to exercise it.

Societies for the enforcement of law for the repression of vice and for other ostensibly good purposes, may be organized by anybody who chooses. The law vests in them powers which it is easy to use for the blackmailing and licensing of the very things the societies profess to antagonize.

The system is clearly wrong and very dangerous. The enforcement of the laws, the repression of vice, the prevention of crime, should be the work solely of legal functionaries regularly appointed and duly responsible, such as the courts, district-attorneys, the grand juries and the police. If these are negligent or corrupt the right remedy lies in replacing them with better men, and not in licensing private and irresponsible associations, which may be composed of corrupt or incapable men, to assume powers that belong properly to the legitimate agents of the law.

Dr. Parkhurst's society, it is true, has rendered inestimable service to the public, but in the hands of bad men it might have done irreparable wrong. And if administration were what it ought to be there would never have been occasion for the existence of that society. There is at least one society organized under the same law which is under grave suspicion of having blackmail and extortion for its sole objects.

What this community needs is a more thorough and conscientious enforcement of law by the regularly constituted agencies of the law. The people of the State can secure it if they will.—New York World, Dec. 29, 1894.
