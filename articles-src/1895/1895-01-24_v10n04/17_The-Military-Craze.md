# The Military Craze.

A few months ago the press announced the fact that the Epworth League, and other young people's societies, had gone into politics. Now it announces that the League of Brooklyn has organized military companies and is drilling for conflict. The next step will be to proclaim a religious crusade and march against the heretics.

What means all this military craze that has taken hold of the churches? "Church Cadets," "Boys' Brigades" and "Epworth Guards," with their weekly drill have superseded the prayer meeting, and it means that the churches having discounted the "Sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God," and having appealed to the State to enforce the doctrines of religion by law, now turn naturally to the use of carnal weapons. "All they that take the sword shall perish with the sword."
