# How to Secure Church Union.

A UNION of churches is hopeless. The tree of nineteen centuries' growth will not split in two hundred fragments and wind itself round the vines of three hundred years' growth. If you want union, dear friends, come into us; the old Mother Church extends her arms and says: "Come in; my wings are broad, and I will shield you from your enemies—and we will be one in Christ."—Western Catholic News, Nov. 10, 1894.
