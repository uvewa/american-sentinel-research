# The Whipping-Post.

The proposition of Commodore Elbridge T. Gerry, of one of our societies for the prevention of cruelty, to revive the whipping-post in this State has been enthusiastically indorsed by the Public Health Section of the Academy of Medicine, and Senator O'Connor has submitted to the Senate a bill embodying it.

Although doubtless well meant as a protest against the enervating influences of modern civilization, and effective as far as it goes in a restoration of the obsolete cruelties of barbarous ages, this bill is crude and imperfect in its scope—a halting attempt to grapple with a great evil which obviously needs strong remedies.

Kind Commodore Gerry stops with a limit of merely forty lashes on the naked backs of certain classes of offenders. If we are going to try to cure crime with cruelty why limit it to flogging and to forty lashes? Why not be thorough?

Citizens of New York have lately been favored with an exhibition of the celebrated collection of instruments of torture of the Nuremberg Museum, as well as of those of the reformatory of Elmira. The new opera of "The Scarlet Letter" teems with suggestions of antique punishment, and China is very much in evidence with her cangues and other devices for inflicting cruelty on the cruel, for making "the punishment fit the crime."

If Commodore Gerry is consistent and has the courage of his convictions, he will not rest content with his trivial and inadequate whipping-post. He will supplement his tentative suggestion by calling to his aid the resources of the past. He will give us not merely the knout, the cat and the bastinado, but the ducking-stool and the pillory, the thumbscrew, the boot, the gauntlets and bilboes for ordinary criminals, and for extreme cases, such as resistance to an officer of the Gerry society, the rack, the wheel, the peine forte et dure, or even "something lingering in boiling oil."

If we are going to renounce civilization and return to savagery, let us not stop half way.—The World, Jan. 14.
