# Uncertainties Log - v10n04 (1895-01-24)

## OCR Corrections Made

### Page 1, Masthead
- **OCR read:** "EDITIONS, AMERICANE EDITOR"
- **Corrected to:** "EDITORS, ASSOCIATE EDITOR"
- **Confidence:** HIGH
- **Reason:** Context and standard masthead format indicate this is clearly "EDITORS" and "ASSOCIATE EDITOR"

### Page 3, Date Header
- **OCR read:** "JANUARY 24, 1886"
- **Corrected to:** (not transcribed - page header)
- **Note:** This is a page header error; the actual date is 1895, not 1886. Page headers were not transcribed as article content.

### Page 4, Author Name
- **OCR read:** "nopee" in context "who generally earn nopee seven days in the week"
- **Corrected to:** "money"
- **Confidence:** HIGH
- **Reason:** Context clearly indicates "money" - discussing clergy earning money

### Page 4, Word
- **OCR read:** "Roreka!"
- **Corrected to:** "Eureka!"
- **Confidence:** HIGH
- **Reason:** Standard exclamation; OCR misread initial letter

### Page 5, Author Attribution
- **OCR read:** "Miloan"
- **Corrected to:** "Milman"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM
- **Reason:** Historical reference, likely to H.H. Milman's works on Latin Christianity

### Page 6, Page Number
- **OCR read:** "39"
- **Note:** Should be "30" based on sequence (pages 26, 27, 28, 29, 30...)
- **Not transcribed:** Page numbers are not article content

### Page 7, Location Name
- **OCR read:** "Reville"
- **Corrected to:** (uncertain - left as appears in atlas description)
- **Note:** Unclear if this is OCR error or actual place name in atlas index

### Page 7, Word
- **OCR read:** "SINDS"
- **Corrected to:** "BINDS"
- **Confidence:** HIGH
- **Reason:** Quote reads "THE LINE THAT BINDS TWO GREAT NATIONS" (St. Clair Tunnel)

### Page 7, Abbreviation
- **OCR read:** "G. T. Bp."
- **Preserved as:** "G. T. Ry." likely intended
- **Note:** Multiple occurrences, appears to be railway abbreviation but preserved OCR reading

All other text transcribed exactly as it appeared in the OCR output, preserving original spelling, punctuation, and capitalization.
