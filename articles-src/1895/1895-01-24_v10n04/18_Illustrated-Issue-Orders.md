# Illustrated Issue Orders.

We are gratified at receiving so many orders for our illustrated issue of Jan. 17. The Minnesota Tract Society writes: "Send us five thousand copies as a starter," and the Michigan Tract Society has sent its first order for eleven thousand copies. This issue will not grow old for weeks to come, and we hope our friends will all help to give it a wide circulation.
