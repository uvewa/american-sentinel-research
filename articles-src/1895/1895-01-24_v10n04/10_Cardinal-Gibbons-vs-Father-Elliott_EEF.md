# Cardinal Gibbons vs. Father Elliott.

After reading the many admissions from Roman Catholic catechisms, periodicals, and letters from cardinal, bishop, and priest, that the Catholic Church changed the Sabbath from the seventh to the first day of the week, without any warrant of scripture, and especially the statement made by the Catholic Mirror, that "The claims of Protestants to any part therein" (the Sunday) is "proved to be groundless, self-contradictory, and suicidal;" I have read "Father" Elliott's article in the December number of the Catholic World, in which he says he takes the so-called "Protestant side of the controversy," maintaining that there is Bible authority for the change of the day. Without doubt this utterance was a surprise to many, but when it is stated that Priest Elliott is one of the "Paulist Missionary Fathers," whose mission is to proselyte from Protestantism, we can understand why he takes the "Protestant side of the controversy," and why Rome is blowing hot and cold on this subject. "The end justifies the means," is an old established principle with Rome, and "Father" Elliott is only tweedling Protestants to accomplish his ends. It is a case of "the spider and the fly," and the eloquent propagandist wants to drop some poor deluded "orphans" (apostate Protestants) into the lap of an adopted "mother" (Rome). See Revelation, 17th chapter. But let us notice his statements as compared with those of Cardinal Gibbons. "Father" Elliott says:—

In the question box our only abundant matter was furnished by the Seventh-day Adventists. They seemed surprised that I took the Protestant side of the controversy on the question of Sunday observance. I maintained that, first, a "Bible Christian," one who holds to the private interpretation of the Scriptures as the only rule of faith, can and must believe that the entire ceremonial law of the Jews is totally abolished by Christ including all liturgical observances whatever, no less the Jewish Sabbath than the Jewish sacrifice. Second, I maintained, with the catechism of the Council of Trent, that there is evidence in the New Testament of the selection by the apostles of the Sunday as a substitute for the Mosaic Sabbath; and if the texts are not conclusive of an obligation, they are still plainly indicative of the apostolic origin of the new custom.

It must be acknowledged by all that the Jews kept "the seventh day" according to the fourth (Catholic, third) commandment; and if, as Priest Elliott says, the Sabbath was abolished with the ceremonial law, then, as a matter of fact, the fourth commandment which says, "the seventh day is the Sabbath," must also be abolished. As "Father" Elliott quotes the Council of Trent, I intend to meet him on his own ground.

In the "Catholic Church History," in "Half Hours with the Servants of God,"* is found the following concerning the action taken by the Council of Trent on this very matter:—

The Council of Trent defines against antinomian heretics of ancient and modern times, that the ten commandments bind the consciences of all mankind, Christians included. "If any one say that the ten commandments have nothing to do with Christians, let him be anathema." "If any one say that a man, though justified and ever so perfect, is not bound to observe the commandments of God and the church, let him be anathema." . . . The ten commandments, then, did not begin to bind when proclaimed to the people of Israel, and they have not ceased to do so now that Christ has done away with the Jewish law. Page 106.

This statement alone, approved by the cardinals, refutes every point "Father" Elliott attempts to make concerning the Council of Trent and its position on the Sabbath question. I will let Cardinal Gibbons again answer Priest Elliott. In a letter to the cardinal, dated Jan. 6, 1895, the writer, after plainly stating that he is a Protestant, but does not indorse the so-called Protestant side of the argument on the Sunday question, but rather agrees with the Catholic Mirror that there is no warrant whatever in Scripture for Sunday sacredness, and that Protestants are following the tradition of the Catholic Church, stated in his letter that "They tell us, however, that the Council of Trent finds evidence in the New Testament for Sunday keeping, and that the said Council agreed that the apostles substituted Sunday for the Mosaic Sabbath" (using the words of Priest Elliott almost verbatim). The letter added that the writer could not agree with those who made the above statement, and asked the cardinal to kindly give his opinion on the subject. The following is the cardinal's reply, and is to the point:—

Cardinal's Residence, 408 N. Charles St.,
Baltimore, Jan. 8, 1895.

Dear Sir: The cardinal desires me to say, in answer to your favor of the 6th inst., that you are right in your conclusions in regard to the Sunday. There is no attempt on the part of council or prelate to give scriptural authority to the observance of Sunday.

What is arrived at is this: That the observance of one day as the Lord's day is of scriptural warrant [the commandment] inasmuch as it forms the essence of the precept given to Moses. But the observance of the day for the Hebrews, Jews, was to be on Saturday for reasons given by God. But that was not essential, and the authority of the church derived from our Saviour* changed the day. There is no text of Scriptures that bears on the matter other than what I have mentioned, viz., the command [in Old Testament] to keep holy the Lord's day. [Italics mine.]

I beg to be,
Yours truly in Christ,
C. F. THOMAS.
(For the Cardinal.)

The above entirely repudiates the sophistry of "Father" Elliott; but to make the contradiction more apparent, the following parallel columns are given, which should be used against this subtle missionary of Rome wherever he is laboring to overthrow the plain statements of God's Word:

FATHER ELLIOTT.
CARDINAL GIBBONS.

I took the Protestant side of the controversy on the question of Sunday observance.

The claims of Protestants . . . proved to be groundless, self-contradictory and suicidal.—Catholic Mirror, organ of Cardinal Gibbons.

I maintain that, first, a "Bible Christian" . . . can and must believe that the entire ceremonial law of the Jews is totally abolished by Christ . . . no less the Jewish Sabbath than the Jewish sacrifice.

The Council of Trent defines . . . against antinomian heretics of ancient and modern times, that the ten commandments bind the consciences of all mankind, Christians included. "If any one say that the ten commandments have nothing to do with Christians, let him be anathema. . . . The ten commandments, then, did not begin to bind when proclaimed to the people of Israel, and they have not ceased to do so now that Christ has done away with the Jewish law.—Church History, p. 106, in "Half Hours with the Servants of God," approved by Cardinal Gibbons.

Second, I maintain, with the catechism of the Council of Trent, that there is evidence in the New Testament of the selection by the apostles of the Sunday as a substitute for the Mosaic Sabbath.

There is no attempt on the part of council or prelate to give scriptural authority to the observance of Sunday.—Letter from Cardinal Gibbons, dated Jan. 8, 1895.

You may read your Bible from Genesis to Revelation, and you will not find a single line authorizing the sanctification of Sunday. The Scriptures enforce the religious observance of Saturday, a day which we never sanctify.—Faith of Our Fathers, by Cardinal Gibbons, p. 111.

It is needless to say more. It truly is, as the Catholic Mirror says, "Self-contradictory and suicidal" to defend Sunday from Scripture. And the above leaves "Father" Elliott and his Sunday just where Absalom was when his head was caught in the tree, with nothing to stand upon.

I will quote one more statement from a small pamphlet, called "Letters of Senex on True and False Faith, and on the Sabbath Question, Scripturally Considered," written by the writer of the Mirror editorials on the same question. On page 10, he says:—

The Bible Christian who conscientiously clings to the Bible as his "rule of faith," cannot close his eyes to the awful truth and fact that there exists a positive command of God—one of the ten—that he has never once kept during his whole life, because he has lived his whole life keeping another day in direct violation of his own rule of faith; whilst in this matter which should be to him one of prime importance, he is blindly and slavishly, and, what is far worse, sacrificing his own fixed religious principles to follow the command of the Catholic Church, which requires the keeping of Sunday rather than Saturday.

Thus we have the Paulist Priest Elliott in conflict with his cardinal and council in an effort to please Protestants and prevent them from severing the Sunday link that binds them to Rome.
