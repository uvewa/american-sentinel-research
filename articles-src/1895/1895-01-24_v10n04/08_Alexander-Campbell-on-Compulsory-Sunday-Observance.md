# Alexander Campbell on Compulsory Sunday Observance.

[In 1820 there was organized in West Middletown, Washington Co., Pa., a society, called the West Middletown Moral Society. The principal object of the society was to enforce the Pennsylvania Sunday law of 1794, which is still on the statute books of the State. This Moral Society was organized by the United Presbyterians, the same people who, later in 1863, organized the National Reform Association. Alexander Campbell, the founder of the Christian or Disciples Church, vigorously opposed the society in a series of articles published in the Reporter, of Washington, county seat of Washington County. His articles were signed "Candidus." A United Presbyterian minister, by the name of Wylie, attempted to defend the society, and signed himself "Timothy." The discussion continued from April 17, 1820, the date of Mr. Campbell's first article, to February 22, 1823, during which time almost every phase of the compulsory Sunday law question was treated. As a result the Moral Society perished, not to appear again until 1863 when it was revived by the same denomination under the name, National Reform Association. Every word of Mr. Campbell's invincible logic and withering denunciation is applicable to the association, resuscitated under the name, National Reform Association, and kindred organizations, such as the American Sabbath Union, the Pennsylvania Sabbath Association, etc.]

MR. T.'S. fifth argument is, "that there are political reasons for the enforcement of the Sabbath." These political reasons are as follows: "Let it be made lawful to labor for the seven days of the week, and the consequence will soon be that the laborer would have no more for the labor of seven days than he now does for the labor of six days." A strong argument truly. To keep up the price of labor, the rich and poor must keep the "Sabbath." If politicians are to legislate on the observance of "holy times," to enhance the value of labor, it would be good policy to compel the rich and poor to observe the seventh day, or Jewish Sabbath, and the first day also; then the number of working days would be reduced to five, and the price of labor would be enhanced. But what would be done with that class of the community called clergy, who generally earn money seven days in the week; many of them being farmers, some of them being presidents of colleges, store keepers, etc., who make money every day, but especially on the "Sabbath"? But perhaps it would be a sin to diminish the number of their working days, as they are a privileged order. It is, however, a good rule that works both ways, and perhaps the number of their working days ought to be diminished.

"In the house of representatives of Connecticut, March 27, 1821, an act for the observance of the Sabbath was taken up and debated. Mr. Welch said that we had begun at the wrong end of the commandment. We should enforce that part of it which directs us to labor six days before we enforce the keeping of a Sabbath. N. H. PATRIOT."

I think Mr. Welch's opinion is as good as Mr. T.'S., and I would recommend Mr. T. to consider it. Consistency is the greatest ornament of character and essentially necessary to recommend our profession and to demonstrate our sincerity.

A compulsory observance of the ordinances of Christ is the most incongruous and contemptible thing in the world. It is the quintessence of folly in them who compel and in those who are compelled. It is in direct opposition to every precept of Christianity, and even to the constitution of a good civil government. What an insult on Christianity, to see an overawed, constrained and intimidated assembly meeting either to save their fine, or to keep fast, or to maintain the appearance of devotion! How unlike to the true worshipers, who worship in spirit and in truth!—Candidus (Alexander Campbell), in Washington (Pa.) Reporter, Nov. 5, 1821.
