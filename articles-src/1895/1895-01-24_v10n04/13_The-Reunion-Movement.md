# The Reunion Movement.

THE question of the reunion of the Eastern churches with the holy see continues to be a subject of interest. Of course, reunion could not possibly be accomplished in the short space of time occupied by a first congress. Leo XIII. has begun the good work; another may terminate it. Meanwhile the holy see has given the Eastern Catholics who acknowledged the pope as their supreme chief, every latitude and privilege with regard to rite, liturgy, and language, so that by fraternizing constantly with their schismatic brethren they may, if possible, bring them within the one fold under one shepherd some day.—Pittsburg Catholic, Dec. 27, 1894.
