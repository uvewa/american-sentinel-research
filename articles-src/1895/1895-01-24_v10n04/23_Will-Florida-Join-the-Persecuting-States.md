# Will Florida Join the Persecuting States?

[The following interesting item will appear in the next issue of the Florida Bulletin, a Seventh-day Adventist paper, and is kindly forwarded to us by L. H. Crisler, a Seventh-day Adventist minister, of Florida.]

On Sunday, Jan. 13, Bro. H. S. Giddings, of Orlando, Fla., was arrested for following his usual occupation of housebuilding. He was building a chimney inside the house and was not making any disturbance.

The officer who arrested Brother Giddings threatened to lock him up, but finally agreed to take his word as bond for his appearance before the police court at 10 A. M. the next day. On his arrival at the police station the following day, he was informed that he would be tried before the criminal court, which was in session; and at 3 P. M. his case was called. The charge was for working on the day commonly called Sunday, to which Brother Giddings plead guilty, stating that he had observed the seventh day as the Sabbath for a number of years, and had followed his usual occupation on Sunday, believing it to be a rival of the Lord's Sabbath, and that to observe it was to pay homage to the power that set it up.

The judge then read Section 11 of the laws of Florida, which imposes a fine of $50 for doing manual labor on the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday; and said: "I suppose you did not know there was such a law. You would not persist in working on Sunday after knowing that this law existed, would you?"

Brother Giddings stated that he understood there was such a law, and that he would never think of breaking one of the State laws, unless it came in conflict with the law of God, which in this case it did. He thereupon read from the Bible, Ex. 20:8-11, showing his authority for observing the seventh day. And after showing that Sunday is the sign of the power designated as the beast, he read Rev. 14:9-11, setting forth the judgment to be visited on all who knowingly worship the beast. He then referred him to the three Hebrew children, stating that his case was a parallel one, and that he could only answer as they did.

By this time the majority of the people present began to see that there was something unusual presented in this case, and the signs of levity which were general when Brother Giddings began his defense, had all disappeared. The judge also seemed much impressed, and stated that he would postpone sentence in this case until next court, and take the matter into consideration.

After we had left the court room, Brother Giddings said: "I never before realized how true it is that we are not prepared to give a reason for our faith until I had to stand up there and do it."

Brethren, we have come to the time when we shall have to defend the positions we hold, before the rulers of the land. May the Lord fill us with his wisdom and guide us in all things to his glory.

ALEX. MITCHELL.
