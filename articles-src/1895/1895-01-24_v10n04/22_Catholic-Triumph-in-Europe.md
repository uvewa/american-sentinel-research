# Catholic Triumph in Europe.

Why is it that Roman Catholics point to the appointment and election of members of their church to the premiership of Germany and the presidency of Switzerland as a triumph of the Catholicity over Protestantism? Because it furnishes an opportunity for these papists to carry out the programme outlined by Pope Leo XIII, communicated in 1885 to the faithful in all lands, but especially in America. It furnishes an opportunity to "do all in their power to cause constitutions of States and legislation to be modeled on the principles of the true [Roman Catholic] church." And when American citizens oppose this programme and attempt to prevent in America what Roman Catholic papers in this country declare to be a triumph of the papacy in Europe, this effort is denounced as persecution! Yea, verily, everything is persecution in the mind of the papist that interferes with the scheme of Rome to again dominate the world and punish heretics.
