# SENSIBLE.

[Truth Seeker, September 14.]

The mischievous notion that certain men, by reason of their vocation, are either too good or too bad to exercise the ordinary functions of citizens is quite prevalent in the South, where the constitutions of some of the States forbid a minister to hold any civil office. In other words, the idea of equal citizenship is lost in that of class distinctions based on occupation. By a curious coincidence, the Church is stronger in the South than elsewhere in the country, and laws against freedom on Sunday and discrimination against infidels are more numerous and stringent, and generally more rigorously enforced.

A disfranchised or disbarred class can dominate legislation in spite of its disabilities if it is accepted by the voters and law-makers as the teaching class. This is precisely the position that the clergy occupy. In view of this fact, the demand of the Press and Banner, of Abbeville, South Carolina, that the legislature "forever prevent any minister of the gospel from holding office or dabbling in politics" is foolish in the extreme. Such a law would vastly augment the influence of the clergy, for whatever savors of persecution redounds to the benefit of the persecuted.

But there is a vital principle as well as a question of expediency involved in this proposition. The State can rightfully discriminate neither for nor against the Church. If it debars clergymen from office on the ground that they are too good to make and administer laws, it discriminates ostensibly in favor of the Church. If it debars them on the ground that they are too bad, it discriminates ostensibly against the Church. If it forbids them to take part in political discussions it denies free speech to a class because they are religious teachers. The State has nothing whatever to do with ministers as ministers; it can recognize them only as inhabitants of the State, subject to the same laws as and no other laws than those which regulate the relations of the other inhabitants.
