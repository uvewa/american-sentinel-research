# BROKE UP A SUNDAY SHOW.

UNDER the heading, "Broks up a Sunday Show," the New York Sun, of Sept. 17, prints the following:—

ST. JOSEPH, Mo., Sept. 16.—Wild scenes of rioting occurred last night when the Ministers' Alliance and the police of the city broke up a performance of Pain's "China and Japan." About 4,000 persons paid to see the show, and when the preachers and policemen made their appearance they were booted, cursed, and threatened by the crowd. Mayor Shepherd appealed to the commissioners to relent and let the performance go on, but to no purpose. The management announced that checks would be given, good for to-night's performance, but hundreds of laboring people who could not attend to-night made a rush on the box office and demanded a return of their money. When this demand was refused the police had to use their clubs in beating back the mob.

There were several broken heads, and the women and children suffered most in the jam. Several were trampled upon and badly hurt. One of the gates was forced open and hundreds rushed out to escape personal injury, not waiting for another admission ticket. Manager Burkholder was arrested on the charge of violating a State law.

It is evident that the clericals who are pushing the Sunday-law crusade are determined to have peace on Sunday if they have to fight for it, and to compel other people to keep Sunday if they themselves have to break it to make them do so.
