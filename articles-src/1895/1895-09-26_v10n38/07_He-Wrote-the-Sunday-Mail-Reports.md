# HE WROTE THE SUNDAY MAIL REPORTS.

The Mail and Express recently printed the following concerning Hon. Richard M. Johnson:—

## He Killed Chief Tecumseh.

The Senate Chamber in Washington is about to be decorated with the bust of one of the most able and popular men who have presided over that body, Richard M. Johnson, of Kentucky, who was vice-president of the United States, during the presidency of Martin Van Buren.

Richard M. Johnson was one of those early statesmen who fought their way to popularity in the forests of the New World. Like Jackson, Harrison, Sam Houston, Davy Crockett and others who were familiar figures in public life during that era, Colonel Johnson had smelt gunpowder on the frontier, and knew well the ring of the savages' war wloops.

Johnson's most famous exploit was during the war of 1812. As Garfield did many years later, the bold Kentuckian resigned a seat in Congress in order to take the field. He was in command of a regiment under William Henry Harrison, and in the battle of the Thames, Oct. 5, 1813, it is believed that Johnson slew with his own hand the famous and hitherto unconquered chief, Tecumseh.

In this battle the British and the Indians were combined. The English forces were posted between the river and the marsh, while the Indians were on a high ground in the swampy land. Colonel Johnson ordered his men forward, and the English let them get within a few yards before the command to fire was given. A desperate battle took place, the Americans being victorious. Tecumseh was found on the field dead, and it was asserted that Johnson was the one who shot him, as he was killed by a man on horseback, and Johnson was the only one mounted, his command being infantry. It was also known that Johnson had been engaged in a hand-to-hand fight with one of the most desperate of the chiefs, who answered to the description of Tecumseh. Johnson himself was badly wounded.

When Colonel Johnson returned to Congress he was still too sick to walk, and was received with a triumphal procession, and a joint resolution of thanks was passed by both houses of Congress.

The Mail and Express has failed to mention the service which most of all endeared Mr. Johnson to the hearts of the people of his generation, namely, the writing of the Sunday mail reports of January, 19, 1829, and March 4 and 5, 1830. Of all Mr. Johnson's public services, the writing of these reports was singled out by his fellow-citizens in Kentucky for mention upon the tombstone which they erected in his memory.
