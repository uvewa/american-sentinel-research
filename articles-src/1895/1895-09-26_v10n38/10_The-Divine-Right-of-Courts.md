# THE DIVINE RIGHT OF COURTS.

[San Francisco Examiner, July 28.]

The criticisms that have been made on the decision of Judge Ross that overthrew the Irrigation Act have brought to the front the same dear old defenders of the courts, who protest against the dissent as a piece of sacrilege against the divine institution of the bench. A suggestion that a judge's decision is against public policy, a danger to the commonwealth, a reversal of settled principles of law, or in opposition to the intentions of the law-making body, can be depended on to bring out the solemn asses who ground their faith on the infallibility of courts, and insist that a judgment from the bench should be taken as the final settlement of any question.

It would be unfortunate for the public rights if the press took this view of the matter. No question of public policy is settled in this country until it is settled right. No declaration of a court that "this is the law" can be regarded as final unless it is a law for the benefit of the public. Courts are not omnipotent or infallible. They have not succeeded to the divine rights that went down with the Stuarts and the Bourbons. The courts are a part of the machinery of government established to secure certain public purposes. When they fail in serving these purposes; when they lay down principles that place the people in the power of corporations or confer upon wealth privileges that do not belong to it, or deny to government the powers demanded for the public welfare, it is not the public, but the courts, that must yield.

The final appeal is not to the Supreme Court. The last word has not been said when four justices in California or five gentlemen on the supreme bench at Washington have given their opinion. Their opinions are entitled to due consideration and respect, and their statement of the law must for the time be obeyed.

But there is another appeal, and that is to the power that makes courts and constitutions and molds governments and forms of society. The final appeal is to the great tribunal of the people, and on the decision of the people finally must all principles of law and government rest.

It is thus proper that the press should criticise or approve the acts and opinions of judges, so long as it does so in honesty and fairness of purpose to secure the right. The press may err, and when discussing the technical rules of securing justice and the precedents of courts is more likely to be mistaken than is a judge who has given his life to examining these rules. But when it comes to discussing the fundamental principles of government, to pronouncing on questions of public policy; to declaring that this law is good because it operates for the public interest, and that a decision is bad because it injures the people, the press is at least on even ground with the courts. Clearness of vision in regard to matters of public policy is probably more frequent in the press than among the judges on the bench.

It is thus not sacrilege, but in the public interest, that the press should protest against a decision which it believes to be wrong, and appeal from the court to the people, from the agent to the principal. If the court is right it will be sustained. If it is wrong it will be reversed in the long, slow process through which the popular will makes itself known and felt.
