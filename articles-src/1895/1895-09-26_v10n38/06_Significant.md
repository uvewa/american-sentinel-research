# SIGNIFICANT!

We have often remarked that the demand for the Sunday-closing of saloons was less in the interests of temperance than of Sunday sacredness. The following from the September 19 issue of the Examiner (Baptist), of this city, shows clearly that this is so:—

Do the liquor-dealers and their friends fully understand what they are doing in their efforts to keep saloon doors open on the Lord's day? Do they not see that they are forcing the issue—a clean sabbath or entire prohibition? There are thousands of men who do not profess to be prohibitionists, but who, when that issue is made, will take their stand. If it is the sabbath or the saloon, they will demand the suppression of the saloon. It may be that God is allowing the liquor traffic to trample on the sabbath day that the Christian heart may be fired with holy indignation against a trade that is willing to sacrifice everything sacred for its own benefit. Open doors on the Lord's day will do more to consolidate Christian sentiment against the saloon, unify the decent elements of society, and array everything that is good against the dram-shop, than anything else. The cupidity and madness of the liquor traffic are forcing the issue—a clean sabbath or entire prohibition. Open doors on Sunday will help to bring over to us thousands of men who are now halting.

This is, in effect, saying to the liquor dealers, "Close your saloons on Sunday, or else we will close them on all days." In other words it is saying, "We have power to prohibit the liquor traffic on all days, but we will not do it if the saloons will assist in giving us a 'clean sabbath.'"

We expect to see the saloons accept the compromise.
