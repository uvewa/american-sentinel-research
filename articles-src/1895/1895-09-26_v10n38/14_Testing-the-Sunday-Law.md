# TESTING THE SUNDAY LAW.

[New York World, Sept. 20.]

EX-JUDGE A. J. DITTENHOEFER appeared in the Court of Special Sessions yesterday as counsel for Anton Koeber, a waiter at Sulzer's Harlem River Park, who was on trial on a charge of sabbath-breaking. The offense alleged was selling a glass of soda water within the gates on Sunday. Mr. Dittenhoefer announced that if the decision of the court should be against his client he would carry the case to the Court of Appeals. There are about twenty-five similar cases pending against Sulzer's waiters, and he wished to make this a test case.

The case alleged by Koeber was admitted, and the ex-judge raised these points: That all sales on Sunday are not prohibited but only public selling; that a sale in an inclosure such as Sulzer's Park is not public selling; that such sale is no interruption of the repose of the community as contemplated in the statute; that soda water is a necessity; that drinking it is not prohibited, and selling it is a labor needful for the comfort of the community; that liquids are foods as well as solids; that never until very recently has the sale of soda water on Sunday been interfered with, and that the construction of the statute by which such sales are now stopped is erroneous.

The court took the matter under advisement.
