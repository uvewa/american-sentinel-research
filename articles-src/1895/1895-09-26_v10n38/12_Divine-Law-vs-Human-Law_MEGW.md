# DIVINE LAW VS. HUMAN LAW.

MRS. E. G. WHITE.

The law of God is the only rule of rectitude. Those who are loyal to that law will not be found transgressors of the law of their country, unless the lawmakers exceed their rights, and enact laws in opposition to the law of God; then God must be obeyed. "If ye love me," says Christ, "keep my commandments." The world may set up its standards and maxima, and governments may enact laws; but if they are counter to the law of Jehovah, the Christian must necessarily be loyal to God, whatever may be the consequences.

The Christian is in the world, but not of the world. He is to represent the character of God in obedience to his holy, just, and good law. Daniel was a noble statesman; but his best service to Babylon was his unswerving integrity in the worship of God. In spite of the king's decree, he prayed three times a day with his window open towards Jerusalem, and made no compromise with an idolatrous nation.

Great is the responsibility of the Christian world. All heaven is looking down upon those who claim to be Christians, and have the Bible, and yet are not searching the word that they may find out what is truth. By precept and example they are teaching the world to transgress God's holy law, and to ignore the seventh-day Sabbath, which he has blessed and hallowed, and declared to be his holy day. Oh that the vast army of professed Christians would teach men to shun the example of Adam, who, by transgression, opened the floodgates of woe on our world. But with this example before them, and all its dreadful consequences, they continue to transgress. They have set the world on the wrong track; they lead sinners away from the path of obedience to God's word into false paths. They might have been a power for good; but what a responsibility will they have to meet in that day when every man shall receive as his works have been.
