# VERY TRUE!

[The Examiner (Baptist).]

Great zeal in religious matters does not always indicate religious principles or religious motives. Demetrius was very zealous for the worship of "Diana of the Ephesians." He was very clearly influenced by the business profit resulting from the making of "silver shrines of the goddess." His appeal to the workmen was, "In this means we have our wealth." "There is danger that this our trade come into disrepute." He cunningly appealed also to the feelings of the populace who did care for the worship of Diana, and admired her "magnificence." He was an astute manager in this matter, and as unprincipled as have been many other managers since his day, where money making is concerned. Many a bad business is advocated for the same reasons which influenced Demetrius. It is not unusual for men in many occupations to consider alone the profit of them. Liquor men are not pursuing their business from benevolent, or moral, or philanthropic motives. It is solely for the money which is in it, even though the money be stained with tears and blood, that they follow the business. The interests of architects and builders in the erection of temples of worship, is not a guarantee of their devotion or piety. Real estate men have been known to offer liberally for churches because of their influence in promoting the value or ready sale of lands. Noah's carpenters possibly were interested in the ark, but perished in the flood in spite of ark and interest.
