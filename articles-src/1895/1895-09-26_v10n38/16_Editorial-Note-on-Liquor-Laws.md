# EDITORIAL NOTE ON LIQUOR LAWS.

THE SENTINEL has always insisted that the laws against the sale of liquors on Sunday were designed, not so much for protection of the people against the evils of the liquor traffic, as for the protection of the so-called Christian sabbath. That we are correct in this is shown by a remark in the Christian Statesman of the 31st ult.: "Sabbath laws need enforcement against the excursion as well as against the saloon." The fact is that if the Sunday-law advocates had their way it would be impossible for the masses of the people to go anywhere on Sunday except to bed or to church. The thousands who see the country only on Sunday would see it no more. And the hundreds of thousands to whom the cheap Sunday excursions is a real boon, and who are for six days of the week confined in hot, crowded offices, shops and factories, would be compelled to spend Sunday on the streets or in the narrow quarters afforded by city tenements—that is, unless they spent an hour or two at church—and this latter is really what the Sunday preachers want—they propose to gain by indirection that which every American constitution forbids, namely, compulsory attendance at church.

Let no one misunderstand the position of the AMERICAN SENTINEL. We are radical in our temperance principles, and for this reason we insist that the real issue should not be made secondary to Sunday sacredness. Let all laws for the regulation or prohibition of the liquor traffic be enacted and enforced for the protection of the rights of the people and not for the protection of a day held by some to be sacred. The conservation of human rights is the only proper object of human law.
