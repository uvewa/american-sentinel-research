# WORSHIPED THE IMAGE.

BY W. S. CHAPMAN.

In ancient times King Nebuchadnezzar, of Babylon, erected a golden image in the plains of Dura, and issued the following command to the people:—

O people, nations and languages, That at what time ye bear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, peallery, dolcimer, and all kinds of music, ye fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king hath set up. Dan. 3: 4, 5.

In the exercises, "Children's Day," at Cheswold, Md., in the Methodist Episcopal churches of that place, occurred a most remarkable and startling reproduction of the enforced worship of an image, which we find recorded by Daniel the prophet. In these churches the pulpits were removed out of the way, and in place of a pulpit a representation of a golden gate arranged—typifying the entrance to the city of God in heaven. Beside the gate stood a female (Virgin Mary) having a key which unlocked the gate (key of Peter). From among the audience young girls were selected to personate the Christian graces. These, in turn, approached the gate, each being met at its entrance by the female guard (Mary), who presented the key by which alone entrance through the gate could be obtained. The pastor of the church (as high priest) superintended the whole performance, issuing directions and offering explanations. As each of the young women went forward and received the key, strains of music issued from the organ, and the command came from the pastor—"At the sound of music let everyone in the audience bow down before the image of the 'Heavenly Gate,'" and all the audience did so bow down.

Of the organization from which such exhibitions eminate, and are promulgated, and which is striving for unity of action between Catholics and Protestants, Rev. W. H. McMillan, in his speech at the convention in Boston, said, speaking of the Catholic views of the body he represented:—

They suggested that the spirit of love and brotherhood was in harmony with that through which Pope Leo hoped to operate in bringing about the Christian unity for which his recent encyclical letter prays.

There was but one hopeful thing connected with these exhibitions, and that was that afterwards, upon reflection, many of the more sober-minded realized the enormity of the offense which had been committed.
