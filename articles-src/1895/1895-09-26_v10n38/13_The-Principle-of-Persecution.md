# THE PRINCIPLE OF PERSECUTION.

[Southern Sentinel, Melbourne, Australia.]

SAYS Canon Potter, referring to the late controversy arising from the church union question:—

If the present discussion were to win from Rome an authoritative repudiation of the principle of religious persecution, something real would be done to pave the way for the reunion of Christendom.—Melbourne Argus, May 13, 1895.

Yes; anything that would win from Rome a repudiation of the principle of religious persecution would accomplish a great thing indeed. But nothing will ever do it; for the Roman Church is built upon this very principle, and it would cease to be the Roman Church the moment it repudiated it. The principle of religious persecution is the principle that the church has the right to use the power of the State, that the church has a right to be established and supported, and have its doctrines and dogmas supported, by law; and this even the Church of England, Canon Potter's own church, has not yet repudiated. It still holds on tenaciously to its establishment and its Sunday laws. We only wish that every soul on earth would refuse to unite with any church until it would repudiate this principle of religious persecution. A grand stride, indeed, would this be for the right, should they do it. There would still be one church left they could join,—the church of Jesus Christ. That never persecutes.
