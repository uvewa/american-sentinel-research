# JAILED FOR "OBSTRUCTING THE STREETS."

The Sabbath Recorder, of the 19th inst., has the following relative to the imprisonment of members of the Salvation Army:—

While the persecutions for conscience' sake are going on in Georgia and Tennessee against Seventh-day Adventists, Pontiac, Mich., has thrown eleven Salvationists into jail on a charge of "obstructing the streets."

These prisoners say they also are persecuted for conscience' sake. But there is a wide difference between their alleged offense and that of the Seventh-day Adventists. The latter consider it a sin to work on the day which Jehovah has set apart, blessed and sanctified and commanded all men to observe as his Sabbath; while no Scriptural law would be violated by refraining from obstructing the streets which the city ordinance forbids. There may be and probably is a spirit of persecution exhibited in the former case, but the victims stand on very different grounds from those who are persecuted for Sabbath observance. To obey the law of the land, in one case is a sin against God; in the other case it is right and honorable. In one case it "renders unto Cesar the things that are Cesar's;" and in the other case "unto God the things that are God's."

Being ignorant of the facts in this Michigan case, we cannot of course say that the authorities acted arbitrarily in the matter; but we are convinced that in most instances the offense of the Salvationists is only technical. We have seen a good many Salvation Army street meetings, and never yet saw a street seriously obstructed. There certainly is the difference pointed out by the Recorder, and yet it is safe to say that if the "obstruction" were occasioned by some political club no arrests would be made.
