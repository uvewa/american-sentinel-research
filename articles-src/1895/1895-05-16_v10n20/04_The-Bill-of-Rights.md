[From the Dayton (Tenn.), Republican, April 26.]

Since the cases of the Graysville Adventists have come before the courts, the Republican has had a good deal to say about this Christian organization, and the prosecution they have suffered because of their consistent adherence to the biblical command to keep the seventh day of the week, or Saturday, as the day of physical rest and spiritual exaltation.

There are those in this community who differ with us as to the rights and privileges these people are entitled to in their belief before the civil law of the State. They deny that the law persecutes them when they are arrested, fined and imprisoned for working on Sunday, or the first day of the week. Their arguments are all of one color. They say the law does not restrain or prohibit the Adventists in observing Saturday as the day of rest and religious worship, and that it only operates against them when they fail to observe Sunday also; and they base this argument on the plea that the minority must conform to the usages and customs of the majority.

In reply to this the Adventists claim that in matters of spiritual belief one man is as much entitled to his opinion as ten thousand who hold a contrary opinion, and that this is plainly recognized and set forth in the State constitution. Upon this they rest their claim. Of course if this is denied and legorteman and juggling of words is used to twist and distort the plain meaning and intent of the constitution, then indeed there is no use in making any sort of argument in the case.

Article 3 of the Bill of Rights of the State constitution says:—

So human law can in any case whatever control or interfere with the rights of conscience, and no preference shall ever be given by law to any religious establishment or mode of worship.

The Adventists' "mode of worship" is to observe Saturday as the Sabbath; this the law does not interfere with. The "mode of worship" of the majority of the Christians of the State is to observe Sunday as the Sabbath; this the law has legalized and thereby has given preference to this "religious establishment or mode of worship," in direct violation of the constitution; and this same law requires the seventh-day observers to keep Sunday, or the first day, also, thereby robbing them of one-sixth of the time they are naturally entitled to.

The Adventists observe fifty-two Saturdays in the year as the Sabbath; this they believe is solemnly rejoined upon them in God's Word; the law of the State, that is to say, a legislative enactment, requires them to also observe fifty-two Sundays; this makes one hundred and four days of rest, half of it enforced. They are ground between the upper and nether millstones—God's command and the State's command. As between the two they obey God's mandate, believing that it is higher than man's law; that it is, in fact, the fundamental law of the universe, and that its violation will be punished with death everlasting. With them it is a solemn choice as to the conscientious discharge of their duty. It is not because they love Caesar less, but Rome more. They claim that the divine command to labor six days in the week is just as mandatory as the injunction to observe the seventh day as the Sabbath.

For this the Adventists are called fanatics, and it has been said that they delight to pose as martyrs. We do not believe this. It is certainly no light matter for these people to undergo these persecutions; and when one reflects that they could avoid them by a simple surrender of the steadfast faith that is in them, their sublime confidence in the integrity of their cause and their devotion to principle is something beautiful. They have the spirit of the old fathers of Israel, in that they meekly submit to persecution for faith's sake. In this day and age, when the obligations of Church and State lie so lightly upon us, and we are too apt to "bend the pregnant hinges of the knee that thrift may follow fawning," it is refreshing to witness such devotion to principle.

The trouble is, that on this question the Church and State are at variance. The State has assumed to interpret the Scriptures for us and lay down an iron-clad rule regulating our faith and practice. As has always happened in a union of Church and State, great injustice is worked to a body of Christians who cannot agree with the State. Every man should be allowed to interpret the Bible according to the guide furnished him by his own reason and conscience; the Pilgrim Fathers landed on Plymouth Rock to enunciate this truth. Their descendants cannot afford to go backward. The growth of humanity should be towards breadth and freedom.

A large number of States have exemption clauses that release all persons who conscientiously observe Saturday as the Sabbath from the operations of the Sunday law, thus recognizing that the minority have just as many rights as the majority in matters involving religious belief, just so long as they do not trench upon or interfere with the natural rights of others.

The State of Tennessee should enact some legislation that will afford the people relief. They are among our best Christian people, thrifty, frugal, God-fearing, law-abiding, obeying in their proper spheres both Church and State, good neighbors, kind fathers and husbands. They are truly imbued with a deep piety and fervor unusual in this age of loose materialism. How any one can feel offended toward them on account of their religious practices is more than the writer, who is not himself an Adventist, an understand. Rather should they receive the approbation of every right-minded person for their consistent adherence to the plain teaching of the Bible, a book that all Christian denominations profess to revere above everything else on earth, but which seems to have rather fallen into disuse as a moral code of faith and practice.
