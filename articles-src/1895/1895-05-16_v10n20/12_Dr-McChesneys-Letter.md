Walnut Hills, April 28, 1895.

Rev. Wm. McKibbin, D. D.—Dear Sir: After further deliberation, I concluded not to advertise from my pulpit the Municipal Reform meeting, to be held at your church, and, therefore, feel obliged to give you my reasons.

1. I am unwilling at this juncture to seem to be even in part responsible for the sentiments of reform speakers of whose antecedents I am not adequately advised.

2. I am not satisfied in my own mind that the moral effect of this reform agitation is for reform, pure and simple, unalloyed by political aspirations of participants, and which at the outcome might prove that our churches had been used as a leverage to resuscitate moribund politicians.

3. If it is a question of bossism I will say that I hesitate about becoming a party to an exchange until I shall know something about the substitute boss. I would not exchange even a pack horse until I had seen the other horse.

4. We have recently been furnished with so striking an illustration of the possible political effects of a municipal reform movement in the city of Columbus, Ohio, that, personally, I do not care to participate in a similar reformation in Cincinnati—especially at a time when the nation itself is prostrate in consequence of the denomination of a power which deceived the country with the cry of reform.

5. The citizens of Cincinnati, including the laity of our churches, are better advised as to the actual facts than our city pastors can be, if they are occupied chiefly with pastoral duties. Is it because the laity are so lumpish that the ministers are shut up to the alternative of leading the reform movement, and that too, under the disadvantage of the suspicion of endeavoring to play the role of a Parkhurst?

Are our laymen so much afraid of imperiling secular interests that they have not the courage to participate to any appreciable extent in a public reform movement? Who believes that?

If that be true, it would seem that our first duty as ministers is to reform the laity.

The non-enforcement of the law is, indeed, a serious affair in municipal government. Is it any the less serious in matters ecclesiastical?

Again, in a country where government is established upon the basis of separation of Church and State, citizenship, with all its privileges and responsibilities, remains alike to preachers and laymen.

How far it is proper and just for ecclesiastical organizations, as such, to make war upon the municipal authorities, is a question which calls for serious consideration.

Is it not safe to affirm that in a country where liberty is supposed to mean something besides license, if the civil authorities were to make war upon any ecclesiastical organization, there would be no hesitation about the assertion of rights under the Constitution?

As guardians of public morals there can be little room for doubt as to the legitimate functions of the churches.

By what means, and in what way, and to what extent, such guardianship shall assert itself are still open questions.

I prefer, therefore, to confine my responsibility in the practice to my own pulpit. With assurance of personal esteem, I am, sincerely yours,

S. MCCHESNEY.
