[From Zion's Watch Tower.]

Or all religionists "Protestants" seem the most inconsistent. Evangelist Moody continues to charge Protestants a good stiff price for reviving them, but shows his love for papists by donating $500 to help build a Roman Catholic church, and by prohibiting the sale upon his school premises of a newspaper containing an anti-Romanist article.

The World's Parliament of Religions clearly showed that many professed ministers of Christ were not only ready to ignore the faith, but even the sense of Christ—to draw men after them.

Recently a Baptist church edifice was dedicated, and all the denominations of the town were represented at the ceremony by their ministers except the Roman Catholic. For his consistency and honesty the priest was roundly denounced. His reply was to the effect that he recognized a wide difference between the teachings of his church and those of the one to be honored by the dedicatory services, and that he wished to be consistent and honest in his conduct as well as in his professions.

A Jewish synagogue was dedicated in Cleveland, and Protestant ministers vised with one another at the service to show that faith in Christ means nothing. This is not Christian love, or "love of the brethren," so highly commended by the apostle as one of the evidences that we "have passed from death unto life." It is worldly love—the result either of ignorance or of disloyalty to Christ. It is the kind of love mentioned in the Scriptures thus: "If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him."

Far better, far more consistent, is the Jewish view of the matter, expressed by the Jewish Exponent, as follows:

The participation of Christian divines in the services at Jewish houses of worship, a notable instance of which—at the dedication of a synagogue in Cleveland—has attracted attention, is accepted as a welcome evidence of good-will and mutual toleration, if it has no under or deeper significance.

It must be confessed, however, that the expression of this sentiment in this way does not seem specially appropriate. For men to ignore broad lines of demarcation, and to announce a harmony where none exists, can only lead to eventual discord. We prefer that Christians and Jews shall remain distinct in the domain of religion, mutually respecting each other's convictions, but agreeing to disagree on this one subject. On all others they can join hands, or at least the lines of cleavage will be other than between Jews and Christians.

On occasions of large and general importance, even of religious significance, it may not be unmust for Jews and Christians to join where no sectarian question is at issue. On other occasions it is better to follow the Mosaic injunction not to remove the landmarks.

Not a great while ago a conference of Christians and Jews was held in the First M. E. Church of Chicago, in which ministers of several denominations took prominent part, notably Revs. W. E. Blackstone, C. A. Blanchard, D. C. Marquis, E. P. Goodwin. The meetings were opened and closed with devotional "exercises"—singing, prayer, etc.,—and the name of Christ was entirely ignored; even the benediction was Moses' blessing, written off and read for the occasion.

The Chicago Tribune criticized the matter and interviewed both Jews and Christians on the subject. The Jewish Rabbi said:—

It was undoubtedly the intention on the part of those who arranged the affair to have all reference to Christ and the Trinity omitted from the devotional exercises. As such it was a great concession on their part, and I think an unfortunate one. More than that, it was the most inconsistent in those who believe that prayer should be offered in the name of Christ. It seems to me that the whole thing was unfortunate.

I do not wish to be understood as questioning the honest intent of the promoters of the conference. I was of the impression that it was a scheme to convert us and wrote Mr. Blackstone that were such the case he had better not waste his efforts. He assured me that such was not the case, and I am now convinced to that effect. I am quite certain it did no good, and I hope it did no harm. I was amused at one thing: Mr. Blackstone asked me if I thought the conference would draw a crowd. I replied that it certainly would, as anything in the nature of a show was certain to draw well in Chicago. He replied that he intended to take from it the character of a show by having devotional exercises. I was much surprised at that, wondering all the while how Jews and Christians could possibly worship together. You see, I did not think they would eliminate Christ. It was done, I suppose, to give the conference a solemn character. This end, however, was not fully attained, as I was often interrupted, during my address, by applause.
