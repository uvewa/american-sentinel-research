*[By Wm. Geo. Oppenheim, in New York World.]*

If I were a philosopher I might offer some reflections on and draw some deductions from certain perplexities that beset men of this city on Sunday. As, for instance, if I were a philosopher, I might ask myself where freedom of action ends and restraint begins.

On Sunday Mr. De Smythe is at liberty—if he is a member of an uptown club—to enter its reception-room, call for any beverage, vinous, malt, or spirituous, and have it brought to him with most perfunctory elegance by a swallow-tailed waiter. But Mr. De Smythe is not permitted on that holy day to buy beer, wine, or liquor at a hotel or saloon bar.

On Sunday John Smith is free to go to the park or a garden and listen to the strains that issue from the kiosk, but he is restrained on that holy day from listening to instrumental music in a public hall. He may go to a concert in the evening, where gems from operas are sung by Melba, De Reszke, or Scalchi, but he cannot hear an opera in its entirety.

On Sunday he may take a pleasure trip on a steamboat or may witness a swimming match, but he is debarred from seeing athletes bat at a baseball. On Sunday he may buy a cigar, but it is made a crime to sell him a pair of gloves or an umbrella. On Sunday he may drive with considerable rapidity on the boulevard, but he may not witness a race.

On Sunday Mr. De Smythe's coachman is permitted to drive him to the church door and wait on the box till the service is over, and after that may drive him to his club, where he gets his dinner and his bottle of '64 Hochheimer; but the coachman may not take either wife or sweetheart on Sunday to a grove where there are music and beer, Hochheimer, or anything but plain Crotonheimer.

On Sunday he may buy a good dinner either at his club or at a hotel, but the grocers are forbidden, under penalties, to sell him the wherewithal to make a Sunday dinner at home.

On Sunday De Smythe may be shaved by the obsequious Figaro at his club-rooms, but it is now contemplated that this necessity shall be denied to plain John Smith at the hairdressing rooms throughout the city.

On Sunday he may look at the panorama in Twenty-fourth Street, but the sight of a pantomime in Fourteenth Street is debarred him.

On Sunday he may hear the blare of trumpets and the music of Cappa's band at the head of a funeral parade, but itinerant musicians with the best of intentions and wind are not allowed to play for him on this same Sunday.

Strange, isn't it?
