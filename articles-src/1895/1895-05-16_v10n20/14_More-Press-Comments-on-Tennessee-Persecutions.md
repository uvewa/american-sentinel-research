[From the Charlotte (Mich.) Tribune, April 17.]

The spirit of Cotton Mather seems to be controlling affairs at Dayton, Tenn., where no less than five Adventists have been in jail for a month for no other reason than that they serve God according to the dictates of their own consciences. The Protestant churches should be the loudest in condemnation of such practices.

["Protestant," in Noblesville (Ind.) Ledger, April 19.]

Now this persecution is as plain a violation of this law as is possible, to say nothing of the Constitution of the United States and Declaration of Independence, which guarantee the utmost religious freedom. And yet to say nothing of the laws and precepts of the Bible, which these same persecutors profess to believe, every law and precept of which they violate—especially the great ten commandment law that says, "The seventh day is the Sabbath." They break the law themselves and then punish men for keeping it. "How long, O Lord! how long?"

[From the New Era, Grand Junction, Ia., April 20.]

The Governor of Tennessee has pardoned the five Adventists, in Rissa County jail, on conviction of working on Sunday. This comes at the same time with the distribution of the AMERICAN SENTINEL, a church paper, containing a full showing of the cause and principle to sustain which these Tennessee members of the church accepted imprisonment rather than pay fines.

[From Mystic (Conn.) Press, April 3.]

The article headed "Religious Persecution," in another column, reveals the existence of laws on the statute books of at least one of the States of the Union, and a disposition to enforce them oppressively, totally incompatible with a free State under an enlightened government. Such proscription and persecution for conscience' sake is a step backward toward the iron rule of a godless ecclesiasticism in the Dark Ages.

[From the Sunday Gazetteer, Denison, Tex.]

Some persons, and there are "orthodox" Christians among the number, are disposed to sneer at these people [Seventh-day Adventists] who go to prison rather than obey a civil law which they believe to be an infraction of a divine command, and which undoubtedly annuls the constitutional guarantee of religious liberty. Those who criticize the action of these people are certainly not familiar with the history of primitive Christianity. The Christians of the first two centuries gloried in martyrdom, and rather than obey Roman laws requiring them to observe certain time-honored customs they believed to be contrary to the teachings of Jesus, they submitted to the most excruciating tortures, if we may believe the statements of the fathers. Few Christians at this time are seeking martyrdom, but the best representatives we have of primitive Christianity in this respect are the Seventh-day Adventists.

[From the Nashville (Tenn.) Banner.]

There is a law on the status books of Tennessee which says no man shall work on Sunday, and as these people believe the fourth commandment requires them to keep holy the seventh day of the week, and consequently work on Sunday as any other day of the week, their enemies in the neighborhood had them indicted for Sabbath-breaking.

The most prominent people in the colony thus fell under the heavy hand of the law. Nine of them were convicted and sent to jail for terms ranging from sixteen to seventy-six days each. Among them were the principal of the school and his first assistant and the minister of the colony. This caused the academy to be closed and sadly interrupted the serenity of the community.

In passing the sentence upon the nine men, Judge Parks recited the Sunday law and the Supreme Court decision upholding it, and then expressed his personal regret that some of the best and most law-abiding citizens of the county should be compelled to suffer persecution in the matter of conscience.

[From the Noblesville (Ind.) Ledger, April 19.]

Is another column of this paper will be found a communication in reference to the prosecution of Seventh-day Adventists in Tennessee for violation of the Sunday law. The author of the article does not overstate the matter when he says it is persecution similar to that in the days of the early Christians. It is an interference with religious liberty and a relic of the Dark Ages that is greatly at variance with the principles of religious liberty and freedom of conscience conceded and guaranteed to the people of this United States. If Tennessee has a statute requiring some of her citizens to observe Sunday as a day of rest when they religiously and conscientiously observe another day for that purpose, it should be repealed.

The facts in the case, as the Ledger understands it, are that a community of Adventists in Tennessee, sober, honest, upright people, had built up a large school there and were living according to their religious belief, until certain evil-minded persons had them arrested and broke up the school by imprisoning the teacher because of observing the seventh instead of the first day of the week.

Such persecution in the name of the law must fail of the purpose intended, and will sooner or later react against those instigating and encouraging it.
