It was supposed that the Sunday saloon would be the first point of attack by the Sunday Observance League of St. Paul, but it has turned out to be the Sunday baseball game. From early spring, preparations have been going on in order that St. Paul might not be behind other cities by being minus a Sunday baseball game. The grounds were leased and enclosed, and stands were made. During all this time there was not a ripple on the surface indicating the deep under-current that was running counter to the popular game; nor was there anything that indicated the storm that would soon break on the heads of the movers in the enterprise. But on Friday, April 19, before the first game was to be played, the wind began to blow. The mayor was visited by a representative of the Sunday Observance League, the Rev. C. E. Haupt, of the Church of the Messiah, who suggested that it would be for the good of the community to put a stop to the game. As his honor was of a different opinion as to what would be for the good of the community, they could not agree; the mayor contending that the best government was the one that governed least. Mr. Haupt could hardly admit the truth of this maxim, as he thought the people could not govern themselves; and that it was only true when the people were fully capable of self-government.

But a query arises on this point. Admitting that the people are not fully capable of self-government, who made the Sunday Observance League the governors of the people who cannot govern themselves? Where are their credentials?

Mr. Haupt urged his case as a needful one, and pointed to the fact that there is a statute forbidding baseball games and prize fights on Sunday; but all to no effect, for the mayor thought such laws were not to be strictly enforced, but only held as a club over the heads of transgressors.

In an interview with a press representative, Mr. Haupt candidly admitted in the following words that the movement was for the sake of enforcing "Sabbath [Sunday] observance":

I think that the Sunday law should be enforced and the Sabbath observed in all respects if it is to be observed at all. I did not ask Mayor Smith to stop the Sunday baseball game because my church is within two blocks of the ball grounds, but merely because I believe that if the Sabbath is to be a blessing to us it should be fully observed.

That is to say: Mr. Haupt believes that the Sabbath is to be observed on Sunday, and that in a particular manner, in order that the Sabbath may be a blessing; and that he finds no other way in which to bring about the desired observance except to appeal to the civil authority and demand the enforcement of civil law against the unbeliever! Is this doing as he would like to be done by? Is it Christian?

The game was played, and still the battle rages, for a second game, under protection of four special and one mounted police, has been played. Several mass meetings have been held, both for and against the games being played on Sunday. Petitions and counterpettitions have been circulated, and sermons have been preached against the games; the "Saturday half holiday" has been strongly advocated, and attorneys have been consulted. Thus, as in the earlier centuries, the Church will turn the seventh day of the week, God's Sabbath, into a holiday and a day of revelry, in order that it may exalt the man-made Sabbath, the "wild solar holiday of all pagan times."

At this writing, the question is still unsettled. The mayor is still obdurate, and the opposers of the games are determined. Of course no one can predict the outcome.

St. Paul, May 6.
