The Evening Journal, of Lewiston, Maine, in its issue of May 7, gives some account of the Methodist Conference at Saco, Maine, in which it is related how the chairman "Rev. Dr. Stackpole, of Auburn, chairman of the committee on Sabbath observance," threw a bombshell into the conference in the shape of certain resolutions touching the observance of Sunday. One of the doctor's propositions was that whereas "the Sabbath was made for man and not man for the Sabbath," "whatever ministers to his welfare, physical, mental, moral, and religious, is good," and not to be prohibited. "Recreation," says the doctor, "that brings real rest to the body and soul should not be prohibited." This was entirely too liberal to meet the mind of the conference as was also this proposition: "The notion that God is a stickler as to what twenty-four hours of the week should be specially consecrated to him is belittling to God and man. Custom and propriety commend the Lord's day. . . . Great charity must be used toward those who conscientiously differ from us in the estimation of the day and its observance."

But this was an application of the seventh-part-of-time theory not to be tolerated in a Methodist conference, and so Dr. Stackpole's resolutions were rejected and others substituted. The Maine Methodists have no charity to waste on those who differ from them as to the day to be observed as the Sabbath.
