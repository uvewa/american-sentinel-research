[From the Times-Democrat, New Orleans, La.]

A DISTATCH from Nashville, Tenn., which the Times-Democrat published a few days ago, gave an account of an act of clemency on the part of Governor Turney of that State which will meet with universal approbation outside the ranks of the "unco guild" who hold that only what they themselves believe and do has the sanction of heaven.

We have called the governor's act an act of clemency, but it would have been nearer the mark to call it an act of simple justice. For what was it? In one of the counties of Tennessee there is a large colony of what is known as "Seventh-day Adventists," one of the articles of whose creed is that the seventh, not the first, day of the week is the Christian Sabbath. They worship, therefore, on the seventh day of the week, and work on the first.

That arrangement did not suit the self-righteous views of the Tennesseans in their vicinity, who rest and worship on the first day of the week; and, accordingly, to prevent the Seventh-day Adventists from working on the first day of the week, they invoked some Blue Laws of Tennessee which are a relic of mediocre barbarism and which are maintained by a State only to its disgrace, and under the terms of these Blue Laws they had a number of the most prominent Seventh-day Adventists and into prison for periods varying from sixteen to seventy-six days. Among the nine Adventists jailed like common felons was the minister of the colony, which is an exceedingly well-behaved and prosperous colony, and the principal of the academy.

Those of the incarcerated Adventists who had the short sentences to work out worked them out and were liberated; and at the end of last week Governor Turney extended official clemency to those who had the longer sentences imposed on them, and restored them to the freedom of which it is a veritable scandal to the State of Tennessee that they should ever have been deprived.

Now, if we mistake not, the readers of the Times-Democrat will agree with us in doubling whether the word "clemency" should be applied to the governor's act. If the word "clemency" can be applied under the circumstances, it can only be in that stereotyped signification when clemency is merely equivalent to the stoppage of a continuing injustice. And such clemency is of course no clemency, in the proper acceptation of the term, to men who are being outrageously, even if legally, robbed of their freedom.

But, clemency or no clemency, the incarceration of these well-behaved and responsible citizens for holding to a religious belief which happens not to be the belief of the majority and for giving their religious belief its appropriate action, is one of the worst instances of persecution which this country has witnessed in this latter part of the nineteenth century, when we had proudly been flattering ourselves that we had attained the perfection of religious toleration. The Tennesseans who invoked an old Blue Law against these men and put them in prison had their prototype in a well-known scriptural character who prayed much in public, and whose prayer was mostly a recital of his self-asserted superiority to other men; and their Christianity is more the Christianity of a Torquemada than of Him who preached that wonderful sermon on the mount which is the world's high-water mark of kindliness and brotherly love.

The enlightened State of Tennessee should have the law which sends such men to jail repealed with the least possible delay, or it will lay itself open to a charge of narrow-minded intolerance which will cause civilization, let alone religion, to blush for very shame.
