A GENTLEMAN, writing to the Dayton Republican, from Sherman Heights, a suburb of Chattanooga, Tenn., has this to say about the Adventist cases in Rhea County:

I admire the stand you have taken in the matter of the arrest and imprisonment of the Seventh-day Adventists. I am just as much in favor of law and order, and of the observance and conformity to the law, as any man, especially the observance of the day recognized by a great majority of the Christian people as the Sabbath, but this thing of straining at a goat and swallowing an elephant is disgusting. A man who believes that he is doing no wrong, and in his judgment violating no law of the Bible, goes out and chops a little kindling wood or does some other work that he deems right on the day which he thinks is a week day. What a sensation is created! With what holy horror the saints hold up their hands and cry out, "Crucify him! Crucify him!" While he is at this labor, to him not wrong, along comes a railroad train, thundering and roaring and whistling and jarring the earth, disturbing the worshipers while engaged in their religious duties. Come to Sherman Heights, even, and you can go to the store and buy what you wish on Sunday. Pinnies and various other amusements abound. In the large cities theaters are open day and night. On our rivers steamboats are plying their trade. Furnaces run full blast on Sunday. Why does the law not take hold of them?

The question raised by the correspondent of the Republican is easily answered: the Sunday work of the Adventists is a protest against Sunday sacredness because it is coupled with Sabbath rest. Hence the offense to the moral sentiment of the community.
