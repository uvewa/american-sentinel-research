Or the Charlton Sunday bill, referred to by us last week, the Toronto World, of the 9th inst., says:—

At the evening session Charlton's Sabbath Observance bill was considered in committee and eventually a motion of Mr. W. F. Maclean's that the committee rise, was carried by 37 to 25. This for the present kills the bill, but Mr. Charlton will endeavor to get it restored to the order paper.

In the discussion of the bill, one member (Mr. Maclean) said, as reported in the Toronto Daily Mail, "The mover of the bill posed as an opponent to trade restriction, but wanted to restrict liberty of conscience. He would like to forge a yoke to place around the neck of the people."

Mr. Curran characterized the language of the section as vague and indefinite, and said endless litigation would result if it was adopted. The section exempted religious publications without affording any definition of what a religious publication was.

Mr. Amyot, the gentleman who so ably opposed a similar bill introduced by Mr. Charlton last year, thought that moral legislation of the character desired by the honorable gentleman was not within the sphere of the House. He also resented the arbitrary setting aside of the first day of the week by the honorable gentleman, when all creeds did not recognize it as the Sabbath day. And Mr. Amyot is right.
