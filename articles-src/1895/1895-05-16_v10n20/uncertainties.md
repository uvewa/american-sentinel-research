## OCR Corrections Made

### Page 1, Column 2, line 80
- **OCR read:** "Matt. 3:11, 12"
- **Corrected to:** "Matt. 5:11, 12"
- **Reason:** Context is the Beatitudes from Matthew 5, not Matthew 3 (which is about John the Baptist). This is an OCR error confusing 5 with 3.

### Page 2, Column 1, line 95
- **OCR read:** "imposed from the high position"
- **Likely meant:** "deposed from the high position"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM
- **Reason:** Context suggests removal from position, "deposed" makes more sense than "imposed"

### Page 2, Column 2, line 134
- **OCR read:** "legorteman and juggling"
- **Likely meant:** "legerdemain and juggling"
- **Confidence:** HIGH
- **Reason:** "Legerdemain" (sleight of hand, trickery) is a real word that fits the context; "legorteman" is not

### Page 3, Column 1, line 174
- **OCR read:** "spekes"
- **Corrected to:** "spoken"
- **Confidence:** HIGH
- **Reason:** Luke 24:25 context requires past participle "spoken"

- **Reason:** This appears to be a subsection heading based on layout and content

### Page 4, Column 2, line 258

- **Reason:** This appears to be a subsection heading based on layout and content

### Page 5, Column 1, line 284

- **Reason:** This appears to be a subsection heading based on layout and content

- **Article break identified** - "MORE PRESS COMMENTS ON TENNESSEE PERSECUTIONS"
- **Reason:** Clear new article with compilation of newspaper excerpts

### Page 6, Column 2, line 442
- **Subheading:** "Gubernatorial Clemency"
- **Reason:** Separate article from Times-Democrat within the press comments section

### Page 7, Column 1, line 468
- **Title formatting:** Added single # before "THE BIBLE DAY AND THE MEETING AT TROAS"
- **Reason:** Major article heading

### Page 7, Column 2, line 492
- **Title formatting:** Added single # before "PUBLICATIONS ON THE SABBATH QUESTION"
- **Reason:** This is an advertisement section, not a substantive article - skipped in article files

- **Title formatting:** Added single # before "BIBLES"
- **Reason:** This is an advertisement - skipped in article files

## Editorial Notes

- Author attribution "R. F. Pielps" for article 10 - this appears to be "R. F. Phelps" based on typical name patterns, but preserved as written in original
- Several articles are reprints from secular newspapers defending Seventh-day Adventists
- Advertisement sections at end of issue (BIBLES, publications) were not transcribed as article files per instructions
