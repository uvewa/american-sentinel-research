The genuineness of the special code called the "Blue Laws of Connecticut" is questioned, but that these laws expressed the prevailing religious prejudice there can be no doubt. The people of New England two hundred years ago were not distinguished for pious hospitality. A person of a different faith from the common Puritan belief was a foe. There was little religious toleration among the early settlers of our land. A Puritan had little charity, and while he wished freedom to worship God in his way, he was not willing to allow another freedom to differ from him.

Quakers and Catholics were objects of particular aversion to the Puritan. He was not able to comprehend how his God allowed a Quaker to live on the earth, or a Catholic to breathe the air of heaven. To his mind God erred in not putting them out of existence without apology. In these so-called "Blue Laws of Connecticut" we find three against the Quaker and two against Catholic priests. They are as follows:—

If any person turn Quaker, he shall be banished, and not suffered to return upon pain of death.

No Quaker or Dissenter from the established worship of this Dominion shall be allowed to give a vote for the election of magistrates or any officer.

No food or lodging shall be offered to a Quaker, Adamite, or other invectus.

No Catholic priest shall abide in this dominion; he shall be banished and suffer death on his return.

Priests may be seized by anyone without a warrant.

We make fun of the Blue Laws, but there are laws on the statute books of Massachusetts that were born of religious intolerance. People must be just as free to doubt, or to deny as to believe, and they must be entitled to as much consideration from the State as the most devout worshiper, so long as they are honest, upright citizens. The State should know neither Christian, Jew, nor infidel, and all laws which punish men for non-observance of a certain religious custom ought to be repealed.
