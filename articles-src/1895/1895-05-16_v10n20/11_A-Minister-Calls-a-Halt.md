[From the Cincinnati Enquirer, April 30.]

At a meeting of the Methodist ministers yesterday morning, Rev. Dr. Davis W. Clark, of the Union Church, Covington, read a paper entitled, "Paul, the First Professor of Pastoral Theology." He created a sensation by saying that ministers of the gospel had no business in bringing into their pulpits discussions on municipal reform. St. Paul had been a roaming missionary, not an agitator nor reformer, but a non-partisan in the modern sense of that word. He had not even proclaimed against slavery. The ministers' full and ready field was to engage in a spiritual warfare upon strict gospel lines. Instead of spending so much of their valuable time in schemes of municipal reform, it would be far better advised for them to invoke the power of the Holy Ghost to create a healthy sentiment for the extermination of the evils they were complaining of. He would advise the ministers to go out among the people, as did St. Paul, and preach the gospel. Their time would be more profitably spent in leading the youth of the country into right and godly paths. All the ministerial agitation about municipal reform would lead to no results.

He did not believe in agitation, but in personal persuasion. He would say to the young men of this country: "Don't be a partisan and don't wear a white rose in the lapel of your coat, and don't join the A. P. A., but join the church and learn from it wisdom that will impress you and remain with you all your life."

In conclusion, Dr. Clark said: "No minister has a right to use his pulpit for any political movement. He has a right to teach the boys and girls of the community in which he lives the duties of true citizenship."

When Dr. Clark had finished his address, Rev. Dr. John Pearson, President of the Municipal Reform League, arose, and, to the astonishment of all, stated that he was delighted with Dr. Clark's essay. However, said he: "In his community there may not be any youth that are liable to be led away by municipal misrule, nor in any danger from the asloons or the race track, but Covington and Cincinnati are in continual communication with a consolidated system of gambling that is bleeding the families of the poor and sending to death and destruction many a young man of promise."

Dr. A. L. Conger, Dr. A. H. Rust and others arose to side with the essayist. Rev. Dr. Peck, the evangelist, of Denver, Colo., spoke against the present movement of municipal reform. He said the devil was trying to blind the preachers, and that preaching the gospel and attending strictly to ministerial duties would be better agents of municipal reform.

Rev. Dr. Sylvester Weeks, President of the Methodist Ministers' Conference, arose to say: "I am heartily sick and tired of this constant meddling by the ministers with political matters and their attacks upon the mayor. In attending to their business, ministers would find plenty to do. I have read Dr. S. McChesney's open letter, which is an excellent thing, and voices the sentiments of a majority of the Methodist ministers."
