HUNTINGTON, W. Va., a city of some ten thousand inhabitants, is agitated from center to circumference over the question of general Sunday closing, including the suspension of street car traffic. The mayor's orders to the chief of police were:—

You are, therefore, directed to order closed, on each and every Sunday after the first of May, all business houses of every description, including barber shops, public bath rooms, fruit stands, restaurants, all classes of confectionery stores, meat shops, newspaper offices, and soda water and ice cream parlors; to prohibit all labor (excepting cases of charity and absolute necessity), including delivery and sale of newspapers, and delivery of ice, milk and meat; to order closed all drug stores, except for the sole purpose of filling prescriptions duly issued by a licensed physician.

You are admonished to cause the carrying out of the foregoing instructions and all other ordinances, with justice to all and favors to no one.

Street cars are not specially mentioned in this order, but the company is being prosecuted for violation of the ordinance. Several smaller towns in the State are following the lead of Huntington, and the crusade promises to become general.
