[From The Progress, Minneapolis, Minn.]

GOVERNOR TURNEY, of Tennessee, has recently pardoned eight Seventh-day Adventists who were not long since imprisoned for doing work on Sunday, at Dayton, Rhea County, Tenn. In passing sentence, the judge admitted the force of the arguments for the defense, the injustice of the law, and the malice of the prosecution. The act of the governor in exercising the pardoning power in this case is upheld by the best sense of the commonwealth of Tennessee and will be approved by the lovers of justice and liberty everywhere.

The Adventists are peaceable and industrious people, and their persecution in Tennessee is due to personal spite on the part of persons who took advantage of an old law that is a disgrace to the statute books of that State. The Adventists make the Bible their rule of conduct and observe the seventh day of the week as a day of rest, according to the fourth commandment as they say, and allege that they cannot conscientiously do otherwise. They accordingly rest on Saturday, and work on other days of the week.

Three of the imprisoned men were convicted for digging a well on Sunday; one for cutting wood, one for pulling fodder and one for putting wire netting around a vegetable bed. Their terms of imprisonment ranged from twenty to seventy-six days. Judge J. G. Parks who presided, said: "If there were only one of them he would be entitled not only to his honest belief, but to the exercise of that belief, so long as in so doing he did not interfere with some natural right of his neighbors."

The Adventists have nowhere been charged with interfering with the rights of other persons. For ten years past they have been persecuted in Tennessee, and similar action has been taken against them in Arkansas, in Georgia, in Maryland and in Massachusetts. Fifty-three have been convicted and thirty have suffered imprisonment. The complainants allege that they are shocked or disturbed by the knowledge merely that Sunday work was being done. One person was "shocked" at seeing Sunday hoeing while he himself was driving a cow home from a neighbor's.

The observance of the first day of the week instead of the seventh as a day of rest was a change made by the Christian church since the death of Christ, and was purely a church regulation. The observance of either rests with the conscience of each individual, and the laws of a free country are supposed to protect every individual in the free exercise of his own conscience, provided he does not interfere with the rights of others.

The question arises: Is the United States of America a free country? Are men to be deprived of freedom of conscience who interfere with no other's rights? Press and public are pointing and should continue to point the finger of scorn at the States which retain laws which make religious persecution possible. The afflictions which are being endured by the Adventists will doubtless accomplish beneficent reform, for the best way, sometimes, to get rid of a bad law is to enforce it. Persecution for conscience' sake will not long be tolerated in America.
