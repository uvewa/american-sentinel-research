## OCR Corrections Made

### Page 1, Masthead
- **Original OCR:** "ALONZO T. JOSEN"
- **Corrected to:** "ALONZO T. JONES"
- **Reason:** Obvious OCR error; Jones is the known editor

- **Transcribed as:** "B. Fay Mills"
- **Note:** This appears to be correct; B. Fay Mills was a known evangelist of the period

### Page 5
- **Original OCR:** "veison d'etre"
- **Corrected to:** "raison d'etre"
