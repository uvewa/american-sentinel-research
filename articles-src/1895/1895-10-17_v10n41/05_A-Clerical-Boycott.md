# A CLERICAL BOYCOTT.

At a recent meeting of the Ministers' Union of Hoboken, N. J., the following was adopted:—

WHEREAS, Many of the trades-people of our city openly and flagrantly violate the Sunday laws by continuing their worldly and secular business on Sunday; and

WHEREAS, Many trades-people, who now respect the law and close their places of business on Sunday, are unfairly treated by and lose much of their trade to the law-breaking trades-people; and

WHEREAS, Many Sunday trades-people who are robbed of their Sundays, want one day's rest in seven, and are willing to stop business on this day if other trades-people do; and

WHEREAS, The said violations of law are detrimental both to the moral and financial welfare of our city; and

WHEREAS, The church people are charged with being largely responsible for the present desecrated Sunday by their apparent indifference and by patronizing law-breakers.

Therefore, We, the undersigned, disapproving of all such lawlessness, do solemnly promise to refrain from purchasing goods on Sunday (except in cases of "necessity and mercy"), and that, as far as possible, we will patronize the trades people who respect the law and close their places of business on Sunday.

These Sunday boycotts are very suggestive of Rev. 13:17: "No man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name."
