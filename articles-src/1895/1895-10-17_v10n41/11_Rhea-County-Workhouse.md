# RHEA COUNTY WORKHOUSE.

[Dayton (Tenn.) Leader, Oct. 4.]

AFTER the Seventh-day Adventists were convicted of violating the Sunday laws, a workhouse craze struck the county. What the county needed, and needed badly, was a workhouse with its gandy trimmings in the shape of a commission of five, superintendent, guards, etc., and the scheme went through the county court like a greased coon through a melon patch. Well, the workhouse plan went into operation in July, and here is the expense melody to which the taxpayers must dance:

|  July expenses | $482.23  |
| --- | --- |
|  August | $56.82  |
|  September | 181.03  |
|  Total for three months | $920.08  |

So the little experiment cost Rhea County $920.08, and if any commensurate public benefit has been derived from the outlay, it would require a committee of experts to discover it.

The prisoners have all been released, except two females, and these have been turned over to the jailer again.
