# PURITANIC ENFORCEMENT.

[Daily Standard, Leavenworth, Kansas.]

ABOUT the meanest thing yet heard of in connection with the puritanic enforcement of Sunday laws now epidemic in the United States, is the case of a poor old crippled Adventist shoemaker in Baltimore named Faust. A week ago last Sunday a policeman came smelling around his residence, and listening at the keyhole, heard him at work. Finding the front door locked, he tiptoed around to the back door, slipped in and arrested him and dragged him off to jail. Give puritanism the full power it is seeking and it will blot out human liberty in less than no time. It is the only danger which threatens the liberties of the American people.
