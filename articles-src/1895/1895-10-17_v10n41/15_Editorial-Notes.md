# EDITORIAL NOTES.

ANY ONE receiving the AMERICAN SENTINEL without having ordered it may know that it is sent to him by some friend. Therefore, those who have not ordered the SENTINEL need have no fears that they will be asked to pay for it.

We are reminded by correspondents that we have omitted from our "Roll of Honor," the Congregationalist (Boston), the Chicago daily Chronicle, the Leavenworth (Kans.) Daily Standard, and the Daily Champion, of Atchison, Kans.

We are pleased to learn that Mr. John Matthews has been released from Chatham (Ontario) jail, where he had been confined for refusing to honor Sunday, as demanded by "the law" of the country. The Department of Justice at Ottawa had been memorialized to inquire into Mr. Matthews' case, and had sent to Chatham for a careful statement of the facts, at the time of the latter's release.

THE article on page 326 from the Eagle, of Gainesville, Ga., is noteworthy because it shows so plainly the hypocrisy of the plea that "the law must be enforced." The "law" has not been enforced in Atlanta against those who worked upon the exposition grounds on Sunday, nor is it enforced in that city at any time against the Sunday excursions and other forms of so-called "sabbath desecration." The Sunday "law" is openly and persistently violated by the railroads every week in the very county in which Mr. Allison was sentenced to serve twelve full months in the chain-gang, and it does not even occasion remark; but the poor Adventist must forfeit the pound of flesh. "The court awards it and 'law' doth give it."

We print on another page an article on "Religion in the Normal Schools," which contains some facts and suggestions worthy of serious consideration.

We are in harmony with the suggestion made in the closing paragraph, that it is only a "matter of simple justice to all denominations, and to those outside of all denominations, that all religious bias should be removed from" all schools under State control or supported wholly or in part by State funds.

We do not take this view, however, simply because of the impossibility of doing equal and exact justice to all concerned in the matter of giving religious instruction, but because in the very nature of the case the State is not qualified to give that kind of instruction. A teacher to properly give such instruction must have not only a religious but a spiritual qualification: and certainly it would be improper for the State to determine who possesses the necessary qualification for giving instruction in matters of religion. It would likewise be manifestly improper for the State to allow the various churches to certify to the qualifications of teachers in that respect; therefore, the only thing for the State to do is to omit religious instruction from its curriculum.

Nor do we believe that the morals of the people would suffer in the least from this omission. Religious instruction properly belongs to the home, the church, and the parochial school. In all these places such instruction can be properly given, and by persons properly qualified to give it. But outside of these agencies any attempted religious instruction is almost certain to be merely perfunctory and calculated only to displace and to cause to be neglected that home training which would otherwise be given.

Germany affords a striking example of what religious instruction in the public schools will do for a people who depend largely upon it. Nowhere, not even excepting in "infidel France," is unbelief so general as in Germany, and formalism in religion so widespread. We believe it would be many times better, both for the schools and the public, if all State schools were purely secular.
