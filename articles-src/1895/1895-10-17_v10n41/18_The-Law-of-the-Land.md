# THE LAW OF THE LAND.

IN the New York Christian Advocate, of Sept. 19, the editor says:—

When we were in Vienna it caused a great effort to find the little Wesleyan place of worship. The law would not allow it a shape like a church building; it could not have a name; it existed by sufferance. Subsequently it was shut up and had a long conflict with the government. Finally certain rights were given to it, and a church was erected, and one Sunday last month, for the first time in Vienna, Protestant church bells rung out, a set of bells having been presented to this Protestant church.

No American Protestant will question the propriety of this little church's "long conflict with the government" in its struggle to occupy the place of a light-bearer to the multitudes that sat in darkness around it. No such person will claim that the "law" which "would not allow it a shape like a church building" or even a name, was not wholly unjust and unworthy of recognition. Yet it was "the law of the land;" and if "the law of the land" ought always to be enforced, simply because it is the "law," the Roman Catholic authorities of Vienna were in the right in trying to extinguish the kindling flame of Protestant public worship.
