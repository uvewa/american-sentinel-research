# THE WORKINGMEN AND SUNDAY.

THERE is a large amount of humbug in the talk about the workingmen becoming slaves to Sunday labor. The workingmen can rest on Sunday if they want to. It is not they who are doing the talking about the prospect of such slavery, or who feel any fear of it. It is not an over-amount of labor that they fear, but a scarcity of it, with low wages.
