# PERSECUTION IN TEXAS.

THE following appeared in the Texas Post (Galveston), of October 6:—

Farmer A. T. Romer, in San Antonio, Tex., was brought before Justice of the Peace Devine, and accused of refusing to work on the high road on a certain day as ordered by the roadmaster. Romer belongs to the religious sect of the Adventists, and said that this certain day was the Sabbath, which is the day of rest according to the rules of his church. He claimed the right to discharge his religious duty, a right which is guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States.

Notwithstanding he was fined $1 and costs, which amount to $20 in this case. Romer, who persists in his right, has appealed to the higher courts.

It seems rather strange that in a State which has so much morality that it calls an extra session of the legislature to prevent a prize-fight, a good citizen cannot be allowed to abstain from labor on the day set apart by his religion for rest and worship.
