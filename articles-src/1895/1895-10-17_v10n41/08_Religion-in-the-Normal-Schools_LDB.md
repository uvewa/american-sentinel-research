# RELIGION IN THE NORMAL SCHOOLS.

BY L. D. BURDICK.

The normal schools and teachers' institutes are now an important part of the school system of the State of New York. The power of the normal schools has been greatly increased by recent changes in methods of passing on the qualifications of teachers. More and more the common schools are dependent on them for their teachers. It is important therefore to know their attitude on religious questions.

There are eleven normal schools in the State. The total number of pupils in them, according to the annual report of 1894, was 7,625. Of these, 3,600 were in the normal classes. The total cost to the State was $326,912.64. The expense of teachers' institutes for the same year was $28,143.44. The number of school districts was 11,161, and during some part of the year 32,476 different teachers were employed.

Some time ago the writer submitted to the principals of the normal schools these questions: What religious services are held in your school? Is attendance compulsory? What are the denominational connections of those who usually conduct them? Do Roman Catholics, Jews, or Unitarians ever participate in conducting them? Replies were received from all of them, from which the following facts are gleaned:—

One writes: "No religious exercises of any kind are held in this school unless the occasional singing of a hymn may be called such." This is the smallest of the eleven schools, having only 291 pupils, of whom 145 are in the normal department. In all the others daily religious services are held, consisting of hymns, prayer, and Bible reading. In seven schools attendance is compulsory, in three voluntary. The number of pupils in the schools where attendance is compulsory is 5,217; in those where it is voluntary it is 2,117. In two the services are conducted by the principals, one of them an Episcopalian, the denomination of the other not given. In four schools the services are conducted by the male members of the faculty. The denominational connections of those conducting services, so far as named, are Presbyterian, Methodist, Universalist, Baptist, Congregationalist, Episcopal, Dutch Reformed, and (in one case) Unitarian. One reports that Catholics have sometimes taken part in religious services at commencement; another, that they have been invited but usually declined to do so. One reports that a Catholic sometimes has charge of religious exercises in the primary department, and another that a Catholic, during the absence of the principal of the intermediate department, conducts reading service from the Protestant Bible. In the latter case the principal adds, "The Catholic priest of this village has recently made an effort to have the reading of the Bible and the sacred music dropped from the exercises, but has failed to accomplish his desired end."

The total number of communicants in the State in the denominations above-mentioned, as participating in religious exercises in the normal schools, exclusive of Catholics, is 814,973. The total number of Catholic communicants in the State is 1,153,130. The total population of the State, by the census of 1890, from which the other statistics are taken, is 5,997,863.

From this brief statement of facts and statistics, does not the conclusion seem warranted that religious denominations whose membership constitutes only a comparatively small part of the entire population of the State virtually direct the religious instruction in the normal schools? How far the standing of those being prepared for teachers in these schools may be affected by their attendance or non-attendance in these services is not known. If it is affected at all is it not making "preference and discrimination" on account of religion which is forbidden in the constitution and has been from colonial days?

Through the teachers that go out from the normal schools the whole public school system of the State must be largely influenced by the religious training in them. Is it not therefore a matter of simple justice to all denominations and to those outside of all denominations, that all religious bias should be removed from them? And this can be accomplished in no other way than by taking all religious services out of them.
