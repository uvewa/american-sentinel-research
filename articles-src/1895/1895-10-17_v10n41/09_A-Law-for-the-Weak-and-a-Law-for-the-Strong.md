# A LAW FOR THE WEAK AND A LAW FOR THE STRONG.

*[Gainesville (Ga.) Eagle, Oct. 3.]*

Last spring, J. Q. Allison, of Douglas County, a Seventh-day Adventist, was arrested, carried to court, and fined for sabbath-breaking, the fine and costs, amounting to $22.05. Mr. Allison's offense consisted in plowing in his field, away from the road, where he disturbed nobody, except those who went out of their way to look at him on purpose to get disturbed. Mr. Allison, according to the teachings of his religion and the dictates of his conscience, had rested on the day before. He refused to pay his fine, and the judge ordered him to the chain-gang. The *Atlanta Constitution*, in commenting on this affair, said:—

As the law now stands, we must punish these people when they violate our Sunday statutes. The Jews have never given us any trouble in this matter, and the "Seventh-day Adventists" should follow their example for the sake of peace and order. Our lawmakers have no desire to persecute these honest and good citizens, but even when law-breakers plead that they are conscientiously obeying the divine command we must draw the line somewhere. We draw it in the case of the Mormons, and we must draw it on this Sunday question.

Oh, yes, we must draw the line. We must draw it on the Jews and the Adventists, but—

There we must stop. The Jews and the Adventists are in the minority. They are weak and powerless—therefore we must draw the line on them. It is a matter of religion with them, a matter of conscience; but they are weak, and are splendid subjects with which to illustrate the majesty of the law.

"We have a law, and by our law he ought to die."

But when it comes to drawing the line on the Atlanta exposition—which is being run by rich men, powerful and influential—the line does not seem to draw. It is a notorious fact that for the past month a full force of workmen have been at work each Sunday from sun-up to sun-down, right in the sound of the bells of the churches, where hundreds of perfunctory worshipers go to hear sleek and salaried persons expound the law and the gospel.

And has one word been raised by one of these persons against this unholy desecration of the Christian sabbath? Not one word. The men who are responsible for this desecration are members of these churches—good paying members, and it won't do to affront them. Even Dr. Hawthorne, that belligerent theological blunderbuss, who wrinkles his placid front and shakes his ambrosial locks and paws up the earth at sight of a bloomer on a bicycle—even he has remained as silent as the grave when his wealthy parishioners laid their leprous hands on the sacred day of rest.

There was no work of necessity or mercy in this business. There was no element of religion or conscience in it. It was sabbath-breaking for revenue only. The motive that prompted and impelled was purely mercenary. It was for Atlanta. It was to enable that city to feather its nest, and that its grand consolidated aggregation of gougers might work successfully their multitudinous home industries in the shape of skin games to fleece the visitors out of their dimes and quarters and dollars.

Being for Atlanta and a work for her advancement, and no matter of conscience about it, it was all right, and the law will wink with one eye and the church will wink with the other.

It won't do to break the law as a matter of conscience. There must be the element of gain in it to escape the majesty of the law.

Theoretically, the laws were made for all alike, but the rich sometimes have the bulge on the poor.
