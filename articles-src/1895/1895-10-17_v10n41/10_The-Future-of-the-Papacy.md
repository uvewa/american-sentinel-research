# THE FUTURE OF THE PAPACY.

*[Sunday News-Tribune, Detroit, Sept. 15.]*

The papacy and its prospects for the future, immediate and remote, have recently been the subject of much thought and discussion among both the writers and statesmen in the highest circles of the Old World. That, in spite of its loss of temporal power, it still clings to Rome and never by a word compromises its hope of recovering its ancient position as a temporal sovereignty, is a constant embarrassment to Italy and a puzzle to not only the statesmen of that kingdom but to those of all Europe. Its spiritual power and prestige have grown enormously since Rome was made the capital of Italy and the pope was confined to the narrow limits of the Vatican gardens. Its influence upon the politics of every country in Europe has become more marked, and there is scarcely one of them which can formulate a policy without reckoning with the position of its Catholic subjects whose action in public affairs was never before so completely controlled by the head of their church.

The universal Church has bowed submissively to the stupendous claims of the Vatican Council, and there is not a breath of schism or heresy anywhere on earth within the ranks of its followers. As a prisoner, which he is pleased to call himself, the pope has more real power than he had formerly as a king.

It might be possible to explain this growth by the changed conditions of the world which, in our time, have enabled all human activities to centralize and consolidate power, and to trace much of the facility with which the Roman Church has done it to that very loss of temporal power, which she regards as a misfortune, but which has freed the Roman see from the natural jealousy which other Catholic communities naturally felt toward her when her bishop was a king. It might not be unreasonable to hope, too, that the new condition would eventually be accepted by the papal court and become permanent. But the persistence of the papacy in clinging to and constantly asserting its claims alarms statesmen, and excites fears that, in the future wars of Europe, the history of the last quarter of a century might be reversed.

This is the view which a recent writer in the Fortnightly Review, Capt. J. W. Gambier, of the British navy, takes of the situation. He predicts that in the coming struggle between the destructive agencies of European society—anarchism, socialism, nihilism, etc.—the great powers will be compelled to call the papacy into alliance with them as the only conservative force which is equally strong among all their populations and which can strengthen their hands by securing for them the faithful support of the Catholic masses.
