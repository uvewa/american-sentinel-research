# PREACHER AND PLUTOCRAT: OR THE CORRUPTION OF THE CHURCH THROUGH WEALTH.*

BY REV. WALTER ALLEN EVANS.

There never was an age since time began which needed so much to be frightened out of its false security and shaken from its covenants with death, as this Laodicean, facing both ways, neither one-thing nor the other age of ours. It is an age which really fears man and only pretends to fear God.—Canon Farrar.

EVANGELICAL Christianity, born anew in the German Reformation, baptized under the hands of the Puritans and the Wesleyans, has already so far apostatized that another reformation is needed to fit the Church for the work of the greater century soon to dawn. The cold formalism of a utilitarian religiousness, ornate with pomp and ceremony, makes of the Church of the present day, to a very large degree, a valley of dry bones greater than that which Ezekiel saw, and as sorely in need of a divine afflatus to give it life. Social discontent, born of pinching poverty on the one hand and riotous riches on the other, gambling, intemperance, commercial dishonor, political corruption, and the whole pestiferous brood of evils which prey upon the nation and threaten its peace if not its perpetuity as a free Republic—they all find their coveted opportunity, when they do not find their abetment, in the worldly ideals, the grasping covetousness, the denominational pride, the sectarian selfishness, the moral cowardice, and the spiritual apathy of the Church.

Much is made, upon occasion, by those who would condone or gloss over the sins of the Church, of the great increase in the number of communicants in the churches during the present century—greater relatively than the increase in population. But here nothing is more misleading than numbers. "The kingdom of heaven cometh not with observation," and Heaven help the Church when she rates her conquests by count of heads! "When I am weak, then am I strong," was the profound remark of the great apostle concerning himself. So is it with the Church. The only power in the Church that is worthy the name is spiritual power—the power that comes of being right and doing right.

The Church of the apostles and martyrs, few in numbers, unorganized, poor, despised, and persecuted, because it was pure was invincible. But the Church of victorious Constantine, the church of royal patronage, intoxicated with worldly success, lulled in the lap of luxury, first slept in security, and then (all but) died in iniquity. So is it ever! Shall history repeat itself? We hope not, we pray not. But no careful observer of men and events as reflected in the secular and religious press can fail to see that the relative power of the Church over the masses for public and personal righteousness in this nation, has most signally and sadly failed to keep pace with the increase in the number of communicants in the churches. While this much-quoted increase of communicants has been going on, crime has also gone on increasing faster than the increase of population. During this time also that question of interminable discussion before ministerial bodies, "The Church and the Masses," has come painfully and persistently into view. Besides, what does it signify that Sabbath desecration—no sign more symptomatic—has been going from bad to worse, as witnessed, among many other signs, by the organization throughout the country of Sabbath Leagues, for the preservation of what remains of that rich heritage from the Pilgrim fathers, the Christian sabbath? What means this dying out of hundreds of country churches on the one hand, so that many districts once the radiating centers of Christianizing influences have become fields for missionary operations; and, on the other, the notorious corruption of our American cities and their equally notorious paucity of church-goers,—the cities whither the country people have gone? What means this "secularization of life" against which the religious press so vehemently inveighs—a thing apparent everywhere? Why is it that there are so many lodges to every church, and that so large a part of the humanitarian and reformatory forces that make for human weal in the present life, are centering outside the Church? Why is it that, as every minister of the gospel knows is the case, so large and increasing a body of noble, honorable, and high-minded men of every community, men who fear God and revere Jesus Christ, are standing studiously aloof from the Church?

There has indeed been an increase of numbers in the Church, but relatively a decline in moral influence and spiritual power. The Church has waxed, religion has waned; "Christians" have multiplied, but the significance of the term has become indefinitely vague; quantity has been attained, but quality lost. The result is, as it always must be, quantity too is now in danger of being lost. Where is the gain in an increased body of church members, if by "church member" nothing in particular is meant as to fervent piety and unmarketable righteousness? If membership in the Church stood for one half what in churchly circles it is assumed to stand for, the fourteen million members, more or less, of the evangelical churches would revolutionize society and write the first chapter of a national millennium before the curtain should ring down on the nineteenth century. It would seem as though the Church had better take these signs of the times and others similar seriously to heart, betake herself to fasting and prayer, boast less of numbers, and attend to the work of reformation. For to the thoughtful observer, gifted with a fair modicum of moral discernment, it is evident that "There is something rotten in the State of Denmark."

But some one will exclaim: "Our organizations! Look at our new organizations, millions strong!" To which one might fittingly reply in the words of that very wise and spiritual seer, B. Fay Mills, "They are very deceiving."* Or one might, by way of amplification, say that multiplication of organizations within the Church, wisely constructed to fit the social instincts of youthful human nature, colossal conventions worked up systematically after the most approved methods of a political canvass for twelve months previous—they may cause a great buzzing of wheels and rattle of machinery that looks very like spiritual vigor. But all this machinery, while it can use power, cannot generate it. It can neither repair a defective boiler nor replenish a furnace the real trouble with which is that the fire is going out. The adding of another wheel to the machinery does not increase the power. Nay, is not this unprecedented multiplication of organizations itself a striking sign of weakness and spiritual degeneration? May it not be, after all, an attempt to brace a man on his feet by artificial means, when the fact is he is suffering from heart failure? What is the matter with the old bottle that it won't hold wine? The Church of the apostles, the Puritans, and the early Methodists turned the world upside down—not by organization, for they had practically none; but by the irresistible power of deep moral conviction, unquestioning faith, and a spiritual unction that was the outcropping of a new and divine life. But to-day, instead of one chasing a thousand and two putting ten thousand to flight, it takes a thousand church members to chase one evil, and then they don't catch it—unless "there is something in it." What, then, is the matter? Whittier, an optimist, who always wrote with his face to the sunlight, hinted at the fundamental trouble with the Church of the present day when he wrote these words (italics ours):

But the living faith of the settlers old
A dead profession the children hold.
To the lust of office, the greed of trade,
A stepping stone is the altar made.
The church to place, and power the door,
Rebukes the sin of the world no more,
Nor sees her Lord in the homeless poor.

The trouble is, a "profession of religion," in too many instances, is a profession, and made to be a very lucrative one! The Church, having become numerous and eminently respectable through the self-denying lives of the humbly and truly pious, the name "Christian" has become a mighty one to conjure with! Religious professions have therefore become a commodity of trade. Membership in the church is used as floating capital and available assets. The Church is made the decoy of the hunters of fortunes; it is utilized as a screen of scoundrels, and, like charity, is made to "cover a multitude of sins;" yea, it has become a great tree, and respectable sinners—respectability is a sine qua non—legal robbers, and pious frauds lodge under the shadow of it! It would be no exaggeration to say that though the great mass of people who compose the evangelical church are sincere in their purpose to lead a Christian life, as they understand it, many of the most cunning knaves, the sleekest rascals, the most adept practitioners of "man's inhumanity to man," also belong to it, help to officer it, and use it as a cloak for their crooked ways. Such are they who bull or bear the market on boards of trade six days in the week and then go to church and look pious (or try to) on the seventh; who in order to get superfluous wealth corner the necessities of life by which millions are filched—legally of course—from God's nobility, the common people; who wreck railway systems for private greed or personal spite; who crush thousands to financial death beneath the wheels of monster monopolies, or who use the same unprincipled methods on a smaller scale—but as large a scale as they can handle; who by evasion and bribery dodge the tax-gatherer that the poor man out of his penury may support the government under the protection of which they live to get and to grab,—and then, to hoodwink the people, throw a soothing sop to a guilty conscience, and keep up a respectable exterior, as well as to "stand in" with the Church and clergy (a paying investment), they father some church enterprise, endow a college, "rent the best pews," or become "liberal givers" to the Church. What words so fitting as the words of Jesus himself, first used to describe the Pharisees of his own day, who also were eminently respectable and religious without being righteous? "They bind upon men burdens grievous to be borne, but they themselves will not touch one of them with one of their fingers; which devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayers."

God forbid that for one moment one should fail to discriminate between such a race of Barabbas and those noble souls, who in a life of commercial honor, characterized by justice first and liberality afterward, honor the Christian profession, and bless their fellowmen. There are many such. They are the Atlases upon whose faithful shoulders rest the precious interests of the Christian world. But these others are the dead weights on the Church to-day. From them as from a slimy cesspool, right at the altars of the church rises a deadly miasma that is poisoning the faith of the masses in God and right and their fellowmen.

And what is the Church doing to rid herself of those weights and to cleanse that cesspool? Little or nothing! On the contrary, the Church puts the stamp of her tacit approval on such religious acrobatics and calls it Christianity. She too often shares in the profits of the sinner and then demands that the pulpit keep mum about the sin. To build an extravagant "house of worship" and raise its debt, she mortgages if she does not muzzle the pulpit, by putting herself in bondage to ungodly men of wealth; and then she prays for the descent of the Holy Spirit—and prays in vain! She frequently, if not usually, takes these very men, whose piety is respected among those to whom they are not known, and by coddling and wheedling them and putting them in office, plays into their hands the tremendous power of her ecclesiastical machinery, so as to install them as general managers and dictators, where without let or hindrance they can "lord it over God's heritage,"—all because they have money, few, if any, embarrassing questions being asked as to how or where they got it. Thus the very ecclesiastical functionaries that were created to conserve the purity of the Church are turned over to those who use them with exactly the opposite effect,—it may chance to be a council, a conference, a presbytery, or something else. Does anyone ask how they do this? By using the Church to further their own personal interests, financial, political, or other, by dictating to the local church a miserable worldly policy which, while it may cause it to flourish for awhile, socially and financially, really signs its spiritual death-warrant; and further (not the least evil either) by so rewarding their faithful henchmen in the pulpit with financial remuneration and ecclesiastical honor, as well as discriminating against such as will not pander to their unchristian schemes, as to put a large premium in the ministry upon the trimmer and time-server, who, putting policy above principle, may always be found intent above all things upon finding the spot of greatest personal prudence between tweedledum and tweedledee. One cannot single out any one denomination as being especially guilty of exalting self above piety. The same conditions widely prevail, and one is probably as bad as another, if not worse!

So the same power, money power, that within a generation has changed the financial features of the nation, wiping out the small manufacturer and trader, making the masses more and more the helots of the classes, and creating a second feudal system worse than the first—this force has its hands also on the evangelical church, and seems determined to make the one institution which for nearly four hundred years has, as a rule, stood for justice and righteousness among men, and so as the break-water of our civilization, the protecting shield for its crimes, if not an attaché of its operations. Shall it succeed? We hope not; but Jesus said, "How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of heaven!" and the Church is saying, by actions which speak louder than words, "How easily shall they that have riches enter into and rule the Church;" by which we are bound to conclude that the fittest for membership in the Church are the least fit for the kingdom of heaven.

Thus the Church, in her dominating element and general trend, instead of utilizing her enormous power to rear a mighty bulwark against this devilish greed for money which is foreordaining millions to "damnation" by force of industrial circumstances, is powerfully assisting to make that vicious public sentiment in regard to the relative value of righteousness and riches which seems hurrying the nation toward a civic Niagara.

How long will the people's faith in the Church and what it should stand for endure the strain? How long will the accrued merit of generations of evangelical piety endure this prostitution of things spiritual to the end of denominational glory, sectarian ambition, personal aggrandizement, and the greed of gain? Society is held together at present by the constraining force of virtues which former generations practiced; but the rich patrimony of Puritan ancestry cannot last forever. When the religion of a people is corrupted, the stream of the civilization is poisoned at its fountain head; and the result of turning the ruling power of the Church over to those whose recognized fitness to exercise it is in proportion to their riches, not their righteousness, is necessarily moth and mildew to all that is vital to the Church as a saving institution among men.

The clergy, selfishly ambitious members of whom are mainly to blame for this state of things, are the first to feel its cruel oppression and its withering blight. So far has degeneration gone that the young minister, with however lofty and Christlike ideals he has set out, soon learns that the favoring nod of the plutocrat is the "open sesame" to "good standing" and promotion in the Church; and that the shrug of the shoulders of the aforesaid plutocrat, his very praise (whispered in secure secrecy), judiciously faint, will apply to him, through the denominational machinery, the ecclesiastical gag and boycott by which, in the smooth usage of the modern inquisitor, God's prophets of righteousness are reduced to silence, or put where their voices will not be heard rebuking sin in high places. Ministers of aggressive zeal and evangelical fervor, who fear God and hate wrong, are thus finding in that very ecclesiastical power that was created to protect them in doing their Master's work, a drawn sword to cut them down. Thus is the Church as a worldly institution "arrayed in deadly strife against the Church as a saving force!"

Of course where, as is sometimes the case, wealth and piety go together, the result is most excellent. But the plutocracy of the local church may, and it frequently does, represent the very worst element in it, as judged by every high moral and spiritual standard; it may be well known to "the world's people" as abominably corrupt. In count of heads it may number but one or two in a hundred. No matter! The minister of the gospel who values supremely the approval of God, and honestly preaches in fact what the Church stands for in theory—justice, mercy, and truth; however much his ministry may have been honored of God in the building up of the Church; though the people, in the Church and out of it, may love him and approve of his work,—that man is marked for ecclesiastical slaughter. The plutocrat in power, whose sins are sure to be rebuked where the gospel is preached in its fullness, will, by the most diabolical machinations (directed in secret if that will succeed, openly if it will not) proceed to make that minister's life a literal foretaste of that place to which ministers of the gospel are not supposed to go. Before long, therefore, he will resign "on account of his wife's health," or some other reason equally convenient; and when he has gone (crucified by Pharisees as his Master was) one will be gotten to take his place, with whom a winked-at understanding is had from the beginning, that he will sing softly to the plutocratic conscience, while a Church that is dying to all that a Christian Church should stand for, accommodatingly rocks the cradle and joins in the chorus, "Hush my dear, lie still and slumber!" There are many exceptions, to be sure, especially in the villages and rural districts. But this is the rule. To relate in detail all the facts illustrative of it that have come to the writer's personal knowledge would require a volume.

Now ministers are but human. They too have stomachs and backs! Put them where they must choose between slow martyrdom and ministerial mugwumpery, and what will result? Martyrs there will be, martyrs there are, who with both eyes open walk into the fire for the sake of being true. They suffer shameful abuse (of course secretly administered), gaunt poverty, sometimes cruel and slanderous misrepresentation by those whose sin they have rebuked, heart-breaking ingratitude, and a persecution that is worse than scourge or pillory. This they do for Christ's faith, to keep a clear conscience and to preserve their self-respect. The blood of these martyrs is still the seed of the Church. But unless church history is a record of lies, and human nature has become something else, the majority will not be martyrs. No man naturally likes to be voted a failure. Therefore make "success" in the ministry synonymous with gathering "a wealthy and fashionable congregation" instead of a congregation of Christians, and need we be surprised if the preaching consults the convenience of the plutocrat rather than the needs of the parish? Need sensible people be disappointed, under these circumstances, if they hear sermons which aim at nobody and nothing—and hit their mark? Is it any wonder if the preacher "gives it" to the Pharisees who crucified Christ, and then, two thousand years ago, died (their one meritorious act), and, somehow, fails to note the Pharisees of the present day (who by many are still believed to have a weakness for "the uppermost seats in the synagogue") who are doing virtually the same thing? When the minister, even the minister of the gospel, knows that if he ignores the unchristian distinctions of caste and class, honestly tries to "reach the masses," puts moral cleanliness and spiritual power above all personal and worldly considerations in the Church (as Christ would do) he is more than likely to pay for the privilege with his ecclesiastical head, at the beck of a plutocracy whose piety would not sell in any market for fifty cents on the dollar; when he knows that his ministerial brethren—some of them—will be among the first to cry, "Crucify him! Crucify him!" that any appeal to the very denominational machinery that was made for saving the Church from evil domination in just such emergencies will result only in more certainly enshrining wealthy worldliness in the Church, and increasing his own personal sufferings,—then is it a cause for open-eyed wonder if the minister falters in the face of such issues, tones down his zeal, loses the martyr spirit, and joins the ranks of the "wise" and "conservative"? Thus are the reins laid on the neck of the downhill steed in the evangelical Church, that is galloping faster and faster along the road of looseness in doctrine and worldliness of life!

And what effect has all this on the Church itself? The evangelical Church is nothing if it is not spirituality. Spirituality is the essence of altruism, the soul of philanthropy, the nourishing nerve of all missionary zeal. It is the source of all that noble endeavor and heroic achievement which has given the masses any confidence in the Church. Without spiritual power, whatever her numbers and organizations, the Church is but "a painted ship upon a painted ocean," freighted with no cargo, bound for no port. But spiritual power is an impossibility in the Church that has set its heart of hearts, not upon God, but upon that worldly equipage and favor which, in order to obtain, it must grovel before wrong clad in rich livery, and kiss the feet of the golden calf. The evil of which we, with much sadness and great reluctance, write, so far as it goes, unchurches the Church! It makes money and what money will buy of worldly pomp and furbishings for gratifying the tastes of the devotees of fashion and the worshippers of mammon, her raison d'etre, instead of the temporal and eternal good of man. . . . The pulpit under such influences degenerates into a kind of lecture bureau and the house of God into a Sunday social club. . . . "Mene, mene, tekel, upharsin" is written on her walls.

Finally, what is the effect of all this upon the people, the masses? Read the answer in the empty pews of the average church; in the meager spiritual returns for the enormous outlay of money and effort; in the widespread skepticism that prevails, especially among men; in the phenomenal success of the Salvation Army, which studiously avoids every semblance to a church; in the hiss that greets the mention of church in representative gatherings of laboring men. . . . The people are not fools! They are not to be caught with chaff! . . . The people are sadly losing faith in the purity, sincerity, and disinterestedness of motive of the Church; and here in the domination of the dollar, is the fundamental reason why. From loss of faith in the Church, it is but a step with most men, to loss of faith in God, in moral government in the world, and then on to all looseness and license. So they go, the great mass of "common people" such as heard Christ gladly, in numbers increasingly large, past the doors of the church to park and pleasure ground, or else stay at home and read the Sunday newspaper. Of course it is very illogical and all wrong; but it is exceedingly human and exactly according to what facts and the trend of events would lead one to expect.

The writer does not wish to be misunderstood. He is neither a skeptic nor a cynic. He is an orthodox clergyman who loves the Church, and writes from a heart which is sad at a contemplation of these things. He bemoans the evils herein set forth; he longs to see the Church awake to her danger, and behold in the coming social battle of the Titans, the greatness of her opportunity. He prays that she may rise and shake off the grave clothes of mammonism, come into harmony with the Christianity of Christ, bring forth fruit meet for repentance, and be rejuvenated by the cleansing fires of a new pentecost!

To force a man to rest one day in the week, with the idea of benefiting him, is like trying to make an individual thrive on food that he does not relish.
