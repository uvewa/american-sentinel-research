# THE SALOON AND SUNDAY.

Is the open saloon any more a "ruthless invasion" of Sunday rest than a ruthless invasion of the peace and happiness of the home circle, of the tranquility of the State, and of the flower of American youth and manhood? Then why all this furore to close the saloons on Sunday only? Is it "in the interests of morality and labor" that, for the sake of giving legal support to a Church institution, the saloon should be given free course to invade every American home and snatch from it the pride of parents and the support of dependent children? The legal closing on Sunday only, means legal sanction on all other days.
