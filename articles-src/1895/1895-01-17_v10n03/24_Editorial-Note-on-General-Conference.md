THE thirty-first session of the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists will convene at Battle Creek, Mich., Feb. 15, and continue until March 4. The regular session will be preceded by an institute for Bible study, beginning Feb. 1, and closing Feb. 14.

A Bulletin will be issued tri-weekly during the institute and daily during the conference. The Bulletin issued during the last conference reached a circulation of 6,000, and was a triumph in modern religious journalism. The committee promises even better work during this session. The Bulletin will not only contain the business proceedings of the conference, but the best thoughts on religious themes presented in addresses, which in some cases will be stenographically reported and published in full. The price of the Bulletin is 50c. All orders should be sent to the International Tract Society, Battle Creek, Mich.
