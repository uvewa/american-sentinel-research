THE Catholic Times boasts that in Roman Catholic Belgium, "Sunday merchandise trains have been suppressed, and more than half of the Sunday postal deliveries have been abolished." Rome is not slow to honor her own. As a "Christian institution," Sunday belongs solely to Rome and it is not strange that she exalts it.
