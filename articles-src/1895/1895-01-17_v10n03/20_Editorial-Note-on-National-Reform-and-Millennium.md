REV. R. C. WYLIE, of the National Reform Association, writing to the Christian Statesman of Dec. 1, says:—

All who are in favor of the millennium should favor this [the so-called Christian] amendment.

We want to make it as easy to be a consistent Christian in the service of this Government as it is to be a consistent free-thinker. We want the public obstacles to consistent Christian living taken away.

That is, Mr. Wylie wants the power of the Government used to remove the cross from the Christian life. He wants a premium placed upon a profession of Christianity, which is only another way of saying that National Reform proposes to place a premium on hypocrisy.
