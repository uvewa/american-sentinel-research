Of the recent appearance of a Catholic priest before the students of the Union Theological Seminary, the Catholic Times says:—

Father Doyle, a Paulist, lectured before the students of the Union Theological Seminary (Presbyterian), and was introduced by Dr. Charles Briggs. This is a good sign. With Father Elliott talking to Protestant laymen and Father Doyle to clerics, a special missionary career opens to the congregation which was instituted for the conversion of the United States. There is a deep good sense in the saying about Mohammed's going to the mountain when the mountain would not come to him. We wish the Paulists boundless success in their efforts.

Of course the Times wishes the Paulists boundless success, and they are having it too. But what a commentary on modern Protestantism is the fact that the lecture platform of a professedly Protestant theological seminary is occupied by a papist, while in another State crowds of "Protestants" hang upon the honeyed words of a priest. Papists are forbidden to read Protestant books or to hear Protestant preaching, while so-called Protestants fawn upon the representatives of the papal church.
