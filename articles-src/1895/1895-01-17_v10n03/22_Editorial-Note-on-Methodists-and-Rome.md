IF SO-CALLED Protestants do not realize how rapidly they are drifting Romeward, Roman Catholics are not ignorant of the downward trend, and they are rejoicing over it. The Western Watchman thus notes with immense satisfaction the progress Romeward of the Methodist Church: The Methodists are adopting the Anglican communion service, and in one church in Omaha, with the full consent of the local bishop, this service is regularly held instead of the tame little picnic that has been the custom heretofore in Methodist churches. It won't be long before the Methodist dominies will be saying "mass." They are able to do so every whit as much as their Anglican confreres. They have deaconesses; why should they not have priests? There is nothing in the name.

Notice the sneer with which this Roman Catholic paper refers to the Lord's supper as celebrated by Methodists—a "tame little picnic,"—and yet Methodists, disciples of John Wesley, will continue to ape the abominations of the "mother of harlots and abominations of the earth."
