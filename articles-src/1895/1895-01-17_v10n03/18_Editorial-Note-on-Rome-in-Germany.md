THE Pittsburgh (Pa.) Catholic boasts that "it has been much remarked that the highest position in a country like Germany, which is far the greater part Protestant, is in the hands of a follower of Rome." The same thing is true to an alarming extent in this country, especially in the large cities. Rome is dominating the governments of earth and using them in her interests.
