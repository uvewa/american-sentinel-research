THE Western Watchman has this editorial note:—

The Emperor William has asked the pope to establish a feast of praise and prayer for the Fatherland, intimating that if the church leads he will see to it that Lutherans and all others follow. His holiness has assented, and a sort of German Thanksgiving Day will be inserted in the calendar of November. Protestant Germany ruled by the pope! Slightly for the present. An entering wedge.

This shows how Rome is watching and taking advantage of every thing to strengthen her power. How long will it be ere Rome again rules the world by ruling the governments of the world?
