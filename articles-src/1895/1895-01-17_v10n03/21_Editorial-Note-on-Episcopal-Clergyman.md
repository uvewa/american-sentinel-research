AN Episcopal clergyman said recently in Jersey City:—

The danger of this country is not to come from Roman Catholicism, but from infidelity; from a luxurious materialistic and selfish spirit which worships nothing but itself; from a divided and quarreling Christianity, which has more sects than there were gods in pagan times.

This utterance is significant of the times. "Rome never changes;" this is her boast; but she is now lauded to the skies by professed Protestants, "degenerate sons of noble sires," who in the days of the Reformation came out of Rome protesting against the very abominations which their descendants now declare are harmless.
