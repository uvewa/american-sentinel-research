# DECISIONS DECLARING VOID THE SUNDAY STATUTES OF KENTUCKY.

As stated in these columns last week, Judge William L. Jackson, of the Circuit Court, and Judge Charles G. Ritchie, of the County Court, both filed opinions at Louisville, on the 1st inst., declaring void Sections 1,303, 1,321 and 1,322 of the Statutes of Kentucky. The following is the opinion of Judge Jackson in full, as reported in the Louisville papers of the 2nd inst:—

## Judge Jackson's Opinion.

On the 19th day of February, 1895, a warrant issued from the Police Court of Louisville against the defendant, Louis Seelbach, charging him with the offense of keeping open on Sunday a bar-room and place for the sale of spirituous, vinous, and malt liquors, and alleging that he did sell spirituous, vinous and malt liquors on Sunday. On March 9, 1895, a demurrer to said warrant was overruled by said Police Court, and the defendant was fined $20, and from the judgment assessing said fine he has prosecuted an appeal to this court, and the case coming on for trial de novo here, the defendant has again interposed a demurrer to the warrant.

This, a test case, and numerous cases await its decision. The warrant is drawn under Section 1,303, of the Kentucky Statutes, which section is as follows:—

Any person who shall on Sunday keep open a bar-room or other place for the sale of spirituous, vinous, or malt liquors, or any of them, on Sunday, shall be fined not less than $10 nor more than $50 for each offense.

As very many of the cases pending in the Police Court arise under Section 1,321, of the Kentucky Statutes, by agreement that section has also been fully argued and briefed, and it is to be considered as if case were pending under it.

## Section 1,321 reads as follows:—

No work or business shall be done on the Sabbath day except the ordinary household offices or other work of necessity or charity, and work required in the maintenance or operation of a ferry, skiff or steamboat, or steam or street railway. If any person on the Sabbath day shall himself be found at his own or other trade or calling, or shall employ his apprentice or other person in labor or other business, whether the same be for profit or amusement, unless such as is permitted above, he shall be fined not less than $2 nor more than $50 for each offense. Every person or apprentice so employed shall be deemed a separate offense. Persons who are members of a religious society who observe as a Sabbath any other day of the week that Sunday shall not be liable to the penalty prescribed in this section if they observe as a Sabbath one day in each seven, as herein provided.

It is contended that these sections especially offend against Section 59 of the new constitution. The material parts of said section are here given:—

"The General Assembly shall not pass local or special acts concerning any of the following subjects, or for any of the following purposes, namely." After enumerating various subjects, that section provides: "29th—In all other cases where a general law can be made applicable, no special law can be enacted."

In discussing Section 1,303 of the Kentucky Statutes, it becomes necessary to settle the question, What is the generic subject of legislation under said section? On the one side it is claimed that the generic subject is Sunday observance: on the other, that it is regulation of the liquor traffic. A brief historical view of said section answers this question. Section 1,303, somewhat enlarged in its scope, it is true, is a reenactment, substantially of the Act of April 13, 1880. That act was an amendment of Section 10, Article 17, of the General Statutes, which was the general law for Sunday observance. From its history and its wording it seems clear to me that the paramount thought and central idea of said section is Sunday observance. Section 1,303, being a law for the observance of Sunday, questions raised upon the two sections now become cognate, and the lines of argument no longer diverge. Whatever may have been the reasoning in former opinions, it is now the accepted and approved doctrine of law writers and modern decisions that "Laws which prohibit ordinary employments on Sunday are to be defended as establishing sanitary regulations based upon the demonstration of experience that one day's rest in seven is needful to recuperate the exhausted energies of body and mind."

This being the beneficent purpose and object of Sunday laws, by reason of the points here raised, the twenty ninth subdivisions of Section 59 of the constitution become material. That provides, "In all other cases where a general law can be made applicable, no special law shall be enacted." Can a general law for the observance of Sunday be made applicable? Is it not apparent that such a law can be made as "broad and general as the casing air?" Section 1,321, stripped of its exceptions, fully solves the problem. If then it is true that a general law for the observance of Sunday as a day of rest can be made applicable, by what law and with what logic can it be contended that if one person keeps open a bar-room or other place for the sale of spirituous, vinous, or malt liquors, or who shall sell or otherwise dispose of such liquors, that he shall be punished more severely than another person who keeps open another place of business, or who sells any other article or commodity? Learned counsel attempt to answer this question by invoking the police power and claiming that under that power a greater punishment can be inflicted upon a party keeping open a bar-room or other place for the sale of spirituous, vinous, and malt liquors, and selling the same, or otherwise disposing of same, than can be inflicted for keeping open any other place or selling any other article or commodity. Would not this be placing the police power higher than the constitution? I now state the settled rule in regard to said power: "It is very broad and comprehensive. Its limit cannot be accurately defined, and the courts have not been willing definitely to circumscribe it, but this power, however broad and extensive, is not above the constitution, which is the supreme law, and so far as it imposes restraints, the police power must be exercised in subordination to it." Again, stated in a very recent opinion, "It is very broad and far-reaching, but is not without its limitations. Legislative acts passed in pursuance of it must not be in conflict with the constitution."

In the face of Subdivision 29 of Section 59 of the constitution, by what law and with what logic can it be claimed that if one person on the Sabbath shall himself be found at his own or any other trade or calling, or shall employ his apprentices or other person in labor or other business, whether the same be for profit or amusement, that he shall be punished, while persons engaged in the maintenance or operation of a ferry, skiff, or steamboat, or steam or street railroad in the limits of this State, or who belong to a religious society who observe as a Sabbath any other day in the week than Sunday, and shall observe as a Sabbath one day in each seven, that they shall go free and unpunished?

In answer to this question it is ingeniously insisted that the exceptions enumerated in Section 1,321 are a legislative declaration of what are works of charity and necessity, and that accused cannot complain of these exceptions. To hold that these exceptions were meant by the legislature as a legislative declaration as to what are works of charity and necessity, would be to hold that the legislative department was invading powers expressly given to the judicial department by Section 27, greatly amplified by Section 28 of the constitution. To deny the accused the right to complain of this section by reason of the exceptions would be to hold that the exceptions were passed for his benefit, and that by them he was not discriminated against, neither of which is true. At first blush it appeared to my mind that if these exceptions did not make Section 1,321 obnoxious to the provisions of the constitution aforesaid, these exceptions should be held void, but I find this position is not tenable. The rule, as stated by Mr. Cooley, is as follows:—

"But if its purpose, that is, the purpose of the law, is to accomplish a single object only, and some of its provisions are void, the whole must fall unless sufficient remains to effect the object without the aid of the invalid portion, and if they are so mutually connected with and dependent on each other as conditions, considerations or compensations for each other as to warrant the belief that the legislature intended them as a whole, and if all could not be carried into effect, the legislature would not pass the residue independently, then if some of the parts are unconstitutional, all the provisions which are thus dependent, conditional or connected, must fall with them."

There is but one other question which I find it necessary to pass upon, and that is that if Section 1,302 and Section 1,321 are invalid, then Section 1,304 which reads, "Any person who shall, without license so to do, sell or otherwise dispose of any spirituous, vinous, or malt liquors, shall for each offense be fined not less than $20, nor more than $100," applies to this case, because defendant's license, if he had any, did not give defendant the right to keep open his bar-room on Sunday, or to sell or otherwise dispose of liquors on said day. It seems to me that the warrant is insufficient to raise this question, and that it would be a complete defense to Section 1,304 if any one produced a license, whether he had sold on Sunday or any other day.

For the reason given the demurrer to the warrant is sustained.

W. L. JACKSON, Judge.

We will print Judge Richie's opinion next week.
