# SILENT EVANGELISM.

THERE has come to our table a neat card case bearing in gilt the figure of a dove and an olive branch, and underneath the words: "Silent Evangelism." Inside the case is an assortment of cards with pertinent questions and texts of scripture calculated to awaken an interest in spiritual things and to arouse the dormant conscience of the careless sinner. The plan is in brief as explained by its author: "The use of a series of superfine, round-cornered cards, of different tints, each elegantly printed in colors, and bearing a word of personal interest and sympathy and a verse of Scripture appropriate to the condition of the person to whom you give it, which person is thereby pointed to Christ. You carry a supply of those cards in your pocket in a handy case provided with them, and give them out prayerfully, as occasion offers." Cards fifty cents per hundred in any quantity. A booklet giving full particulars can be had free by addressing. Silent Evangelism Association, Battle Creek, Mich. This association is undenominational and is under the management of Rev. R. R. Wightman.
