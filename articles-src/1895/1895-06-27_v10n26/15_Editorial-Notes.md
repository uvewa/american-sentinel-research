# EDITORIAL NOTES.

IF ANY ONE receiving the AMERICAN SENTINEL without having ordered it may know that it is sent to him by some friend. Therefore, those who have not ordered the SENTINEL need have no fears that they will be asked to pay for it.

THE Dayton (Tenn.) Republican is faithfully continuing its fight for religious freedom. Read its editorial on this page; also the one on page 207. All honor to the Republican.

SEVENTH-DAY ADVENTISTS are refusing to obey statutes enacted to enforce a false sabbath, and in consequence are suffering persecution. In this are they following the example of Christ? Read the first-page article.

A POLICE OFFICER called at the SENTINEL office Sunday morning and ordered the manager to dismiss all SENTINEL employés, and not to permit them to labor on Sunday. The employés were informed of the order, but all remained at work. Up to the hour of going to press no arrests have been made.

THE case of John A. Faust, the Baltimore Seventh-day Adventist, arrested June 10, for cobbling in his own house on the preceding day, and who was locked in a cell and refused a bed, has been thrown out by the grand jury. Justices of the peace have exclusive original jurisdiction of Sunday cases in Maryland, hence violation of the Sunday statute is not indictable in that State.

In the article, "Early Persecution of Seventh-day Baptists," on page 206, Mr. Buell gives some interesting historical facts which show clearly that the first Sunday statute enacted in this country was aimed at Seventh-day Baptists, and that observers of the seventh day were actually persecuted under that act. The conclusion is also well-nigh irresistible that Obadiah Holmes, John Clarke and John Crandall, the former of which was so cruelly whipped, were Seventh-day Baptists.

WE promised last week to give our readers this week the decisions of Judges Jackson and Richie. We find, however, that we have room for only one. The other will appear next week.

The decisions are interesting, because if sustained by the Court of Appeals, the action of these judges will leave Kentucky for the time being without a Sunday law. But inasmuch as both Judge Jackson and Judge Richie have intimated that a general Sunday statute would be constitutional, it is more than likely that the near future will see a very stringent statute enacted in that State prohibiting all labor and business on the first day of the week, under heavy penalties.

But it is somewhat difficult to see how any Sunday law can be held to be constitutional in Kentucky under the present constitution and the ruling of Judge Richie. The judge holds the present statute to be unconstitutional, "because it is a religious statute." Now, whatever may be the pretense upon which such a statute may be based, there can, in the very nature of the case, never be a Sunday statute in Kentucky or elsewhere that is not religious. And if such a statute could be framed nobody would want it. Mr. Crafts says: "Take the religion out and you take the rest out." We shall watch the progress of events in Kentucky with great interest.

Our correspondent who sends us the translation of the circular letter to the priests of Bogota, printed on page 205, says: "The effect of the circular has been to increase the attendance at the college. In my own work [colporter], it has given me opportunity to more readily place tracts in the hands of the people. Yesterday in one of the parks I gave some tracts to two gentlemen, and meeting them a little later asked them how they liked them. They said they liked those they had read very well. In the course of the conversation which followed one said: 'I had a large Bible and some Latin books which I valued very highly, but one day a priest came to my father's house, accompanied by a policeman, and took my books away.'" Our correspondent adds: "For a Colombian there is little or no relief in such cases. The church is the conservator of social order, as is stated in the constitution of the country; and when it [the church] says that anything is contrary to social order the government must prohibit it, as it is bound to protect the church and see that it is respected." This is strikingly suggestive of some of the "arguments" used in this country, especially in justification of Sunday legislation.

THE California State Sabbath Association, so-called, was recently reorganized in San Francisco. The following is the official statement of its object:

The object of this association shall be two-fold:

Section 1. To promote the proper observance of the Christian Sabbath in the State of California and in the nation.

Sec. 2. To promote religious influence by State legislation and by county and municipal ordinances; to prevent all open acts of Sabbath desecration; and to secure by law the observance of the first day of the week as a day of rest.

But notwithstanding this plain statement, we suppose that when a Sunday law shall be enacted in California we will be gravely told that it is only a police regulation, a merely civil statute for the physical good of the people.

The end sought by this so-called Sabbath Association is, it seems, to be attained by way of the Sunday saloon, as witnessed by the following:

Resolved, That among the first things for which this association will labor will be the closing of all saloons on the Christian Sabbath.

This means that the Sunday closing of saloons is to be a stepping-stone to a general Sunday law stopping all business and forbidding "all open acts of Sabbath desecration."
