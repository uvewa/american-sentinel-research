# "HOME NEVER CHANGES."

[The following translation of a circular letter from the Bishop of Bogota, United States of Colombia, S. A., to the priests of his diocese, shows conclusively that Rome has not changed. She is the same in South America that she was in Europe five centuries ago. Rome establishes schools when she must, and controls, but never fosters education.]

Archbishopric of Santafé de Bogota.—Ecclesiastical Government. Bogota, May 6, 1895.

To the Priest of ——:—

As our divine Saviour says: the enemy continually invades the father's inheritance, and laughing at vigilance of the good, sows tares amongst the wheat. Such is the case in countries like ours, where, through divine favor, and, thanks to the zeal of our superiors, the only true, the apostolic Roman Catholic religion prevails. The proselyting Protestant sects endeavor to induce the faithful to apostatize from the faith professed by them at baptism. This we have witnessed during the past few years, principally, in this city, and elsewhere in the Republic.

One of the numerous Protestant sects—who agree among themselves, only to make war upon Catholicism—the Presbyterian, has for some time been among us, supporting missionaries and propagating its false doctrines. Early, a church was built in which to celebrate its heretical worship. Later these missionaries undertake the task of collecting proselytes by sowing the evil seeds of heresy among the young.

To accomplish this, a college and school for girls was established, where, as it is well known, are gathered not a few children of poor parents; these they flatter by gifts and promises of pecuniary help. Next comes the establishment of a college and schools for boys; and recently a night school was opened for workingmen, in which, according to their lately circulated prospectus, they also offer to give, besides the primary instruction, that of religion; which is none other than the Protestant.

It pains us to see that some fathers and mothers, some unintentionally, others perverted, have sacrificed their consciences and the faith of their families, and, perhaps for a small assistance, placed themselves and their children on the road to eternal destruction. We would be guilty of a grave neglect of duty if we did not earnestly call the attention of the clergy and faithful to these great evils which we have noted. Under a pretext of offering instruction, which is justly desired by all, it is not possible to permit them to snatch away, principally, from the poor the inestimable gift of faith in our Lord Jesus Christ, and his holy church.

The present energetical propagating of the Protestant faith by means of tracts, leaflets, and periodicals, in which, under a cloak of pretended virtue and false piety, they endeavor to gain the confidence of a simple, and naturally believing people in order to instill into their minds errors and heresies which are not always easy to discover, and in the end to persuade them, that they teach the true doctrines of our Lord Jesus Christ; that this consists in believing; that faith and works do not go together; that it is enough to be sorry for sins and ask God's forgiveness in order to obtain justification; and, therefore, the teaching of the Catholic Church is false upon these, faith and good works, the sacraments in general, especially upon the holy eucharist, repentance, and confession.

You, the priest, well understand how imperative is our duty to instruct the faithful, who are under our pastoral care, of the dangers which threaten their souls, if they knowingly expose themselves to the reception of these miserable doctrines, clearly prohibited and anathematized by our holy mother church, and, especially, by the holy Council of Trent. Therefore we most earnestly exhort you by the love of our Lord Jesus Christ, to improve every occasion presented, in public and private, in the pulpit, the confessional, and your social relations, to dissuade Catholics under your jurisdiction, from receiving Protestant books and periodicals, or those of unbelievers, and from taking part in, or causing others to take part in, the establishments of education founded and sustained in this city, or elsewhere, by the Presbyterians or any other sect.

Therefore, in exercise of our authority, we decree that you persistently communicate and explain to the faithful the following points:

1st. Apostates from the Christian faith incur the penalty of excommunication, later sentencia reserved especially to the Roman pontiff, and with them all heretics, of whatever name or sect, and all who believe, harbor, aid or defend them; also schismatics, and all who obstinately depart from the obedience of the Roman pontiff.

2nd. The same penalty is incurred by all who knowingly read, without the authority of the holy see, books of the said apostates and heretics, wherein their heresy is defended, or books of authors which are expressly forbidden, also those who keep, print, or in any manner defend them.

3rd. No Catholic can, without committing mortal sin and incurring the other penalties imposed by the church, send his sons, daughters or those dependent upon them, or go himself to any establishment or school founded and known in this city by the name of the "American College for Boys and Girls;" nor can he give aid or help in any like educational institutions.

4th. The workmen, youth or adults, who go or encourage others to attend the night school, which has been opened in the American College for Boys, incur the same grave sin, and are under the same penalties.

5th. It is highly unlawful for all Catholics to cooperate or assist in any Protestant ceremony, funeral, etc., performed in the church or out of it.

6th. The faithful who receive, or have in their possession, tracts, leaflets, periodicals, such as the Evangelista Colombiano, and El Progreso of New York; Bibles or books of whatever class printed within or out of the Republic, which are distributed or sold by Protestant missionaries, or their agents, or any other bookseller, are positively obliged to deliver said books to their respective parish priest, or send them to the archbishopric.

You are to cause this circular to be read in all of the churches for three consecutive Sundays at the time of mass, so that the faithful may fully know its contents. God keep you.

BERNADO,
Archbishop of Bogota.
