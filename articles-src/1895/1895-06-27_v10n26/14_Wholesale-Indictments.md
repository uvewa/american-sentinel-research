# WHOLESALE INDICTMENTS.

## Nineteen Graysville Adventists To Be Tried This Court.

[From the Dayton Republican, June 21.]

Rhea County Circuit Court will convene the first Monday in July, Judge James G. Parks, presiding, and Attorney General A. J. Fletcher, prosecuting. There are very few cases of importance, with the exception of the Graysville Adventists, who are to be tried on the charge of violating the Sabbath.

Nineteen of these Adventists will be tried upon this charge. Some of them are made defendant in several cases. Following are their names:

E. M. Plumb, 4 cases, — Harrison, Lewis Abbott, 2 cases, W. L. Burchard, E. S. Abbott, 2 cases, J. M. Ball, Walter Ridgeway, E. R. Gillett, Dwight Plumb,

— Dieffenbacher, N. B. England, 2 cases, H. C. Leach, 2 cases, Oscar England, Geo. Dodson, Allen Cather, 2 cases, Columbus Myers, Bird Terry (col.), W. J. Kerr, Monroe Morgan.

We call the attention of the reader to matter published elsewhere in this paper relating to these people. Some of them have been arrested upon the most trivial charge. They are none of them Sabbath-breakers within the meaning and intent of the spirit of the law. They are God-fearing, law-abiding, industrious citizens of this county.

One of the indicted parties is E. R. Gillett. A great many of our readers know "Uncle" Gillett, as he is called. He is a pleasant, mild-mannered, inoffensive old gentleman, well up in the sixties. He is everybody's friend and everybody loves him, for he is a lovable character. He would turn aside in his path to avoid crushing a worm. Like Abou Ben Adhem he can say, "write me as one who loves his fellow-man." In practicing his faith he has worshiped on Saturday and labored the remaining six days of the week. In doing this he has aroused the ire of some people who want everybody else to believe as they do, and now he is to be brought into a court of justice and tried like a common malefactor. It would be a strange sight indeed in this latter age of the world to see venerable "Uncle" Gillett behind the bars. Yet such is likely to be his fate. Jailer Smith should watch this man with extra care. He is a dangerous criminal, and society is not safe while he roams at large.
