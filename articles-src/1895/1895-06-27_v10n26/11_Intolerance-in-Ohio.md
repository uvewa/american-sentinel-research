# INTOLERANCE IN OHIO.

The Minerva (Ohio) News, of June 7, has the following note, which we presume has reference to Seventh-day Adventists, as there are a good many people of that faith in Ohio:

It has come to the notice of the News that on a certain farm not far from Minerva fences and barns are repaired, machinery overhauled and work of this nature regularly carried on on Sunday just the same as other days. Such a despicable desecration of the Lord's day is indeed a shame upon the community, and if it is not stopped, the law will certainly take hold of the offenders and teach them a lesson of respect to God and their fellow-men.

We would inform the News that it is entirely legal for observers of the seventh day to do ordinary labor upon the first day of the week; therefore, if the work complained of is done by Seventh-day Adventists, it is not a violation of the law. But suppose it is not done by observers of the seventh day, but by Primitive Baptists or by members of the Christian or Disciple Church, who believe in no Sabbath in this dispensation, or by persons of no religion, would it be right to invoke the law against such persons any more than against Seventh-day Adventists, Seventh-day Baptists, or Jews? Certainly not. And is not a law which provides for such discrimination even more plainly religious in character than is one which requires all, without exception, to observe Sunday as a day of rest? It certainly is.

The News editor talks of a "despicable desecration of the Lord's day"; he ought to read the opinion of Judge Thurman, in the case of Bloom vs. Richards, December term of the Supreme Court of Ohio, 1853. He would there learn that "the General Assembly of Ohio is not a guardian of the sanctity of any day. If it may protect the first day of the week from desecration because it is the Christian Sabbath, it may, in like manner, protect the sixth day because it is the holy day of the Mohammedan, and the seventh day, because it is the Sabbath of the Jew and the Seventh-day Baptist. Nay, more, it may protect the various festival days which, by some of the churches, are considered scarcely less holy than the Sabbath day."
