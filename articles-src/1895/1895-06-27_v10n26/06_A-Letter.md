# A LETTER.

[From the Examiner National Baptist and Christian Inquirer, New York, June 20, 1895.]

We have received a letter from Mr. R. S. Owen, 450 Auburn Avenue, Atlanta, Ga., in which he expresses very high appreciation of the position taken by THE EXAMINER in its editorial columns in reference to the violation of religious liberty in the case of men sentenced to fine, imprisonment, and the chain-gang, for conscientiously engaging, upon the first day of the week, in labor which does not disturb their neighbors. He also expresses his gratitude for the resolution passed by the American Baptist Publication Society, at Saratoga, on the motion of a representative of THE EXAMINER, protesting against these violations of religious liberty.

Mr. Owen further writes: "But a few days since, I visited one of my brethren in a loathsome prison, inclosed in an iron cage with incendiaries, thieves, and murderers, awaiting their departure to the chain-gang. This brother had wronged no one; he had molested no one. He had simply kept the Sabbath according to the commandment, and, quietly, in his own back field, had worked at honest labor on the first day of the week. I talked to the clerk of the court, who had lived neighbor to him for years; he told me there was not a better man in the county. The sheriff told me he was a good citizen. After I had spent some time in the jail, visiting through the iron bars with this brother, I felt that his cold-hearted persecutors were more in need of sympathy than he. We prayed together, and although I could not refrain from weeping, his face was lighted up with joy. The presence of Jesus seemed so near to him that it turned the prison into a palace. May God bless you, and make you a blessing to those who are seeking to make men religious by law, showing them that the power of God is to be manifested through the gospel, and not through the pains and penalties of the civil law."
