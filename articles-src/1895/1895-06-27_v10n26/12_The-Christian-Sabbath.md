# THE CHRISTIAN SABBATH.

A. F. BALLENGER, a Seventh-day Adventist, has written a reply to a series of articles published in the Baltimore Mirror on the observance of Sunday. He claims that all the Protestant sects have been influenced by the Catholic Church to observe Sunday instead of the Sabbath or Saturday. He is right. It is true that Protestants have bowed their plumes to the authority of the church in this matter. They are inconsistent, of course, for there is not a word in the Bible commanding the change from the Sabbath to Sunday. To be consistent with their principle of "the Bible and the Bible alone" they should keep Saturday holy, as the Jews and the Seventh-day Adventists do.—Philadelphia Times, quoted in Catholic Mirror, June 8.
