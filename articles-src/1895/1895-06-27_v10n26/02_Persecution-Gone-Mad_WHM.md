# PERSECUTION GONE MAD.

BY W. H. MCKEE.

The Imprimerie Polyglotte, the publishing house of the Seventh-day Adventists in Basel, Switzerland, has been closed because of the persistent prosecution, for its Sunday labor, met with from the authorities of Basel. The work of the house, in the publication of the literature of the denomination, will be divided and carried on outside the regulation of the factory law. To make this complete revolution in the carrying on of the business will cause considerable expense, much trouble, and some loss from the quantity of valuable machinery and material left idle. However, there is every certainty that this will result in a far wider distribution of the denominational work and literature than before, and an increased production at cheaper rates. The handsomely situated and commodious building, formerly occupied by the publishing business, will be remodeled within and used as a nurses' training school, and for the introduction and development here of the rapidly increasing medical mission work of the denomination.

Such an outcome as this was, of course, unlooked for by those who brought the persecuting prosecutions. Yet it has been invariably and everywhere the result and will be no less so here than elsewhere. At the trial of the last case, brought on the 31st of May, the very day on which it had been previously decided to discontinue the business of the Imprimerie Polyglotte, the prosecuting attorney said in his summing up, "It is a satisfactory thing that, at last, the Seventh-day Adventists in Basel are broken up." Yet he had already acknowledged that they were a quiet, peaceable, respectable, honorable people. It was clear that he had nothing to bring against them except the fact that they believed that they ought to obey God rather than men, and practiced their belief. On the occasion in which Peter and the other apostles were called before the council and made that reply, "We ought to obey God rather than men," some very wise advice was given by a doctor of the law, which, though apparently forgotten, is still applicable,—"If this work be of men, it will come to nought; but if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it;" therefore he counselled that they leave them alone, "lest haply ye be found even to fight against God."

The proceedings against the Basel publishing house, for its Sunday work, present as strange a legal medley as can probably be found upon the records of any modern court. According to the factory law, under which it was necessary to bring the prosecution, the manager of the establishment, alone, is responsible. Therefore, the manager, Mr. Holser, was fined and his household goods taken and sold to satisfy the fine. Again, he was fined two hundred francs, and imprisoned three weeks. The fine was not paid, and no goods were found to levy upon, all his personal effects having been taken to satisfy previous fines. When the authorities found that the fine could not be collected, they would have imprisoned Mr. Holser forty days more, in lieu of the fine, but, in the meantime he had gone to America to attend the biennial conference of Seventh-day Adventists of the world, to which he had been called as a delegate. He was then advertised as a bankrupt, according to legal form. Upon his return to Europe, Mr. Holser did not come into the jurisdiction of the Basel court, but went to attend denominational meetings in northern Europe, to which he had been assigned. Apparently the limit of legal procedure in this line had been reached, and still the employés of the Imprimerie Polyglotte continued to work peacefully and quietly six days in the week and rest upon the seventh.

Also, in the meanwhile, the police had maintained a careful and systematic supervision over the house, on Sundays, and all its outgoing and incoming. During the last week in May a summons was received at the office of the Imprimerie Polyglotte, which was then preparing to go out of business on the 31st of May. On reading the summons, it was found that the "congregation of Seventh-day Adventists" was summoned before the court. As the congregation has no legal personality, and no one was summoned personally, the law firm which has previously attended to the legal business of the Imprimerie Polyglotte was asked to appear in answer to the summons and so represent, and request a dismissal of the case on the ground that it had not been brought against any person or corporation having a legal individuality to be proceeded against in law. This was done and the fact made very clear to the court that the Seventh-day Adventist Church in Basel was not a corporate business body, and owned no property, and did no business,—that it paid rent for the assembly room which it used in the building formerly occupied by the Imprimerie Polyglotte in its publishing business. But instead of dismissing the case, the court did about as strange a thing as can be found in the legal annals of our time. It fined "The Central European Conference of Seventh-day Adventists" five hundred francs, the limit of the law,—and threatened a similar fine for every Sunday upon which labor should be continued in the publishing house. This fine was decreed against this other religious body, as the court said, in "continuation," which, of course, means for refusal or failure to appear before the court in answer to a summons. Note the remarkable inconsistency,—a religious body, not a definite person, was summoned, nevertheless an accredited lawyer appeared, and there were present in court the pastor of the church and several members,—the court then fined another religious organization, not mentioned in the summons, five hundred francs for not appearing. Neither the Seventh-day Adventist Church in Basel, nor the Central European Conference owns any property in Basel, or transacts any secular business anywhere, and yet the court fined "The Central European Conference," which it had not summoned, and which is a religious organization anyway, five hundred francs, and threatened to continue the multiplication of the same fine weekly until work was stopped in the Imprimerie Polyglotte, the buildings and business of which is owned and managed by an incorporated business association having its headquarters in Battle Creek, Michigan. It scarcely seems possible that futility and inconsistency could have gone any farther.

This ends all possible proceedings against the Seventh-day Adventist publishing house at Basel. The next step will be to prosecute the members of the church individually, under the cantonal law, whenever they are complained of as laboring on Sunday. This law is very strict, and yet admits of an interpretation which is a sufficient protection to the ordinary citizen from its severity. It remains to be seen how long it will be before it is put in operation against Seventh-day Adventists.
