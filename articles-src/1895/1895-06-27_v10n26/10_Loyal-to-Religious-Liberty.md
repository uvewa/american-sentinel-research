# LOYAL TO RELIGIOUS LIBERTY.

[From the Christian Register, Boston, June 13.]

The Baptists, at their recent gathering at Saratoga, gave another proof of their loyalty to religious liberty for which they have been distinguished in their history. On the report that in some portions of the United States citizens who have conscientiously observed the seventh day for religious rest and worship, and engaged on the first day in labor which in no way disturbed others, have for this act been arrested, fined, imprisoned, and put upon the chain-gang, they passed the following:

Resolved, That we most solemnly protest against the violation of the right of religious liberty for which our fathers have contended at the cost of imprisonment, and spoiling of their goods, and stripes, and exile, and even of life itself.
