# SEVENTH-DAY ADVENTISTS VS. MORMONISM.

[From Dayton (Tenn.) Republican, June 21.]

In some quarters the argument is advanced that Mormonism, which includes as its essential feature polygamy, is susceptible to all the arguments that may be advanced in favor of allowing the Seventh-day Baptists to worship on Sabbath or the seventh day of the week, and labor the remaining six days as they see fit.

The Republican takes it that these two religious denominations are as wide apart in the essential principle upon which they are founded as the antipodes, and that there cannot be the slightest parallelism between them.

To begin with, the order of Seventh-day Baptists is founded upon the biblical command to keep the seventh day holy. The authority is direct from the Bible itself, as any one may see by investigation; also this injunction is coupled with the command to labor the remaining six days, which is equally as mandatory and binding upon all true and obedient Christians. Moreover, the Adventists, as we will call them in brief, in practicing their belief, do not place themselves out of harmony with any vital law of society. On the contrary, they are seeking to bring society and its laws into harmony with God and his laws. The majority of the Christian world has repudiated the command of Jehovah as expressed through the Bible, and adopted in its stead the tradition of the Catholic Church, to observing the first instead of the last day of the week as the Sabbath. The Adventists are seeking to have the true Sabbath reinstated. That Saturday is the Sabbath of the Bible the Christian world cannot deny without repudiating that book.

So far, then, the Adventists have the best of the argument; and their faith and practice is gentle and persuasive in its character, and not calculated to produce any violent friction in society. In fact, no essential rule of society has been disturbed, and no natural or inherent right of man has been invaded. What criticism and disturbance we have over this essentially religious question is caused by the ultra-attitude of a few persons here and there, who unfortunately labor under the impression that society owes them a greater amount of consideration than their fellow-men, and who take advantage of a general Sunday law undoubtedly designed with the sole thought to protect the community from the vicious and criminal element, to crush a rival religious organization that threatens to make encroachment upon their territory.

On the other hand Mormonism is founded upon polygamy, which is a violation of both religious and civil rule and authority. The conjunction of male and female, as man and wife, the propagation of offspring in order to insure the perpetuity of the race, the growth of the family along with laws for the protection of husband, wife and children, have been an entirely natural evolution; they relate wholly to this life, and are therefore properly the subject of human legislation. In all matters of secular government, the regulation of the civil relation of the various members of society, the State, that is to say, the aggregate members of society, is and should be supreme. The right of man to take to himself as many wives as he sees fit is not a vested right, because the State has laid down the law of single marriage, which is essential to the preservation of society; on the contrary, the right to worship according to the dictates of conscience is a vested right, and is so declared by the great charter of human liberty framed by our forefathers.

But there is another element that is an important factor in this question: The State must regulate marriage because in its very nature it affects not only those who enter into that relation, but the entire community as well. Marriage imposes upon those who enter it certain obligations, and they must not be permitted to escape those responsibilities, for if they do the burden will fall upon others. To protect the community from the imposition of this burden, the State rightly insists that marriage shall conform to the rules it lays down. It is therefore the right and the duty of the State to regulate the marriage contract; this it does for self-protection.

This is not true of Sabbath-keeping; for one man's failure to keep the Sabbath does not deprive another of that privilege, neither does it burden the State. The conclusion is, that while polygamy is an invasion of natural rights, destructive of the very idea of civil government, the State has no right to assume to dictate to man upon questions that affect the spiritual relations between his Maker and himself.
