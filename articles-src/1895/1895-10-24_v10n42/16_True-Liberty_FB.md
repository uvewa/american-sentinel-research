All through a land of thick strewn graves,
There walked the Lord of Life who saves,
And softly whispered to the slaves,
"Have liberty."

Some at his gentle voice looked up,
And caught the radiance of his hope;
Some knew not that the Master spoke,
"Have liberty."

But one with kindling faith drew near.
The Saviour whispered, "Have no fear.
Trust thou in me, the way is clear
To liberty."

And as he spoke the slave was free.
The galling chain fell off, and he
Followed the Master joyfully
In liberty.

No longer with the slaver's horde,
He joined the army of the Lord.
He bore a banner with this word,
"True liberty."

Then enemies around him drew,
But all their ranks he fought straight through,
And struggled upward with the few
In liberty.

The tempter placed upon his track
Sirens to lure his footsteps back.
Still facing heaven, he did not lack
His liberty.

Then crueler darts were on him hurled.
Men hated him in all the world;
But still his banner was unhurled,
"True liberty."

Then prison walls around him close.
Torture and shame they add to woes;
But o'er the rack his banner rose,
"True liberty."

Then to the stake they led him on.
The fagots kindled one by one;
But bright his soul was as the sun,
In liberty.

Above the flame the people saw
With dreadful fear, with sacred awe,
The banner of his King, the law
Of liberty.

Above his ashes as they stood
The people saw the cross of blood,
And on it nailed the Son of God,
For liberty.

And in a vision they behold
The clouds withdrawn, the streets of gold,
The conqueror, earth could not withhold,
From liberty.

No more could foes his soul harass.
High near the throne they see him pass,
Singing upon the sea of glass
In liberty.

O liberty of Christ, 'tis given
To us as to the martyrs even.
We too may conquer hell, win heaven,
Have liberty.
