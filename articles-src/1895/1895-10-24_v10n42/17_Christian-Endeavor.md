The Christian Endeavor Societies of the State of Illinois held their State convention at Bloomington, October 3 to 6. On the afternoon of the 5th, the following resolutions were offered:—

WHEREAS, The endeavors of the Barbers' Union are being exerted toward the better observance of the Christian sabbath.

Be it Resolved, That we, the Illinois Christian Endeavor Union, in convention assembled, thoroughly sympathize with their efforts for the maintenance of a half sabbath.

Be it Further Resolved, That we pledge ourselves personally to cooperate with them in their observance, especially by personally refraining from patronizing barber shops on the sabbath day.

Resolved, That a copy of these resolutions be forwarded to the union of Chicago.

"This," says the Daily Pantograph, of the 7th inst., "brought Rev. E. O. Sharpe, pastor of the Christian Church at Saybrook, to his feet, with the following amendment":

Resolved, That the Illinois Christian Endeavor convention, while heartily favoring all Christian measures for the promotion of the proper observance of the Lord's day, severely condemns the infringement by law on the religious rights of those who conscientiously observe the seventh day as their day of rest.

The amendment was voted down, and the original resolutions were unanimously adopted. This action was further emphasized later in the day by the adoption of the following:—

Resolved, That we condemn any and every foe of the sabbath day, in business, public or private life, and that we will use all our powers and influences for a better observance of the Lord's day.

"Any and every foe of the Sabbath" is broad enough, and was doubtless designed to be broad enough, to include those "foes" of the so-called sabbath (Sunday) who oppose its claims with the divine truth that "the seventh day is the Sabbath." At all events, by rejecting Mr. Sharp's resolution, the Y. P. S. C. E., of the State of Illinois, stands committed to a denial of equal rights to observers of the seventh day—and they call this Christian endeavor!
