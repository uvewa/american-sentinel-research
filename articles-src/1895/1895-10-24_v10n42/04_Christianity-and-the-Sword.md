The spirit that seeks in this country to force religious dogmas and institutions upon people by the power of the "law," has its counterpart abroad in the spirit that calls for the sword of "the powers that be" to put down heathen opposition to Christian missions. An example of the latter is furnished by a letter from the Rev. Mr. Fulton, an American missionary in China, printed recently and approved in the Evangelist, New York. In it, speaking of the late massacre of missionaries by the Chinese, he says:—

There is but a single remedy, if this Munchau rule is to continue, and that is to demand that henceforth foreigners shall have unrestricted right of residence in every foot of Chinese territory, and that the local authorities and high officials shall be held personally responsible for the life of every foreigner residing within the bounds of their jurisdiction. Nothing short of this will meet the pressing needs of the case. The decapitation of a dozen or more of low criminals will be gladly granted by China, as a very cheap way of allaying the anger of England and America, but this will no more settle the matter than the amputation of an arm will cure leprosy. We must strike at the root, not at the branch. If this demand is not enforced, there is no assured hope for foreigners in China.

Elsewhere in his letter, says the Nation, the missionary "reviles the Chinese government in unmeasured terms." That journal comments upon the imprudence of this and similar letters written by the missionaries and published in England and America, and adds: "Imagine a handful of Buddhist missionaries in one own country reviling the government, calling for vengeance on their opponents, demanding foreign intervention on their behalf that they might ram their doctrines down our throats at the point of the bayonet, and some idea may be had of the way our performances must strike the Chinese."

The truth which sadly needs to be emphasized, both in that country and this, is that the arm of the secular power cannot be properly invoked in the defense and furtherance of Christian work. Christianity can never make headway against its foes by the aid of carnal weapons. The one weapon upon which those under its banner must rely to cut their way through all opposition is "the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God." And this is a far more powerful weapon than any that can be furnished from the arsenals of the world.

The spectacle of Christian missionaries calling for a bloody punishment upon their persecutors, and relying upon the bullets and bayonets of their own "Christian" nations to back them up in their work, is a sad indication of the modern degeneracy of Christian effort, under the influence of that spirit which is seeking, both at home and abroad, an alliance with the State.
