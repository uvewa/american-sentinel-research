The World, of the 15th inst., had the following item:—

Three men were brought as prisoners to the Essex Market Police Court yesterday, for having sold umbrellas on Sunday.

It rained on Sunday. Every man, woman and child who was in New York on that day will remember that it rained. It poured. It came down in buckets, cartloads, rivers, lakes, and, some say, oceans. It was the sort of rain that burrows its way through your water-proof and, when it reaches your skin, trickles down in fiendish drops. It rained in the morning, it rained in the afternoon, it rained at night. It rained outrageously.

Three friends of humanity, Kell Silverman, Wolf Popkin and Benjamin Lavine, stood in that rain and sold umbrellas. When they were brought to court they pleaded that they were poor and that the few cents they had earned would buy food for their families.

"Besides," said Silverman, "it was raining very hard and the umbrellas came in handy."

Yet each of them was fined $1.

At the same moment street cars were running and railroad trains were thundering into the city. Tobacconist shops and candy stores were open and fruit stands were doing business, because these things are considered necessary even on Sunday, especially the tobacco. But an umbrella is quite another thing. Cigars and tobacco must be had fresh on Sunday, but the man who does not provide himself with an umbrella when the sun shines, ought to get wet in case it rains on Sunday. Such are some of the absurdities of the New York Sunday "law."
