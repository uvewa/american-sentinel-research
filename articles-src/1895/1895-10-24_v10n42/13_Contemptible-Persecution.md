[The Progress, Minneapolis, Oct. 12.]

The report comes to the Progress that Mr. R. T. Nash, of Amory, Miss., formerly of Minnesota, who is a member of the Seventh-day Adventist denomination, was recently arrested again for Sunday work in his own corn field; which is claimed by the prosecution to have been done on the 12th day of last May.

The officer who made the arrest rode a mule, and was inclined to compel Mr. Nash to walk fifteen miles to Aberdeen, the county seat. But Mr. Nash had already walked a long distance, and had been kept up all the night before with a sick child, and was very tired. With much persuasion the sheriff allowed his prisoner to take the train, meeting the officer at the depot, from whence he was escorted to the jail and thrust therein. He was there held behind iron bars for forty-six hours, with only a scanty supply of corn bread, peas and water. Pork and coffee were furnished, but these he could not use. When he was called before the court, he refused to plead, saying that he could not remember what he did on the 12th of May. This was held by the court as a plea of not guilty. It was found that there were no witnesses present to testify against him, and they were fifteen miles distant. Mr. Nash was compelled to give bonds for reappearance at the next term of court, some time next spring.

Mr. Nash made quite a mark in this State as a canvasser for denominational books, and went to Mississippi at the request of the General Conference Board. He put in a small garden where he worked at odd times and Sundays for the comfort of his family. It will be remembered that Mr. Nash was arrested some time since, was tried, plead his own case, found guilty and fined. The fine was paid by his neighbors, who said they would not see him go to jail for that which others did every Sunday in the year. In his defense, he claimed that it was a matter of conscience, as he observed the Sabbath according to the commandment, and spent the other six days in labor; and that the State had no right to interfere so long as he did not interfere with the rights of any other person. He held that it was the inalienable right of all men to spend their time as they wish, so long as they do not invade the equal rights of others in spending their time as they wish.

The incidents here related are in line with many similar outrages which have been perpetrated in Tennessee, Georgia, Maryland, and other southern States, and even in some of the New England States. It is purely religious persecution of the most contemptible kind, by people who must be devoid of all true Christian principle, and who take technical advantage of an old law, the spirit of which was never in accordance with such purpose.

Such abuse of law and liberty is a mockery of the civilization and intelligence of free America. It is bringing reproach and shame upon the communities that tolerate it, and should not be countenanced by any self-respecting people. The press of the country should turn such scorching blasts upon these satanic persecutors that they would not only fear to longer insult common decency, but would be recognized in their true character as public enemies, and shunned as agents of evil.

Enlightened public opinion in the United States will never indorse such persecution, and laws which are so imperfect or unjust as to permit it must ultimately be repealed. Political freedom can only be compatible with religious freedom. Persecution for conscience' sake is not consistent with the sentiment that upholds the "Stars and Stripes."
