## OCR Corrections Made

### Page 1, Masthead
- **OCR read:** "ANNISTANT EDITOR"
- **Corrected to:** "ASSISTANT EDITOR"
- **Confidence:** HIGH - obvious OCR error for "ASSISTANT"

### Page 7, Advertisement
- **OCR read:** "BIBB & CO."
- **Corrected to:** "MUNN & CO."
- **Confidence:** HIGH - context confirms this is Munn & Co. (patent attorneys), and the correct company name appears later in the same ad

### Page 7, Greek Testament Sample
- **Note:** Greek text and interlinear translation preserved as-is from OCR; many OCR errors present in the Greek characters but correcting these would require Greek expertise beyond scope of transcription
- **Action:** Left as-is; this is sample advertising material showing the format of the product

### General Notes
- All obvious OCR errors (clear misspellings, character substitution errors) were corrected
- Original spellings like "to-day", "connexion" were preserved as per instructions
- Page headers, running titles, and page numbers were omitted as instructed
- Advertisement sections at bottom of pages 5-8 were skipped (subscription forms, product ads not part of article content)
