[J. Christiansen in the Evangelists Sendebud and Sanhedens Tidende (Gospel Messenger and Herald of Truth), Danish.]

In the thirteenth chapter of Romans, we are commanded to be subject unto "the powers that be;" and are told that they who resist "shall receive to themselves damnation."

In the third verse the apostle gives us the reason for this: "For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wilt thou then be afraid of the power? do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise of the same: for he is a minister of God to thee for good."

Jesus said: "There is none good but one, that is God: if thou wilt enter into life keep the commandments." Matt. 19:17. The Saviour then tells to which commandments he refers, namely, those which forbid murder, adultery, theft, and false witness, and the one which requires honor to parents. Obeying these we have nothing to fear from the powers which God has ordained.

In the seventh chapter of Romans, twelfth verse, we read: "The law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good;" and from the seventh verse we understand that this law is the ten commandments.

Of the same law David says: "The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple. The statutes of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes. The fear of the Lord is clean, enduring forever: the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether." Ps. 19:7-9. "Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, and thy law is the truth." Ps. 119:142. No wonder, then, that Paul declares the law to be holy, just, and good; and the man who strives to live according to this law, is certainly trying to do that which is good, and should have no reason to be afraid of the ruler who administers "the powers that be," for "he is a minister of God to thee for good."

The Seventh-day Adventists are arrested and punished for keeping the seventh day, the Sabbath of the Lord, and for working on Sunday, the first day of the week, although the "holy, and just, and good" law says: "Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work: but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work."

These men are trying to do just what this perfect law tells them: to "fear God and keep his commandments, for this is the whole duty of man." Eccl. 12:13. They are doing just what is required by the law which is "holy, and just, and good;" and as "rulers are not a terror to good works," those men who are dragging their fellowmen to jail and setting them to work in chain-gangs among common criminals for doing that which is good, cannot be in that thing ministers of God, ordained by him to minister the powers that he has ordained; because instead of condemning men to prison for doing good, God's ministers give them praise. "For he is a minister to thee for good."

The rulers who now administer the power come very far short of their duty, or rather have usurped functions not given them of God, just as the king of Babylon did when he cast the Hebrews in the "burning fiery furnace." And those who are so diligently watching the Adventists on Sunday to get them arrested, must stand in full fellowship with those men who assembled and found Daniel praying and making supplication to God and accused him before the king. Dan. 6:11.

It seems that Peter, in his first epistle was looking forward to this very time, for he says in chapter 2:19: "For it is thankworthy if a man for conscience toward God endure grief, suffering wrongfully." The prophet Micah, in the seventh chapter, seems also to have seen this same time; in the second verse, he says: "The good man is perished out of the earth: and there is none upright among men: they all lie in wait for blood: they hunt every man his brother with a net. That they may do evil with both hands earnestly, the prince asketh, and the judge asketh for a reward; and the great man he uttereth his mischievous desire: so they wrap it up." Or "twist it together" (Daniels). But what a comfort to the poor Adventist behind the prison bars, is the seventh verse: "Therefore I will look unto the Lord; I will wait for the God of my salvation: my God will hear me. Rejoice not against me, O mine enemy: when I fall, I shall arise; when I sit in darkness, the Lord shall be a light unto me."
