No one who keeps track of current events, as recorded by the secular press, can have failed to note the frequent mention during recent years of wonderful cases of healing said to have taken place at Catholic shrines, and by the application of relics of Roman Catholic saints.

The well-known Chauncey M. Depew had a wonderful story to relate upon his recent return from Europe, of a notable miracle which he had all but witnessed himself at Lourdes, France, a shrine to the Virgin Mary.

More recently the papers have been full of remarkable stories of wonderful cases of healing in Denver, Col., through the instrumentality of a humble shoemaker, a member of the Roman Catholic Church in New Mexico; and more recently still, the secular press has published the details of a marvelous cure effected in this city through the virtue which is supposed to reside in a fragment of a bone, said to have belonged to St. Ann, mother of the Virgin Mary.

The Roman Catholic Church has always claimed miraculous power for her saints and their relics; and Protestants have always denied the validity of these claims, asserting, for the most part, that the "day of miracles is past." But in recent years there has been among Protestants a revival of faith in the miraculous; and this answer that "the day of miracles is past" is no longer regarded as satisfactory by many people; nor is this strange since there is really no authority for the declaration.

The Scriptures do not teach that miraculous power was ever to cease out of the church; on the contrary, we learn from 1 Cor. 1:7, that the Church, just before the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, will "come behind in no gift;" so that something more than a general denial of miraculous power is required to meet the claims of Rome in this matter.

We do not admit all that is claimed by Rome in regard to miraculous power, but it is not necessary to deny the existence of such power. The fact that miraculous power is possessed by an individual or by a church, does not prove that that individual or that church derives such power from God, or that such an individual or church enjoys the favor of God. Miracles are indeed evidence of power but not of its source.

When Moses presented himself before Pharaoh and delivered to him the divine message, "Let my people go, that they may hold a feast unto me in the wilderness,"¹ Pharaoh called the wise men and the sorcerers;" and "they also did in like manner with their enchantments."² "And Pharaoh's heart was hardened, neither did he hearken unto them [Moses and Aaron]; as the Lord had said."

Power was certainly manifested through the magicians, but it was not the power of God, for it was used in resisting the servants of God; and in his second letter to Timothy, the Apostle Paul says: "This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come." He then gives a catalogue of the sins which will be common in the last days among men "having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof." He then adds: "Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these resist the truth."³

This is a plain prediction that just as miracles were used in resisting the work of Moses and Aaron, so miracles will be used in the last days in resisting the truth of God; hence we see clearly that though miracles are an evidence of the possession of power, they are not necessarily evidence of divine power.

That miracles are to be used in the last days for the purpose of resisting divine truth and deceiving the people, is further shown by the description which is given by inspiration of a prosecuting power which is to oppose the work of the people of God just before the second advent of our Lord Jesus Christ. Of this power it is written: "He doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men, and deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do."⁴ And again the prophet says: "I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet. For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty."⁵

This text applies just before the end of the world; for immediately following it is the declaration: "Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame."⁶

As we have seen, the days of miracles are not passed; but it will not do to blindly follow any church or any individual simply because miraculous power is manifested through that church or that individual. The Lord did not leave his people to be deceived either by "the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive," or by miracles wrought by devils to confuse and bewilder His people, and to give his enemies "occasion to blaspheme." God has given all who will use it a means of proving those who profess to exercise divine power, so that none need be deceived.

The divine touchstone to which all such manifestations are to be brought is the word of God. "To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them."⁷

That word can never deceive those who put their trust in it, and it is the only safety for anybody in these last days. By it the Catholic saints, shrines, and miracles must be tried. If in anything they speak not according to that word it is because "there is no light in them."

What then, is the purpose and what the effect of Roman Catholic miracles? Perhaps this question cannot be answered better than by quoting a paragraph from an article on "The Shrine of St. Ann," in the Catholic World, for October, as follows:—

While we hear a great deal—and rightly so—of our American pilgrimage of Ste. Anne de Beaupré, comparatively few in this country know anything of its European ancestress, of the mother shrine in the Old World which the Breton sailors, mindful of home and its associations, had in view when, tossed by the storms of the Atlantic, they promised "la bonne Sainte Anne" that if she saved them from the seas they would erect in her honor, and on the very spot where they would land, a new shrine on this distant shore. Saint Ann heard the prayers of her children: we possess our beautiful sanctuary under her protection, which bids fair to become for Canada and the New World what Sainte Anne d'Auray is for Brittany and the Old—the nucleus of the devotion to the mother of the blessed Virgin.

Of course the Roman Catholic reader will discern nothing amiss in this paragraph, but it will sound strange to Protestant ears; for here we discover that objectionable doctrine, the worship of saints, disguised, it is true, under the expression "devotion to;" but it is worship none the less truly.

It will be observed that, according to the Catholic World, prayer was offered to St. Ann, and was heard by her upon the ocean, while at the same moment at Auray, in Brittany, pilgrims were offering up their supplications to her; so that we have in this paragraph, not only saint worship, but here is also omnipresence, or at least omniscience attributed to St. Ann. And to-day the new shrine at Beaupré, Canada, is frequented by tens of thousands annually, while other tens of thousands are praying to the same saint in distant Brittany, and St. Ann, two thousand years dead, is supposed to hear them all!

The Scriptures forbid intercourse with the dead. "And when they shall say unto you, Seek unto them that have familiar spirits, and unto wizards that chirp and that mutter: should not a people seek unto their God? on behalf of the living should they seek unto the dead?"

The reason for this commandment is evident: "Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve." To seek unto the dead is to put them in the place of God. The Scriptures declare that "there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus," but saint worship makes many mediators between God and man.

Moreover, the Scriptures declare that the dead "know not anything;" that "his sons come to honor, and he knoweth it not; and they are brought low, but he perceiveth it not of them." "Put not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man, in whom there is no help. His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts perish." And again: "For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not anything, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten. Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished; neither have they any more a portion for ever in anything that is done under the sun."

Saint worship, or prayers to the saints, is therefore diametrically opposed to the teaching of the Word of God, and as Roman Catholic miracles foster superstition and idolatry and destroy faith in the Scriptures, they can be regarded only as part and parcel of the working of Satan by which he hopes to deceive the whole world to its destruction.
