[Boston Daily Globe, Sept. 10.]

The New York State Republican League resolves in favor of "the American Sunday."

But what is "the American Sunday"? There are many thousands of Jews in this country who keep the seventh day as dictated by their consciences. For them "the American Sunday" has no meaning.

There is a very flourishing American city in southern Rhode Island, many of whose leading citizens, all simon-pure Americans, are Seventh-day Baptists. They keep the seventh day in their churches, and regard "the American Sunday" as a violation of the Scripture injunction to keep the Sabbath day holy.

"The American Sunday" must be a Sunday especially adapted for Americans. But for what Americans? Have a set of politicians in convention any authorized prerogatives in the matter of prescribing a Sunday for all?

Those people who are so fond of prescribing an "American" this and an "American" that, have evidently only in view their own prejudices and narrowness.

The truly American Sunday will prove to be the one on which each citizen secures rest and recreation in his own way, his liberty of choice being circumscribed only by recognized morality and legality, and respect for the equal liberty of others.
