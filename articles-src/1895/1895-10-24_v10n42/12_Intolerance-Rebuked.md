[Sabbath Recorder, October 10.]

The Christian Statesman seems happiest when it is making a thrust at those who observe the Sabbath of the Bible. In its issue of September 26, speaking of observers of the seventh day, it says, "It is a sign of a soft head rather than a tender heart to shed tears over the prosecution of law-breakers." This is the beautiful spirit shown by this journal which professes to be loyal to Christ and his disciples. Those who do not worship God according to the rules laid down by the Statesman must be forbidden. A similar case is narrated in Luke 9:49, 50. "And John answered and said, Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name, and we forbade him, because he followeth not with us. And Jesus said unto him, Forbid him not; for he that is not against us is for us."

But the Statesman, more like a pettifogger than a true statesman, continues to deny that anyone has been either prosecuted or persecuted because they keep the seventh day, and insists that it is because they do not keep the first day. That is a very small crawl-out. It is hardly worth one's while to make reply to any opponent when he shows disposition to carry a point by sophistry and misleading statements. The whole matter, so far as the Statesman is concerned, lies in the fact that it champions the cause of legislation to enforce the observance of Sunday, as opposed to that religious liberty which was the guarantee of our forefathers, and for which reason our Pilgrim fathers fled from the same spirit of oppression in the old country and sought a refuge here. The inheritance they bequeathed us is now being contested. Like the infamous decision of Judge Taney, in the famous Dred Scott case, that "the negro has no rights which the white man is bound to respect," so now the Statesman, with a slight change in phraseology, attempts to maintain that the minority, as Sabbath-keepers, have no rights which the majority is bound to respect.
