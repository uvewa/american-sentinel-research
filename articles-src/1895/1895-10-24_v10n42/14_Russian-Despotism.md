[Christian Advocate, Oct. 10.]

A ukase has been issued at St. Petersburg forbidding any Hebrew to embrace the Christian faith unless his wife, children, brothers and parents do so as well. This curious law is designed to circumvent the Jews who had the habit of sacrificing one of the family to the Russian Church, and thereby of acquiring for all the other members a right of earning a living, on the ground that they are all employés in a business conducted by the convert. They are also forbidden to join either the Roman Catholic or the Protestant Church. This is based on the theory that the Greek is the only true Church, and also that the legal privileges that the Jews are to get as a result of joining it should not be conferred by joining an opposition church. Russia will do as it pleases, without regard to the sentiments of the rest of the world.
