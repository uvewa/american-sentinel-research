One of the most significant and deceptive movements of the present century, is the crusade in behalf of so-called "municipal reform;" and strangely enough, this so-called reform is being assigned a place above gospel work, even by ministers of the gospel.

At a Christian Endeavor meeting in Brooklyn, on the 8th inst., Dr. Parkhurst is reported to have said: "Municipal reform is the highest enterprise in which Christians can engage." And again: "I have no sympathy with Christians who simply seek a beautiful state in the hereafter. Our duty is in the present, and there can be no higher duty than municipal reform."

It is very true that the end of Christianity is not "to secure a beautiful state in the hereafter," and "our duty is in the present;" but how a minister of the gospel can declare that "there is no higher duty than municipal reform, is something not easily explained."

The Saviour says: "Seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness." Matt. 6: 33. And James declares that "Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widow, in their affliction, and keep himself unspotted from the world." But times have changed, and now we are told that the first duty of Christians is "municipal reform."

We are heartily in sympathy with the honest administration of civil government; but we have no sympathy with the idea that municipal reform is gospel work. The period of the Church's greatest moral power was when it was not only not supported by civil law, but it was persecuted by the powers of earth. By turning to the world for support, by making municipal reform the highest Christian duty, the Church simply confesses her dearth of spiritual power. The Saviour made no attempt to reform the municipal government of Jerusalem except by preaching the gospel to both rulers and people. The apostles nowhere engaged in municipal reform; and the modern preachers who are going after this phantom, are preaching another gospel, and not the gospel of Christ.

Human nature is the same to-day that it was 1,800 years ago, and it will continue the same until the end of time. There is but one consideration that appeals irresistibly to the masses, and that is self-interest. When municipal government becomes so corrupt that the rights of the people are trampled upon, and the burden of taxation becomes unnecessarily great, the people will inaugurate municipal reform by placing the authority in the hands of other officers; but this in nowise changes human nature, it remains the same, and in a few months or years at most, the municipality must be again reformed. It is impossible for humanity to elevate itself. The only thing that can elevate humanity is the gospel; hence the importance of using that means, not for the purpose of securing municipal reform, but to save men; and in saving them, they will be reformed; and just in proportion as the individuals which compose society are reformed, society itself will be reformed; hence the highest duty, and in fact the duty of the Christian, is to labor, not primarily for municipal reform, but for the salvation of his fellowmen.
