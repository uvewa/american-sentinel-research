The following dispatch from Salt Lake City appeared in some of the daily papers on the 14th inst.:

President Joseph F. Smith and George Q. Cannon, of the Mormon Church, at a secret meeting of the priesthood on last Monday [October 8], made some sensational remarks of a political character, and all party leaders in Salt Lake City to-day are talking about the attitude of the church towards political candidates who are Mormons. It is considered evident that the church intends to exercise all its power in politics, although the high priests have disclaimed any interference.

The remarks made by President Smith were to the effect that numerous men high in the councils of the church, and particularly Moses Thatcher and B. H. Roberts, candidates on the Democratic ticket for the Senate and Congress, had seen fit to accept nominations for political offices without first taking counsel with the president of the church. The procedure he characterized as contrary to the rules of the church, subversive of good discipline, and might tend to the detriment of the church.

George Q. Cannon endorsed Mr. Smith's remarks. The words of the church authorities are taken as a command that those who have gone into politics without the advice and consent of the church must retire from that field.

This declaration is viewed with great alarm by Gentiles, and the progressive young Mormons, who fear a return to the old conditions which prevailed when the Mormon Church authorities ruled with a rod of iron. Strong and bitter anti Statehood talk is being indulged in by those who hitherto have favored Statehood the most strongly.

Judge Powers, chairman of the Democratic State Committee, has called a meeting of the Committee for Monday with the avowed purpose of dissolving the Democratic party and forming an anti-Statehood party.

Powers is strongly supported by the Gentile Republicans and the progressive element of the Mormons, irrespective of party.

It is believed that a fight is on with the church, and if the latter does not recede absolutely from its position, the anti-Statehood movement will be at once inaugurated.

In a speech last night, J. L. Rawlins, nominee for the Senate and delegate in Congress, who secured the passage of the Statehood bill, criticized the action of the church authorities and expressed the belief that the people will not countenance such interference.

There can be no doubt that the Mormon Church has in the past controlled political matters in Utah. In fact, during the greater part of its history, the government of Utah was a man-made theocracy, ruled absolutely by the high priests of the Mormon Church; because it was impossible for any man to secure or to hold office without approval of the Mormon hierarchy. We do not wonder that the politicians of Utah are alarmed at the prospects of the perpetuation of this State of affairs. Our only wonder is that the people of the whole country are not equally stirred by the equally impertinent meddling on the part of other churches.

The Mormons are only doing in Utah what other churches have been doing for several years past in other parts of the country; and this Utah affair seems very like a tempest in a teapot besides the commotion that ought to be witnessed from ocean to ocean and from the Canadian line to the Mexican border.

It is the boast of the American Sabbath Union that the church can have anything from Congress that it demands,—and in short, that it holds Congress in its hands; and it is a well-known fact that legislation has been secured from Congress by threat of political boycott. Members of Congress have stated openly that they were compelled to act as they did in certain things, because if they did not, the churches would get together and knife them at the polls.

It is a strange thing that the evils of priestly domination are so clearly seen in Utah and scarcely discerned at all elsewhere. There is not a State in the Union in which to-day the churches are not exercising a greater influence in politics than the Mormons can hope to do in Utah; but no alarm is felt, no protest is entered, except in the case of this candidate for Statehood.
