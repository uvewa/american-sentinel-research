### MORE PRESS COMMENTS CONCERNING RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION.

Is This Religious Liberty?

[Farm and Stock Record, Del Rio, Texas, August 10.]

IN Tennessee the Seventh-day Adventists are being imprisoned for "violating" Sunday by work. These people very properly observe the seventh day of the week, Saturday, as commanded by our Lord, and work Sunday. Is this the religious liberty guaranteed us by the Constitution, or is it not rather the approaching tread of the dragon of Revelation to whom power is to be given for a season? It cannot be safely denied that the Seventh-day Adventists have the authority of Scripture for the observance of the seventh day, Saturday. "The Son of man is Lord also of the Sabbath." Mark 2:28. "But the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God." Ex. 2:10. "In vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men." Matt. 15:9. The sabbath of Constantine is not the Sabbath of our Lord.

No Excuse For It.

[Laramie (Wyo.) Times, July 27.]

DAYTON, Tenn., is now the scene of a travesty on justice worthy the Dark Ages. Nine honest, industrious men, all Seventh-day Adventists, save one, and he the son of a Seventh-day Adventist lady, a widow, were tried July 1 and 2, convicted, and in default of payment of fine and costs, amounting to nearly $40, were imprisoned in the county jail for terms ranging from seventy-five to ninety days.

Protestants are being persecuted by means of State enactments in several Roman Catholic countries of South America. They have demanded of the pope that these persecuting acts be repealed. The papal secretary of state answers in substance, that these statutes are "civil" enactments, not religious. We are sorry for these persecuted Protestants, and we denounce this "civil" excuse as a mere dodge. But is it less of an excuse than the one the Tennessee court can give for persecuting the poor men as above stated? Is it not about time that religious liberty will be insisted upon by the civilized world?
