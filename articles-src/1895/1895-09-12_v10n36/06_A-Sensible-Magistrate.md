## A SENSIBLE MAGISTRATE.

Fibre and Fabric, a Boston industrial journal, publishes the following:—

New York, JULY 28—Joseph Leibertz, who lives in a nest little cottage at No. 1020 Prospect Ave., was raking the flower beds in his front yard on Sunday afternoon when policeman McCarthy, of the Morrisania station, came along and told him he was violating the Sunday law and he must stop. Leibertz refused and was placed under arrest. He spent an hour in a cell before he was released on bail.

When he was arraigned in the Morrisania Court today and McCarthy had explained how industriously Leibertz was raking when he captured him, Magistrate Crane turned to the policeman and asked:

"Is that all the prisoner was doing?"

"Yes, sir," McCarthy replied.

"Do you consider that a crime?"

"It is a violation of the law," said McCarthy.

"The prisoner is discharged," said the magistrate, and turning to the policeman, he added: "Try and use a little better judgment the next time you come before me."

Had Joseph Leibertz been an Adventist, and had he lived in Tennessee, Maryland, or Georgia, he would not have escaped in any such way. An Adventist in Rhea County, Tenn., has only just been discharged from the chain-gang for lifting a wheelbarrow over a fence on Sunday.
