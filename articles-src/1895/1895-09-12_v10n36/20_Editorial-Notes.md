BY ANY ONE receiving the AMERICAN SENTINEL without having ordered it may know that it is sent to him by some friend. Therefore, those who have not ordered the SENTINEL need have no fears that they will be asked to pay for it.

THE Sunday law of New York City well illustrates the anomalous nature of Sunday laws in general. By its peculiar provisions it is a crime to sell ice one minute after 10 o'clock, A. M., on Sunday, but no crime to sell it one minute before 10; a crime to sell bakery goods after 1 o'clock, P. M., but all right to sell them before that hour; and a crime to sell any intoxicating liquors at any hour of that day, which it is no crime to sell on every other day. Cannot anyone see that such arbitrary distinctions have no foundation in reason? Such a law, so far from decreasing crime, becomes itself a manufacturer of it.

WE learn from the Christian Statesman that "a new society has been organized in Boston and incorporated under the laws of Massachusetts. It is called the 'Newspaper Sermon Association.' The articles of the association state that the corporation is constituted for the purpose of disseminating non-sectarian and non-doctrinal religious truths by the aid of Sunday newspapers, quickening among editors and publishers of Sunday newspapers a realization of their possibilities and responsibilities in the spiritual and moral development of their readers; lessening church antagonism and developing in the Christian church a greater willingness to use the newspapers as a power for Christianity."

THE Seventh-day Adventists, recently in the chain-gang in Rhea County, Tenn., have been released. They were not required by the authorities to work upon the Sabbath, but were required to work an additional number of days for the "privilege" of resting upon the Sabbath as required by the divine commandment. The officials were magnanimous(?) and did not exact the full pound of flesh; they "gave" them from one to three days each, because, as they said, the Adventists had been good hands, and had given them no trouble.

But the release of these men in no wise affects the question at issue; the fact remains that they were unjustly deprived of their liberty, and that the State of Tennessee still claims the right to impose upon them the observance of the so-called sabbath under penalty of further imprisonment.

We greet with pleasure the advent of a new journal into the field of the discussion of those themes which pertain to religious freedom. Such is the South African Sentinel, published at Cape Town, South Africa, monthly, by the International Tract Society. A parallel edition is published simultaneously in Dutch, under the name of De Wachter. It will treat all subjects from the standpoint of the gospel of Christ, and will thus uncompromisingly oppose every movement towards a union of Church and State. That there is an urgent call for it in South Africa, especially, is evident from the agitation that has recently sprung up there, and the steps that have already been taken, for a compulsory observance of Sunday. The world-wide extent of this evil movement demands that the voice of protest and of warning against it should also be world-wide. We wish our new contemporary the fullest success in its gospel mission.

THE law of God is spiritual. The Saviour, in his sermon on the mount, showed that the sixth and seventh commandments could be broken even by an evil desire. And the Sabbath commandment, like the others, requires more than a conformity in outward acts. It requires that we should not seek our own pleasure on the Sabbath day, or speak our own words, but should make it a day of spiritual delight. See Isa. 58:13, 14. And no one can do this without being spiritually-minded. Hence it is utterly impossible for any human sabbath law to help any person to keep the Sabbath; and all the legislation that might be passed on earth, though enforced as strictly as ever human law was enforced, could not save the nation from being a nation of Sabbath-breakers in the eye of God.

THE World, of August 26, had the two following items of news, which serve to illustrate the wickedness of the statute which makes an act, otherwise commendable, a crime, simply because it is done on Sunday:—

Of the Sunday-law arrests the most interesting was that of Thomas Coughlin, of No. 1763 Third Avenue. He was selling ice, and a policeman saw him sell five cents' worth to a girl from a tenement-house. There used to be an order that the selling ice was a work of necessity, but City Magistrate Simms, of the Harlem Police Court, held him for trial.

Another case was that of Cassel Goldman, clerk, in No. 17 Canal Street. He sold a policeman three cents' worth of writing paper. The place is a cigar shop as well as a stationery, and the policeman, whose memorable name is Grinnshaw, came in and said: "I want to write a letter. Won't you accommodate me with a piece of paper?" City Magistrate Deuel held Goldman for trial.

It is difficult to properly characterize these arrests. It is astonishing that officers would make arrests under such circumstances, and still more astonishing that a police magistrate would hold a man for trial, arrested for selling ice. Bad as the Sunday law of New York is, it permits works of necessity and charity, and defines necessity as being "whatever is necessary for the health, comfort, or well-being of the people." It is evident, however, that nothing is to be permitted to stand in the way of a rigid enforcement of the Sunday law.

The other case, while not having in it the same elements of barbarous cruelty, as in the circumstances attending the arrest of the ice-man, presents a sad commentary on the morals which are fostered by Sunday legislation. The sale of manufactured tobacco is legal in New York State on Sunday, therefore it was not a violation of the law for the clerk to sell cigars on that day, and it was doubtless for that purpose that the shop was open. The policeman who made the arrest, did not find the clerk selling other articles, nor did he induce him to violate the law simply by proposing to buy stationery from him, but professing that he wanted to write a letter, asks simply as an accommodation that he might be supplied with the necessary material; and for doing this favor the clerk was arrested. The first impulse is to blame the officer and to feel that society is unsafe in the guardianship of such men; but the fault is primarily with the "law" which makes an act otherwise commendable a crime because it is done upon Sunday. Sunday laws, instead of promoting morality, foster immorality.

THE State League of Republican Clubs, in session at Syracuse on the 5th inst., adopted the following relative to Sunday:—

We heartily commend the action of the police authorities of New York City in closing the saloons on Sunday, and note with pleasure that the liquor-dealers, in taking official action by which they promise to obey the law and assist in its enforcement, have shown more good sense and honesty than the newspapers and public men who have counseled against obedience to law and order by inveighing against public officials for doing their sworn duty. The question of open saloons on Sunday is not a political question, but is one the determination of which, will, to a large extent, measure the moral tone of the Empire State.

We believe in the American Sunday, and that the traditions of the Republican party favor the preservation of all those conditions and principles calculated to bring peace, prosperity and happiness to the masses of the people, and while this league still adheres to its constitutional provision against attempting to dictate nominations for public office, it will, at all times, reserve the right to speak plainly on any and all questions affecting the well-being of society and our fellow-citizens.

This action is significant, and shows that there is no probability of any change in the Sunday statutes of this State.

THE plea that the imprisonment of men under the Sunday statutes of the various States is not religious persecution because "Sunday laws are civil enactments," can be honestly made only by those ignorant of history. With the exception of isolated cases of individual and mob violence, no martyr ever suffered except for violation of civil law. Of the Puritan regime in Massachusetts, Bancroft says: "Since a particular form of worship had become a part of the civil establishment, irreligion was a civil offense."

Very much of the intolerance of the Puritans was "justified" on civil grounds. Of the banishment of certain offenders from the territory of Massachusetts, Bancroft says:—

The government feared, or pretended to fear, a disturbance of the public peace. . . . The triumph of the clergy being complete, the civil magistrates proceeded to pass sentence on the most resolute offenders. Wheelwright, Anne Hutchinson and Aspinwall were exiled from the territory of Massachusetts.*

Religious intolerance has always masqueraded as the conservator of civil order.
