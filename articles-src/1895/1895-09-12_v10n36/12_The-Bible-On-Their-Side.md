### "The Bible On Their Side."

[Pennsylvania Grist, Williamsport, August 11.]

IN America the State has nothing to do with the religious observance of any day. Lately, in Maryland, certain zealous people have secured the prosecution of the Seventh-day Adventists because they choose to work upon the first day of the week. It is not charged that these seventh-day Christians are not good citizens; that they do not live upright lives. They are prosecuted because the law of Maryland prohibits all secular occupations except works of necessity or charity on a certain day. Clearly the law is unjust to the Adventists. They have the Bible on their side.

Father Enright, a Roman Catholic priest at Harlan, Iowa, says: "I have repeatedly offered $1,000 to any one who will furnish any proof from the Bible that Sunday is the day we are bound to keep. It was the Holy Catholic Church that changed the day of rest from Saturday to Sunday, the first day of the week." It was a Romish council that anathematized those who kept the seventh day, Saturday. Well may the priest ask: "What right have Protestant churches to observe Sunday?" So the whole religious world goes back on the Bible and obeys the Romish Church in the observance of the first day of the week, and all the legislative bodies of Christendom are sadly in fault in providing penalties for those who believe in and follow the Bible in respect to the Sabbath.
