A Relic of Witch-Burning Days.

[New Era, Hopkinsville, Ky., July 19.]

THIS [Sunday law] is a relic of the witch-burning days of the New England Puritans.* The law in force in regard to the observance of the first day of the week was so strict that it forbade a man to kiss his wife or children on that day, and forbade making up beds, sweeping, shaving, chewing or smoking tobacco, or engaging in anything except "going decorously to and from the meeting-house." Persons violating these Sunday laws were fined pretty heavily and put in the public stocks—a painful and disgraceful punishment.

The Seventh-day Adventists keep Saturday, the seventh day of the week, holy, and do no work of any kind, but spend the day attending religious services at their churches and homes. They work on Sunday, the first day of the week, and get severely punished by the antiquated puritanical and tyrannical laws of Tennessee. Such laws should no longer disgrace the statute books of our sister State.

*This is a mistake. "Witches" were hanged but never burned in New England.—Ed. SENTINEL.
