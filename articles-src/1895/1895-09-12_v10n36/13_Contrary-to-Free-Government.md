Contrary to Free Government.

[Globe, Council Bluffs, Iowa., July 26.]

THE STATE has no right to say to the citizen which day he shall observe as the Sabbath. If the State should go so far in asserting control as to determine the day of worship, it could hardly do otherwise than appoint the seventh day, as the highest authority on religion is the Bible, and the Bible says that "the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God." Therefore, if the State or society be inclined to exercise authority to this extent, it can appoint no other than the seventh day without violating one of the ten injunctions of the Decalogue. . . . Such legislation is contrary to the spirit and letter of the Federal Constitution, and is clearly hostile to the principles of free government.
