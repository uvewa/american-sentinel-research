Sectarian Bigotry.

[Independent, Madison, S. D., July 26.]

It is time that the American people were paying some attention to the question of religious liberty. Think of it, in one State of this Union men are imprisoned for doing what Congress has frequently done—breaking the sabbath day. It is fortunate for our national law-makers that Washington is not in Tennessee. If a class of American citizens believe that the seventh day should be observed as the holy Sabbath day, they have the right to observe that day. No religion can flourish on the American soil that silences the conscience of men and enforces its dogma by court decrees. We want no sectarian bigotry in this country. It is unchristian, and it is a menace to American liberty.
