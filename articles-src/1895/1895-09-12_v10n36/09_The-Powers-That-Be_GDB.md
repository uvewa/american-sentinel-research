# THE POWERS THAT BE.

## BY G. D. BALLOU.

"The powers that be are ordained of God," Rom. 13:1 So are the marriage and family relationships. But when God ordained the marriage relation he did not ordain that the husband should horsewhip his wife or lock her up in a garret. In other words, God ordains marriage, but he does not ordain the abuses of that relationship.

God ordains the civil power to act in civil matters, but when the civil powers stop out of their ordained sphere, God does not ordain the abuses which follow. The husband may not whip his wife because she does not respect his religion. The man who did it would be branded a tyrant. The State may not rightfully punish the man who fails to respect the religion of the majority, unless that want of respect amounts to a disturbance such as would be a civil offense, under the same circumstances, against any other society than the church. The right of the State to enforce a Sunday law no more exists in the State authority than in that of the individual. The individual has no control over the time of his fellow-man. It is none of his business how his fellow employs his time so long as he does not thereby injure his fellows. The authority of the State in such matters is no greater than the authority of the individual. Because the individual authority is simply 0. Now add a thousand, yes, ten thousand, yes, seventy million 0's, and what do you have? Simply 0. Then where is the right of the State to command a time rest? Such command is an abuse of civil authority—a usurpation.

Now while God ordained the civil power, he never ordained the abuse of that power. His people have ever been justified in trampling such abuses under foot. Refer to Daniel 3. Note the case of the Hebrew worthies. They were not forbidden to worship the God of heaven. They must only fall down and worship the golden image which the king had set up. The outward act only was all that the decree controlled. They might have fallen down in that crowd and prayed to the God of heaven, but to their fellow-men they would have conveyed a false impression, and they saw in it a denial of Jehovah. So they said: "We are not careful to answer thee in this matter. . . . We will not serve thy gods nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up." Dan. 3:16-18. And when they went into the fiery furnace, one "like the Son of God" went in with them. Thus the king's abuse of civil authority was rebuked.

In Daniel 6, is recorded a similar case. A law was framed to entrap Daniel if he should ask any petition of any king, lord or ruler save of Darius, for thirty days. He might have turned his face into the corner and in subdued tones offered up his petition to God, but, no; that would have been surrendering a right which sacredly belonged to him, a right to pray with his face toward Jerusalem, with his windows open, in audible tones. Had he heeded this unrightuous civil law it would have been to surrender his God-given right to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience. He might for thirty days have prayed silently in secret. But God justified him in openly trampling under foot this abuse of civil power, by sending his angel into the den of lions with Daniel.

In the fourth chapter of Acts we have another instance. The Jewish Sanhedrim commanded Peter and John not to speak at all nor teach in the name of the Lord Jesus. Their answer was: "Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye. For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard." Verse 18. In the fifth chapter they are arraigned for not heeding this abuse of authority. In verse 29, the eternal principle of God's superior authority when there is a conflict between "the powers that be" and God, is recognized,—"We ought to obey God rather than men." And the events which followed show how God again vindicated those who recognized his authority when the civil power had overstepped its bounds and was interfering with matters which belonged to God.

Now, candid reader, down here in the last days of the nineteenth century, shall we unquestioningly bow to an abuse of civil authority which in principle is in every way parallel with those we have cited? Shall we give our example on the side of enforcing rest on a religious day contrary to the plain letter of God's Word and the natural rights of man? God's Word says "the seventh day is the Sabbath, . . . in it thou shalt not do any work." Cæsar says, rest from all your work on Sunday. What shall we do? If we belong to that class in which the prophets and apostles were found shall we not trample this usurpation of authority in the dust?

The powers that be have not yet ceased meddling with things which belong only to the spiritual realm. Shall we justify them by rendering our allegiance to them, or condemn them by obeying God? Shall we obey the other strong injunction (1 Peter 2:13), Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake in this case by keeping the obligation of the Sunday law, or shall we violate the wicked obligation and calmly submit to the penalty? Is not the latter the way the Hebrew worthies did? What better precedents could we have? And will not the great God, Creator of heaven and earth, vindicate the cause of his loyal subjects who from pure principle stand out boldly against all tyranny, whether in the home, in the church, or in the State? Shall not we believe in him and trust that he will?

Baltimore, Md., Sept. 1, 1895.
