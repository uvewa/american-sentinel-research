### "THOU SHALT NOT WORK." — "SUNDAY LAWS"—"SUPERIOR'S BLUE LAWS."

BY H. F. PHELPS.

The above are the titles of a news item from West Superior, Wis., as appears in the morning papers of the 28th of August.

It appears that the Law and Order League of that city made threats that the Sunday laws shall be enforced as interpreted by the ancient blue laws, and they are now giving proof that they intend to be as good as their word. C. R. Fridley is the attorney of the league, and complaints have been made against ten different parties, representing the candy, tobacco, news, fruit, boating, drugs and street-car traffic. In stating the object of the league, Judge Fridley said that—

It is a mistake to suppose that the Law and Order League is made up entirely of liquor dealers. They are and will be the most active in carrying out the purposes of the league, because they are the most interested; but persons of other kinds of business and in the professions are members of the organization and in sympathy with its purposes. The intention of the league is to do just what it claims—to prosecute all offenses against the Sunday laws until everything is closed up or else everything is open on Sunday. The purpose is not to get the authorities to compromise with the saloon men or to run the town, but it is to get an expression of public sentiment on the question of the enforcement of the blue laws which will be decisive. All offenders against the Sunday laws will be promptly, vigorously and persistently prosecuted until this question is settled. A test case will be made as to the right of the street-car company to operate its road on Sunday, and if we are successful, there will be no more street-cars desecrating the sabbath with their diabolical noise.

Here, then, is another element by which the man-made sabbath will be exalted before the world, and by which men will be compelled to worship the beast and his image and to receive the mark of his name. Of course, no one can definitely predict as to the outcome of this particular movement; but without doubt it will be a compromise. No doubt the ultimate object is to secure a repeal of the Sunday laws. It will give the enemies of the true Sabbath another opportunity to class those who will stand for the principle of obedience to God's written word and in defense of the inalienable rights of all men, with the saloon element, as stated by a recent writer, "Those who honor the Bible Sabbath will be denounced as enemies of law and order, as breaking down the moral restraints of society, causing anarchy and corruption, and calling down the judgments of God upon the earth."

Their conscientious scruples will be pronounced obstinacy, stubbornness, and contempt of authority. They will be accused of disaffection toward the government. A false coloring will be given to their words; the worst possible construction will be put upon their motives."

Such a crisis is before us.
