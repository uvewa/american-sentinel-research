A Travesty on Justice.

[Dotham (Mass.) Transcript, July 27.]

Is America the land of the free? Can men worship God in the United States as their consciences dictate? These are questions all should ponder deeply, and they are asked because of a travesty on justice that this month happened in Dayton, Tenn. Eight Seventh-day Adventists, all honest, honorable and industrious men, have been tried and condemned to serve terms of from seventy-five to ninety days in Dayton's jail and made to work in its chain-gang for the offense of working on what is in law styled the Lord's day, although their labor disturbed no person's private or public devotion. . . . Because of their religious belief, they are now, in this boasted age of civilization, undergoing the punishment that is meted out to the meanest of malefactors. They are criminals, yet not criminals, because they have been faithful to the religious principles in which they firmly and honestly believe. Their punishment savors, not of the enlightened days of the nineteenth century, but rather of the Dark Ages. Small wonder it is that the secular and religious press of our country is denouncing the un-American act of intolerance that has been done in the name of justice.
