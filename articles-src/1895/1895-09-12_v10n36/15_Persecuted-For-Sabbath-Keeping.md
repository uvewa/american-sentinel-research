Persecuted For Sabbath-Keeping.

[Ohio Soldier (Chillicothe), July 27.]

IT is evident to any unprejudiced person who will note the facts in the case, that the trouble is not that these people work on the first day of the week, but that they do not work on the seventh day; for the principal complainant was compelled, on the witness stand, to acknowledge that he was at work—going to borrow a plow—when he saw these Adventists at work.

It is also a fact that a number of furnaces in the county run the same on Sunday as any other day, and the jail in which these men are confined is shook twenty times a day each Sunday by the passage of that number of trains, while a switching engine and crew are working all day long in easy hearing distance. . . .

The writer is far from being an Adventist, but he hopes that these prisoners may have the courage and fortitude to stay in the Rhea County jail until they rot, rather than surrender one hair's breadth of their religious freedom.

It is to be noted that Rhea County is inviting immigration. We would as soon think of moving to Armenia.
