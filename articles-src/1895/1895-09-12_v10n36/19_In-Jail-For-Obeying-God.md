In Jail For Obeying God.

[Flora (Ill.) Democrat, July 25.]

Doesn't it sound like a voice from the Dark Ages to hear it said that in Dayton, Tenn., eight Christians are in jail for exercising liberty of conscience and obeying in spirit and in letter the commandment that says, "Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy"? Eight Baptists, of the order of Adventists,—honest, industrious, and above reproach, men of religious fervor, of the same material of which martyrs are made, were arrested, dragged into court, tried and found guilty of obeying that commandment of God—"Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy: Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work; but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work," and actually disobeying the laws of Tennessee by working, as God did, on the first six days of the week. . . .

These men are no doubt now working with shackles upon their limbs upon the streets in Dayton, Tenn. They refused to pay the unjust fine, as they labored the first six days of the week and rested on the seventh, and claimed the constitutional right of the American citizens in the exercise of good conscience and religious liberty under the broad Constitution of the Nation, and yet the American flag, "Old Glory," waves proudly over these eight Christians in chains who refused to disobey their God and our own God, or have their consciences violated by the heathen laws of the State.
