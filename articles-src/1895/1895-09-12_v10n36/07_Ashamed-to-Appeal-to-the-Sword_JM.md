## ASHAMED TO APPEAL TO THE SWORD.

BY J. MCAVOY.

"For I was ashamed to require a band of soldiers and horsemen to help up against the enemy in the way: because we had spoken unto the king, saying, The hand of our God is upon all them for good that seek him; but his power and his wrath is against all them that forsake him." Ezra 8:22.

Every servant of God ought to be ashamed to appeal to the State for force to help forward God's work, for doing so reveals a lack of faith in God. But the Christian Endeavor Society and the Young Men's Christian Association, whose motto is, "Scotland for Christ," and who seem to consider enforced idleness on Sunday the scene of perfection in Christian reform, are not ashamed to appeal to the secular power. Nor are they ashamed to hunt through the statute books of the Dark Ages in search of laws to enforce the Sunday dogma; thus they are going to the origin of this relic of paganism and picking up its old crutches by which it came among us.

The name and character of these laws reveal their origin and purpose. The usual title is, "An act for the better observance of the Lord's day." But the Lord's day is a "holy day" and to be "kept holy," therefore a law for the better observance of it must enter the heart of each one and make him more holy. And as human laws are powerless to do this, they are therefore powerless to make any one keep the Lord's day better; so their title is deceptive. Sadly ignorant of the nature of the Lord's day must the man be, who talks of a law, the only power back of which is the carnal sword, making men keep it.

The fact that there are twenty-four of these laws on the English statute books, and an increasing demand for more, is proof of their worthlessness. One after another is passed so that the existing ones can be enforced, just as men make resolutions and break them and then make more resolutions binding themselves to keep the first ones.

But these laws are not only false and worthless, they are wicked, because they imply that idleness is Sabbath-keeping, or that an outward compliance for fear of punishment, is obeying God; thus putting a premium on hypocrisy. But worthless and wicked as they undoubtedly are, the world-wide mania for their enforcement is lauded by many as Christian zeal.

I attended a meeting of a society recently at which the work of Dr. Parkhurst in America was highly praised and considered worthy of emulation. This society has laid a petition before the local authorities declaring ice-cream shops open on Sunday to be "a violation of the ancient and divinely instituted sanctity of the Sabbath," and calling on the officers to use their power to close them. Well might those men be ashamed to stand with their Bibles in their hands and talk of an old law of the Dark Ages enabling them to stop irreligious Italian ice-cream vendors from violating the divine sanctity of the Sabbath.

Talk of the Dark Ages when men's bodies were tortured for the good of their souls! but if men in an age of light, and with the Bible, the source of light, in their hands, return to theories of the Dark Ages, are they not ten times more culpable than the inquisitors of old? Nevertheless the horizon is dark with storm clouds. Persecution is brewing. Loss of property, imprisonment, and the chain-gang are only faint mutterings of the coming storm.

But whither shall we flee, since the virgin of liberty is run to earth in her last retreat by the bloodhounds of error, bigotry, and persecution? The old song of "The land of the free and the home of the brave," which inspired hope and courage in the heaving breasts of our oppressed forefathers, must fall as ironical mockery on the ears of him who is one of a convict squad because he regarded the majesty of God's law above the majesty of American law.

Can he who is wrested from a happy home and tender offspring and driven with common criminals because he dared to obey God and his own conscience, sing,

Time's noblest offspring is the last?

Noble offspring, indeed. But alas! with foster parents dead, the victim of bad guardians.

Two men once lived in this world; one called Cain and the other Abel. They were both religious, but Cain instituted his own ceremony and Abel accepted God's. This displeased Cain, who was the elder, the majority, as it were; he "talked with Abel," and as Abel was fully decided to obey God rather than Cain, not being able to obey both, Cain killed him. "And wherefore slew he him? Because his own works were evil and his brother's righteous." But God was not pleased with Cain, and he is the same God still; and God's institution or man's institution, the issue between Cain and Abel, is the burning issue of the present day.

Storm clouds may rise to obscure the "Sun of righteousness," but to them who fear God rather than men, will be "ariss with healing in his wings."

Maybole, Scotland.
