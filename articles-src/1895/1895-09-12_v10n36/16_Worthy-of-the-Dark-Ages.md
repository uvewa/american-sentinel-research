Worthy of the Dark Ages.

[Dubuque (Iowa) Trade Journal.]

THE AMERICAN SENTINEL, New York, informs the world that "eight honest, conscientious Seventh-day Adventists of Rhea County, Tenn., have been condemned to serve terms of from seventy-five to ninety days in the county jail at Dayton, Tenn., for doing common labor on Sunday—labor which disturbed no other person's private or public devotion. It has also been decided to work these honest men in the chain-gang." This is religious persecution and intolerance more worthy of the Dark Ages than the United States in the nineteenth century.
