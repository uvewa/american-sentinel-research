# THE "WORLD'S" TOLERANCE AND LOGIC.

## BY EUGENE LELAND.

The Toronto World appears to be the self-constituted champion of the separation of Church and State in the Dominion of Canada, and one would very naturally expect to find it very logical in argument and very liberal toward dissenters. Its position is thus stated in its issue of August 7:—

We believe in the absolute separation of Church and State, and we intend to how to this line, and let the chips fall where they may.

Good! But should some of the "chips" hit the World, will it defend itself against them, or will it still maintain the offensive? Let us see. In the same paper, speaking on the Sunday question, it says:—

When Methodist and Presbyterian clergymen combine to incorporate a religious enactment in the statute respecting Sunday observance, we oppose them, and will oppose them till the objectionable features are removed.

From this and other statements which might be referred to, one might expect to find in the World an everlasting enemy to the enforcement of Sunday laws upon dissenters; but not so. In that paper of August 5, appeared the following:—

But whether men are inclined to worship on a sacred day or not, the law steps in and forbids them from working one day in the week. This is a good law.

Further on in the same paper it says:—

The civil law is therefore right in selecting Sunday as the day of rest, and with a few exceptions, in making it apply to all alike.

Surely this valiant champion of separation of Church and State should be able to hold to a position at least two days together; but possibly the World makes a distinction between the sacred Sabbath of the Christians and the civil rest-day of the government. If that is the case, will the World please to explain why it considers it to be fitting that the government should have decided on Sunday "as the day of rest," simply because "a large majority of Christians regard that day as the sabbath"? If that is not a union of Church and State, will the World please to tell just what would be? Will the World kindly tell us further, why the government should decide to enforce a weekly day of rest at all, aside from the religious reason?

If the World regards Sunday merely as a civil day, why should its observance be made compulsory? Are people required to close their places of business on a civic holiday, the Queen's birthday, or in the States on the Fourth of July? No, sir, my friend. People are not fined from one dollar to four hundred dollars for engaging in civil labor on other civil holidays as they are for doing the same thing on your "civil" Sunday. It is the religious character of the day that determines how the civil law shall operate; and it is a union of Church and State.

To show how logically consistent the World is on another point, I quote again from the editorial of August 7:—

So, too, when the clergymen of Ontario go to the government and ask to have their taxes remitted because they are Christians, we oppose them, and we will keep on opposing them.

Compare this statement with the one quoted above:—

As a large majority of Christians regard Sunday as the Sabbath, it is fitting that the government should have decided on that day as the day of cessation from work, the rest-day.

Why is it not just as "fitting" for the government to grant exemption from taxation, because the church demands it, as it is to decide that Sunday shall be a day of rest because the church demands it? Has not the church as much right to demand the people's money without rendering an equivalent, as it has to demand their time without equivalent? If not, why not?

June 28, the World published an editorial on the Sunday question, using some very expressive language concerning those who advocate Sunday laws, and at the same time defending a man who had been arrested for working on Sunday. But on August 5, the World says of this same man:—

We cannot jeopardize a most wholesome law by permitting the Jews and Seventh-day Adventists to keep their stores open and do business on Sunday.

Passing by the intolerance of this statement let us notice the argument. It is the very same that is used by "Methodist and Presbyterian clergymen" against Sunday cars. Here is the argument:—

We cannot jeopardize a most wholesome law by permitting the World to have Sunday cars.

Will the World gracefully swallow its own medicine, or will it continue to accuse the "large majority of Christians" of bigotry and intolerance while using the same arguments itself? Possibly the World claims a monopoly in bigotry and intolerance! It would not do, you know, to jeopardize a most wholesome law by permitting Jews and Seventh-day Adventists to commit the awful crime of engaging in quiet, civil employment on a civil day! No, no! It would—see—what would it do? Oh, it would injure their health! That's it!

Wonderfully interested in the health of these people, are our valiant civil sabbath reformers! And in the health of their families! Yes, their families! So much so that if any of them should happen to be detected in doing civil work on a civil Sunday, why, work them in the chain-gang as they did recently in Tennessee. Shut them up in jail as they have one of them shut up in Chatham at the present time, until they and their families have learned that it is injurious to work on Sunday! Yes, quite so!

Let the World come out squarely and acknowledge that all Sunday laws are religious laws, and oppose them as such, or cease to pose as the champion of "absolute separation of Church and State." "How to the line, and let the chips fall where they may."
