"The pretense that all law must be rigorously enforced because it is law is refuted," says the World, "by a hundred dead-bitter statutes, and condemned by the French philosopher in the saying that 'of all sorts of tyranny the forcing of the letter of the law against the equity is the most insupportable.'"

"The powers that be are ordained of God," but they are ordained to administer justice, not to decree injustice. There is, as every man knows, a limit to civil power.
