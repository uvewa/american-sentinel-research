## OBSOLETE SUNDAY LAWS.

[The Havre de Grace (Md.) Republican, August 17.]

THERE is just now a spasmodic effort, in various sections of the country, to revive and enforce the old, antiquated and obsolete Sunday laws. As public sentiment had relegated these old, puritanic blue laws to the shades of oblivion, the attempt to enforce them at this late day, provokes resistance and conflict. The decisions of the magistrates and courts before whom cases of violation of the law are made, are varied and conflicting as to what, in their judgment, constitute works of necessity. The only way to avoid these bitter and costly judicial conflicts is to abide strictly by the Constitution of the United States.

We take the ground, which we think cannot be successfully controverted, namely, that all Sunday laws violate the letter and spirit of the Constitution.

The Constitution is a civil compact, and wholly secular. While guaranteeing religious freedom to all, it does not enjoin, but prohibits religious tests of any kind.

Sunday observance is a religious requirement of the varied religious sects, though they differ greatly as to the day and the manner of keeping it—which non-sectarians are in no wise bound to observe.

The State has no right to meddle in the matter of the religious faith of the citizen. If it did it might, with equal propriety, require the observance of baptism or any credal article of faith.

This is not a Christian or religious, but a civil government of the whole people, administered for the material interests of the Christian, Jew and unbelieving citizen.

The State has no right to supervene or meddle with the spiritual belief of the citizen; that should be left to the individual conscience. Such interference is, and always has been, destructive of personal liberty.

History gives voluminous and emphatic testimony that mixing politics and religion, the uniting of Church and State, and all attempts of civil government to regulate the spiritual affairs and beliefs of the people, have engendered the most bitter animosities, caused the most foodish atrocities, and drenched old mother earth with the best blood of the race.
