**Liberty Only For the Majority.**

[From the Centralia (Wis.) Enterprise, July 27.]

For over a century Americans have been prating about liberty. Ever since that memorable Fourth of July, 1776, their one theme has been liberty.

My country 'tis of thee,
Sweet land of liberty,

has been the burden of their song since then. Many Americans have prated about liberty so long and so incessantly, that their intelligence and their conscience have become ossified. Their notions about liberty are the narrow and perverted. Liberty to them means the liberty of the majority.

July 3, on the eve of the nation's anniversary of independence, there were sentenced at Dayton, Rhea County, Tenn., eight innocent men to a ninety days' term in the county jail at hard labor. This means that they will be worked in the chain-gang along with felons of every shade and depth of crime. The Enterprise said "innocent men." They were innocent—innocent of any wrong doing. But they did not agree with the majority. That was all the crime they were guilty of. The majority observed the first day of the week by abstaining from work; these condemned men observed the seventh day. That was all. But the majority have enacted a law which makes it compulsory to observe the first day of the week. That is their idea of liberty. The minority, a handful of Seventh-day Adventists, observed their Sabbath and went about their work the next day, the day set by the majority for abstaining from work. The work these men did was quiet, unobtrusive; yet the majority evidently thought their liberties and social good order endangered, and eight innocent men were sent to the chain-gang. This is an instance of American liberty of speech and conscience. This is American justice.

Justice—what a stupid farce it becomes when an ignorant, fanatic majority can thus send snuffending men to the chain-gang for going about their work on Sunday. People guilty of enacting and enforcing such barbarous laws have no conception of true liberty.
