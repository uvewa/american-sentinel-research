## BOOK NOTICE.

One of the most interesting and valuable little books recently given to the public, is "Life Only in Christ, or Immortality Not a Birthright, but a Gift from God," by Eld. Wolcott H. Littlejohn.

Speaking of this book, W. McLane, Ph. D., D. D., of New Haven, Conn., well says that the author "has rendered very valuable service to the truth in his book." "His clear, forcible, comprehensive and scriptural argument for conditional immortality should command the attention and win the consent of the truth-loving mind."

The chapter on Dives and Lazarus commends itself specially to the writer of this notice, since it is substantially the same view that he has entertained for about fifteen years, namely, that the parable is an argumentum ad hominum (an argument to the man). This chapter alone is amply worth the price of the book and should be read by everybody. The book contains 179 pages, is neatly bound in cloth, and will be mailed, post paid, to any address in the Universal Postal Union on receipt of 65 cents for the plain-edged, and 75 cents for guilt edges.
