## MORE TENNESSEE INJUSTICE.

AUGUST 15, the authorities of Rhea County, Tenn., notified the Seventh-day Adventists whom they have been driving in the chain-gang for nearly two months, that they will be required to make up the time which they have "lost" by keeping the Sabbath. Thus these men are being punished directly for obeying the fourth commandment.

The constitution of Tennessee provides that "no man shall in time of peace be required to perform any service to the public on any day set apart by his religion as a day of rest;" but this constitutional guarantee is being deliberately violated by the authorities of Rhea County, who are punishing men for not working on a day set apart by their religion as a day of rest.
