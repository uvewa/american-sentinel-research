**Should Be Promptly Repealed.**

[From the Indicator, Pueblo, Col., July 27.]

It seems impossible that in this day and age, just at the close of this enlightened century with the facts of a dark past to serve as beacon lights, that religious persecution should be practiced in any part of the Union, and yet the information comes from Tennessee to the effect that eight Christian men have been imprisoned for working on Sunday. They are Adventists, or seventh-day observers, and according to the teaching of their church, they worshiped on Saturday and labored on Sunday if they chose. Because these men worked on Sunday, therefore, they were arrested, tried, convicted and imprisoned. This was early in July, and the chances are that they are now doing service in the chain-gang like common culprits. It is no excuse to say that the laws of the State provide for such cases. Such a law is a libel on the fair name of Tennessee, and an outrage on our boasted freedom. There is no more room in this country for miserable religious persecution and intolerance, and all such laws in conflict with the spirit of the Constitution which guarantees the right of every citizen to worship as his conscience directs, should be repealed promptly, and thus a disgrace wiped from the statute books.
