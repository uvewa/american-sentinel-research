## The Persecution of Mr. Allison.

[From the Nashua (N. H.) Telegraph, June 15, 1895.]

The State of Georgia has a Sunday law that is calculated to make angels weep and bigots rejoice. Under its drastic provisions, one J. Q. Allison, of Douglasville, has been meanly prosecuted and unjustly sentenced to pay the sum of $22.05 or serve twelve months in the chain-gang. What was Mr. Allison's crime? Nothing more than to have plowed up a garden spot on his own land on a Sunday. The work was performed quietly in a spot which could not be seen from the highway, or the homes of his neighbors. Therefore he disturbed no one. . . . Mr. Allison is a Seventh-day Adventist, who has conscientious scruples against working on Saturday, the Sabbath, and hence follows his regular occupation on the other days of the week, sometimes quietly performing labor on Sunday.

But while Mr. Allison religiously keeps the real Sabbath, he is prosecuted by some mean individual or official for the so-called misdemeanor of "Sabbath-breaking," which means in this case "Sunday-breaking." Mr. Allison conducted his own defense, denying nothing save that Sunday is the Sabbath and that he disturbed his neighbors in performing his work. For that matter, his neighbors who testified did not claim to have been disturbed.

On the contrary, they testified that Mr. Allison was a good man, and that there was nothing in the world against him. It is not every keeper of Sunday who could get as good a title as this from his neighbors.

But it seems that some one learned that Mr. Allison did work on Sunday, collected evidence of that fact, and had him summoned into court for violation of the State law. In our opinion, this was a despicable action which should have been rebuked by the court by the complete acquittal of the defendant. But Mr. Allison was declared guilty, and the judge administered a sentence which in the default of the payment of money was of the most rigorous character. The Judge disclaimed religious persecution, but said that the laws of the State must be enforced. We wonder what this judge would do with a gang of lynchers or ballot-box stuffers.

The best thing Georgia can do is to reform her Sunday laws and catch and convict her real criminals. The unchristian treatment of Mr. Allison deserves the contempt of mankind.
