## Specific Uncertainties

### Page 2, Line 113-115
- **Issue:** Footnote reference marks and attribution unclear in OCR
- **Transcribed as:** Footnote appears to reference "Given at Rome, June 28th, 1816..." with citations to Wylie
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM
- **Reason:** The footnote markers and exact formatting of source citations were unclear in OCR but content is readable

### Page 3, Line 125
- **Issue:** Possible OCR error in "Exe. 46:1"
- **Transcribed as:** "Exe. 46:1"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM
- **Reason:** Likely means "Ezek. 46:1" (Ezekiel) but OCR shows "Exe." - kept as OCR shows it

### Page 3, Line 129
- **Issue:** Unusual word "chargelet"
- **Transcribed as:** "chargelet"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM
- **Reason:** Archaic or unusual form; context suggests "charged" but kept as OCR shows

### Page 5, Line 324
- **Issue:** Possible OCR error "foodish"
- **Transcribed as:** "foodish"
- **Confidence:** LOW
- **Reason:** Likely should be "foolish" based on context, but kept as OCR shows

### Page 7, Line 407
- **Issue:** Word "snuffending" appears unusual
- **Transcribed as:** "snuffending"

- **Reason:** Likely OCR error for "inoffending" or "unoffending" based on context

### Page 7, Line 501-502
- **Issue:** Author names "Reva, F. N. and M. A. PeLCUBET" have unusual formatting
- **Transcribed as:** "Reva, F. N. and M. A. PeLCUBET"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM
- **Reason:** Likely "Revs. F. N. and M. A. Peloubet" but kept as OCR shows

- **O. W. Pearson** - Letter signed at bottom
