NEW YORK, AUGUST 29, 1895.

Any one receiving the AMERICAN SENTINEL without having ordered it may know that it is sent to him by some friend. Therefore, those who have not ordered the SENTINEL need have no fears that they will be asked to pay for it.

READ the letter on page 270, under the heading, "Religious Persecution in Illinois."

Extra copies of the illustrated SENTINEL, of August 15, can still be furnished at the usual price, $1 per hundred, or $8 per thousand. It is a number of exceptional value, and ought to have a much wider circulation than has yet been given it.

NUMBER 35 of the SENTINEL, dated September 5, will contain an illustrated article on Southern chain-gangs and their relation to religious persecution. This article, besides being illustrated, will give the writer's personal observations in Atlanta, besides much other valuable and reliable information. We will also republish in this number, by request, the illustrated article, "In the Chain-gang Under the Flag," which appeared in the SENTINEL of August 1. This paper will be furnished at the usual price, $1 per hundred or $8 per thousand. It will also be furnished in any quantity on the terms offered on the preceding page.

Mrs. J. C. BATEHAM, Superintendent of the Sabbath Observance Department of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, has an article in the *Christina Statesman*, of August 3, in which she protests mildly against the persecution of Seventh-day Adventists in Tennessee, and says:—

A clause providing exemption for those who conscientiously observe Saturday instead of Sunday, and are careful not to disturb the rest of others, should always be inserted even if those provisions may occasionally be abused. Courtney and the Golden Rule require that even at partial expense of uniformity the consciences of the minority should be protected.

This statement does credit to Mrs. Bateham's heart. It is perhaps all that could be expected of one in her position. It does seem that almost everyone ought to be able to see that all Sunday legislation is improper, and that all Sunday-law enforcement savors of religious persecution. Mrs. Bateham can see this in the case of the enforcement of the so-called law against Adventists in Tennessee. She says, "It savors of religious persecution, which, looked at on the lowest plain, is thoroughly impolitic since making martyrs for conscience always increases the following, and nothing more prejudices the onlooker than appearance of lack of fair play."

This is indeed looking at the matter from the "lowest plain." But we do not attribute this motive to the lady in question; we believe that it is her innate sense of justice that leads her to protest against persecution. Having seen and admitted so much, may she be enabled to see more.

THE SASBOTH RECORDER thinks our strictures of August 1, unjust, and complains that we quoted only a part of what it said. We can only say that we had no intention to be unfair; nor do we think that we did our contemporary any injustice, though our criticism was probably unnecessarily caustic. This latter we regret. We still think, however, that one unacquainted with the facts in the case, could get no other impression from the Recorder's note than that some, at least, of the persecuted Seventh-day Adventists had been unnecessarily offensive to their neighbors, and had thus needlessly brought trouble upon themselves. This we deny in toto, and base our denial not upon the unsupported assertion of the Adventists themselves, but upon the sworn testimony of the State's witnesses in the several cases. We are sure that in not a single one of the scores of cases tried during the past ten years in several different States, has there been any evidence of aggravation. The annoyance charged has all been of the kind that is begotten of bigotry and intolerance, and is born of an unwillingness on the part of the persecutors to award to others equal rights with themselves.
