## THE FIRST DUTY OF CITIZENS.

The first duty of every citizen of whatever country is to do right.

The duty of a citizen to the State which owns his citizenship is not determined in all things by the laws of that State. The authority of the State is not paramount. Only one authority is paramount, and that is the voice which is the quickener of conscience. Otherwise the office of conscience would be superfluous.

No individual can, in the same matter, as some people seem to think, owe one duty to God and another duty to the State. There can be but one duty for one time and one way for its accomplishment. And that way is the way of justice.

The first question to be considered is not, What says the State? but, What is right? And in doing what is right, the individual discharges his duty to the State.

The State can have no better citizens than those who conscientiously adhere to the right. And it can have no worse ones than those with whom conscience and right are secondary considerations.

The "first duty" of a citizen is his only duty, and this is the duty he owes to the State, to himself, and to God. If the law of the State commands him to do that which he knows not to be right, it is his duty to disregard that law and act according to his knowledge. And in so doing he will be serving the State, for it is not in the interests of the State that wrong should be put in the place of right, and falsehood in the place of truth. The peace, honor, and dignity of the State cannot be conserved through a bad law. That State has most honor and most peace which has most upright, conscientious citizens.

No individual can divorce himself from his duty to God, and he cannot be divorced therefrom by the State. And this duty covers the duty he owes to his fellow-men; for God has said, "Thou shalt love . . . thy neighbor as thyself." By the highest considerations, those of love to his Creator and to his fellow-men, every individual is bound to do that which is just and right, according to the light God has given him. He is bound to bear witness by his life to the truth. This obligation is indestructible and unchangeable, and it is not for the State to set limits about it by law. The individual must determine its boundaries for himself, by the aid of the Word of God.

God's word is the rule of right; and no word of man, even though expressed in law, can constitute such a rule. The fallible must give way to the infallible; the law of God must take precedence of the law of man. And in obedience to the law of God is found the highest expression of that law-abiding spirit which is so important a factor in good citizenship.
