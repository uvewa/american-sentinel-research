**"A Disgrace to Our Age."**

[From the Universitat Herald, Notazulga, Ala., August 1.]

It is a disgrace to our age and country that religious persecution is carried on in Tennessee against the Seventh-day Adventists. These are good people, who hold that Saturday is the proper day to keep as the Sabbath, and not Sunday. Therefore they do on Sunday what they would on any other day,—keeping Saturday as the Sabbath. For this some of them have been thrown into jail, where they now linger. The Constitution of the United States guarantees to every man religious liberty; therefore, to persecute these people because they do not observe our sabbath, but Saturday, is grossly wrong and intolerant.

The Adventists are said to be an orderly, Christian people, and to persecute them as indicated, is violative of the Christian spirit and the laws of our country. Let this foul blot on Tennessee be speedily wiped out.
