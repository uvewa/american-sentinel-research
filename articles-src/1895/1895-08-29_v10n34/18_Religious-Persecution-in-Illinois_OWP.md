**RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION IN ILLINOIS.**

Summerdale, Ill., August 22, 1895.

C. P. BOLLMAN.—Dear Brother: In reply to your request of the 20th, would briefly say: I was arrested July 28 (Sunday) by a Roman Catholic police officer on complaint of a Mrs. Miller (a Congregationalist), who knew I was keeping the seventh-day Sabbath. I was taken in the police patrol wagon between two officers to two different police stations; and failing to give bonds, I was locked up with a criminal. The Sunday work for which I was arrested was some light carpenter work, with windows and doors closed, so as not to disturb anyone. After some counsel with some of the brethren, I concluded to waive my examination at the police court the following day and appear before the grand jury. My bond was fixed at $300.

Our dear heavenly Father bestowed much of his grace and good Spirit upon me to freely speak and testify to the officers and prisoners out of my Bible which I carried with me. We have shared much Christian love and sympathy from our dear Sabbath-keeping brethren.

I belong to no creed, but try to obey the Bible and do the will of my Heavenly Father. We have meeting privileges with Seventh-day Adventist brethren.

What is in store for us when the case is to be tried next month we know not as yet. But even if the Lord permits that I should be thrown into prison, I know his sustaining grace and presence will be with me. It will probably be hardest for my dear wife and little ones.

Faithfully your brother in Christ,
O. W. PEARSON.
