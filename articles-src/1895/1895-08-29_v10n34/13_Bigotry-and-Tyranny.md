**"Bigotry and Tyranny."**

[From the Echo, Broadway, Va., Aug. 2.]

The Adventists are good citizens and a religious people, observing what their consciences tell them to be right, and their belief is based upon the Bible as many another sect. They have as good a right to observe the day they set apart for their Sabbath and work on the day that other people take for religious worship, as these other denominations have no calling the first day of the week sabbath. It is belittling to religion to persecute these people; it breathes of the bigotry and tyranny of the ancients. As the United States is supposed to be a free country for religious worship of all creeds, we doubt the constitutionality of the law that imprisons these Seventh-day Adventists for working on Sunday.
