## MORE PRESS COMMENTS CONCERNING RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION IN TENNESSEE.

"Modern Inquisition."

[From the Evening News, Erie, Pa., July 20.]

Eight Adventists have been put into the chain-gang in Tennessee for desecration of the sabbath. They observe Saturday with rigid piety as their day of rest, and work Sunday. It is a disgrace to any State in the nation to think that such puritanical idiocy still exists. The Constitution of the United States permits every man, woman and child to worship God according to the dictates of their own conscience.

The Adventists believe that Saturday is the Sabbath, and according to their religion they are entitled to work on Sunday. They disturb nobody by it, and it has been our experience that they were in almost every instance excellent citizens. It is an outrage on justice that such a thing should happen.
