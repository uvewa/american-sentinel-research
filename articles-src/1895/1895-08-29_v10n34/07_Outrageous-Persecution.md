### OUTRAGEOUS PERSECUTION.

[From the Christian Intelligencer, July 3.]

The last case of outrageous persecution for religious opinion that has come to our knowledge occurred not in China, nor in Turkey, nor in any other half-civilized country, but in our own land beneath the stars and stripes. We learn from the Examiner that there is now in Georgia a man universally recognized as a good citizen who is shut up with incendiaries, thieves and murderers, and with them awaiting departure to a chain-gang; and the reason is that on Sunday he had worked quietly in his own back field, disturbing nobody, and acting in obedience to his conscience. This is lamentable intolerance. We have no sympathy with the mistaken views of this Judaizing Christian, but he has a perfect right to work on the first day of the week so long as he does not hinder his neighbors from the rightful use of the Lord's day. To shut him up with gross criminals is nothing less than religious persecution.*

* This man was not actually put into the chain-gang; an unknown friend paid his costs, and he was released—Ed. SENTINEL.
