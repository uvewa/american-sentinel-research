## ARE BAPTISTS DRIFTING?

BY G. D. BALLOU.

This staunch denomination that has so many years stood for the defense of liberty has just held its National Baptist Young People's Union Association here in the city of Baltimore. It began July 18th and closed the 21st. In their honor flags floated from thousands of windows, and banners of "Welcome to N. B. Y. P. U. A." were conspicuous, and all the leading denominations flung wide their doors and their hearts to entertain the strangers from abroad, and nearly every pulpit in the city, except Roman Catholic, was filled on Sunday by a Baptist. Hundreds of dollars were spent in beautifying the grounds and the great pavilion about 200 by 325 feet.

State delegates were present from the Pacific Coast and every part of the country; in all 6,559 delegates were enrolled. Dr. Wharton, said to be the most eloquent and popular Baptist preacher in Maryland, delivered an address of welcome on behalf of the Baptist young people of Baltimore, which contains some things I wish to put alongside of the resolutions passed the next day that will, I think, make very interesting Baptist history. Here is the extract:—

The Baptists stand upon eternal principles. They believe in the Bible pure and simple from the first verse in Genesis to the last word in Revelation. They stand for liberty civil and religious, and the sacred institutions God-given and blessed. They honor the sabbath, they believe in the everlasting separation of Church and State; they do not believe in the red hat, but they do believe in the little red school-house. We welcome you as young people; it is the young people's day. In all the avenues of trade, of business, of profession, the young men and women are at the front: in religion, in politics, and trade. We wave our hats and bid you welcome. We want your life in our churchs. There has been too much stagnation. Westminster Abbey burles her people in the aisles of the church: we are content to have our dead sit in the pews. Life is what we want, and life more abundantly for which Jesus came into the world. Young men and women, go stand in the valley of dry bones and prophecy unto them while you beseech heaven to breathe upon the lifeless ones. Your energy, young people, is what is needed. When men go hunting and fishing they seek the game, and the youngest and most active are ordinarily most successful.

It is your mission to go out in the highways and hedges and compel them to come in, to stand in the stream and fish and hunt the game, start it afloat and pursue it until death; yes, until it is dead to this world and all things in it, and alive for evermore to Jesus Christ and his cause. A live man is better than a dead nation. The salt has lost its savor, the light has well nigh gone out. We look to you, God bless you, to seize the flag now falling from the nerveless grasp of the feeble, faltering church, and rush forth to conflict and to victory.

This animating and arousing address was cheered again and again; but what in the name of liberty does it all mean when interpreted in the light of the following resolutions, everyone of which was cheered to the echo and unanimously adopted the next day:—

We, the Baptist Young People's Union of America, in convention assembled, recognize the first day of the week as the Lord's day, and as the day set apart by the laws of the land as the day of weekly rest from secular toil.

We will, by example and influence, seek to promote a better observance of the day as the day of rest and worship.

And that to this end we will use all proper means to secure the enforcement of the Sunday laws.

To discourage the publication and circulation of the Sunday newspapers, the running of Sunday excursions, and the opening of places of public amusement, contrary to the law.

There was another resolution aimed against prize-fighting, and these were all the resolutions passed; and this reveals the object of this convention—to boom the Sunday law crusade.

Let us consider a few statements by Dr. Wharton, in comparison with the spirit of these resolutions.

"The Baptists stand on eternal principles; they believe in the Bible pure and simple;" and yet they adopt the corrupt principles and practices of the Middle Ages by proclaiming Sunday to be the Lord's day, and pledging themselves to help enforce this dogma of their religion upon their fellow-men, under civil pains and penalties. And all this in face of the fact that Dr. Hiscock, of New York, the author of their church manual, only last winter showed them that there was no divine authority for Sunday—that it is not in the Bible.

"They stand for liberty civil and religious;" and yet pledge themselves to "use all proper means" to see that laws are enforced which will send to prison Christian Sabbath-keepers and others simply and solely because they differ from them about Sunday observance.

"They honor the sabbath." How? By calling it "Jewish;" saying it is abolished, trampling it under foot and engaging to enforce the precept of a rival institution which a large number of their leading men know "was always only a human ordinance;" by helping to send men who keep the ancient Sabbath to prison or causing them to pay fines; in these ways they do dishonor the Sabbath that Jesus and every holy man of old sacredly observed, and thus do they cast contempt on the Lord of the Sabbath.

"They believe in the everlasting separation of Church and State" (i. e., the Roman Catholic Church and State; is not that right?). But they pledge themselves again to help the State enforce the Sunday sabbath upon all people, that the Baptist Church and her kindred sisters and their mother Rome may have their Sunday sabbath honored and their church work made more easy. Is this separation between Church and State, when the State makes a law enforcing religious dogma and the church pledges herself to help sustain the law?

Shades of consistency, are they gone mad? Jer. 51:7, furnishes the only consistent explanation.

"They do not believe in the red hat, but they do believe in the little red school-house." They do not believe in the principle of Rome asserting her power to rule, but they do believe in Protestants making use of the civil arm to sustain what they call the truth, and thus keep their churches in the ascendancy. They forget that "they that take the sword shall perish with the sword," and they cannot see that they are moved by the same principle and spirit that actuated Rome—"We must sustain our church and our religion by the civil arm."

An appeal to civil power in matters of religion means the use of force in spiritual things, and this is not the religion of Jesus (see John 12:47, 48), nor of the Baptists of other days.

They talk about the life that is in Jesus, but their perverted appetites do not crave the water of life. It is the wine of Babylon that best suits their perverted religious taste, and they thirst for civil power and seek it yet again. Prov. 23:35. Like the man who has tasted strong drink, so those who have drank of the wine—the false principles of Rome, her Sunday sabbath, her doctrine that the Church should control the State, that the Church may force the conscience—when they awake they say, We will seek it yet again.

God's way is too tame and slow; we must compel men to obey. The recognized sign of Christian life and activity is a manifest desire to enter politics and make the Church a felt power in civil matters and control the counsels of the nation. And for what else does the B. Y. P. U. A. exist?

We asked at the head of this article, Is the Baptist Church drifting? We say No, manifestly No. She has got her prow turned, her rudder is set, her sails all trimmed, and with a full head of steam on, she is driving at full speed into the great vortex of ruin that will engulf Babylon and all her kin, and the mist of worldliness is so thick about her that only a few of her watchmen discern the grin shadows, or hear the dread soughing of the surf that lies athwart her course.

Why cannot Baptists see God's Sabbath as well as baptism? How can they read Sunday into the fourth command and call it sabbath when they will not allow anyone to read sprinkling into the gospel commission and call it baptism? Why will they seek to the civil power to sustain their religion? Perhaps it is because they can sustain it in no other way.

Do they honestly think God's Sabbath blessing has slipped from the seventh day over to the first day? And now, lest a few Sabbath-keepers shall succeed in slipping it back, will they spike the blessing onto Sunday with Sunday laws and then clinch the spikes with church resolutions? Truly they have drunken of Babylon's wine and are mad.

The last day of this great convention, Sunday, July 21, was a gala one. Upon the grounds a half dozen lines of the best money-making business were in full operation. The street cars, in open violation of the statutes of Maryland, were reaping a rich harvest selling religious railroad tickets gotten up by the B. Y. P. U. A. especially for the occasion. On one side these religious tickets, sold at a reduced rate, read: "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ," "Culture for Service;" on the other, "Search the Scriptures," "Loyalty to Christ." Hackmen and bus drivers by the score solicited patronage at the gate, and throughout the city several lines of the best money-making business were almost unrestrained. It was a common remark of people who attended that it seemed more like a bazaar than a religious service. The cheering at times could be heard several blocks away. On this very day a poor, inoffensive Seventh-day Adventist quietly mended shoes in his private rooms in a secluded suburb of this same city far away from a chance to disturb any one; even his window blinds were closed, and the officer, to find out whether or not the man was at work, had to enter the room. For this awful conduct the brother was arrested and thrown in prison, and now must stand trial as a criminal with almost a certainty of a heavy fine or imprisonment.

Now, can the Baptists of America show cause why the National B. Y. P. U. A. convention, just closed, is not accessory in principles and purpose to this and all similar cowardly acts of persecution? They have pledged themselves to stand by Sunday laws and see that they are enforced; why are they not guilty in this case? They pledge themselves to sustain Sunday laws, but none of those in the Sunday-keeping ring are disturbed. If one only professes to keep Sunday he can do as he sees fit about keeping it. But let one turn aside from the beaten path, and he at once becomes a prey. What does this mean? Are they blind?—stone blind?

Reader, it is time to seek God for power to make the truth of God known to the people that they may heed the warning of Rev. 18:4: "Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues." Who will lift up the voice like a trumpet and show God's professed people their transgressions and the house of Jacob their sins?

Baltimore, Md., July 24, 1895.
