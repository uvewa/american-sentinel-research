**THE Knoxville Sentinel, in commenting upon the Tennessee prosecutions, while evidently seeking to do justice to the victims of the Sunday law, makes this statement:—**

The Adventist who has observed the seventh day as the day of rest and has labored on the Christian sabbath, has no right to complain because he is punished for his violation of the civil law if all other infringers are likewise punished.

This view of the case is faulty. If the law is a just one, the Adventist has no right to complain if he is punished for violating it, whether other violators are punished or not, any more than the thief or murderer has a right to complain if he is imprisoned, while others like himself roam at large. No man has a right to complain of justice.

The injustice lies in the law itself. The Adventists do not clamor for the imprisonment of other violators of the Sunday law, but on the contrary, ask for liberty for all men in the matter of Sunday observance. They do not feel aggrieved because others around them are not imprisoned for Sunday labor; they desire that those, as well as themselves, should be free from all coercion in matters of religious belief; provided, of course, that such belief does not invade another's rights.
