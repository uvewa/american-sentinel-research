**Our Fundamental Law Violated.**

[From the Brown County Republican, Mt. Sterling, Ill., July 25.]

The fundamental law of this land guarantees to all the right to worship God according to the dictates of conscience, and the law of God sets aside the seventh day as a day of rest, in which no labor shall be done. The first day of the week is the man-made sabbath, and because these men persist in observing the law of God rather than the law of man, they are made to suffer persecution from alleged Christians who have no love of justice in their souls.

It is not claimed that these men disturbed the peace of others or are a menace to the safety of the State, but are persecuted simply through religious intolerance. The very men who are most active in this persecution raise no objection to founderies, mills, and railroads running on Sunday, nor in fact do they care for everything running wide open on that day unless the person engaged in this work is a Seventh-day Adventist. That makes all the difference, and the poor man who is observing the law of God is jerked up and heavily fined and forced upon the chain-gang. Every lover of justice should condemn this inhuman treatment of Christian citizens, and demand the repeal of all laws that dictate how or when one shall worship God.
