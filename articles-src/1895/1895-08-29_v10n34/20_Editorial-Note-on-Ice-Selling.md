AN Italian was arrested a few days since in this city for selling ice on Sunday in a crowded quarter. When arraigned before Magistrate Cornell, his honor said:—

It's a crying shame to arrest a man for selling ice in the tenement districts. Why, ice is a necessity on such a close, hot day as this. I wish I could let you go, Bacon; but, unfortunately, as the law stands, I must hold you in $100 for Special Sessions.

Commenting upon this, a contemporary asks: "What can be said in defense of a law when even the judges on the bench declare that it is a 'crying shame' to enforce it?"

The question is pertinent; but is not this one equally so? What shall be said of a magistrate who will blindly hold a man for selling ice on a hot Sunday in a crowded city, under a statute which permits works of "necessity and charity," and defines necessity as including "whatever is needful during the day for the good order, health, or comfort of the community?" Bad as is the statute the magistrate had no occasion under it to hold the man who sold ice. However, the primary fault is with the statute. "Bad laws," said Edmund Burke, "are the worst sort of tyranny. They derive a particular malignity from the wisdom and soundness of the rest of our institutions."
