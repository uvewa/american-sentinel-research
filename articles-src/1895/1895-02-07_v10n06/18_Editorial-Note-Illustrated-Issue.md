# Illustrated Issue Announcement

ANY ONE receiving the AMERICAN SENTINEL without having ordered it may know that it is sent to him by some friend. Therefore, those who have not ordered the SENTINEL need have no fears that they will be asked to pay for it.

READ the article, "Religious Liberty Violated," on page 47 of this paper. All honor to the Examiner and its courageous editor.

OUR illustrated issue of January 17 has had a most encouraging sale. We have sent out one hundred and twenty-five thousand copies. Once more we call attention to this valuable number. Order before the fifteenth of February. This is the "third and last call."
