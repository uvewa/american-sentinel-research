# Papal Encyclicals and American Catholics

THE PAPAL ENCYCLICAL OF JANUARY 6TH, BRIEFLY COMMENTED UPON ON THE FIRST PAGE OF THIS PAPER, IS THE MOST REMARKABLE PRODUCTION OF THE KIND IN MODERN TIMES. IT SHOWS MORE CLEARLY THAN ANYTHING ELSE COULD, THE REAL PURPOSE OF ROME CONCERNING THE UNITED STATES AND THE WORLD. IT IS SPECIALLY SIGNIFICANT IN VIEW OF PREVIOUS UTTERANCES. IN 1885, IN AN ENCYCLICAL ADDRESSED ESPECIALLY TO THE ROMAN CATHOLICS OF THE UNITED STATES, LEO XIII. SAID:

All Catholics must make themselves felt as active elements in daily political life in the countries where they live. They must penetrate, wherever possible, in the administration of civil affairs; must constantly exert the utmost vigilance and energy to prevent the usages of liberty from going beyond the limits of God's fixed laws. [The laws of the Roman Catholic Church.] All Catholics should do all in their power to cause the constitutions of States and legislation to be modeled in the principles of the true church.

In his latest encyclical the pope tells plainly what "the principles of the true church" are as concerns the relations of Church and State. The two encyclicals in effect command American Catholics to do all in their power to bring about in the United States such a union of Church and State as will give the Roman Catholic Church "the favor of the laws and the patronage of the public authority." But after all the gravest danger that threatens our free institutions is from Protestants who have proved recreant to their principles, and who, by invoking in behalf of the Church the influence and power of the State, have mightily strengthened the hands of the papacy in its assaults upon American principles.
