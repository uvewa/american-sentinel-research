## OCR Corrections Made

### Page 1, Masthead
- **Original OCR:** "CALVIS P. BOLLMAN"

### Page 2, Article "Rome as the Guardian of Peace"
- **Original OCR:** "enconverted"
- **Corrected to:** "unconverted"
- **Confidence:** HIGH
- **Reason:** Context clearly indicates "unconverted" (those not converted to the strike cause)

### Page 4, Article "That's True"
- **Original OCR:** "buzzer"
- **Transcribed as:** "buxom"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM
- **Reason:** Context suggests "buxom and rosy-cheeked" describing Annie, though "buzzer" could be a period term

- **Transcribed as:** "Schaffhausen"
- **Confidence:** HIGH
- **Reason:** Known Swiss city name; standard spelling

- **Confidence:** HIGH
- **Reason:** Latin phrase; "debita" (owed) makes grammatical sense

### Page 6, Article "Are Sunday Laws Religious?"
