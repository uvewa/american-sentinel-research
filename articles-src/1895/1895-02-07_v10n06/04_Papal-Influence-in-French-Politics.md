# Papal Influence in French Politics.

THE new president of France, M. Faure, is a Romanist. A press despatch from Paris says:—

While the voting was in progress, M. Faure's friends were actively canvassing for votes and with apparent success until a rumor was started that he was a Protestant. This for a time had bad effect upon his candidacy, but a deputation instantly approached M. Faure and questioned him upon his religious persuasion. M. Faure, who was greatly excited, said in reply to a question on the subject: "No, I am a Catholic."

This reassured his supporters, and they went to work with renewed vigor.

Another despatch, dated Rome, Jan. 18, says:—

The Vatican is entirely satisfied with the election of Faure, the French president.

"How does all this comport," asks an exchange, "with Bishop Keane's assertion that the Catholic Church has no political purpose? What has the Vatican to do with the President of France any more than the President of the United States? Why did Faure have to declare himself a papist in order to reach the presidency? And how long will it be before this country is in the condition of the French Republic? All these are timely questions."
