# Religious Liberty Violated.

THERE is deplorable ignorance as to what constitutes religious liberty. To a large proportion of the human race, religious liberty means "the right to believe as I please, and to act accordingly." Others mistake religious toleration for liberty. Great Britain grants toleration, but not liberty or equality. France grants a larger degree of religious liberty, but still lays a tax upon every one, of whatever belief or unbelief, for the equal support of every form of religious worship whose professors ask for this State aid.

In not a few of our States religious liberty is grossly, wickedly, infamously violated, through abuse of what are called the Sunday laws. The International Religious Liberty Association, Battle Creek, Mich., publishes a pamphlet entitled, "Religious Persecution," from which we gather a few facts. At Springdale, Washington county, Ark., Elders Wellman and Scales, Seventh-day Adventists, held meetings which resulted in the organization of a Seventh-day Adventist Church. Elder Scales gratuitously painted the meeting-house, which was out of sight of all public roads. On Sunday he did a small strip of painting. For this he was arrested and convicted. Mr. James, another Seventh-day Adventist, did some carpenter work on the house of a poor widow, as an act of charity. The widow was to be thrown out of the house in which she lived, and had no other shelter; so he worked in the rain on Sunday. He too was arrested and fined. He would have been imprisoned, but for the fine being paid by others. Mr. Armstrong, for working in his garden, was arrested and locked up in jail with another prisoner, with only a little straw and a blanket about thirty inches wide for both of them. And all this time, Sunday trains were running. Sunday excursions were advertised, men and boys were shooting squirrels in the woods, without check. So eager were the prosecutors that men were arrested and fined and imprisoned when the alleged offense was committed previous to the enactment of the law.

In Tennessee Sunday gaming and shooting have not been interfered with, but when a lawless mob fired into a congregation of Sabbath Adventists, the crime went unnoticed. Men cut their wheat and rafted logs on Sunday, untouched by the law, but those who had conscientiously observed their Sabbath were put into the chain gang. From the windows of the jail where they were confined, on Sunday they saw a train load of workingmen passing in the streets not thirty feet from the jail, going out to work. We have already spoken of the case of William B. Capps of Weasley County, Tenn. He says: "During my imprisonment I saw work done on Sunday that was followed every other day in the week. Beeves were killed and hauled through the town to the place of sale. Dry goods were sold." The American Hebrew of New York made a plea for Mr. Capps, and raised money among the Hebrews for the payment of his fine, whereupon he was released. Similar persecutions have occurred in Maryland and Georgia. A similar case occurred in western Pennsylvania. A few years ago a Seventh-day Baptist deacon, who had run a cultivator through his corn on Sunday, and had worked his planing-mill, far from any habitation and from any place of worship, was arrested, imprisoned and fined.

All these are in violation of the principle of religious liberty, which is that the State takes no cognizance whatever of any one's religion or lack of religion—that the State has nothing to do with religion, except to see that no one's religious rights are interfered with. No one under whatever guise has a right to disturb the Sunday worship of his neighbors. No one has a right, on Sunday, to go through the streets with a band of music, or to cry his wares; but any work done that day that does not interfere with the rights of others, is utterly out of the proper reach of the law.

It is amazing how good people fail to understand what are the principles in this matter. At the last quarterly meeting of the Philadelphia Ministers' Union the writer proposed a resolution to the effect that the Pennsylvania Sunday law of 1794 should not be used for the violation of religious liberty in the case of quiet and conscientious citizens, who having observed the seventh day as a day of rest and worship, perform on the first day of the week such labor as does not interfere with the religious rights of their fellow-citizens. This resolution was opposed by one speaker on the ground that it was very dangerous to open the door at all, or in the least to relax the requirements of the law; by another, on the ground that very few cases of hardship occurred under the law; and by another, on the ground that if this resolution were adopted, it would be necessary also to exempt those who observe Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, or any other day of the week. At last a master stroke was effected. A member called the attention of the chairman to the fact that the hour of adjournment had already passed, and thereupon the chairman ruled that the body was no longer in session. It is this sort of thing that brings reproach upon Christianity. It is just such religious persecution as would make the Lord's day an offense.—The Examiner and National Baptist, New York, Jan. 31, 1895.
