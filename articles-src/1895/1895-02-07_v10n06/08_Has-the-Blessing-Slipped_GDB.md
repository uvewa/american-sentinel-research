# Has the Blessing Slipped.

"AND God blessed the *seventh* day and sanctified it." Gen. 2:3. This blessing and sanctification made it God's "holy Sabbath." Neh. 9:14. Man was commanded by God's own voice, and this command was written by his own finger on stone, to "remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy." Ex. 20:8 and 34:4, 28. All of God's holy patriarchs, prophets and apostles regarded the blessing God had placed upon the seventh day. Jesus regarded it, and continued to bless men on that day by removing the physical effects of the curse, and by endeavoring to bless every one by turning them away from their iniquities. Acts 3:26. And the holy women at the sepulchre were in harmony with the holy Sabbath God had made, for "they prepared spices and ointment and rested the Sabbath day according to the commandment." Luke 23:56. All the holy men of Bible times were in harmony with God's holy day, and so were all the Christian church until the great apostasy took place; and then did the blessing slip from the seventh day because the Church went back into heathenism? This blessing had held firmly to the seventh day all through more than four thousand years of earth's dark history, and now *did* it quietly slip on to another day? Did God set his blessing so lightly on his "holy day" that an apostate church could by its decree remove it to another day? And if the blessing of God has slipped off the seventh day onto the first day, is it so firmly fixed now that it will not slip back again? Is it a sense of this loose sacredness, or sacred looseness that causes all these efforts we see at "civil Sabbath legislation"? Do they hope thereby to rivet the blessing on Sunday so it may not be slipped back again onto the seventh day? And now if this Sabbath blessing could be slipped off the seventh day over onto Sunday by an apostate church, why cannot the faithful people of God slip it back again onto the seventh day? And pray tell, after all, when time was moving forward so rapidly, how this blessing slipped forward to Sunday instead of backward onto Friday? There are some queer things about this loose Sabbath blessing.

But all this folly is set at naught by the fact that God never makes mistakes. That same blessing placed on the seventh day at creation will remain upon it in the new creation, *all flesh* will come up on that day to worship before the Lord. Isa. 66:22, 23. Then God's blessing is now upon the seventh day and will ever thus remain, and no earthly power can remove it, and all opinions of men that regard it lightly are rebuked by the promise in Isa. 58:13, 14: "If thou turn away thy foot from the Sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on my holy day; and call the Sabbath a delight, the holy of the Lord, honorable; and shalt honor him, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine own words: then shalt thou delight thyself in the Lord; and I will cause thee to ride upon the high places of the earth, and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father: for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it."
