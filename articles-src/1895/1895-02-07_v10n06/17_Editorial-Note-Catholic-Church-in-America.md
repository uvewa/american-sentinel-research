# The Catholic Church in America

THE EVANGELIST (Presbyterian), in commenting on the pope's encyclical, says that "it needs but a superficial comparison of the Roman Catholic Church in America with that in European States to show that the spirit of that church in this country is essentially different from the traditional spirit as exemplified in France, or Austria, or Italy, or Ireland." THE EVANGELIST is quite right; only a superficial, a very superficial, comparison, would show this difference. THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH is a unit the world over; what she is in France, Austria, Italy, Ireland, or even in Spain, she is in spirit and purpose in America.
