# Sectarian Schools and Indian Affairs

THE HOUSE COMMITTEE ON INDIAN AFFAIRS HAS RECOMMENDED THAT THE APPROPRIATION FOR SECTARIAN SCHOOLS BE DIMINISHED 20 PER CENT. ANNUALLY FOR THE NEXT FIVE YEARS, AND AFTER THAT DISCONTINUED ENTIRELY.

NOW THAT THE HOUSE COMMITTEE ON INDIAN AFFAIRS HAS RECOMMENDED THAT THE GOVERNMENT DISCONTINUE THE POLICY OF APPROPRIATING MONEY FOR SECTARIAN SCHOOLS, WE WILL BE ABLE TO TEST THE POWER OF THE PAPACY IN AMERICAN POLITICS.

THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH BITTERLY OPPOSES THE PRESENT ATTEMPT TO CUT OFF GOVERNMENT APPROPRIATIONS FOR THE INDIAN SCHOOLS. EVEN THE POPE IS WATCHING THE STRUGGLE WITH INTENSE INTEREST. BISHOP KEANE RELATES THAT THE POPE RECEIVED THE NEWS OF THE LAST FAILURE TO DISLODGE THE CATHOLICS FROM THE UNITED STATES TREASURY WITH GREAT SATISFACTION.
