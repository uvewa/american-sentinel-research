# Are Sunday Laws Religious?

The pendulum of public opinion which swung over our fair land, bringing us the glorious charter of our liberty, that immortal document, the Declaration of Independence, and our peerless Constitution, has already begun to swing backward to the Dark Ages, as is evidenced by the clamor of the clergy and of the church for Sunday laws and the enforcing of such laws where they do exist; and the courts, under the pressure of a real or supposed public opinion, declaring such laws constitutional, although they give one class of religionists an advantage over others, as stated in the decision of Judge Hammond in the celebrated King case. In this article I do not pose as the advocate or champion of *my* rights, or *my* religion, but to plead for *equal* rights of *all* men of every nation, color, and creed.

Are Sunday laws religious? I answer emphatically. Yes, from first to last.

Sunday is a religious day. It is so held by the majority of Christians and observed as such. They call it the Lord's day. Laws enforcing a religious institution must be religious laws. Hence, Sunday laws are religious.

Sunday is one of the days of the *week*. The week is not a natural division of time. There is nothing in nature to reveal or suggest it, or make it discoverable to the human mind. Hence it could not originate in the human mind, but must come to it by revelation from its Author. The Bible reveals the origin of the week, and the weekly cycle stands as an enduring and unshaken monument of the Creator's work and rest, as recorded in Genesis 1 and 2, before the fall of man, before he needed physical rest. Man's labors were to cease that he might worship, not rest from weariness or work or toil. Nature knows no Sabbath, and hence can reveal none.

Rest is not based on the physical constitution of the animal, vegetable or mineral kingdoms. It is solely and essentially religious in character, was instituted for worship, and the remembrance of God. It was made by the Creator for man and adapted to his religious nature; a time set apart for the cultivation and exercise of his spiritual nature. Hence rest was enjoined that he might be free for devotion and worship. Therefore, laws enforcing a weekly day of rest, grow out of, and are based on the religious character of the institution. Hence arises the serious question: What right has the State to enforce idleness upon the physical man, when it can furnish no employment or exercise for man's spiritual nature. The man who observes the weekly day of rest on religious grounds in obedience to the divine law, is furnished by its Author with employment and exercises adapted to the character of the day, and the needs of his spiritual nature. But when the State enforces rest from secular labor, and prohibits innocent amusements, it leaves the irreligious man without honest employment, and thus would foster vice and crime which are almost sure to follow in the wake of idleness.

Sunday laws are urged most zealously and persistently by church people and clergymen. This is a signal fact. Why? Because they regard Sunday as a sacred day and wish to secure it from desecration.

Some have changed tactics. Does change of name or title change the nature of the institution? Does calling Sunday the civil Sabbath take away its religious character? Is it not religious still?

They aim to divert attention from the religious character of the day and the legislation they ask for it, by calling it the Civil Sabbath, the American Sabbath, the Weekly Independence Day, etc. All of a sudden they have become very patriotic. The nation will go to ruin unless Sunday is preserved as a day of rest and worship. If Sunday is the Christian Sabbath or the Lord's day, as they claim it is, why do they not appeal to the Lord to protect and preserve it, instead of appealing to the State? Do they have more faith in the power of the State than they have in the power of God? Our beloved country, with its free Constitution as our fathers framed it, without an established religion, with a complete separation of Church and State, stood forth as the prodigy of the nations; the freest, the richest, the grandest, the best.

The Declaration of Independence declares that governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed, and this was a basic principle in our great Republic. This grand principle is now denied by a powerful church element, and the claim is set forth that the power is derived from God; hence the rulers must enforce the law of God; and thus a great American hierarchy is established on precisely the same theory which gave rise to the papacy with its Holy Inquisition and its horrible cruelties. The people were no worse than now. When religionists have the power they will use it, whether they be Jews or Pagans, Protestant or Catholic, whether it be in the 9th or 19th century. For those who seek power will use it every time, and when they govern and rule for God, the enemies of God, the heretics, those who differ from them in faith, have to suffer under the grinding despotism of a gigantic religious monopoly or "Sacred Trust." (*Lincoln*). Beware of the danger that lurks in this movement for the enactment and enforcement of Sunday laws.

Sunday-law advocates manifest a great interest and sympathy for the workingman. They set forth his sad condition in touching language; they talk of Sunday slavery under the pressure of grinding monopoly and soulless corporations. You would think to hear them talk that they had real love and sympathy for the laboring classes. But it is not so; their love is for Sunday. They expatiate on the evils of intemperance and their hostility to the Sunday saloon, but it is not so much because they hate the liquor traffic, as because they love Sunday.

When there is no law enforcing a day of rest, all are free to work or rest as they choose. Does one man's work hinder another man's rest? Our yearly Independence Day is one of privilege; we celebrate, we recreate, we rest or we work, as we choose, and no one is disturbed or shocked; and why? Because it is not a religious day, and there is no law to enforce its observance; hence it is a day of privilege for all as every truly American institution will be. Sunday will be a day of privilege when all classes of citizens, whether Christian or infidel, can labor or worship, rest or recreate, as they may choose, without a law compelling its observance in accordance with the demands of a class of religionists in deference to their religious principles.

Why do labor and amusements on that day disturb and shock the sensibilities of a certain class? Because of the religious idea which they attach to the day. Hence laws enforcing rest and prohibiting secular labor and amusements, are laws in the interest of religion in response to the clamors of a religious class; therefore religious laws. Without Sunday laws, the observers of Sunday are just as free to rest or worship on Sunday as the observers of Saturday are to rest and worship on Saturday without Saturday laws. Why should not all religions, why should not all classes, be satisfied with absolute freedom and equality in the matters of rest and worship? When Sunday laws are passed and enforced at the clamor of Sunday-keepers, they have a "corner" in the religious market, and those not in the combine, who do not form a part of their "Sacred Trust," must suffer the consequences in fines, imprisonments and chain-gangs, as illustrated in Arkansas, Tennessee, Georgia and Maryland. Why should the non-Christians and the observers of the seventh day pay tribute to the religionists of another class? How would the Sunday-law advocates regard a law enforcing rest on Saturday? With holy horror they would acclaim, "Religious persecution!" And yet they profess to be the followers of Him who taught "all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them."

But some generously propose to grant exemption from the operation of their Sunday laws to those who religiously observe some other day. Indeed, to exempt a religious class from the operations of a law, stamps it as a religious law and is a tacit admission that without such an exemption clause, it would be unjust and oppressive to that class. And further, if the State has a right to exempt a religious sect from the operation of a law, it has a right to repeal such exemption.

Then it is argued that the laboring man needs weekly rest for his health as a sanitary measure; and hence a Sunday rest law is needed. Can he not rest when he needs rest without forcing him to do it by a church hierarchy or a paternal government? Is not daily rest as essential to the health and as important as a sanitary measure as weekly rest for the worker? Yes, indeed, far more essential and important. Then why do not the Sunday-law advocates clamor as vehemently for a law enforcing daily rest? Oh, simply because they are not interested in sanitary measures and the protection of the health of the poor working man, except as such measures harmonize beautifully with their religious faith and practice. Wonderful coincidence! I wonder if it has any significance.

The real ground or basis of Sabbath laws is religion; they may clothe them in secular dress, and give them civil titles, to deceive the unwary and quiet the fears of the people, but they are religious still, and would never have been thought of or clamored for if Sunday was not regarded as a sacred day. This conclusion is clear, logical and absolutely necessary when the facts are duly considered.

Sunday laws prohibit secular work and civil things. Is it possible to class honest labor and innocent amusements with murder and theft and adultery, as crimes against man and breaches of civility? Absurd! If they are crimes on Sunday, why are they not crimes on Monday? Why is labor adjudged wrong on Sunday? Simply because of the religious character of the day, and Sunday laws have come down to us a heritage from the Church and State governments of the Old World, in which the idea prevailed that it was the duty of the State to foster and cherish religion and religious institutions for its own preservation.

It is a demonstrated truth that although the Church and the State has taken a Sabbath institution which requires rest for its proper observance, and labeled it civil and called it a sanitary measure, and enforced it avowedly in the interest of man's physical nature and the welfare of society, yet it still remains a religious institution. The Government by calling it civil, has not taken away its religious character. The character and nature of a bottle of poison is not changed by changing the label on it from "poison" to "food." A British coin with the image of the Queen on it would not become a United States coin by erasing the image and stamping an eagle upon it. No one would have the right to do such a thing. It would be a fraud and a counterfeit, because it would not be a United States coin although so stamped. So the Sabbath is a divine institution revealed alone in the Scriptures: hence religious in character. Therefore, for any human government to take it or its rival Sunday and stamp it civil and enforce it as a day of rest, is to usurp the place of God, and as a usurper exercise authority in enforcing a religious institution under the false and deceptive plea that it is civil because called so.
