# Rome as the Guardian of the Peace.

We have frequently called attention to the scheme of Rome to make herself of necessity the arbiter of disputes between capital and labor, between constituted civil authority and a riotous people, and between contending nations—in fact, the international peacemaker, the arbiter of the world. This is the settled, published programme of the papacy, and its representatives utilize every opportunity for furthering this scheme.

An opportunity was offered in connection with the recent street-car strike in Brooklyn.

After the strike had become riotous, and the State militia were called out to preserve order, a Roman Catholic delegation from Greenpoint, Brooklyn, headed by "Father" O'Hare, called upon Mayor Schieren, and told him if he would withdraw the soldiers from Greenpoint, they would promise to prevent rioting; and, astonishing to tell, the mayor agreed and withdrew the militia and left that portion of the city to the protection of the Roman Catholics. What followed is related in the *World of January 26:—*

The mob began a war dance about this tangle [of collided cars], the two motormen and two conductors shivering on the platforms.

Soon a third car bore down and was stalled, then a fourth, and so on until there were eighteen cars standing in a long row, with thirty-six of the "unconverted" powerless to escape from the earnest missionary work which straightway began.

The police made a sally and banged a few heads before they decided that it was better to retreat than to shoot. Then the missionaries [strikers] opened up. The work began with a shower of bricks and stones, bottles, clubs, fence posts, and assorted building materials. These broke all the windows and bruised up the thirty-six [non-union street car employés] and got them into a submissive frame of mind.

When every window was broken the missionaries drew near, surrounded the cars and fell to cursing and swearing at the motormen and conductors. They shook their fists at the poor wretches; they told them to come off the cars and go away or lose their lives. The leaders of the rioters got on the platforms and argued, putting a fist and a bank-note under the nose of each man with whom they argued. The "bank-note" horn of the dilemma was soon accepted by most of the men.

Some one had gone down to the parish house of St. Anthony's and had told Father O'Hare what was doing. The priest came on the run, and the crowd, bowing respectfully as he pushed through, ceased cursing and threatening, but kept on with the bank-note horn of argument. They offered $5 and $10, and before many minutes all the thirty-six had deserted except one man.

Many of the rioters must have been Roman Catholics, and the Roman Catholic committee under whose protection the mayor of Brooklyn placed a considerable portion of the city, must have known that the rioters were Roman Catholics, or they would not have dared to promise to control them. That there was a large element of Roman Catholics engaged in the riots is evident also from the subservient manner in which the priest was received by the mob. The published account goes on to tell how the priest finally succeeded in quelling the riot by bribing the one remaining motorman to leave his car. The Roman Catholic government of Greenpoint was however only partially successful in preserving order, and consequently the mayor addressed the following letter to the priestly government of Greenpoint:—

The Rev. J. J. O'Hare, Pastor of St. Anthony's R. C. Church—

Dear Sir: I am directed by his honor the mayor to call your attention to the fact that at the interview he had with the delegation, of which you were one, on Wednesday, assurances were given that if the Greenpoint cars were started without protection of the military there would be no interference with their operation. Complaints have been made to me that there has been such interference. He would deeply regret the necessity of calling upon the troops in order that the cars may be run, and asks that you will exert your influence to prevent further interference.

Respectfully yours,
W. M. PALMER,
Secretary to the Mayor.

In all this there is a miniature representation of one of the last acts in the great drama that will close the history of the world. What these Roman Catholics of Greenpoint proposed to do for that portion of the city of Brooklyn, the pope of Rome proposes to do for the world. The Roman Catholic Church is constantly declaring, as does Leo XIII., in his encyclical to Americans, just published, that political order and civil government cannot be maintained without the acceptance of the Roman Catholic religion, and that fast increasing political unrest, is the result of a failure to acknowledge and enforce that religion. And the turbulence and rioting of the uncontrollable masses will yet persuade the nations of the world, as they persuaded Mayor Schieren of Brooklyn, to give the Roman Catholic Church the place and power she demands with the hope that she will preserve order as she declares she can; and when she fails, as did the priests in Greenpoint, the nations of the earth, in disappointed rage, will visit upon her the retributive judgments predicted in the symbolic words of Rev. 17:16: "And the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast, these shall hate the whore, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire."
