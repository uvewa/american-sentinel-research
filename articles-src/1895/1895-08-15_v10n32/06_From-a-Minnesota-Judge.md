## FROM A MINNESOTA JUDGE.

Editor of American Sentinel: I have received several copies of your paper, and must say that I am well pleased with it. Its short articles that "hew to the line" are sure to be read. At first I gave it but little attention, but it kept coming, and I thought I better see what it amounted to. Beyond a doubt the Sentinel is just the paper needed for the times. It is a pity that every reader cannot have a copy every week; and I want to say to every one who may pick up a copy of the Sentinel, don't lay it down until you have read it.

Sunday is my Sabbath, and whether the teaching that Saturday is the Sabbath, makes the people any better may be doubtful; certainly they are not made worse thereby. He who believes that Saturday is the true Sabbath should be afforded the same protection as Sunday observers. It is surprising to hear of the persecution of the seventh-day people in Tennessee and other States. That they should be imprisoned for doing what they believe to be their duty to God, is a crime, notwithstanding statutes may read otherwise.

I have noticed that Judge Parks, who committed these men to prison, has been commended for his personal views upon this question, and justly so. Did he do right? Are his acts commendable? Let us see. Many of the early settlers of this country fled from a land of religious persecution, and when this Government was established care was taken that every one should have the right to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience. Of course, such conscientious rights must not abridge the rights of others. The Sabbath was ordained by God. The observance of it is an act of worship, and is so regarded by all worshiping people. Whether Saturday or Sunday be the true Sabbath must be left to each individual according to his own conscience. It cannot be decided by legislative acts without abridging the rights of conscience.

The statutes of Tennessee do not prohibit one from keeping Saturday as the Sabbath. They in effect say you can do so, but you must forfeit one-sixth of all you could otherwise earn during the six working days; that is, you must not work Sunday. If you will keep Sunday only, you need to forfeit nothing. So if one keeps Saturday he must pay a license for the right to do so. This is so palpably in violation of the principle upon which our Government was founded, and in violation of the Constitution, that it does seem that any court, even the lowest, would be justifiable in disregarding any such legislative enactments. These persecutions, they call them prosecutions, are a disgrace to the States; yes, and to the United States, which we call the land of liberty.

If we should seek to find the cause that has lead to these conditions, no doubt we should find it in the inclination of churches to advance their interests by legislative enactment. The zeal of the Catholic Church in this direction exceeds all others. In fact, this church seems more political than religious. A few years ago a celebrated Irish Catholic divine replying to Froud, the English lecturer, upon the treatment of the Irish by the English, declared that the Catholic Church ought to stand at the head of all government, because the pope was the vice-gerent of God and could do no wrong. The leaders in this church now hold to and advocate this doctrine, and are seeking to make this a Catholic country, not by force of arms, as many think they intend, but by the ballot. Their priests control the votes of their members, and the pope controls the priests. Catholic school officers must be had, if possible, and so with legislatures, judges, and all executive officers. By the signs of the times there is no mistake in this. If any one disbelieves this, he should live in a community where the Catholics dominate, and he will be soon convinced of its truth.
