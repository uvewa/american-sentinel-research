## MORE PRESS COMMENTS CONCERNING RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION IN TENNESSEE.

### Complimentary.

[From the Republican, Wausau, O., July 19.]

THAT able journal, the AMERICAN SENTINEL, has a complimentary editorial of the Baptists, who protest against the religious persecutions in Georgia and elsewhere, and concludes as follows:—

"This action does honor to the Baptist name, and shows that the spirit of soul-liberty still lives in the Baptist Church."

### Little Christianity in the World.

[From the Northwest American, Sioux City, In., July 11.]

PERSECUTION of Seventh-day Adventists still continues in the South. Such work as this is almost enough to cause a thinking man to believe that there is little Christianity in this world. They are not allowed the constitutional right to "worship God according to the dictates of their own conscience." If the Southern States hope to encourage emigration to the sunny South, they are pursuing a very poor course. Northern people are too tolerant and broad-minded—generally speaking—to sanction anything of the kind, and will be slow about emigrating to a land where religious freedom is not tolerated. A complete separation of Church and State is inevitable.

### An Outrage and a Disgrace.

[From Clinton (Mass.) Daily Item, July 19.]

This country is called a land of religious liberty. The Pilgrims sought a new home at Plymouth Rock that they might worship God according to the dictates of their conscience, but there are today in the chain-gang at work on the public highways in Tennessee eight reputable men, their only offenses being that they set apart and keep Saturday as a day of sacred rest and worship, believing it to be the "Lord's day." Any law that causes the arrest and imprisonment of Christian men because they conscientiously set apart any particular day in the week to rest from their labors and worship God, is an outrage and a disgrace upon the civilization and intelligence of America.

### Ought to Exercise Discretion.

[From the Times-Star, Cincinnati, July 16.]

THE arrest, conviction and punishment of those conscientious Seventh-day Adventists in Tennessee is a monstrous form of legalized persecution, a twin sister to that barbarous institution which the civil war abolished from that State more than thirty years ago. It is a part of their religion to liberally interpret the Bible and observe the seventh rather than the first day of the week. There ought to be intelligence enough in the courts and court officers of Tennessee to exercise a little discretion, so far as the execution of the law in regard to the observance of Sunday is concerned.

### A Disgrace to the State.

[From the Ligonier (Ind.) Banner, July 18.]

IT is a disgrace to the State of Tennessee that it still persecutes the Seventh-day Adventists and other religionists who obey their consciences by keeping holy the Sabbath or seventh day of the week, and pursuing their ordinary avocations on Sunday. A long list of new indictments have been returned by the grand jury of Rhea County, and the Adventists who had kept the biblical Sabbath and worked on Sunday have been tried and in some cases convicted and sentenced to fine and imprisonment. They had only obeyed what they believed to be the law of God, as revealed in the commandment of rest on the seventh day, and for this they are punished as criminals! Yet Tennessee is one of the States in the Union, and this is near the close of the nineteenth century.

### It is a Disgrace.

[From the Mirror, Bracton, N. Y., July 24.]

IN Rhea County, East Tennessee, is a colony of Seventh-day Adventists. A few weeks ago eight of them were put on trial for desecrating Sunday, convicted and fined. Although abundantly able to pay their fines they refused so to do and were sent to jail on workhouse mittimuses to work out their sentences on the county roads. One day last week they were put to work with the county convicts. The leader of the band is E. R. Gillett, a native of Batavia, N. Y., and who is nearly seventy years of age. He volunteered in the civil war and served three years. These men are persecuted for opinion's sake. They are just as sincere in their religious convictions as any other can be, and they observe some other day than the so-called sabbath with as much reverence as others keep that day. It is a disgrace to any State to persecute such people for their religious views, and if the old veteran Gillett is a G. A. R. man, that body should demand his immediate release, and the State of Tennessee should see to it that his co-religionists are also liberated. Will man ever be willing to accord to his neighbor every religious and political right that is as much his as the free air of heaven?
