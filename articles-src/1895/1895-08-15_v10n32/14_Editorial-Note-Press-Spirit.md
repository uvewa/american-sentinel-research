THAT the spirit of religious liberty is by no means dead in America, is proven by the attitude of the press of the country toward religious persecution in Tennessee. We have received at this office hundreds of marked copies of papers, denouncing in vigorous terms the action of the authorities in Rhea County; and we are satisfied that we have seen comparatively few of the papers that have commented upon it. Occasionally we find a paper that defends the persecution, but the overwhelming majority denounce it in fitting terms. We are publishing extracts from the opinions expressed, as rapidly as our space will permit; and are keeping a list of the papers that make mention of it which we shall publish shortly.
