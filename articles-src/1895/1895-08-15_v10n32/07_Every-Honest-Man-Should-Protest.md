### "EVERY HONEST MAN SHOULD PROTEST."

The Cincinnati Tribune, of July 20, contains a contribution, nearly a column long, from the pen of Thos. Clephane, of Cincinnati, under the sub-heading, "Very Vigorous Protest Against the Conviction of Seventh-day Adventists." We extract the following from the last paragraph:

The Sabbath is a religious, and not a civil institution, and belongs to the Church, not the State. Whatever is lawful on any other day of the week is lawful on Sunday. Every honest man should protest against such law. I do not doubt but these conscientious Adventists can, by looking out of their prison cells next Sunday, see very many working without restraint; loaded care of excursionists passing by to places of amusement. Why do railroads work on Sunday? Why do all others that labor on that day do so without restraint, while this small band of people that have observed the day believed by them the proper one to observe are treated in this manner? Not being a Christian, but, I hope, a humanitarian, and believing that injustice has been done in this case, I hereby protest.

Mr. Clephane, though declaring himself a non-Christian, shows in this protest that he is more nearly in harmony with Christian principles than multitudes of professing Christians.
