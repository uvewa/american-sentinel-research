### A VOICE FROM THE CHAIN-GANG.

Spring City, Tenn., August 9, 1895.

EDITOR SENTINEL: In the last issue of the AMERICAN SENTINEL, the Rev. Chas. D. Blaker, pastor of the Baptist Church at Camby, Minn., asks if you know of any Baptists who have appeared as the persecutors of the Seventh-day Adventists who are now suffering persecution for conscience' sake. For one I wish to respond, and will give the facts in the case.

I am now working in the chain-gang at Spring City, Tenn., on the public roads with seven others of my brethren, who have offended the peace and dignity of the State and the conscience of our neighbors by peaceably and quietly going about our work on Sunday as on other days of the week. My offense was unloading a wheelbarrow from my wagon and setting it over the fence of the one from whom I had borrowed it, he being also an Adventist.

The man who witnessed the awful act lives on the opposite side of the road, and is a deacon of the Baptist Church. The next day I was indicted by the grand jury, as the court was then in session. I am now paying the penalty at hard work in the chain-gang for sixty days, because I disturbed the conscience of this deacon of the Baptist Church by unloading that wheelbarrow on Sunday.

I have no right to judge the man, but I am led to inquire why I am arrested for doing what I did, while the son of this same deacon goes fishing on Sunday? also his other children picked strawberries every Sunday through the season, and are now gathering peaches on Sunday for wages, and still his conscience is not disturbed; and that, too, since I was arrested; and this Baptist father is not disturbed, at least I hear of no arrests being made. It is not possible that the deacon could fall from grace so soon, even if he believed in the doctrine. I was a member of and preacher in the Baptist Church before I became a Seventh-day Adventist, and knowing their principles then, and what they have suffered in the past for conscience' sake, I least expected a Baptist brother to appear as my persecutor. This action impresses on my mind the fact that my Baptist brethren have backslidden on the principles of religious liberty which were once so dear to them.
