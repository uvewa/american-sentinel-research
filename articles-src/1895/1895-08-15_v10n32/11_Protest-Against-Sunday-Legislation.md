### PROTEST AGAINST SUNDAY LEGISLATION.

[From the Cape Times, Cape Town, Cape Colony, South Africa, June 19.]

A DEPUTATION representative of the Seventh-day Adventists waited upon the Right Honorable the Prime Minister, and the Treasurer-General yesterday morning for the purpose of protesting against the proposed legislation on Sunday observance. The deputation was introduced by the Hon. J. Rose-Innes, Q.C., M. L. A., and consisted of the following gentlemen: the Rev. A. T. Robinson, the Rev. S. N. Haskell, Mr. G. D. J. Schultz, Mr. H. P. Wessels, and Mr. H. J. Edmed.

### THE CASE STATED.

The Rev. A. T. Robinson, in explaining the views of the deputation and those of whom they represented, said they were thoroughly in accord with every measure calculated to tend towards the best interests of society, but they were strongly against the legislation which was being asked for with regard to Sunday. They would strongly favor a law which would prohibit everything of an indecent and uncivil character on every day of the week, but it appeared inconsistent to them, viewing the matter as they did, to place a law on the statute book which would forbid these things on Sunday any more than on any other day of the week, thus making in the eyes of the law that which was indecent and immoral right on six days of the week. They respectfully protested against Sunday laws, because they believed that such laws were wholly unnecessary for the good of society. Legislating against what was indecent and immoral they regarded as being in the best interests of society, but with regard to the matter of Sabbath observance, that should be left for every man to do as he pleased, as that was a matter of conscience. Countries which had been most dominated by such laws were those in which the continental Sunday was observed. They further protested against Sunday laws because there was a respectable minority in Cape Colony who conscientiously believed that the divine law commanded them to keep holy the seventh day. On this point they had been met with the assurance that the State did not propose to interfere with the right of anybody to keep the seventh day, but they would respectfully point out the command of God regarding the observance of the seventh day as the Sabbath. The manner in which the seventh day was to be kept holy was here very clearly defined—it was making a distinction between the six working days and the seventh day. They further held that when the State made any demand touching religion, a man as a Christian was bound to disregard such laws, but he was bound to submit to the powers that be in regard to any consequences that might follow. Another reason for protesting against Sunday legislation was that they believed that such laws were wrong in principle, and if Parliament placed such laws upon the statute book, they, as Christians, could not but regard them as religious laws, and therefore wrong in principle. Legislation against indecency and incivility did not affect them, because, as Christian citizens, they did all in their power to discountenance such things on every day of the week, but with regard to legislation as to Sunday observance they protested most strongly. In the event of the passing of such a law the only possible course left open to them as Christian citizens would be to obey God rather than men, and in consequence to suffer as did the three Hebrew worthies under similar circumstances. They would ask the government to reconsider the answer given to the deputation which waited upon them recently with regard to Sunday observance.
