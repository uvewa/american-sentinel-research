### A DANGEROUS PRECEDENT.

[From the Mail and Express, New York, July 30, 1895.]

The action of Vice-Chancellor Pitney, in enjoining a reporter from publishing the details of a suit involving the right of way of the Watchung Railway Company in East Orange yesterday afternoon has created a sensation in newspaper circles. It is reported that the vice-chancellor had remarked that "some street railway companies received their franchises very cheaply," when a reporter was seen to leave the room. "Is he a reporter?" asked the vice-chancellor of a court attendant. Being told that he was, he said, "Fetch him back." The reporter returned. "Let me see your notes," demanded the vice-chancellor. They were produced and handed up to the bench. After looking them over, the vice-chancellor is said to have remarked: "You can now leave the room. If one line is printed in your paper about this case I will have you arrested for contempt of court."

It is not known how the vice-chancellor became clothed with such extraordinary power. He may have had some special reasons for his action, which have not been made public, but we know of no authority by which the court can seize the papers of a private individual who may happen to be present at the hearing of a case, and demand of him any memoranda which he may have taken in the course of his reportorial duties. Not since the abolition of the Star Chamber centuries ago has an attempt been made to establish such a censorship of the press.

Instead of previously submitting to the inspection of a tribunal created by the government for the purpose, matter which is intended to be published, and receiving a special license to print it, the custom has prevailed, both in England and in this country, of permitting the publication of anything which may be written. This, however, is done at the writer's or publisher's peril. If his article contains anything which is libelous, or which would subject him to punishment for contempt of court, he must take the consequences. In this country especially the greatest latitude has always been allowed and taken by the press in this respect.

It seems to us that it is an unwarrantable infringement upon the freedom of the press for a court to prohibit the publication of its proceedings, which have taken place in the face of day in a court of justice. It would be taking a long stride backward to have the proceedings of legal tribunals take place in secret. While there may have been no particular hardship caused in this case, still it is a precedent which, if followed, would be a dangerous and far-reaching one.
