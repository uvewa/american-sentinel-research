# Uncertainties Log - v10n32 (1895-08-15)

## OCR Corrections Made

### Page 2, line 112
- **OCR read:** "* 10. 32: 14."
- **Corrected to:** [footnote reference - appears to be misread footnote number]
- **Confidence:** LOW
- **Reason:** This appears to be a scanning artifact or misread footnote marker; the number sequence doesn't match the footnote pattern used elsewhere in the article

### Page 5, line 236
- **OCR read:** "AMSTANT EDITOR"
- **Corrected to:** "ASSISTANT EDITOR"
- **Confidence:** HIGH
- **Reason:** Clear OCR error; "ASSISTANT EDITOR" is the correct term

### Page 6, line 282
- **OCR read:** "AMERICAN SENTINELS"
- **Corrected to:** "AMERICAN SENTINEL"
- **Confidence:** HIGH
- **Reason:** Publication title should be singular; likely OCR error

### General Note
- Several image references (img-0.jpeg through img-3.jpeg) were preserved as written in the OCR output
- Image captions were transcribed as they appeared beneath the image references
- Some footnote numbering appears inconsistent in the original OCR (particularly the "* 10. 32: 14" reference on page 2)
- The article "Fundamental Principle of Government" has multiple footnote markers that reference back to the introduction statement about Prof. William Addison Blakely
