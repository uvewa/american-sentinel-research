Under date of July 5th, the San Juan Times, Farmington, N. M., contains the following editorial note:—

The authorities of Colorado Springs, after thoroughly illtreating the members of the Salvation Army, have finished up by sending Captain Blanch Cole to jail for thirty days. This is religious persecution again with a vengeance. The lady is well known as a well educated woman, and was exerting herself to the utmost to aid the fallen and comfort the distressed. Her crime is the holding of open air meetings. Her sentence is looked upon as a disgrace to Colorado Springs and to Colorado.

The SENTINEL joins with the Times in condemning this treatment of Captain Blanch Cole. It is but another exhibition of that bigoted tyranny which imprisons Seventh-day Adventists in Tennessee. We are glad to see our contemporary striking the hydra-headed monster whenever he appears.
