### A HYDRA-HEADED MONSTER.

TYRANNY is a monster that never dies. It has passed into a proverb that eternal vigilance is the price of liberty; and that is because the spirit of oppression is never destroyed, and, on its part, is sleeplessly vigilant. Behold here to-day [1878], this great people, whose passion for liberty is recorded in splendid pages of history, whose resolution to build on these islands a commonwealth of justice and freedom is written on every acre of its soil in their heart's blood, and in royal blood too; and yet after all these sacrifices and heroic martyrdoms, the scratch of one man's pen can run through the achievements of centuries and turn the arm of England to a bulwark of barbarism. The cause of such recurrences is not far to seek. The fatality is not in the evil thing, but in some strange popular hallucination like that which Hercules had about the ninth hydra head. Instead of killing that he hid it under a stone; and, in the same way, whenever in history, the Anglo-Saxon has vanquished a wrong, he always spared one of its heads. He hides it away; he calls it obsolete; but, after lying still for a long time, up it starts again at the call of some ambitious partisan, all through this curious disinclination to eradicate a wrong utterly and leave no germ of it behind. The chief art of reform is to be radical. No unrepealed statute is ever obsolete. The head of every wrong lives still while its principle is spared, and though it seems antiquated one day, it may be a "spirited policy" the next.
