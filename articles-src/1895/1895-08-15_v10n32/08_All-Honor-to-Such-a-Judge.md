### ALL HONOR TO SUCH A JUDGE.

[From the Albion (Neb.) Weekly News, July 9.]

The constitution of Maryland provides "that in all criminal prosecutions every man hath a right . . . to a speedy trial by an impartial jury." But some years since the legislature passed an act providing that in cases of vagrancy the accused might be committed to the workhouse, by a magistrate, for one year or less, without trial by jury.

A man thus committed was brought before Judge Yellott on writ of habeas corpus, and he was promptly discharged, on the ground that the act under which he had been committed was unconstitutional. The case was appealed by the county, and the Court of Appeals (the Supreme Court of Maryland) sustained the statute on the ground that the constitution of Maryland must be interpreted in harmony with the practice under the unwritten constitution of England, in which country the guarantee of trial by jury is not held to extend to such cases.

Reinforced by this decision, the magistrates of Maryland continued to commit to the workhouse, without jury trial, such vagrants as were brought before them; and Judge Yellott as promptly discharged every man thus deprived of his liberty who was brought before him on writ of habeas corpus; and this, notwithstanding the fact that case after case was taken to the Court of Appeals, and always with the same result, namely, that the "law" was sustained. But the venerable Judge Yellott treated it as void until his retirement from the bench on account of the infirmities of old age. And we say all honor to such a judge.
