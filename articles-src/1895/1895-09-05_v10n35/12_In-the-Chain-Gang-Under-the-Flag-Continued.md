ourselves united. From the conclusion of this war we shall be going down hill. It will not then be necessary to resort every moment to the people for support. They will be forgotten, therefore, and their rights disregarded. They will forget themselves, but in the sole faculty of making money, and will never think of uniting to effect a due respect for their rights. The shackles, therefore, which shall not be knocked off at the conclusion of this war; will remain on us long, will be made heavier and heavier, till our rights shall revive or expire in a convulsion."

In the light of current events, Jefferson's words seem almost prophetic. The spirit of the times have altered; our rulers have, many of them, become corrupt; and the question has been repeatedly asked of petitioners for justice, "How many are there of you? Have you political influence?" Our people have become careless, and in scores of cases a few bigots have commenced persecution and better men have been their victims. But neither the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution of the United States, nor the banner which represents them is to blame; neither is deliverance to be found in any nor in all of these. The fault lies at the door of fallen human nature, and the remedy is the power of God; for such things will be until he comes, whose right all dominion is, for his alone is a righteous role. And the divine promise is: "At that time shall thy people be delivered; every one that shall be found written in the book."
