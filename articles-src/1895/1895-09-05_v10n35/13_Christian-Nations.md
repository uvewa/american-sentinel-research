## CHRISTIAN NATIONS.

[Ram's Horn.]

A radical and unadulterated gospel knocks out a lot of unmeaning talk about Christian nations. There is not a Christian nation in the world to-day. A Christian nation would be a nation composed wholly or chiefly of Christian persons. Where is there such a nation? We sometimes hear men talking about England and America sending rum and ruin to other countries as Christian nations. Fiddlesticks! Because a nation formally recognizes the Bible, does that make it Christian? Could a Christian nation fill the high seas with ships of war? Could it keep men armed to the teeth? Could it spend a thousand times more for drink, tobacco, and harmful luxuries than for sending the gospel to the heathen? Of all the bitter delusions that ever filled men's minds, this is the worst. There is not such a thing as a Christian nation on the face of the earth. There are some nations that have a measure of civilization, and for this we thank God. But such a thing as a Christian nation does not exist.
