THE Christian Intelligencer voices a foreboding which is troubling the camp of the adherents of the first-day sabbath, thus:—

What will become of the sabbath! The trials of speed of the Defender have been made on Sundays. They have been made by men of wealth and leisure, who could as well make these tests on another day, and they exhibit the spirit now animating a large portion of society. What with Sunday newspapers, Sunday bicycle runs, Sunday excursions, Sunday yacht races, and Sunday traveling, the outlook in this country for a proper and scriptural observance of the Lord's day is not hopeful. The destruction of the sabbath advances rapidly.

It may not afford any consolation to the good people who are thus troubled, but we can assure them that the Sabbath is in no danger from the disregard of worldly men or the assaults of all the forces of evil, for we have the Word of the Lord himself that it will continue beyond the time of the creation of the new earth. "As the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me, saith the Lord, so shall your seed and your name remain. And it shall come to pass, that from one new moon to another, and from one Sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before me, saith the Lord." Iss. 66:22, 23. This, however, is said of the Sabbath of the Lord,—the seventh day, which God blessed and sanctified, and which his law upholds. The first-day institution must take its chances, with such aid as it can get from earth.
