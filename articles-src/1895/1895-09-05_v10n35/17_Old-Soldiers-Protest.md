## OLD SOLDIERS PROTEST.

The following preamble and resolution, unanimously adopted at a soldiers' union in Illinois, are sent to us for publication:—

WHEREAS, Comrade E. R. Gillett having honorably served in the legislature of Iowa, and having risked his life in his country's service for three years, and having served as staff officer and regimental quartermaster, is now at the age of sixty-nine years, turned out with a gang of criminals doing work upon the public highway in the State of Tennessee for obeying the fourth commandment, for the same law which says, "The seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work," also says, "Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work." Ex. 30:8-11. Therefore be it

Resolved, That we survivors of 99th and other regiments of Illinois troops at or near Nebo, Pike Co., Ill., assembled in reunion on this 23rd day of August, 1895, do most emphatically object to such treatment of our comrade, and earnestly request that justice be done one who so dearly earned his liberty by exposing his life 'death the stars and stripes in the hour of his country's peril.

Attest.

This action was taken under a misapprehension of the facts in the case. "Uncle" Gillett, as he is familiarly known, is not in the chain-gang; for though indicted with others last March, he has not yet been tried. It is probably, however, only a question of about two months' time till he will be in the chain-gang, as a number of his brethren now are, for the "crime" of obeying the fourth commandment.
