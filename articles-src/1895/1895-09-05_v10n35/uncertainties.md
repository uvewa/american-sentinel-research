## OCR Corrections and Uncertainties

### Page 1
- **Line 47**: "to perform any service to the public on any day set apart by his religion as a day of rest." — Text appears incomplete/unclear in context; likely missing connecting text before this phrase
- **Line 56**: "We required to subsist..." — Appears to be missing a word; likely should be "We were required" but kept as printed

### Page 2
- **Line 78**: "[fclunies]" — OCR error; corrected to "[felonies]"
- **Line 84**: "installing this" — Uncertain; kept as appears in original; context suggests possible OCR error

### Page 3
- **Line 118**: "foss America" — OCR error; corrected to "free America" (likely "free" was misread)

### Page 4
- No significant uncertainties

### Page 5
- **Line 295**: "FEBRUARY 5 1895" — Page header shows wrong date; article is from September 5, 1895 issue; this is a header artifact

### Page 6
- No significant uncertainties

### Page 7
- **Line 431**: "Ex. 30:8-11" — Biblical reference appears incorrect; should be "Ex. 20:8-11" (Fourth Commandment); kept as printed but likely OCR or typographical error in original

### Page 8
- **Line 550**: "indigenous proceeding" — Unusual word choice; likely should be "iniquitous" but kept as printed

### General Notes
- Article on chain-gang system is powerful and detailed; descriptions match contemporary accounts
- Multiple reprinted articles properly attributed
- Some page headers contain artifacts/errors but do not affect article content
- Biblical references checked where possible; one apparent error noted above
