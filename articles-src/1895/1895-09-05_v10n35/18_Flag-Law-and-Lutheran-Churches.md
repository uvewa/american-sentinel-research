The new Flag Law of Illinois requires the hoisting of the United States flag over all buildings in which schools are taught. This law will require Lutheran churches that are used for school purposes, to fly the flag during school hours. In case of failure to do this, the teacher and pastor will be liable to fine and imprisonment. "The Lutherans," it is said, "are much stirred by it, but their conference has left action in resisting it to individual churches." It is no wonder that the Lutherans are "stirred" by this law. It is, as the World, of this city, very properly says, "an attempt openly made to force the church to acknowledge the supremacy of an American State." The Lutheran conference has done well to leave this matter to the individual churches, for it is a matter directly affecting the conscience. Many persons who are perfectly loyal to the flag, and who would, in case of necessity, fight to defend it, scruple to hoist it over a church; and people as such a scruple may seem to some people, the Government has no right to trench upon it.

There is a good deal of nonsense indulged nowadays in regard to the flag. People can not be made patriotic by law any more than they can be made religious by law. It is highly proper that United States history should be taught in all schools, and when properly taught, patriotism will not be lacking. But to make a fetish of the flag and require that it shall be hoisted over churches simply because parochial schools are taught therein, is the height of absurdity. If any Lutheran pastor or teacher sees fit to ignore this statute and to suffer the penalties of the law, he will be entitled to the sympathy and respect of all right-minded people, because he will be standing for the principles which the flag represents much more truly than though he yielded to the demands of such a law.
