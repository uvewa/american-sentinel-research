Richmond, Va., Aug. 25, 1895.

Editor Sentinel: Your readers will remember that Prof. E. C. Keck and myself were fined $50 and costs such, or ninety days on the streets in the chain-gang, by the mayor of Gainesville, Ga., nearly two years ago, for working in our church at that place on Sunday. The city did not even have an ordinance against Sunday work, but did have one against "disorderly conduct and disturbing the peace," and finding there was no city statute exactly covering our case, the mayor brought it in under this head, and arbitrarily fined us as stated, though the testimony of the witnesses did not by any means prove us guilty of the charge, the nearest neighbors swearing that they were not disturbed.

There was, and is, a State Sunday law in Georgia, and whatever offense there was in the Sunday work, was against the State and not against the city at all. The grand jury found a bill of indictment against us, and after a trial in the County Court, which resulted in a disagreement of the jury and a "mistrial;" the case was finally dismissed from court without a conviction.

The mayor's action was not only making two cases out of the same offense, but it was taking action in a case over which he had no jurisdiction whatever. Hence we appealed the case to the Superior Court, asking that the mayor's judgment be set aside. The best
