## RAINING PURITANISM.

[Evening Standard, Leavenworth, Kansas, August 2.]

The old Puritan sabbath is going fast. The old Blue Laws are passing away or sinking into deserved disrepute.—Kansas City Star.

The Star would remind you of the fellow in the tree who hailed the ark as it floated by and asked to be taking aboard. His request being refused he told Noah to sail on with his old scow, he didn't think there was going to be much of a shower anyhow. The fact is, it is raining puritanism all over the country, with a pretty good prospect for a regular deluge. Wichita is all afloat. Atchison and Kansas City are under water, and in every part of the State the people are fleeing to the hills and tree tops.

And Sunday-law puritanism is on a rampage all over the United States. It is more alive and aggressive than at any time for a hundred years. The Puritans are thoroughly organized and last winter succeeded in several States in passing new Puritan laws. Every State has its Puritan code, and with the aid of Comstock, Blair, and others, the United States has, during the last fifteen years, added quite a good-sized Puritan code to its repertory of law.

Only three months ago Massachusetts enacted that: "Whoever is present at a game of sport, a play, or any public diversion except a concert of sacred music on the Lord's day, shall be fined $5." For participating, the fine is $50. For being the manager of said sport, play, or diversion, $500. For keeping open a place of business, $50.

This looks a good deal as if "the old Puritan sabbath is going fast." A fine of $5 for merely looking at "a game of sport, a play, or any public diversion." At this rate of "going fast" it will soon be a crime to wink or brush a fly off your nose on Sunday. Several State supreme courts, as also the United States Circuit Court, have recently sustained the Puritan laws. The latter court, in the case of R. M. King, who since died, charged with the crime of keeping Saturday instead of Sunday, held that the United States Constitution did not guarantee religious liberty as against State laws.

Of course this is not good law construction of the Constitution, but it is good enough for Adventists who haven't very many votes. . . .

Public Opinion, a neutral New York journal, says:—

It is in reality a national struggle that has been entered upon in this city. This is equally evident from whichever point of view we look at it, whether as advocates of the strictly religious, Puritan Sunday, or of the European, holiday Sunday. Unless all signs fall, the contest will prove one of the greatest and bitterest in the history of our country.

The Star is simply whistling to keep up its courage.
