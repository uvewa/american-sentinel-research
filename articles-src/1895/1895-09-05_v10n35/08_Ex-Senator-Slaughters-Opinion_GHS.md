### EX-SENATOR SLAUGHTER'S OPINION.

[The following letter, which appeared in the American, of Nashville, Tenn., is from a gentleman who was a member of the Tennessee Senate, two years ago, and who at that time introduced a bill designed to put an end to the injustice against which he still earnestly protests.]

#### To the American:

I see in your paper of July 4 (the anniversary of American Independence), where, in one of the counties of this State, true and good citizens are being persecuted for acting in accordance with their religious convictions of right, as dictated to them by the holy Word of God. And, as stated, one of these poor persecuted people is "a mere boy, who works in the mines all the week, and in the support of a widowed mother and aunt, was only charged with cutting stovewood for his mother's use." Oh, what a terrible crime!

I very much regret to know that such a wrong has occurred in Tennessee, and also that there are two men in the State holding such high and responsible offices as judge and attorney-general who will allow the prosecution of these people, not in the interest of justice and right, but only for the purpose of upholding one of the most unjust and ignominious laws ever placed upon the statute books of any State.

It does look to me like going back to the days of the Spanish Inquisition, when people were burned at the stake and otherwise made to suffer torture and death, only because of their honest convictions of right as regards religious matters, the only difference being that the one was done under the influence of Romanism during the Dark Ages and the other is being done in an enlightened age, supposed to be under the control of Christian Protestantism. As to difference in principle, there is none.

I am not an Adventist, but a member of the Baptist Church, and seek to observe the day generally regarded as the Christian Sunday; but this does not change my views as regards the right and justice of allowing perfect religious freedom for every human being of our supposed-to-be-free country.

In accordance with the intent and spirit of both the State and National constitutions, and all intelligent teachings of the Bible, we have no just right to interfere with the religious belief or actions of others, provided they do not disturb the general well-being of others, all unjust and prejudiced decisions of the Supreme or other courts to the contrary notwithstanding. And those very good (?) people who allow themselves to be disturbed by the action of others at their own homes, and on their own premises, may be likened to the young women who claimed to be insulted by nude boys bathing in view of their homes but so far away that they could only be distinguished from hogs or some other animals through the use of a field glass or telescope, which the said girls used to learn what they were!

In accordance with the direct teachings of the Bible, these Seventh-day Adventists have good authority for claiming Saturday, or the last day of the week, to be the day of rest designated by God himself. The true origin of the Sabbath, or the day of rest, was through the work that God did in six days, and his rest from this work on the seventh, which for thousands of years was regarded by God's people as the proper day of rest, and so observed. This being true, and it also being true that there is no direct or divine authority in the Bible or elsewhere for changing it as a day of rest, the Adventists certainly have a fair basis for their doctrine in this particular.

Paul the apostle says, "One man esteemeth one day above another, another esteemeth every day alike. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind."

The truth of the matter is, there is not a human being on earth, so far as is known, who can tell which is the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, or seventh day of the week, coming in regular order in accordance with God's arrangement of the days during and after the creation. Nor do I believe that it can be positively known which is the first or the seventh day of the week, in accordance with the arrangement of time during the days of Christ our Saviour upon the earth. Therefore when we all may be mistaken, why should a few be persecuted for their honest convictions as regards the day that should be properly observed as a day of rest?

But then suppose there is a law upon our statute books forbidding labor on the day generally observed as sabbath, which, as the judge says, "should be upheld," why is it that steamboats, railroads, street-car lines, hotels, livery-stables, hackmen and other money-making concerns can continue their various vocations without the least fear of molestation by the officers of the law, whilst another class of true and good citizens must be persecuted for doing what others are promiscuously allowed to do? Can any public official or Christian, man or woman, give an intelligent answer as to why such things should be in this age of Christianity?

G. H. SLAUGHTER.

St. Bethlehem, Tennessee.
