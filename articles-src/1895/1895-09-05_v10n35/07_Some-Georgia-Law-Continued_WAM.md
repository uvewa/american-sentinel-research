lawyers of the town, including the ex-judge of the Superior Court, said at the time, there was not a shadow of doubt about its being done when the case was reached,—that the judge would have to do it; he could not do otherwise.

That was, as stated, nearly two years ago, and the case has been pending ever since. In the meantime a new judge has come to the bench, who is a Baptist minister, and who, before reaching our case, had threatened Seventh-day Adventists. And now word comes from our attorney* at Gainesville that this same minister-judge has passed upon our cases, affirms the decision of the mayor, and holds that we were properly convicted.

I noticed in a recent issue of the SENTINEL, an inquiry from a Baptist as to whether, in the cases of persecution against our people,—which are becoming so common,—any of his denomination had ever been guilty of taking part in it. Here is an instance the brother might take note of, where a Baptist, as judge on the bench—and a minister, too—has used his high office for this express purpose, and without the warrant of a shadow of law at that. What are we to expect next?

Our lawyer thinks that he may possibly get the city to remit the fines, and if not, he is ready to take the case on up to the Supreme Court if we desire it. Failing in both these efforts, it means ninety days each for Professor Keck and myself in a Georgia chain-gang, which, though so nearly realized at different times by our brethren there, has been escaped so far, but which, with the possibilities for oppression and cruel treatment to chain-gang convicts under the laws of that State, makes it decidedly the most forbidding condition that has yet confronted any of our people in this country. But if this is God's will, he will give grace for it.

W. A. McCUTCHEN.
