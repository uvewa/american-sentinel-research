JUDGE BROWN, of the Supreme Court, decides that the Sunday barber law is "a valid exercise of the legislative power," and therefore is constitutional. But we do not believe that this gross and ridiculous interference with the private life of the citizen can be so justified. Where there is no disorder involved, no wrong done, and no act performed that can by any possibility have evil consequences, the proceeding is not within the sphere of acts that may be regulated by law. It is contrary to the whole purpose and spirit of the Constitution. What a judge says settles nothing. In all great cases three judges are on one side and four on the other.—N. Y. Morning Journal.
