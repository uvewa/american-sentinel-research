## THIS "CHRISTIAN" NATION ILLUSTRATED.

[New York Sun, August 19.]

CONGRESSMAN M. W. HOWARD, of Alabama, was the speaker of the day at Prohibition Park yesterday. He was down to speak on the subject, "If Christ Came to Congress," which is the title of a book of which he is the author, but only a small portion of his address was in any way connected with the subject. Most of his time was taken up in relating humorous stories—and he is a very good story-teller—and in expounding the advantages of Populism. These are some of the few things he did say about the hypothetical coming of the Saviour:—

If Christ came to Congress, he would find it full of men who achieved their seats through bribery and use them for corruption. If he came to the Senate, he would find there among the senators a fugitive from justice, who stole thousands from Washington, and ran away to the West, where he made a fortune, by which he purchased his right to return to Washington as a senator. If Christ came to Alabama, he would find the party which once called itself the white man's party buying or forcing 65 000 negro votes. I have here pictures of negroes who cannot count to thirty, and who were put in Alabama to count the election returns.

The speaker showed the photographs, which he said were part of an interesting collection. He also read from a New York paper an account of alleged disgraceful scenes attendant upon the closing session of the last Congress.
