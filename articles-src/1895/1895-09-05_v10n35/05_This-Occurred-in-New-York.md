## THIS OCCURRED IN NEW YORK.

### The Law is Supreme.

[Evening World, August 26.]

A little child lay dying in a room in a crowded tenement house. By the side of the poor bed sat a pale-faced woman. It was Sunday, but the woman's fingers were busy with her needle. So long as there was daylight, seven days in the week, she must sew constantly upon the garments which later would be sold by greedy merchants at so-called "bargain sales." The merchant would make his goodly profit, for the "bargains" were made possible by the miserable wages paid to the woman and her tired sisters who stitched in other tenements.

The little figure on the bed stirred, and a thin little hand was stretched out toward the woman.

"Mamma!"

"What is it, darling?" cooed the woman, as she put aside her work for a moment and bent over her child.

"I am so hot, mamma. My head is burning up. Give me some water, mamma."

"Yes, darling."

The mother rose wearily and went out into the hall to fill a pitcher at the sink there. As she entered the room again she looked out of the window into the crowded street below. Many children were clustered around the back end of an ice wagon. The woman's eyes brightened. She went over to the bed, and, bending over the tiny figure there, said:

"Girlie, mamma will get you some ice, and that will make your throat cool. Lie still for a moment; I will be right back."

Then, with the nickel which had cost her two hours' hard labor clutched in her hand, she ran down the narrow stairs and into the street.

"Give me five cents' worth," she said to the iceman.

He selected a piece of ice, weighed it and was handing it to her, when a policeman suddenly appeared from the other side of the wagon and laid his hand upon the man's shoulder.

"I arrest you," saith the policeman. "It is after 10 o'clock, and it is against the law to sell ice on Sunday at this hour. You will have to come to the police court with me. And you must come, too," he added to the woman.

"My little girl is very sick; I musn't leave her," cried the poor woman, in great distress.

"That don't go," said the policeman. "Come along."

And she had to go. At the police court the iceman was held for violating the Sunday law. The woman was questioned and told to come back in the morning as a witness. Then she was allowed to go. She hurried back to the tenement where she lived. She ran upstairs and entered the room.

"I was kept away and couldn't get back sooner, darling," she said. "I couldn't get the ice because"

Suddenly the words died on her lips. She knelt down by the bed and took a little wasted hand in hers. Then, raising her face, she gazed up with dry eyes that yet saw nothing and whispered:

"Thy will be done, O God! Thou knowest best!"

For the child was dead.
