A NATION can be uplifted only by uplifting the individuals which compose it. The individual must be touched first; and only through the individual is it possible to reach and affect that which individuals compose. Only a law which can reform a man can reform a nation; and only by reforming the man can it take effect. Human laws and human power can affect the outward conduct, but only the law and power of God can change the heart.
