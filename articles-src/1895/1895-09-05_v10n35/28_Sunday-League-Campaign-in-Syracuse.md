REV. EDWARD THOMPSON, LL. D., manager of the Sunday League of America, is conducting a Sunday campaign in this State. He spoke at Syracuse on a recent Sunday, the burden of his discourse being to show that this is a "Christian" nation. Of course, the "clinching" argument was Justice Brewer's decision in the Trinity Church case. "Dr. Thompson announced," says the Syracuse Post, "that he expected to hold a series of meetings in the city in about six months' time to agitate the Sunday question. Meanwhile the league, membership blanks for which were passed throughout the congregation, would busy themselves in the distribution of literature, which should set the people of Syracuse to reading, thinking and studying on the subject."

A few thousand copies of the AMERICAN SENTINEL, judiciously distributed in Syracuse, would do very much toward giving proper direction to the thoughts of the people on this subject. Who will do it?
