THE World, of this city, figures out that four-fifths of the population of New York are opposed to the "stupid and oppressive enforcement of the Sunday-closing law." We think the estimate is entirely too high; doubtless four-fifths, or perhaps more, oppose the laws which trench upon their own liberties, but very few comparatively, are opposed to such laws upon broad principles; and it is for this reason that the rights of the people are not respected. They do not respect their own rights; for instance, those barbers who selfishly and foolishly asked the legislature to pass an act prohibiting barbering on Sunday in order that they might not suffer by the competition of shops keeping open on Sunday, have forfeited their right to protest against other measures of Sunday legislation which are demanded by other people; and the same is true of other trades and classes.
