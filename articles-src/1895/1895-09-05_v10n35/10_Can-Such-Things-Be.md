### CAN SUCH THINGS BE?

[From the Evening News, Paterson, N. J., July 23.]

We are apt to boast that these United States are a land of freedom and religious liberty and that under the shadow of our glorious starry flag every man may worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience provided he does not disturb others in the enjoyment of the same rights. And yet in this, as in some other things, our boast is without foundation. Eight honest men, who, being Seventh-day Adventists, keep Saturday as the Sabbath, have been condemned to serve ninety days each in the common jail, and besides this are compelled to labor in the chain-gang with confirmed criminals. The crime of these men was working on the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday.

This outrage upon civil and religious liberty has not been committed in Russia, but right here in the United States, in this year of grace, 1893, and these victims of intolerance are in jail at Dayton, Ilhea County, Tennessee.

Some of our readers may wonder how it is that seventh-day observers in Tennessee can be punished so severely when the only statute forbidding Sunday labor provides for a fine of but three dollars, recoverable before a justice of the peace. The explanation lies in the fact that the Supreme Court of the State has decided that a repetition of Sunday work constitutes a "nuisance," and is indictable. And to carry this judicial legislation further, Judge Parks has decided that "a single act of work done under such circumstances as to amount to a nuisance, is indictable and punishable as such." The term "such circumstances" is explained by the judge in the next sentence to mean "in such a public manner as to be open to the observation of the public."

The only crime charged against one of these men was that he assisted to lift a wheelbarrow from a wagon into a yard on Sunday, and for this he is serving seventy-five days in the chain-gang! And this in Tennessee, United States of America. This in "the land of the free." If it had been in Russia, Poland or Turkey, our surprise would not have been as great.
