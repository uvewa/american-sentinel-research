## PROSTITUTION OF LIBERTY.

[From the Antigo Herald, Antigo, Wis., Aug. 2.]

To make the first, second, third or seventh day (as the Bible says) the day of rest, is the affair of every religious sect, and each sect has the right of choice. Should all Christian sects decide to keep the first day, while only one sect chooses the seventh, that does not give them any right whatever to prevent the people belonging to this one sect from observing the Seventh day as the Sabbath. . . . Conditions of the Middle Ages are out of place in the nineteenth century. No matter how slowly the step of civilization advances, there can be no backward step or retrogression. Shame to the State and its legislature which passes laws against the liberty guaranteed by the Constitution of the Union. Such a straggler in the march of advancement is seen in the State of Tennessee. It is there where lately religious persecution has secured a foothold, which reminds us of thumbcrews, spanish boots, the rack, the stake, and all other inquisitorial infamies.

Nine Adventists in Dayton, Tenn., were fined $40 for breaking the Sunday law, and as the fine was not paid, they will have to suffer in prison from seventy-five to ninety days. The "criminal" act of these people consisted in doing their daily work on Sunday, after observing the day before as their Sabbath.

Faith is not a thing that can be forced upon any by a majority. Nine hundred and ninety-nine of one belief cannot, and have not the right, to force one of a different faith to believe as they do; and any attempt in this direction is barbarism. The most precious gift to man is personal liberty.
