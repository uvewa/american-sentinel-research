The Sunday movement in France is being urged forward, not on religious grounds as in this country; oh, no! but on the so-called "civil" basis. The Sunday-Rest Association, organized four years ago, now has a membership of several thousand. Its aim is stated to be "to secure the reenactment of the law which prescribes the cessation of all work on the seventh day of the week."

The only law "which prescribes the cessation of all work on the seventh day of the week" is the fourth commandment of the Decalogue, hence the aim of the association must be to secure the reenactment of the fourth commandment by the French Chamber of Deputies!

Of course, this view of the matter is a direct contradiction of the claim that the movement is being urged forward on "civil" grounds, but then in such things it does not do to be too particular; in the matter of enforced Sunday-rest, "civil" grounds means a civil law enforcing a measure of religious observance. It does not mean that the thing is done for civil reasons, that is, to protect material civil rights, or indeed civil rights at all, but only in response to a religious sentiment which demands practical recognition at the hands of the State.
