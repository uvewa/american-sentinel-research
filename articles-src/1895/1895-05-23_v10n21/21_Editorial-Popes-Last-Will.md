The Western Watchman (Roman Catholic), in its issue of May 9, copies from the London Standard what purports to be a quotation from the last will and testament of Pope Leo XIII. which he has sent to cardinals and heads of orders. The quotation reads thus:—

> Even if the temporal power has not been attained, the papacy has arrived at a situation enabling it, when the opportune moment shall come, to dictate conditions, and the same calm, prudent line of action will conduce further to that end, if followed unaltered.

This "calm, prudent line of action" of the present pope, is deceiving many Protestants into the belief that the papacy has become converted, but at the "opportune moment," they will be undeserved; but it will then be too late to retrieve the fatal mistake.
