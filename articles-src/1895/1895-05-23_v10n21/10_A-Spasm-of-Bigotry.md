March 8, 1895, eight Seventh-day Adventists were sentenced to imprisonment from twenty to seventy-six days each for performing secular labor on Sunday. These men had kept Saturday as the Sabbath, according to their faith, and were prosecuting their ordinary work on Sunday in a quiet way, disturbing no one. But it seems they have intolerant bigots down in Tennessee as well as elsewhere, and some of these filed complaints under an old "Blue Law" of that State which is very severe upon Sabbath-breaking. The offense charged was easily proven, and the judge, though sympathizing with the prisoners, felt compelled to pass sentence under a law which he felt was unworthy of a free country.

Similar prosecutions—they may as well be called persecutions—have been instituted in Maryland and Massachusetts, all going to show that the age of bigotry and religious intolerance has not entirely passed; that there is an element in the churches to-day which are loyal descendants of those New Englanders who fled from persecution in the Old World to a land where they could worship God according to the dictates of their own consciences, "and compel everybody else to do the same." This spirit crops out here and there, all over the country.

In many cases not enough are actuated by it to do any great harm, but let the proper occasion arise, and a close observer is astonished at the vast preponderance of theologians over Christians in many communities.

There is very little real freedom in a country where theologians of any sort can use the law against those who dissent from their views. Religious intolerance is had enough when it strives to crush a man socially, and destroys his business and financial standing, but when it has the power to imprison also, it becomes the most unrelenting tyrant.

This should be a free country, but the Tennessee illustration reminds one of the age of John Bunyan. The same old spirit still lingers, and crops out whenever and wherever enough are imbued with it to render its manifestation at all prudent.

The Adventists are a very peaceable and law abiding people, but profess the ability at all times to prove from the Bible that their Sabbath is the only one ever instituted and blessed by Jehovah. But the position of the bigot is this: "Whoever attempts aggressively to prove from the Bible that any one branch of my theological tree is hollow, must be put down, in one way or another." It is not safe to leave on the statute books even an obsolete law for such men to seize and use as a weapon of oppression. It will be a sad day for America, and our stalwart eagle will fold his wings and hang his head in abasement, when the people at large fail to resent as an insult, personal to each and all, every act of oppression perpetrated upon any individual member of the community, and every petty tyranny imposed upon any class.
