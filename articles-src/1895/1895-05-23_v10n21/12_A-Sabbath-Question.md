One of the worst relics of barbarism in the United States is the persecution of religious sects which believe in the "seventh-day" Sabbath under the "Sunday laws" of several of the States. It is called to notice now by the fact that on March 8 of the present year eight Seventh-day Adventists were imprisoned in the county jail of Rhea County, Tenn., for doing ordinary work on their own premises on Sunday, and part of them are still imprisoned. It is hardly possible to realize that such things occur in this country, but it is a fact that in the last sixteen years over fifty persons of this sect have been imprisoned in this country on similar charges. Some of the States, as Indians, expressly exempt from the operation of Sunday laws "such as conscientiously observe the seventh day of the week as the Sabbath," but others have not yet arrived at even this degree of religious liberty.

These persecutions began in Georgia in 1878, when an aged Adventist, named Mitchell, was arrested for plowing in his field on Sunday. His conscience would not permit him to pay a fine, and his imprisonment of thirty days was too much for his age and feeble health. His death resulted from the imprisonment, and he died as absolute a martyr for conscience' sake as any person that was ever burned at the stake or boiled in oil. This in the United States in 1878, Arkansas took up the persecution in 1884, but several shameful imprisonments and seizures of property for costs roused the Americanism of the State. In 1887 the Bar Association of the State took up the cause of religious liberty and an act was passed exempting seventh-day observers from the operation of the Sunday laws. Tennessee began the work of the Dark Ages in 1885, and is continuing it up to date, notwithstanding the provisions of the constitution of Tennessee—

"That all men have a natural and indefensible right to worship Almighty God according to the dictates of their own consciences; that no man can, of right, be compelled to attend, erect, or support any place of worship, or to maintain any minister against his consent; that no human authority can, in any case whatever, control or interfere with the rights of conscience, and that no preference shall ever be given, by law, to any religious establishment or mode of worship."

Maryland began, in 1892 with the imprisonment of an Adventist for breaking corn on Sunday, and the complaint was made by a man who is recognized as a Christian minister. The due observance of Christian principles in that State has presented the even more edifying case of an aged father spied upon, arrested and prosecuted by his own son, and imprisoned for the offense of setting out tomato plants in his own garden on Sunday. The Spanish Inquisition could not greatly surpass that. Massachusetts has fallen into line recently by fining an Adventist for selling half a pound of candy to a spy sent out by the mayor of Everett to secure evidence. This case is appealed and is still pending.

On the merits of the question from a scriptural standpoint the seventh-day observers have clearly the best of the argument. No one pretends that the Sabbath of the Scriptures was not our Saturday, or that it was not observed by Christ and his disciples, even to the last. When his body was laid in the sepulcher by Joseph of Arimathos, and the women who followed him had seen it, "they returned and prepared spices and ointments, and rested the Sabbath day, according to the commandment." And scriptural testimony is equally explicit not only in commanding the observance of the seventh day to the Jews, but also that "the Lord blessed the Sabbath day, and hallowed it." It is generally conceded that after the resurrection of Christ, his followers observed both the seventh and the first day of the week; but the first official recognition of the first day was the edict of Constantine in 321, which prohibited work "on the venerable Sunday," but even that excepted necessary work of husbandry.

England and the United States have long maintained an attitude toward Sunday unknown to other countries, but it may fairly be said that Sunday legislation is now generally maintained chiefly on the theory of the economic propriety of one day of rest in seven. There is also a general sentiment against the unnecessary disturbance of those who desire to devote the day to worship, but neither of these principles in any way affect the case of the seventh-day observers. Their persecution is purely the result of a bigotry that has no support in reason or the religion either of the Old or the New Testaments. It is a disgrace to American civilization.
