[By Charles Foley, in Patriot Phalanx, May 9.]

I UNDERSTAND J. B. C., in his article of April 25, to contend, in substance, that the fourth commandment is merely a civil labor regulation, a day set apart for rest and recuperation from toil. I think it is not a civil labor regulation at all, for the reason, that before the ground was cursed and Adam was banished from the garden and told, "In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread," God had "blessed the seventh day and sanctified it; because that in it he had rested from all his work." Gen. 2:3. Thus it is seen that the seventh day was blessed and distinguished because of what God himself had done, and not as a civil labor regulation for man, for up to that time man was not under the curse, had not labored and was not tired.

Later, man being under the curse, came the command from Sinai applicable alike to those not needing, as well as those needing, rest: "Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy," and particularly designating the day that is the Sabbath, and mentioning that God created the universe in six days and rested on the seventh, and blessed and hallowed it. Ex. 20. In Ex. 10:23, the Lord is quoted as speaking of the seventh day as being "the holy Sabbath;" and in Ex. 31:12-17 inclusive, the seventh day is mentioned as being the Sabbath "holy unto you," and as being "holy unto the Lord," and as being a sign throughout the generations and a perpetual covenant, and the death penalty was pronounced against those who defiled the same by working thereon.

In the above-mentioned scriptures, the doing of work seems to be the only defilement of the Sabbath prohibited, but in Isa. 58:13, 14, we find the greatest rewards conceivable are promised those who abstain from seeking pleasure, after human ways, on that day.

In the light of the above scriptural references, I conclude that the biblical idea of Sabbath observance is, that it is a religious obligation imposed on man for the honoring of God, a sign between man and God for a perpetual covenant, and that it was not instituted as a labor and sanitary regulation.

I fully agree with J. B. C. when he says, "It follows that if Church and State are to be kept separate, and Sabbath observance is a religious duty, that the civil government should not enforce Sabbath rest or punish Sabbath work." This declaration should not concern those laws and regulations for the protection of public assemblies from disturbance, and for the preservation of public order. All lawful public assemblies, whether religious or not, are equally under the protection of law and should be.

A great contest is now on in this country between the friends of religious liberty and those who want laws enacted to compel other people to conform to their views and practices relative to the observance of the first day of the week commonly called Sunday. The contest is being silently waged, and considering its importance is attracting comparatively little public notice. How it will end no man can tell. The indications all point to a disturbance and upheaval of the strata of society in the near future. I believe the better way in State policy is to adhere to the principle that was dominant in the minds of the framers of the Constitution of the United States, and in the adoption of the First Amendment thereto; that is, protection equally to all persons in their religious beliefs and practices from interruption from all other persons, and the favor by law of none. The Supreme Court of Ohio speaks much truth in the following words: "United with government, religion never rises above the merest superstition; united with religion, government never rises above the merest despotism; and all history shows us that the more completely they are separated the better it is for both."
