*From Die Rundschau (Chicago), April 24.*

UNDER the caption, "Unjust Laws" we recently commented editorially on the prosecution and punishment of Adventists in Tennessee for their violation of the Sunday laws of that State. Those convicted have since been pardoned by the governor and released from imprisonment. But though the Adventists rejoice over this turn of events, still they are in no wise satisfied with only this. They demand more,—repeal of the Sunday laws, obnoxious to them, not only in Tennessee, but everywhere, wherever such exist. This is what they are agitating for everywhere, with the energy peculiar to them and why they are constantly seeking to obtain the cooperation of all lovers of the religious liberty of our country, wherever they may be, for their ideas and purposes in this respect.

They have good reasons for this agitation on their part. To a much greater extent than we knew until now have they been persecuted for their violating the Sunday laws. [Here follows a brief account of the persecution of Seventh-day Adventists in Arkansas, Georgia, Tennessee, Maryland and Massachusetts.]

Such is in short the history of the persecutions Adventists suffered in this land of religious liberty. The subject is important enough for calling our readers' attention to it, and to comment thereon thoroughly and in all its bearings. God willing, we will do this in the near future.

The rigid Sunday laws of Massachusetts have been made more rigid by a new law. It declares among other things that no entertainment shall be given on Sunday at which an admission fee is charged. Any person attending such prohibited entertainment is made liable to a fine of five dollars, and then the law declares further: "Whoever, on the Lord's day, keeps open his shop, warehouse, or work house, or does any manual labor, business or work, *except works of necessity and charity,* or takes part in any sport, game or play, *except a sacred concert,* shall be punished by a fine of $50 for each offense, and the owner of any hall in which said law is violated, is liable to a fine of $500."

Our readers will notice the two exemption clauses made prominent by italics. The law prohibits in the first place all work, except works of necessity and charity. This clearly proves this Sunday law to be of a religious character, with the object of effecting the rehabilitation of the Old Testament Sabbath command, with the only difference of putting Sunday in the place of Saturday. For the Jews, too, were permitted to do works of necessity and charity on the Sabbath, and if the State of Massachusetts now grants its citizens the same liberty, then it thereby establishes a new theocracy on the same basis with the Israelitish. However, in the second place, the new law prohibits all Sunday enjoyment, except the so-called sacred concerts. Thereby the Sunday church-theater is sanctioned by law and is made a good work. The clergy, evidently aback of this law, want their so-called spiritual performance preserved intact, and want to compel those people who seek places of amusement on Sunday to patronize the theater established by them instead of the worldly theaters.

But Governor Greenhalge, of Massachusetts, leaves no one in doubt as to the sense and spirit in which the new compulsory law is to be made effective. Even before its passage by the legislature he solemnly swore to see to it, that "the Lord's day would be kept holy," and then added: "When two and a half centuries ago Massachusetts knelt on this uninhabited sea-shore, it then heard the thunder of this Sabbath law from Sinas and did write it in its statute book. There it still standeth to-day, and I prophesy, there it will remain for all time."

Here we have the official confirmation of what we have written above. It is the Sinaitic Sabbath law, to which the Governor of Massachusetts wants to procure obedience. Evidently he has gone amiss of his office. For as governor he has neither the duty nor the right to procure obedience to a divine law given to Israel and above this, to mutilate it, by putting Sunday in the place of Saturday. If he does do this anyway, then he is posing as a new Moses and thereby arrogates unto himself a position, the incompatibility of which, with the fundamental laws of the country, ought to be brought to his cognizance by the liberty-loving citizens of the State of Massachusetts without delay.
