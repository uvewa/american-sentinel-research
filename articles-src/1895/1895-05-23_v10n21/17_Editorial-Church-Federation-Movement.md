A movement has been inaugurated in this city for the federation "of all the churches of the several denominations in the solution of the religious, social and other problems which each separate parish or denomination is striving to solve for itself." As might be expected, Drs. Chas. H. Parkhurst and Josiah Strong are prominent in this movement. "Work will not lag," it is stated, "during the summer months in preparation for the work of the coming fall."
