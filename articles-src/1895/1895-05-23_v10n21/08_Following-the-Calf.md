## A Poem With a Moral for All Slaves of Precedent.

One day through the primeval wood
A calf walked home, as good calves should,
But made a trail all bent askew,
A crooked trail, as all calves do.

Since then two hundred years have fled,
And, I infer, the calf is dead.
But still he left behind his trail,
And thereby hangs my moral tale.
The trail was taken up next day
By a lone dog that passed that way;
And then a wise bellwether sheep
Pursued the trail o'er vale and steep,
And drew the flock behind him, too,
As good bellwethers always do.
And from that day o'er hill and glade
Through those old woods a path was made,
And many men wound in and out,
And dodged and turned and bent about,
And uttered words of righteous wrath
Because I was such a crooked path;
But still they followed—do not laugh—
The first migrations of that calf;
And thro' this winding woodway stalked
Because he walded when he walked.
The forest path became a lane
That bent and turned and turned again;
This crooked lane became a road
Where many a poor horse with his load
Tolled on beneath the burning sun,
And traveled some three miles in one.
And thus a century and a half
They trod the footsteps of that calf.
The years passed on in swiftness fleet
The road became a village street.
And this, before men were aware,
A city's crowded thoroughfare.
And soon the central street was this
Of a renowned metropolis.
And men, two centuries and a half
Trod in the footsteps of that calf.
Each day a hundred thousand rout
Followed this zigzag calf about.
And o'er his crooked journey went
The traffic of a continent.
A hundred thousand men were led
By one calf near three centuries dead.
They followed still his crooked way
And lost one hundred years a day.
For this such reverence is lent
To well-established precedent.
A moral lesson this might teach
If I were but ordained to preach.
For men are prone to go it blind
Along the calf-paths of the mind.
And work away from sun to sun
To do what other men have done.
They follow in the beaten track
And out and in and forth and back.
And still their devious course pursue
To keep the path that others do.
But how the wise old wood-gods laugh
Who saw the primeval calf.
Ah, many things this talk may teach—
But I am not ordained to preach.

—Sam. W. Foss, in Nonconformist.
