A week or two since, under the head of Religious Persecution, we referred to the arrest, trial and imprisonment, at Dayton, Tenn., of the Messrs. Colcord, principal and manager of the Graysville Academy, Seventh-day Adventists. On March 8, there were in the Dayton prison eight persons, including the Colcords, for the crime of "Sabbath" breaking. They had observed strictly and religiously the seventh day, believed by them to be the Sabbath, but were arrested for quietly pursuing their usual avocations on Sunday. At last accounts warrants had been issued for the arrest of sixteen other Seventh-day Adventists for the same offense.

These arrests were made under the laws of Tennessee, and furnish a fair illustration or foreshadowing of what may be expected under the union of Church and State, so ardently desired by the head of the Roman Church, and to which most of the other branches of the nominal Christian Church are, in this close of the nineteenth century, so strongly tending.
