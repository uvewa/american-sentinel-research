Arrangements have been made by which our former assistant editor, A. F. Ballenger, will be retained on the Sentinel as an editorial writer until about August 1, after which as a public laborer he will do battle for the Sentinel's cause in Pennsylvania, the storm center of Romanizing Protestantism. Mr. L. A. Smith, whose name appears as assistant editor, is at present in London, where he may be detained for some weeks.
