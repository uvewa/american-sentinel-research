> The American Sentinel, of April 11, has an account of the legal fight between Seventh-day Adventists and first-day laws in Massachusetts and Tennessee. As long as the Adventists have a good chance to keep two Sundays, and only have to work five days every week, why can't they let well enough alone and be happy?

The above strikes us as very flippant, especially when, as we think, the Seventh-day Adventists are as conscientious a class of people as there are, and claiming that Saturday is the Sabbath of the commandment, keep it. They read the command to work six days and rest one, not work five days and rest two. They consider the command as imperative to work six days as to rest one.—Rockford (Mich.) Register, May 1.
