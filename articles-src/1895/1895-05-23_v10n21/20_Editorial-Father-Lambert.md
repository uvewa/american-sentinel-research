The Converted Catholic for June, will contain an article exposing "Falsehoods Regarding Father Lambert, the Converted Redemptorist Priest," who is now one of three Methodist ministers in charge of Coke Church, Kingston, Jamaica, W. I. It seems that no sooner was this ex-priest out of the country than Roman Catholic papers from Maine to Texas began to publish a statement that he had become insane and was an inmate of an asylum; adding that it was doubtless aberration of mind that led him to separate from the Catholic Church. The article referred to is a complete refutation of the story, which could have no other purpose than to destroy the influence of Mr. Lambert's renunciation of Romanism.
