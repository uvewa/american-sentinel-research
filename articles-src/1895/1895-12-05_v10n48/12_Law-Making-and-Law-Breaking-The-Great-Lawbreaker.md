**The Great Lawbreaker.**

There is a being known as Satan, or the adversary, who was once an angel of light in heaven, having the name Lucifer, or light-bearer. The cause of his fall from heaven is thus described: "Thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north: I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the Most High." Isa. 14:13, 14.

That which turned him from the light-bearer into the prince of darkness was the exaltation of himself. He set himself forth as greater than God.

Having seduced man from his loyalty to God, Satan became "the god of this world." He is such because men have turned "every one to his own way;" and to choose our own way in preference to that of God, is to be ruled by Satan. The way of self is the way of Satan. The full development of this satanic spirit among men is thus set forth by the Apostle Paul, in speaking of the coming of Christ: "That day shall come except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition; who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshiped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God." 2 Thess. 2:3, 4.

"That man of sin," is literally, as rendered by Young, "the lawless one." He is the lawless one because he sets himself against God and his law. So in Dan. 7:25, we have the same lawless one described as one who "shall speak great words against the Most High, and shall wear out the saints of the Most High, and shall think to change times and laws."

The beast of Revelation 13, also answers to the same description, in that "he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme his name, and his tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven; and it was given unto him to make war with the saints and to overcome them." Verses 6, 7.

That earthly power which completely meets these specifications is the papacy. All men are by nature in opposition to God, and there are many forms of organized opposition to him; but in that vast system, the head of which is the pope of Rome, we find the most complete development of the satanic principle of the exaltation of self that can possibly be found among men.

Of this power it is said in Rev. 13:2, that "the dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority." Not that the dragon resigned his own power and authority in favor of "the beast," but that all the power and authority which "the beast"—the papacy—has, is given it by the dragon. But the dragon is "that old serpent, called the Devil and Satan." Rev. 12:9. Therefore the power of the papacy is the power of the devil; and the pope, who professes to be the vicar of Christ, is, on the contrary, the vicar of Satan.
