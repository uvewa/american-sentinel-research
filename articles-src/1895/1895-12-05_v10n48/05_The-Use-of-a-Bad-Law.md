### THE USE OF A BAD LAW.

The following from the New York Sun, of Nov. 25, illustrates the evil of a law whose prohibitions are based not upon the intrinsic character of acts forbidden, but merely upon the time when they are committed:

Policeman O'Connor, of the Macdougal Street station, after putting on plain clothes yesterday, rang the door bell of Louis Bredenstein, who lives over his saloon at 455 West Broadway. When Bredenstein opened the door, O'Connor, who is sickly looking, pretended to be gasping for breath.

"What do you want?" the saloon keeper asked.

"Friend, I'd like to get a drink," gasped the policeman.

"I can't give you a drink to-day," said Bredenstein. "Don't you know it's Sunday?"

"I know that," replied O'Connor, "but I'm sick. You can see that for yourself."

"You certainly do look sick," said the saloon-keeper sympathizingly, "but I can't break the law."

"For God's sake, man, don't turn me away," pleaded the apparent invalid. "I'm so sick that I must have a drink."

This was too much for Bredenstein. He invited the spurious sick man into the hall, and, unlocking his saloon door, went behind the bar and poured out a big drink of whiskey. He brought it back to the shamming policeman, who drank it slowly, and appeared to feel much relieved. The saloon-keeper took the empty glass out into the barroom and washed it. When he returned O'Connor put his hand on his shoulder and said:

"I arrest you for violating the Excise law."

"What?" shouted the saloon keeper, "you don't mean to say that you're an officer?"

"That's what I am," said O'Connor.

Bredenstein was taken to the Macdougal Street station and then to Jefferson Market Court. When arraigned before Magistrate Simms he told of the circumstances under which his arrest was made. He denounced his arrest as an outrage, and said that he had tried not to violate the law since it had begun to be enforced.

"Is this man's story true?" asked Magistrate Simms, addressing O'Connor.

"Yes," replied the policeman, his face turning red.

"Officer, I am surprised," said the magistrate severely. "This man has certainly been guilty of a violation of the law; but a man wearing the uniform of the New York Police Department that will resort to such a low piece of trickery as to play on the sympathy of a citizen in order to make him violate the law, is certainly no honor to the force, and moreover, will never make a good officer. This man was willing to keep the law, but by your persistence and false representations, you induced him to violate it. I regret that I have to hold him for trial."

Bredenstein was later released on bail. He hurried home to his wife, who is ill.

If the "law" in this case were a good law, —that is, one prohibiting a deed because it is in itself evil, there could be no occasion for regret by the magistrate that the prisoner must be held for trial. A good law does not work as in the case here described. Such laws are the terror, and not the tools, of evil-minded persons.

The Sunday "law" is inconsistent in that it declares to be wrong on one day of the week that which it sanctions on the other six days; it makes a man a criminal for doing an act from a mere motive of kindness to a fellowman whom he believes to be in need, and it tends to bring the enforcement of law into disgrace. That is how a bad "law" works; it simply tends to bring discredit upon all law and law-enforcement. The use of such a "law" is nil.
