**The One Supreme Law.**

"Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments; for this is the whole duty of man. For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil." Eccl. 12:13, 14. So the message which goes forth "to peoples, nations, tongues, and kings" (Rev. 10:11), even "to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people," is to "fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come; and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters." Rev. 14:6, 7.

God is the supreme lawgiver, because he alone is able to save. Therefore "the law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul." Ps. 19:7. That law, which was once spoken by God himself, in tones which shook the earth, is composed of ten precepts.

It was of this law that Jesus said, "It is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of the law to fail." Luke 16:17. He said, "Think not that I came to destroy the law, or the prophets: I came not to destroy, but to fulfill." Matt. 5:17. The law was within his heart (Ps. 40:8), and he came in the likeness of sinful flesh, in order "that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us." Rom. 8:4.

This law is summed up in two great commandments, the first of which is, "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy soul, and with all thy mind." And the second is like unto it, namely, "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself." Matt. 22:37, 39. "Love worketh no ill to his neighbor; therefore love is the fulfilling of the law." Rom. 13:10. "All things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them; for this is the law and the prophets." Matt. 7:12. Therefore it follows that the man who faithfully keeps the law of God, fulfills every obligation to man. "Love is the fulfilling of the law," and "love is of God;" therefore he who loves God, must love all men. So to fear God and to keep his commandments is the whole duty of every man. There is nothing that can be required outside of that.

No man can serve two masters. Whatever is contrary to God's law, even though it be framed into "law," is lawless and wicked, and must be shunned and ignored by every one who does his duty. There is no danger that this will lead to anarchy; for to love God supremely is the first commandment, and he who does that will necessarily love men.
