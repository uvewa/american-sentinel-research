If it is right to enforce "law" simply because it is "law," then Torquemada stands justified before the world, for he only enforced the "law" of Spain.

If it is duty to enforce "law" simply because it is "law," then Torquemada not only stands justified before the world, but he must be awarded the meed of honor, for he only discharged an unpleasant duty!

But it is not duty to enforce "law" simply because it is law. Every man, however humble or however high his station, is bound, first of all, to do justice to his fellow-men; and nothing can free him from this obligation. Any failure to discharge this duty to the law of nature as written in the very nature of man, is either tyranny or cowardice.
