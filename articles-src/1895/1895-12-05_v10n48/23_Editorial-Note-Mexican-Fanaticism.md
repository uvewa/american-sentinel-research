The following is from an associated press dispatch recently published in the daily papers:—

CITY OF MEXICO, Nov. 3.—News comes from Texacapa, a small town inhabited by Indians and masszos (half breeds), confirming the report that ten persons were burned there as heretics by order of the auxiliary town judge. He claims that he was acting according to the will of God, manifested to him in an extraordinary vision, accompanied by certain indications of divine wrath against heretics and people leading immoral lives.

The victims of this outburst of papal fanaticism were first locked in the jail, after which the building was set on fire.
