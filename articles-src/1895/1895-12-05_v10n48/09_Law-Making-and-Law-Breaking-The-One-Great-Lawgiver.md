**LAW MAKING AND LAW BREAKING.**

**The One Great Lawgiver.**

*[The Present Truth, London, England.]*

"THERE is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy." James 4:12. This is absolute. "For the Lord is our Judge, the Lord is our lawgiver, the Lord is our King; he will save us." Isa. 33:22. God is the only real lawgiver. He is Lord and King over all the inhabitants of the world, "both low and high, rich and poor together." He is the lawgiver for princes as well as peasants, for judges as well as common people. To him they all alike owe allegiance, even as a child does to its father; "for we are also his offspring." Acts 17:28. "The Most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will." Dan. 4:25. "Wisdom and might are his;" "He removeth kings, and setteth up kings." Dan. 2:20, 21. It is decreed that the nation and the kingdom that will not serve him shall perish. Isa. 60:12. Hence the exhortation, "Be wise now therefore, O ye kings: be instructed, ye judges of the earth. Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice with trembling. Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way." Ps. 2:10–12.
