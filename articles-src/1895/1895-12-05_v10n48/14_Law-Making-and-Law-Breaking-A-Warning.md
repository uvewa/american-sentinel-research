## A Warning.

Against the receiving of this mark the Scripture utters the following warning: "If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand, the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb." Rev. 14. 9, 10.

Evidently it is not a light thing that the Papacy has done in substituting Sunday for the Sabbath. It strikes directly at the authority of God. In no other way could so bold a claim be made to supremacy above God. It is a denial of His supremacy as the one only Lawgiver.

There are many thousands who have never thought but that in keeping Sunday they were obeying God; it is for the benefit of such that the warning is given, that they may save themselves from the coming danger. God does not punish any except those who disregard His gracious warnings. It is when men persist in following the traditions of men, knowing that they are contrary to God's word, that they have the mark of the beast so as to be subjects of the threatened punishment.
