We hear much said at the present time about the "civic duties of Christians." This is a very misleading phrase. It conveys the idea that that which is civic pertains to that which is Christian; which is not the case. Man as a mere unit of civil society, a mere factor of civil government, is not necessarily a Christian at all. A Christian sustains exactly the same relation to the civil government as does one who is not a Christian; in other words, the profession or non-profession of Christianity or of any religion does not affect a person's relation to the civil power at all. All persons, whether Christians, atheists, Jews, or pagans, are equally bound to contribute to the support of the civil power which exists for the preservation of their mutual rights. They are equally bound to abide by all just laws. These are their civic duties; and the civic duty of the atheist is the same as that of the Christian.
