**The Mark of Lawlessness.**

The papacy arose through the substitution of the teaching of men for the word of God. The great claim of the papacy to-day is that of infallibility, that it is superior to the Bible, competent to sit in judgment upon it, and to decide what is authoritative and what is not. Now the one thing above all others upon which the papacy depends to show its power and authority, is the substitution of the Sunday for the Sabbath. A few extracts from standard Catholic works are sufficient to show this.

From the "Catholic Christian Instructed," sixteenth edition, James Duffy, Sons, & Co., Dublin, we quote the following:

Q. What are the days which the church commands to be kept holy, or observed as days of particular devotion?

A. 1st. The Sunday, or Lord's day, which we observe by apostolical tradition instead of the Sabbath.

Q. What warrant have you for keeping the Sunday preferably to the ancient Sabbath, which was Saturday?

A. We have for it the authority of the Catholic Church and apostolic tradition.

Q. Does the Scripture anywhere command the Sunday to be kept for the Sabbath?

A. ... the Scripture does not in particular mention this change of the Sabbath. ... In fact the best authority we have for this ancient custom is the testimony of the church. And therefore those who pretend to be such religious observers of the Sunday, whilst they take no notice of other festivals ordained by the same authority, show that they act more by humor than by reason and religion; since Sundays and holidays all stand upon the same foundation, viz., the ordinance of the church.

In the "Faith of Our Fathers," by Cardinal Gibbons, "twenty-fifth carefully revised and enlarged edition," we find the following evidence that the Catholic Church exalts itself above the word of God:—

The Scriptures alone do not contain all the truths which a Christian is bound to believe, nor do they explicitly enjoin all the duties which he is obliged to practice. Not to mention other examples, is not every Christian obliged to sanctify Sunday, and to abstain on that day from unnecessary servile work? Is not the observance of this law among the most prominent of our sacred duties? But you may read the Bible from Genesis to Revelation, and you will not find a single line authorizing the sanctification of Sunday. The Scriptures enforce the observance of Saturday, a day which we never sanctify.—Page 111.

Christ declared, in the words of Scripture, that man must live "by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God." The Catholic Church on the contrary, coolly boasts of setting aside the word of God, and thereby proclaims itself antichrist, opposing and exciting itself "above all that is called God, or that is worshiped."

Again, in a Catholic work entitled, "Abridgment of Christian Doctrine," we find the following:—

Q. How prove you that the church hath power to command feasts and holy days?

A. By the very act of changing the Sabbath into Sunday, which Protestants allow of.

Exactly in harmony with this Roman Catholic testimony is the following from professed Protestants. Canon Eyton says:—

There is no word, no hint, in the New Testament about abstaining from work on Sunday. No commandment of God bids us do this or not do that on Sunday; we are absolutely free as far as his law goes. The observance of Ash Wednesday or Lent stands on exactly the same footing as the observance of Sunday.—The Ten Commandments.

The late Dr. R. W. Dale said:—

The Sabbath was founded on a specific, divine command. We can plead no such command for the observance of Sunday.

Dr. Isaac Williams, of the Church of England, says:—

We are commanded to keep holy the seventh day; but we do not think it necessary to keep the seventh day holy; for the seventh day is Saturday. It may be said that we keep the first day instead; but then surely this is not the same thing; the first day cannot be the seventh day; and where are we told in Scripture that we are to keep the first day at all? We are commanded to keep the seventh; but we are nowhere commanded to keep the first day.—The Church Catechism, p 334.

On the next page but one he adds:—

The reason why we keep the first day of the week holy instead of the seventh is for the same reason that we observe many other things, not because the Bible, but because the Church, has enjoined it.

Let it be observed that these statements are almost identical with those quoted from Roman Catholic writers. All agree that the substitution of Sunday for the Sabbath is contrary to Scripture. "The Church" is the sole authority for the change. Now it matters not by what name that church is called; the fact is that the substitution of Sunday for the Sabbath, contrary to the Scriptures, marks it as apostate and identical with "that lawless one," and the "beast" which opens its mouth in blasphemy against God.

This conclusion, therefore, is as clear as that two and two make four: The substitution of Sunday for the Sabbath of the Lord is the badge of authority of that power which claims to be superior to God, in that it claims to be above his word. Sunday is, therefore, the mark of the beast.
