## The World Following the Beast.

The Scripture says that all that dwell on the earth shall worship the beast, except those whose names are in the book of life. It is only necessary for us to take a glance at the so-called "Christian nations" of earth, in every one of which Sunday laws are a prominent feature, to see how nearly universal homage to the Papacy, although often unconscious, has become.

In the position that the civil authorities and even ministers of the church take in regard to the enforcement of Sunday laws, we see the spirit of the Papacy. When the fourth commandment is quoted to a magistrate, so that he can see that the Sunday law is in opposition to it, he will say, "I am here to enforce the laws as they are, whether right or wrong. This is a law of the State, and it must be enforced." That is to say, "It matters not what God's law may say; the law of the State is above it." That is putting the State above God.

A New York minister who has gained a world-wide reputation as a "reformer," Dr. Parkhurst, of anti-Tammany fame, made a typical utterance a few weeks ago, when he said: "The enforcement of the law, and the wisdom of the law, are distinct." "I care very little comparatively what law is on the statute books. But I will fight till I die for the enforcement of such laws as are there." So it is often said that the best way to get rid of a bad law is to enforce it. That is simply to do evil that good may come. But the whole world has a perverted idea of law and duty. Men fancy that they are law-abiding because they will enforce even a bad law, because it is a law of the State, not realizing that to enforce a bad law is sin, a violation of the law of God.
