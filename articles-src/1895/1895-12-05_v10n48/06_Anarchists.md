### "ANARCHISTS."

The term "anarchist" is getting to be quite a convenient designation in the vocabulary of certain persons who entertain feelings of bitterness against others whose ideas and principles antagonize their own, especially in matters of religious belief. For example, the "Rev. Thomas Sherman, S. J.," son of the illustrious general, is quoted by the Chicago Herald as saying in a speech delivered last February in that city, that "ex-priests are anarchists of the worst stamp." To which Prof. George Rudolph, Ph. D., an ex-priest, of Clyde, Ohio, replied by quoting Webster's definition of an anarchist—"one who excites revolt, or promotes disorder in a State"—and inquiring when he had been guilty of such acts. Of course no proof that ex-priests are anarchists was forthcoming.

The same term has been applied to Seventh-day Adventists by some zealous exponents of certain popular religious dogmas, with which the views of the former are in conflict; and doubtless in the future it will be so applied much oftener than it has been in the past. The same spirit prompts its use in the one case as in the other; namely, the spirit of religious intolerance. The Adventists have never been promoters of riot and disorder, though they have in some instances been the victims of disorders promoted by their opponents.

It was thus that the Jews sought to secure the condemnation of Jesus Christ. They represented that he was seeking to set up a kingdom in opposition to that of Caesar, and was therefore inciting the people to insurrection, and by threats based upon this representation they secured the consent of Pontius Pilate—the civil power—to their evil purpose. And they pursued the same course with Christ's followers. Paul was represented as a seditious person, inciting the people to rebellion against the authority of the civil ruler. By this means the Jews stirred up the people against him, so that he was subjected to bitter persecution. And a like experience has often fallen to the lot of Christ's representatives down to the present day.

We live in a time when the evil passions of religious bigotry and animosity are ready to break forth again with all the virulence they have shown in the past. The smoldering fires of old controversies are ready to break forth anew and commingle with new controversies of our own times. The old conflict between the forces of good and of evil, of godliness and worldliness, must continue to the bitter end. In this the powers of evil resort to carnal weapons, to calumny and violence; and the same hatred as of old animates them against the just. The "Rev." Mr. Sherman said that "the man who shoots an anarchist at sight is a public benefactor," and then added that the worst sort of anarchists were priests who had become Protestants. Religious bigotry invents its own definition of anarchy, and when religious strife breaks forth, the opposing forces will not be slow to brand each other with the mark.

It is of importance to every person to understand now the great truth that the Word of God is never to be found on the side of anarchy, strife, and tumult. Those persons are never anarchists who stand upon the Word of God. Those are never anarchists who appeal to the law of God in justification of their views and their practice. They may be in the minority, but it is only the seeming minority, for the invisible God is on the side of those who adhere to his word, and the invisible hosts of the skies perform his bidding.

The essence of anarchy is opposition to the law of the Highest. Satan was the first anarchist; and any power which sets aside the word of the Lord and exalts the word of man, in the shape of human tradition or custom, or the dictum of pope or priest or other person or persons, Catholic or Protestant, is on the side of anarchy, and is to be shunned accordingly.
