ANOTHER misleading expression is the phrase, "Christian laws." No civil government on the earth to-day ever enacted any Christian laws. They have laws which are in harmony with the spirit of Christianity; for that spirit leads a person to leave all his fellowmen in the full enjoyment of their rights; and many men are in harmony with the spirit of Christianity in this respect. A man may respect the rights of his fellows and give his support to such laws as do not invade those rights, because he wishes his own rights to be respected; while at the same time he ignores the rights of God. God has enacted laws which recognize his rights, or in other words, which define his claims upon the beings he has created; and only those laws are truly Christian; they are the rule of Christian conduct. Man cannot enact such laws; he can legislate only within the sphere of the rights of man. Within this sphere all persons can unite in legislation, whether they profess a religion or not. And therefore no nation can, in respect to the laws it has enacted, be a Christian nation.
