THAT the Sabbath is not designed merely for physical rest is shown by the fact that mere physical rest is not Sabbath-keeping. The prophet thus describes true Sabbath-observance: "If thou turn away thy foot from the Sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on my holy day; and call the Sabbath a delight, the holy of the Lord, honorable; and shalt honor him, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine own words: then shalt thou delight thyself in the Lord." To keep the Sabbath is therefore to delight in the Lord; hence only he who delights in the Lord keeps the Sabbath.
