### SOUTH AFRICAN CORRESPONDENCE.

BY G. R. THOMPSON.

At the last session of the Colonial Parliament, in response to the urgent demands of the ecclesiastical leaders, another Sunday law, in the interests of what was called morality, was added to those already upon the statute books. It is quite true that the enactment was only a sop, which was thrown by the ministry to the projectors of the bill to satisfy their abnormal cravings for something of the sort, yet in passing it they recognized, and indorsed the principle, that governments can rightfully legislate on moral questions, and be, after a fashion, dispensers of religious pap to the people.

But just now much comment is being indulged in by the press upon the retirement, by the government, of the general manager of railways, and many are querying as to the reason why the government has set him aside. The Cape Times, of Oct. 14, 1893, has a long leader on the matter, and says that the most diligent inquiries secure only the scantiest reasons of which the summing up is something like this: "Elliott—Oh, yes, a good old boy: just a bit too pious."

If this be true, it would seem that while the government thinks religion a good thing, and tries by human law to get it into the heart, it is not deemed a good thing to have at the fountain head, and officials are not desired who are "too pious." But just what direction the piety of the worthy manager takes, who is a member of the society of the Plymouth Brethren, is hinted at by the Times, as follows:—

Now the general manager's strongly religious bent does undoubtedly lean to a certain Sabbatarianism, and we have ourselves, in spite of the value we set on the weekly break in work for all classes, a point or two which we should like to press in regard to the starving of the Sunday-train service.

From this it seems that the train service on Sunday is in a "starving" condition, on account of fewer trains being run on that day than on other days of the week, because the general manager is "too pious" to allow them to run. Because he regards Sunday as a sacred day, he makes a difference in the number of trains that are run. But this is not satisfactory. The people are "starving" for a ride, and do not like such "religious bent." So the government (which is the people), after making laws for the better observance of what it calls the "Lord's day," and enforcing its observance on the people by penalty of law, retires one of its officials because he shows a deference for Sunday! If something of the kind is not inferred by the above editorial, I fail to see what it means.

The inconsistency of Sunday laws is well illustrated by this. The law provides that any person who shall chop a little feel, or open a shop on Sunday for business, shall be fined or imprisoned. But government trains may run, and if fewer trains run than on other days, it is called a "starving of the train service," and unsatisfactory to the people.

Recently, a gentleman here in the employ of the government, became convinced that he should keep the Sabbath taught in the Bible—the seventh day. He wrote the government, accordingly, setting forth his reasons, and asked that some arrangement might be made, whereby he could keep the Sabbath of the Lord, and at the same time retain his position. I am informed that the government answered adversely. If so, it is a declaration that an individual cannot be a servant of the Lord and of the government at the same time. And yet the nation is Christian! so much so that a Presbyterian divine of the colony not long since pleaded for the union of their churches, that it might be shown that the Presbyterian Church is the national church of South Africa. National church, forsooth! The question arises: When the "wicked shall return to sheol, even all the nations that forget God," what will become of all the national churches?

The glaring inconsistencies of self-constituted Christian governments have always been painfully manifest, for the very simple reason that there is no such thing on this earth, and never will be, till the kingdom of God shall be established. That time is the end of this world, and the ushering in of the world to come.
