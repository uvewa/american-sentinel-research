### ILLINOIS ON THE SUNDAY QUESTION.

[By Addison Blakely, Ph. D., Lecturer in Political Science and History, University of Chicago.]

The Sunday question is now assuming in Illinois the most interesting phase that it has taken in the history of the State, with, perhaps, the possible exception of the Sunday controversy of a half century ago. At that time the whole country was stirred by the agitation of the Sundayists to close up all post-offices on the first day of the week. As the readers of the SENTINEL know, petitions were sent in from all parts of the country asking Congress to take action favorable to the Sunday cause, and to change a usage which the Postmaster-General of the United States declared, in 1815, had been "covered with the Constitution of the United States." In Philadelphia they went so far as to extend chains across the streets, padlocked at the ends, to stop the stage coaches and driving on Sunday.

The agitation became so general that those religious bodies favoring Sundayism held mass meetings and sent speakers around to agitate the suppression of the mails on Sunday. Books were published and petitions were sent everywhere. Signatures rolled in on Congress and each new session was met with a new batch of petitions or met the old batch augmented. But each succeeding time they received the same answer from Congress. No Sundayism for this government; no interference by force in religious affairs. And each answer by the Federal Legislature would close by saying, "And the petitioners shall have leave to withdraw their petitions."

This agitation, after having been carried on for some dozen or fifteen years, gave rise to Senator (afterward Vice-President) Johnson's celebrated "Sunday Mail" reports. One of these was adopted by the Senate of the United States, the other by the House of Representatives. These statements of Federal law and policy declared emphatically that—

It is not the legitimate province of the legislature to determine what religion is true, or what is false. Our government is a civil and not a religious institution. Our Constitution recognizes in every person the right to choose his own religion, and to enjoy it freely without molestation. Whatever may be the religious sentiments of citizens, and however variant, they are alike entitled to protection from the government, so long as they do not invade the rights of others. . . . Among all the religious persecutions with which almost every page of modern history is stained, no victim ever suffered but for the violation of what government denominated the law of God. To prevent a similar train of evils in this country, the Constitution has wisely withheld from our Government the power of defining the divine law. It is a right reserved to each citizen; and while he respects the rights of others, he cannot be held amenable to any human tribunal for his conclusions.

Extensive religious combinations to effect a political object are, in the opinion of the committee, always dangerous. This first effort of the kind calls for the establishment of a principle, which, in the opinion of the committee, would lay the foundation for dangerous innovations upon the spirit of the Constitution, and upon the religious rights of the citizens. If admitted, it may be justly apprehended that the future measures of the Government will be strongly marked, if not eventually controlled, by the same influence. All religious despotism commences by combination and influence; and when that influence begins to operate upon the political institutions of a country, the civil power soon bends under, and the catastrophe of other nations furnishes an awful warning of the consequence.

What other nations call religious toleration, we call religious rights. They are not exercised in virtue of governmental indulgence, but as rights, of which government cannot deprive any portion of citizens, however small. Despotic power may invade those rights, but justice still confirms them.

Let the national legislature once perform an act which involves the decision of a religious controversy, and it will have passed its legitimate bounds. The precedent will then be established and the foundation laid for that usurpation of divine prerogative in this country which has been the desolating scourge to the fairest portions of the Old World. Our Constitution recognizes no other power than that of persuasion for enforcing religious observances.

Notwithstanding these telling reports, plain, logical and concise, the Sunday advocates went right on with their agitation. It was finally carried to such lengths that several of the State legislatures thought that it was time to call a halt. The people thought that fanaticism was going too far; that Sunday intolerance was spreading beyond the point when silence is golden, and that the time had come when forbearance had ceased to be a virtue. No memorials were passed by several of the State legislatures and sent to Congress, Illinois being among the number. They declared Sunday statutes to be subversive of liberty, and their enforcement the work of tyranny. But the people of Illinois went further, and rightly so, for Sundayism is merely the entering wedge of an intolerance which will destroy every vestige of religious freedom when once it becomes the fixed policy of government. "Such an innovation upon our Republican institutions would establish a precedent of dangerous tendency to our privileges as freemen, by involving a legislative decision in a religious controversy."

The memorial of the State legislature of Illinois was as follows:

WHEREAS, A variety of sentiment exists among the good people of the United States on the subject of the expediency or inexpediency of stopping the transportation of the mails on the sabbath day; and inasmuch as Congress has been, and is still urged to pass, an act restricting the carrying of the mails to six days in the week only, by petitions and memorials from various quarters of the Union; and inasmuch as it is believed that such an innovation upon our Republican institutions would establish a precedent of dangerous tendency to our privileges as free men, by involving a legislative decision in a religious controversy on a point in which good citizens may honestly differ;

AND WHEREAS, A free expression of sentiment by the present General Assembly on the subject may tend, in a great degree, to avert so alarming an evil as the union of Church and State; therefore,

Resolved by the People of the State of Illinois, represented in the General Assembly, That the able report made by Col. Richard M. Johnson, of Kentucky, in the Senate of the United States, on the 19th of January, 1829, adverse to the stoppage of the transportation of mails on the sabbath or first day of the week, meets our decided approbation.

Resolved, That the governor be requested to transmit copies of the foregoing preamble to our senators and representatives in Congress, with the request that they use their exertions to prevent the passage of any bill which may, at any time, be introduced for such purpose.

And be it Further Resolved, That our senators in Congress be instructed, and our representatives requested to use their exertions in opposition to any measure that may tend to retard the transportation of the mail.

This seemed, practically, to settle the question in Illinois for upwards of sixty years, but the Sunday "law" fever has now broken out anew, and with, perhaps, an added virulence. The outcome is attracting the attention of bar and laity alike, and whichever way the controversy is decided, the stir caused will rest but little. It seems merely to spur the defeated ones to renewed activity. A contest is on, the end of which none can tell.
