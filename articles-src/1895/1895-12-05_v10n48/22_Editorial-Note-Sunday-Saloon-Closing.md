Is not the Sunday saloon-closing law a virtual support to the evil which the saloon represents? Does it really weaken the saloon's position? If so, why are saloonists in general willing to abide by such a law? Does it not afford them an opportunity to assume more of an appearance of respectability? And is this likely to help toward the saloon's extinction? Let candid, thinking people seriously consider whether a law which helps the saloon to appear respectable, and virtually justifies its existence and its work upon all but one day in the week, is not doing more to strengthen than to weaken the power of this foe to humanity.
