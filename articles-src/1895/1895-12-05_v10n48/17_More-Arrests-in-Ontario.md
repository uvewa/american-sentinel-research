## MORE ARRESTS IN ONTARIO.

A LETTER from P. M. Howe, dated Nov. 29, brings news of more arrests of Adventists in the vicinity of Chatham, Ont., for doing work on Sunday. The writer says that on Nov. 28 he was summoned, together with William Simpson, to appear before Justice Watson, of Ridgetown, to answer to the charge of doing worldly labor on the third day of November, "being the Lord's day," by working at carpentering and masonry. Thomas Griffith was also arrested for cutting wood on Nov. 10; and A. O. Burrill, the Adventist pastor, is under arrest for assisting in the building of the Adventist church.

When the Adventists began the erection of their church, the opposition party set fire to their lumber, by which about 3,000 feet of it was destroyed. As the work was however continued, they began to watch the Adventists on Sundays, and the above-mentioned arrests are the result. No comment is needed to make plain the animus of the proceeding.

The justice at Chatham refused to take the cases, and the prosecutors, not discouraged, went to the neighboring village of Ridgetown, where they succeeded in getting them set for trial. All four cases will be tried the same day, Dec. 5.
