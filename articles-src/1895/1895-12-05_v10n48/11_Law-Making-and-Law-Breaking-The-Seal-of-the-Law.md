**The Seal of the Law.**

"In six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day, and hallowed it." Ex. 20:11.

At the close of each day's work "God saw that it was good." Each step was perfect as he proceeded in the work of creation. At the close of the sixth day "God saw everything that he had made, and, behold, it was very good." Gen. 1:31. Creation was then both perfect and complete.

Then God rested from all his works. A perfect dwelling place was prepared for a perfect people. In Heb. 4:1–4 the fact that the perfect rest for the people of God was ready from the foundation of the earth, is proved by the statement that "God did rest on the seventh day from all his works." The seventh-day Sabbath is therefore the seal of a complete and perfect new creation. Now note carefully what follows:

1. Salvation from sin means a new creation. "If any man be in Christ, he is a new creature." 2 Cor. 5:17. "By grace are ye saved through faith; . . . not of works, lest any man should boast. For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works." Eph. 2:8–10. The gospel is "the power of God unto salvation," and the eternal power of God is seen in the things that he has made. Rom. 1:16, 20. Redemption therefore is creation.

2. The Sabbath, being the sign of creation complete and perfect, is the sign of perfect and complete salvation. So God says of his people, "I gave them my Sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I am the Lord that sanctify them." Ese. 20:12. The Sabbath of the Lord is the sign and reminder of his power to save.

3. God is the only lawgiver, because he is the only one who can save. "There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy." He has a right to the service of men, because he is the Creator, and we are dependent on him both for this present life and for that which is to come. Therefore it follows—

4. That the Sabbath is the seal of God's power, and of his authority as lawgiver. To despise the Sabbath is to despise God's authority. To substitute another sabbath in the place of God's Sabbath is the most bold and glaring defiance of God that could be devised.
