# THE SUNDAY "LAW" IN CHICAGO.

The friends of religious liberty in Chicago have scored several victories against the Sunday closers in that city, and bid fair to completely rout the forces that have been combining during the past few months to bring Chicago under a despotic régime. In every contest, so far, the friends of freedom have come out ahead, and their repeated successes have made for them warm and influential friends throughout the city.

On the 15th of July last the City Council passed an ordinance making it "unlawful for any person or persons to keep open any barber shop or carry on the business of shaving, hair-cutting, or tonsorial work on Sunday within the city of Chicago;" and, as a penalty for the violation of the foregoing provision, the ordinance declared that "any person, by himself, agent, or employé, violating the provisions of Section 1 of this ordinance shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined in any sum not exceeding two hundred ($200) dollars for each and every offense." The "law" passed by a vote of 48 to 15.

Upon the passage of this ordinance, an association of barbers and friends of religious liberty was formed and incorporated, and began a popular crusade against the so-called "law" on the ground that it was unconstitutional and void, and that therefore it had no proper place in the city code of law.

For some weeks each of the opposing sides was strengthening its forces, and no open conflict other than arrests by the Sunday forces was discernable. But as October was drawing to a close, and failure of the Sunday cause appeared imminent, pressure was brought to bear upon the mayor of the city, who thereupon issued an order that the police of the city should see that all tonsorial work should cease on the venerable day of the sun. This brought things to a crisis. A committee of religious liberty advocates waited upon his honor and asked him to withdraw his order. He, as is usual in such cases, replied that he would not, that the "law" was there, and that it was his "duty to enforce the law as it stands upon the statute book," etc.

The association opposing the Sunday "laws" then decided to go to the fountain-head of the evil, and to undertake its repeal. The attorney and counsel for the association, Mr. Addison Blakely, Lecturer on Constitutional Law in the University of Chicago, drafted a repeal ordinance, as follows:

# AN ORDINANCE

Repealing an ordinance making it unlawful for any person or persons to keep open any barber shop, or carry on the business of shaving, hair-cutting, or tonsorial work on Sunday, in the city of Chicago (passed July 14, 1895).

Be it ordained by the City Council of the city of Chicago:

Section 1. That the ordinance making it unlawful for any person or persons to keep open any barber shop or carry on the business of shaving, hair-cutting, or tonsorial work on Sunday within the city of Chicago, passed July 15, 1895, be and the same is hereby repealed.

Section 2. This ordinance shall be in force from and after its passage.

Within two weeks every alderman was interviewed, the situation explained, the nature and meaning of Sunday "laws" set forth, and their character as revealed in their workings shown. When the council met, the petitions were presented, the rules were suspended, and the ordinance drafted by Attorney Blakely was passed by the astonishing vote of 57 to 5. After showing up the real character of Sunday "laws," only five aldermen voted for the retention of the Sunday-closing ordinance.

The Sunday forces now saw that they were fast losing ground and redoubled their efforts to keep the shops closed on Sundays. The president of the closing association said that they welcomed the hotter fight, and that they were never in such good fighting trim. "The fight is to be hotter than ever," he said to the newspapers, "and we expect many shops will open next Sunday. But the State law is all we need, and with the help of our friends we shall make the anti-closers weary of the fight. And while the repeal does not affect us, we will try to have the mayor veto it. That would strengthen our position."

But the mayor did not veto it. He saw the direction that the wind was blowing and took in his sails. The Sunday forces then tried to have the vote reconsidered, but failed as signally in this as they had failed before, and they, then, perforce, succumbed temporarily to the inevitable. But they by no means did it gracefully. Threats of assault and battery were openly made, and personal violence was evidently determined upon. A hurly fellow, rough and uncouth, followed a representative of the religious liberty party down the elevator at the suggestion to "throw him down the elevator," "smash him in the neck," "put him to sleep," and kept close behind him for several blocks from the city hall until the man boarded an electric car for his home.

The Chicago Record, which has befriended the Sunday cause from the beginning, gives the following report of the events following the final defeat in the council:

As soon as the mayor announced that the motion had been lost, Alderman Lawler tried to have the petition presented by the barbers referred to a committee, but he was opposed by Alderman Madden and the petition was ordered printed. Then the barbers left the council chamber and gathered in the corridor.

"It was all the mayor's fault," shouted one.

"It was Alderman Madden—we'll remember Madden," shouted another.

And when one of the opposition barbers who had occupied a seat in the gallery passed, some one suggested that he be thrown down the elevator shaft.

"Now we know who we've got to fight, and we're ready to go at it," said President Hoy. "We'll begin to morrow and get up a monster petition and have it signed by all the barbers, grocery clerks, salesmen, butchers, and other clerks in the city who now have to work seven days in the week. Then we'll hold a big mass meeting in Central Music Hall, and when we've got the people thoroughly worked up we'll go before the City Council again and demand that an ordinance be passed under which the police will be compelled to close Sunday shops. Of course this action does not hurt the State law. That is still in force, and we propose to enforce it."

At this juncture in the history of the controversy, several religious organizations which had been all the while lending their assistance to the work, came out openly in its support and raised contributions to help on the Sunday-closing movement. Even a labor organization has come to their support and passed the following resolution:

Resolved, That the Chicago Labor Congress, in regular session assembled, denounces in unmeasured terms the efforts of certain factions and individuals who are straining everywhere to make the Cody law inoperative.

The whole interest will now center upon the controversy going on in the courts. The State's attorney is with the religious liberty party, and has ordered the prosecutions stopped. Both sides are sanguine of success. A representative of the Chronicle asked Attorney Blakely how the decision would go. "It [the statute] will undoubtedly be declared unconstitutional," was the reply.

"But the other side tell me that there is not a shadow of doubt that the law will be upheld," was the rejoinder.

"Under the circumstances," the attorney said with a laugh, "I presume we will have to leave the decision of the question to the Judge."
