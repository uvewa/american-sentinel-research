# THROUGH A FIERY ORDEAL

[Republican, Dayton, Tenn., Nov. 8.]

Tuesday the remaining cases against the Seventh-day Adventists were quickly disposed of, and for the first time in twelve months this religious sect in Rhea County can enjoy the resests of perfect religions and civil liberty. These people have gone through a fiery ordeal. They have, many of them, literally been imprisoned and made bond-slaves to the State for opinion's sake. But through it all they have maintained an evenness of faith and a serenity of temper that has challenged and won for them the admiration and respect of all classes of people. At this time we do not intend to point a moral or preach a homily on the evil affects of religious prosecution. We believe, however, that the people of Rhea County have received a great light on the question. Certainly a liberal sentiment has been awakened on behalf of religious freedom; and we hope and believe that never again will the Adventists of Rhea County be disturbed in their inalienable right to worship God according to the dictates of conscience. All methods of honest worship are acceptable to God, so long as they do not conflict with His spiritual and moral laws. Conscientious differences of opinion on how to attain heaven should not set men to fighting one another.
