# SPEECH OF JUDGE LEWIS SHEPHERD AT THE ADVENTIST TRIALS IN DAYTON, TENN.

The subject covered in this indictment is one of great importance to the people of this community.

Inasmuch as the Attorney-General said seriously that he was going to insist upon conviction, and chose to treat the matter seriously, I must beg the indulgence of the honorable court and the gentlemen of the jury to offer a few remarks.

Now, may it please your honor, Mr. Snodgrass and myself have volunteered our services to assist the defendant in his defense before the court and the jury of the county, on the grounds that we believe that he is not guilty; he has violated no law, and that he ought not to be subject to any of the penalties.

The law provides that should a man pursue any of the ordinary vocations of life on Sunday, erroneously called "Sabbath," he can be proceeded against, before a justice of the peace, and the fine be covered by three dollars, I believe. That particular act set forth by the statute does not constitute an indictable offense; though if these offenses are continuous in their nature, and so conducted as to become a common nuisance to all, they may be indicted upon common law principles; but there is no statutory law involved in the case.

Now in this particular case there is a gentleman who followed the vocation of a student. (Tis a pity that Mr. Fletcher did not follow the vocation of a student in that college, and spell the words better than they are spelled in this indictment. Now he ought to quit his vocation of attorney-general, and go to some Adventist school and learn how to spell.)

Now, may it please your honor and the gentleman of the jury, the act which is sought to be converted into an act of public nuisance, is not an act of publicity, but of charity. How do we know the circumstances around that house where he was nailing on those boards? There might have been circumstances that demanded this labor, the neglect of which would have endangered the health of his family. It is sufficient to state, and this honorable court will charge you, that works of necessity are of course excluded.

Now, gentlemen, I did not know that a religious question was involved in this case until I heard Mr. Snodgrass; he is quite well posted, as he quotes quite fluently. Reasoning from the proof, one would not know that sort of a question was in this case at all. But as a matter of public concern, that is just what it is.

These people worked on Sunday because they conscientiously believe it is right to so do. Yet it is a matter of such notoriety and concern that we take judicial note of it.

I have been a student of the Scriptures of the Almighty ever since my early infancy. We have heard it every day and Sunday too. Before we retired to our beds at night we read a chapter in the Bible. And Sunday after Sunday, from the time we came into this world, we have gone out to the house of God and heard some minister preach, taking the Bible as the light of the world. And we know one thing, that the Almighty established one thing in this world, and that is our Sabbath. Man has no power to establish any thing of that sort, but God has. And the record that we have in the Scriptures is that God made the world in six days, and when it came to the seventh day, it is said that God looked out on this beautiful world that he had made and he saw that it was good. Then he rested from all his works. And God said that six days of the week thou shalt work and on the seventh thou shalt rest from all thy works.

And this Sabbath was kept by the people of God all along up to the time when Christ and the apostles passed through the wheat field and shelled some wheat to eat, and were unjustly accused of breaking the Sabbath. Now that was a religious question with those people in those days. They were keeping that commandment of our God, to work on the six days of the week and rest on the seventh, as a memorial of the fact that God had worked six days of the week and rested on the seventh. It was a memorial of the rest of God, just like the ordinance of the Lord's supper is a memorial of Christ's death for sinners.

With reference to the moral law in this, the Adventists believe that if they discharge their conscientious duty to God, it is their duty to rest on the Sabbath. Now, in my town, we do not speak of a Sabbath school, but it is a Sunday school. So we do not refer to this Sunday as a sabbath at all; it is simply Sunday. Do you know how Sunday as the Sabbath came about? Why the emperor Constantine said that the Almighty did not know what he did when he established the seventh-day Sabbath, and said he, I shall pass an edict to worship on the first day, Sunday. The pope of Rome, after Constantine had issued that proclamation, addressed to the world an edict establishing the first day of the week as the sabbath.

So they said, We are going to have a new sabbath here. God says, You must keep the seventh day that I rested on; you must rest on that day as a memorial of my rest from my labors; but Constantine says, We will keep another day, and the pope of Rome says, We will keep another.

That is the simple and brief origin of Sunday as a sabbath. We have conformed to this Catholic precedent and joined in and keep the first day of the week instead of the seventh. But how about a man who has conscientious scruples on this subject?

What would you think of a man that pretended to be a follower of the meek and lowly Jesus, who, if there was a law in the State in which he lived that says, "Thou shalt commit adultery," though the moral law says, "Thou shalt not commit adultery," would in compliance with the State law commit adultery? What would you think of a man who pretended to be a follower of God, and who thought it was his duty to keep the seventh day, and because he thought the law required it, would go and violate the law of his God in obedience to the State law?

A man who cannot defend his conscientious belief any more than that, is not a good American citizen. These people believe that the seventh day is the one upon which they should rest, and in which they must worship God, and then they go along and labor six days and do it so as not to disturb anybody. What sort of a nuisance was it to go in there and nail those planks on his house to keep out the cold? This fellow who is witness in this case is over-particular. He is exactly like the Pharisee who shouted out for to crucify the Saviour because he had violated the Sabbath day.

Supposing some fellows should pass a law in this part of the country to the effect that you shall not any more break bread nor drink wine in the commemoration of the death of our Saviour. Would not every earnest Christian disregard that law and go along celebrating the ordinances in the same way, and keep that memorial service? Why, gentlemen, this Sabbath memorial is like the monuments that mark the places of heroic deeds on the battle field of Chickamauga; a stone that marks the place of some still loved dead. It is sacred in the bosom of those who honestly believe in the seventh-day Sabbath.

Now, gentlemen of the jury, in this free America, the home of the oppressed of all the earth, where a man can come under the glorious protection of the Constitution, and worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience, where there can be no religious tests required; in this free America, are you prepared to say that when these men have simply exercised what they believed to be their conscientious duty, and have conscientiously kept the commanded law of the Lord Almighty, that they have committed a nuisance?

Gentlemen of the jury, I know a great many of you, and those that I do not know, I can see honesty and intelligence beaming out of your countenances; and I have too much confidence in you to believe that you will pronounce a verdict other than "not guilty."
