# PRESS COMMENTARY

A TENNESSEE paper, the Jewish Spectator, of Memphis, in its issue of the 8th inst., notes the victory gained for religious liberty in Rhea County, that State, and says:—

We congratulate the AMERICAN SENTINEL and all secular and religious papers, who championed the cause of those conscientious Sabbatarians. We believe firmly that the influence of the press contributed much to this victory of right over wrong, of justice over bigotry, because but a few months ago several Advents were sent to prison for the same offense by a verdict of the same court.

The press has indeed done good service in the struggle of the Tennessee Adventists for equal rights, but those Tennessee papers that have spoken out fearlessly for liberty are entitled to even greater credit than their contemporaries of other States.
