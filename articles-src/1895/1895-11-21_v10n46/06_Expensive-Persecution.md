# EXPENSIVE PERSECUTION.

[The Leader, Dayton, Tenn. Nov. 8.]

LAST Tuesday disposed of the remaining cases against the Seventh-day Adventists in this county. Hon. H. C. Snodgrass, of this city, and Col. Shepherd, of Chattanooga, defended the accused Adventists, verdicts of not guilty being returned in every case but one, and that was dismissed by the attorney general. Thus ends a series of religious persecutions that were a disgrace, as as well as an injury, to the county, and ought not to have been commenced.

We say religious persecution, because the facts show nothing else. There are hundreds of men within sight of the courthouse, and elsewhere in the county, who labor at their usual avocations every Sunday and they were not molested, for no reason under heaven only that they were not Adventists. But the bigoted grand jurors of the last November and March terms, with a spirit of fanaticism and intolerance worthy of the dark ages, shut their eyes to the Sunday lawlessness that is being carried on openly under their very noses here in Dayton and elsewhere in the county, while they raised their hands in holy horror over the alleged wickedness of a little band of Seventh-day Adventists down at Graysville, five miles away! And it is a fact that cannot be controverted that there was scarcely a man on those two grand juries who is not violating the Sunday laws of the State, either in spirit or in letter, at least fifty-two days in the year. Why, it is a notorious fact that some of the members of those grand juries who found indictments against the Adventists, openly defied the law by compelling their hired help to pick berries on Sunday during the berry season of last summer. And it is such holier-than-thou hypocrites as these, who wantonly put some of our most honorable and industrious citizens to needless humiliation and trouble, besides plunging the county into a heavy bill of expense. It is estimated that the persecution of the Adventists cost Rhea County, directly and indirectly, at least $2,000, and we have nothing to show for it only the gratified malice of a few fanatics.

We want it distinctly understood that the LEADER does not advocate lawlessness of any kind; but we believe in even-handed justice. We do not believe in singly-out any particular class of our citizens for persecution, because of alleged offenses thousands of other citizens are permitted to carry on with impunity. Let us have a fair deal, with the law enforced impartially and no more persecution because of religious belief.
