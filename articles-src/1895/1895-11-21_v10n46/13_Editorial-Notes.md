# EDITORIAL NOTES

ANY ONE RECEIVING THE AMERICAN SENTINEL without having ordered it may know that it is sent to him by some friend. Therefore, those who have not ordered the SENTINEL need have no fears that they will be asked to pay for it.

THE Independent says: "Efforts are being made to bring about a union between the Prohibition, Populistic and Socialist parties in a single National Reform party."

It is stated that "two colored men, both Protestants, one an alumnus of Oberlin, and the other of Amherst, have entered as students in the Catholic University at Washington."

THE friends of religious liberty everywhere will hold in high esteem Ex-Congressman H. C. Snodgrass, of Sparta, Tenn., and Ex-Judge Lewis Shepherd, of Chattanooga, for their able and unselfish defense of the persecuted Adventists of Rhea County, that State.

THE papers of Dayton, Tenn., especially the Republican and the Leader, are entitled to great credit for the decided stand they took from the very first against the persecution of the Adventists in that community. All honor to them for their outspoken advocacy of human rights.

THE persecution of Seventh-day Adventists, under color of the unjust Factory Act, still continues in London, Eng. November 1, the publishers of Present Truth, were, for the third time, summoned before the Police Court for Sunday work done by certain of their employés. They were fined forty-two pounds ($204) and the costs will be about ten pounds additional. The manager of the office writes us: "We do not see how we can avoid being closed up in our manufacturing department by the seizure as they will be sure to remove more than one hundred pounds' worth of goods to satisfy the fine, and our small plant will be crippled by such a loss."

THE Sunday-law contest has been going on in this city for almost a year past and the end is not yet.

At first this contest was ostensibly a fight against the Sunday saloon, but it has been all the while in reality a determined and persistent effort to advance the interests of the so-called "Christian sabbath."

It is true that the saloons are more generally closed on Sunday than formerly, but the enforcement of the "law" has not stopped there. Numerous arrests have been made for the most trivial causes. Police spies have repeatedly, by lying to them, induced small dealers to violate the "law" by selling some small article such as a paper of pins, a pair of stockings, three cents' worth of stationery, a clean collar, or something of that nature, and have then arrested them. Only a few days since an itinerant flower vender was arrested in Harlem, this city, for selling a bunch of violets on Sunday, and the regular florists have been notified that they will be arrested if they either sell or deliver flowers on Sunday hereafter.

As before remarked, the leaders in this movement profess that their object is simply to enforce the "law" and to close the saloons on Sunday. But one of the leading clergymen of this city announced from his pulpit a few weeks hence, that the real object was to secure the observance of the "Christian sabbath;" so that the issue is no longer an obscure one, and every man, woman and child has opportunity to act intelligently in the matter. The question is, Shall the power of the State continue to be used to enforce a religious dogma?

Or the acquittal of the indicted Seventh-day Adventists at Dayton, Tenn., on the 5th inst., the Chattanooga Times says: "This ends, for the time being at least, one of the most celebrated struggles for religious liberty ever waged on American soil. It has been a valuable object lesson to the people of Rhea County. The scenes and incidents attending the trial of these people, their submission to what has seemed the harsh and arbitrary operations of the law, the speeches made, the literature produced—all of these things have tended to throw light upon the dark places, and a perceptible spirit of liberality and tolerance for other people's rights is now seen and felt."
