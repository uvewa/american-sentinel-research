# THE "AUTHORITY" FOR SUNDAY.

The Independent (New York), of Nov. 7, contains a symposium on the Sunday question, in which prominent writers of various denominations participate. It will be interesting to one candidly seeking for information on the question of the authority for Sunday as a day of rest, to note the divergent and contradictory positions taken by those thus selected to speak for Christendom in the matter of Sunday observance; each one speaking, as he does, for the church of which he is an adherent. It would seem that in the face of such a divergence of opinion respecting the nature and claims of the Sunday institution on the part of those supposed to be the best informed in the matter, and the most capable of judging correctly, if for no other reason, some latitude might be allowed people in shaping their own conduct in the matter of Sunday observance. Such, however, is not the case, so far as the "law" is concerned; that prescribes how each and every one shall act on Sunday (no matter how he may think) in order to show a due regard for the day. If he has any latitude in the matter, it is that which he takes himself, in disregard of the "law."

We will note briefly some of the statements made by these different contributors to the fund of general information concerning the authority for Sunday observance.

Cardinal Gibbons states the Roman Catholic position, which is that Sunday as a religious day rests on the authority of "the church." He says: "The church desires us on that day to be cheerful, without dissipation, grave and religious without sadness and melancholy. She forbids, indeed, all unnecessary servile work on that day; but as 'the Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath,' she allows such work whenever charity or necessity may demand it. And as it is a day consecrated not only to religion, but also to relaxation of mind and body, she permits us to spend a portion of it in innocent recreation."

Talbot W. Chambers, D. D., attempts to find a scriptural foundation for observing the day as the Sabbath. He says that the Scriptures nowhere teach the abolition of that law of which the Sabbath is a part, or the abolition of the Sabbath alone; that the institution still rests, therefore, upon the authority of the fourth commandment; but that "the change of the day leaves the fourth commandment unimpaired," so "that the precept will be found to apply to our day as well as to the old economy." As to the authority for the change, he admits that "there is no direct precept," but says that "we hold that there is a clear implication of divine authority in the fact that on the day of, his resurrection our Lord appeared five different times to his disciples, that precisely a week afterward he appeared again to the eleven, that Pentecost occurred on the first day of the week, that the church at Troas assembled for worship on the first day (Acts 20:7), that Paul enjoined the Galatian and Corinthian churches to 'lay by in store' on that day for charitable purposes (1 Cor. 16:2), and the Apostle John received the wondrous visions of the Apocalypse on 'the Lord's day' (Rev. 1:10), which could have been no other than the Christian rest-day."

But the "implication" which rests upon these seeming's substantial grounds is far from "clear," even were such an implication a sufficient basis for faith, which it is not. For,

1. It was but natural that the risen Saviour in his love and pity for his grief-stricken and bewildered followers, should show himself to them immediately after his resurrection. There could be no reason for leaving them in their despair even for a day, and there is no hint that the Saviour had any other purpose in this than that of reviving their joy and their faith.

2. There is no scripture which states that "precisely a week" afterward he appeared again to the eleven; the record is that his appearance was "after eight days." As there are but seven days in a week, how it was that he appeared after eight days from the day on which he rose, and still precisely one week from that day, is a mystery which only the necessity of finding proof where there is none can enable any mind to comprehend.

3. Pentecost did not occur on the first day of the week, but on the seventh, being the filtieth day from the Passover (Lev. 23:5, 10, 15, 16), which in the year of Christ's crucifixion came on Friday. The Passover lamb was a type of the "Lamb of God." Horatio B. Hackett, D.D., LL.D., an eminent Baptist scholar and author on biblical subjects, says that "it is generally supposed that this Pentecost, signalized by the outpouring of the Spirit, fell on the Jewish Sabbath, our Saturday."*

4. The fact that the church at Troas assembled on the first day of the week to break bread, furnishes no proof of the sanctity of that day, for the early Christians engaged very frequently in this ordinance.

5. There is no scriptural connection between the act of regularly laying by money for the poor and the observance of the Sabbath. Both are Christian acts, but the former is appropriate on any day of the week.

6. The "Lord's day" is, by the authority of Scripture, the seventh day of the week,—the Sabbath.†

Following this attempt by Mr. Chambers to find the institution of Sunday rest established upon the fourth commandment, or a "clear implication" of such a thing, Prof. J. Henry Thayer, D.D., of Harvard University Divinity School, sets forth that "the Sabbath is an integral and distinctive part of Judaism; and Judaism for the Christian is 'antiquated and abrogated' by Christianity;" and that consequently there is no Sabbath law for Christians. "For a Christian man," he says, "there is no 'law of Sabbath;' (1) because the Sabbath is a Jewish institution; (2) because the Christian is free from the obligations of the Jewish law; and (3) because the teaching and practice of the Christian Church for centuries indisputably and abundantly substantiates these positions." But it is a question whether those whose teaching and practice "substantiated" such positions, were at any time during those centuries more harmonious or scriptural in their Sabbath views than are the theologians of the present day.

Thus we are told (1) that the first-day sabbath rests upon the authority of "the [Catholic] church;" (2) that it rests upon the authority of the fourth commandment; and (3) that the fourth commandment and all the rest have passed away with Judaism, and that there is no law of the Sabbath for Christians, since they are "not under the law." Prof. Th. Lahn, of the University of Erlangen, is equally positive that Sunday cannot be regarded as a continuation of the "Jewish Sabbath," and says that "it never entered the minds of the Christians of the first three centuries . . . to call it [Sunday] the Sabbath. Not until the fourth and fifth centuries do we find the beginnings of this way of regarding the subject."

From other contributors we learn how far the modern practice of various countries of Europe is in harmony with these conceptions of the day; also what legislation there has been on the subject in the United States, and what (in the view of some) we ought to have both in legislation and practice at the present time. The one writer whose statements regarding the nature and foundation of the Sabbath are sustained by scripture and by reason, is A. H. Lewis, D. D., Seventh-day Baptist, whose argument is not for Sunday at all, but for the seventh day.

If from all this there is anything clear, it is that any scheme to compel all persons to act alike in the matter of Sabbath observance, is contrary to justice and common sense, and can only succeed in making hypocrites. And since a law of the land must be for all alike, and from all human standpoints anything like harmony of thought or of conscientious action in the matter is out of the question, it is plain that reason does not call for any human legislation on the subject of Sabbath observance.

There is, however, plenty of good and harmonious and reasonable authority for the Sabbath instituted by God at creation, and legislation which fully covers the subject of Sabbath observance is in force to-day, and to which no difference of human opinions on the subject offers any objection. And that authority and legislation are found in the Word of God. But the administration of that law is in the hands alone of its divine Author, and of its violation human governments have no jurisdiction.
