# THE AMERICAN INQUISITION.

**EDITOR AMERICAN SENTINEL—Dear Sir:** The illustrated number of your valuable paper of Aug. 15, 1895, lies before me, and language falls me to give expression to my feelings as I hear of my fellow-creatures being thus persecuted for conscience' sake. I have read with horror of the inhuman deeds of the ecclesiastical butchers who did the bidding of that sacrilegious tribunal, the Roman Inquisition, where prisoners were, by the "mother of harlots," immured in filthy dungeons without light, without air, where they suffered with cold, were covered with vermin; with no sound to break the sombre silence of their dismal dwelling-place, other than the creaking of the machinery with which their immolators applied the torture, mingled with the sobs and moans of the maimed and dying.

I had hoped that the inquisitorial fires of the past having gone out, the blackened ruins which remain as a mark of the infamous work of that dread tribunal would serve as a sufficient warning to succeeding ages. But with sadness I see that America, from whose shores I am now absent as a missionary, though once the "home of the free," is following the example of the nations of the Dark Ages, by becoming a persecutor. And liberty, the most priceless boon of God to man, and that for which our forefathers pledged their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor, is no more. The parallel between the present and the dark past is complete.

Torres de Castilla, in his work entitled, "History of Political and Religious Persecutions," Vol. 1, p. 787, speaking of the Roman Inquisition, says:—

The criminals are there confounded together; not only are there those condemned for cases of conscience, but also malefactors judged by the ordinary tribunals, and it is not a rare thing to see bound to the same chain an honorable man, condemned for suspicion of Judaism, because he was never seen to eat pork, and a brigand or a robber on the public roads.

That the Tennessee Inquisition is a reproduction of this, and is, therefore, a disgrace to American civilization and jurisprudence, is clear. Then criminals, and those condemned for "cases of conscience" were confounded together. So are they in Tennessee. Then some were criminals, and some were those who dared to worship the Lord of hosts as their conscience dictated. Then an "honorable man" and the perpetrator of some outrage were chained together. So in Tennessee; the Adventists are honorable men. This was admitted by the judge who sentenced them. Their sole crime(?) consisted in practising what their persecutors call a kind of "Judaism," viz., keeping the commandments of God as they read. This in the Dark Ages sent then to work in chains. It does the same in Tennessee. That was the Inquisition, and this in Tennessee is the the Inquisition. Was there ever a more complete parallel? Never. That iniquitous institution which was the scourge of past ages, has lifted its head in "free(?) America," and persecution stalkas through the land.

Here in this part of the earth are many in whose minds the gospel shines but dimly, and who bow down to wood and stone, and commit many deeds of cruelty. Yet these deeds have been rivalled by many committed in the name of Him who on Calvary prayed for his murderers. And as I scan in vain the map of civilization, from the frozen regions of Siberia to the sunny slopes of California, for a place where religious freedom is the perfect guarantee of every man, involuntarily the query arises in my mind, Will the abor'gines of the Dark Continent become the conservators of religious liberty, and offer an asylum to the oppressed, as did the red man of the New England forests in the days of Roger Williams?

With the persecuted, as a friend and brother, I can, and do, sincerely sympathize. Yet they do not need it, for no greater honor can fall to the lot of mortal man, than to be "counted worthy to suffer shame for His name." It is their persecutors who are in need of pity. When they stand before the last tribunal, where God, and not man, shall be the Judge, and from whose decision there will be no appeal, then their work will appear as it is. It is to be hoped that "blindness in part" only has happened unto them, and that they, like the Pharisees of old, will go and "learn what that meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice."

Yours truly,

G. B. THOMPSON,

Grahamstown, S. Africa,

Sept. 30, 1895.
