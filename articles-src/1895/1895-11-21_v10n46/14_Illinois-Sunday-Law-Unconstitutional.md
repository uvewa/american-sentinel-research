# ILLINOIS SUNDAY LAW UNCONSTITUTIONAL.

[Special Dispatch to the American Sentinel.]

CHICAGO, Nov. 17.—The case of Manager Eden, of the Great Northern Hotel, who was arrested here some weeks ago and fined for the violation of the Cody Sunday Law, passed at the last session of the legislature, came up for final hearing in the Circuit Court yesterday. The closing remarks were made by the counsel on each side, and the venerable judge then gave his decision upon the law, pronouncing the statute unconstitutional and void. He held that the pretended law was a flagrant violation of the plain provisions of the constitution of this State which declares positively that "in all cases when a general law can be made applicable, no special law can be enacted." The Judge held that the purpose of law is to enforce justice, not to be used as an instrument of persecution and damage to the private business of any citizen. Special and inequitable legislation is entirely without the delegated powers of the law-making body.

The decision is eminently satisfactory to the friends of personal liberty and is a stinging defeat for the Sunday advocates who have been arresting the barbers by the score almost every week, for a long time past. These arrested men, by the advice of Attorney Blakely, have refused to pay either fines or costs, on the ground that they violated no law; and now this decision will prevent the Sunday-closers from collecting the money. They will have to pay it over themselves, or the justices go without their pay. The latter is the most probable course, however, as it is understood that some of the justices were in league with the association on a division of profits. Their great respect for this particular "law" was augmented by an expected harvest. But the decision has thrown them into confusion, and they will be under the necessity hereafter of sympathizing with each other in the "mass" meetings, one of which the Sunday-closers have called for this afternoon.

An appeal to the Supreme Court was at once taken by the Barbers' Sunday-closing Association. The Chicago barbers are greatly at variance on the subject of Sunday-closing, a majority of the owners of shops being against the "law," while the men who do the actual work are equally divided over the matter.

Pending the appeal the prosecutions are to be stopped and the State of Illinois and the city of Chicago are again without a Sunday "law" of any value to the Puritanical Sunday closers.

Judge Gibbons, who presided, held court in one of the largest court rooms in the city, and still there was too little room. At every Sunday-law hearing there is an immense audience which evidently shows the interest that the public takes in this decision. In Chicago, at least, Sundayism is the great question of the hour. It has occupied more space in the Chicago Record the past few weeks than any other question. The interest in the agitation is difficult of explanation on any other hypothesis than that the Sunday controversy is the coming great political question of the times.
