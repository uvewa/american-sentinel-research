# SHALL RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION CONTINUE?

[Rev. E. T. Hissow, D. D., in the Examiner, Nov. 7.]

No man who deserves the name of Baptist, and is worthy to share the honorable history of the fathers who suffered in New England, Virginia and elsewhere, two and a half centuries ago, not to mention earlier times, but will protest against the application of civil tests to matters of faith, or the infliction of civil penalties for dissent in matters of religion, no matter who may be the sufferers. Every man has equal rights with every other man in concerns of conscience and religion. Baptist and Pedobaptist, Protestant and Romanist, Mormon and Pagan, all stand on common ground as to the rights of faith and worship, so long as no one else is wronged, or his rights invaded by their means.

The recent cases of prosecution—persecution, it has very properly been called—have been aimed almost exclusively at the Seventh-day Baptists, for engaging in secular employment on Sunday, they observing Saturday as their Sabbath. The Seventh-day Baptists and Seventh-day Adventists are separate and distinct denominations. With the former I have been familiarly acquainted from my childhood. More quiet, orderly and industrious people can nowhere be found than they, nor better citizens. And as Christians, none are more consistent, devout or loyal to their convictions and their creeds. As to the Adventists, I have no personal knowledge. But in the numerous cases in which they have been before the courts, as law-breakers, for working on Sundays, the testimony of witnesses, lawyers, and even of the judges, has almost uniformly been that, except in that one thing, they were good citizens, kind neighbors, and men of most praise-worthy character and upright conduct. The Sunday work for which they have been prosecuted, fined and imprisoned has usually been some trivial matter, like cutting wood for the fire, or hoeing in the garden, and seldom, if ever, in sight of a place of Sunday worship, and very seldom even in sight of a human habitation. Those who have informed against them have usually discovered them at work by accident, or spied them out for the purpose of having them arrested. These facts appear on their trials, and are as dishonorable to those who inform against them as they are to the States which enact and maintain statutes so detestable, and so capable of being made instruments of oppression to persons innocent of all crime save differences of religious opinion.

These shameful transactions have been going on up to this year of grace, 1895. They are going on now. Religious persecution did not cease with the Dark Ages, nor confine itself to barbarous lands. . . . The base work goes on, and religious tests continue to be enforced against good citizens and otherwise blameless Christian men.
