# NO SPECIAL LAW FOR SUNDAY.

[The Sentinel, Kings County, Cal., Aug. 1.]

The only Sunday law that we need is to see that everybody behaves himself on Sunday as well as he does on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. We are tired of this "Sunday law" clatter.

As long as we are peaceful and obey the civil laws on Sunday we don't want any religionist to question or to dictate what we shall do on Sunday, or any other day, in a religious way. "Freedom to worship God" was one of the first songs of the Pilgrims, and why are people in this nineteenth century so little, so niggardly, so narrow-headed as to make or seek to make laws of religious force?
