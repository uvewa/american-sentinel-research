# THE AUTHORITY FOR THE SABBATH.

HAVING considered the "authority" for Sunday as the weekly day of rest, and having noted the confusing and conflicting theories and assumptions of which that "authority" consists, it is well to take at least a brief view of the authority for the seventh-day Sabbath, designated in Scripture as the "Sabbath of the Lord." Otherwise it might be thought that there is no well-defined authority with regard to the Sabbath and Sabbath observance.

The authority for the seventh-day Sabbath rests on no assumption on the part of "the church" of power to set apart and command a day of rest, nor of any mere "implication" of divine warrant, but upon the clear and explicit command of God. While the ancient people of God were assembled in vast and solemn audience around the base of Sinai, from the top of the smoking, quaking mountain, while the whole earth shook, God spoke these words:

Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy; six days shall thou labor and do all thy work, but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God; in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates; for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day; wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed it. Ex. 20:8-11.

In this clear and simple language, consisting largely of words of one syllable, and suited to the comprehension of a child, God has set forth to the world the divine nature, authority, and obligation of his day of rest.

Why is it, then, that men are in such confusion and disagreement upon this subject? There can be no other reason than that they have turned aside from this plain word of the Lord and attempted to establish a different day upon God's foundation, or upon some foundation of their own. When people cut loose from the word of God, they can do nothing but drift, without chart or compass, upon the wide sea of human fancy and speculation.

The seventh-day Sabbath is the memorial of creation, and creation is the visible token of the power of the true God. "All the gods of the nations are idols; but the Lord made the heavens." Ps. 96:5. The Sabbath commandment stands in the bosom of the Decalogue, as that which points out the true God, and the keeping of it is the visible sign to the world of those who are worshipers of the true God. It is their own evidence of their relation to the true God. For God has said: "Hallow my Sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between me and you, that ye may know that I am the Lord your God." Eze. 20:20.

Is it possible, then, that this memorial of creation, this sign of the true God among so many false gods, could pass away while the Creator still maintained his sovereignty in human affairs? Is it not evident that this memorial is an absolutely essential part of God's plan for making himself known to mankind, and leading them to trust in him for salvation?

Redemption itself, which is secured to man by the gospel, is nothing else than creation,—making the sinner new in Christ, causing him to be "born again." Ps. 51:10; Eph. 2:10; Gal. 6:15; 2 Cor. 5:17. Hence the memorial of creation,—the seventh-day Sabbath,—is an appropriate and necessary feature of the gospel plan which saves men from their sins.

In the light of these truths, we see the force and propriety of the Saviour's statement that "the Sabbath was made for man." Mark 2:27. It was as much a necessity for man as the knowledge of the true God was a necessity. If the Sabbath had been kept by all, there could never have been any idolatry.

Such being the nature and purpose of the Sabbath, it is seen to be totally distinct from those ceremonies and ordinances which in the days of "Moses and the prophets" pointed forward to Christ, the coming sacrifice,—the shadows, as it were, cast by his body. It could no more pass away than God's eternal purpose could pass away. It has in it no elements of a temporal nature. And nowhere in the Word of God can a text be found which releases any man from its obligation.

It is true that Christians are "not under the law, but under grace," and have been called "unto liberty." But what is liberty? David said, "I will walk at liberty, for I ask thy precepts." Ps. 119:45. And Jesus pronounces a blessing upon the one who looks into "the perfect law of liberty," and continueth therein; and we know that the "perfect law" is the law of God. Ps. 19:7.

The liberty that comes through Christ is not liberty to break the law or disregard it, but liberty to keep it; for men cannot keep it until they receive the grace of God. While they desire to do right, they find themselves in the bondage of sin, so that they cannot do the things that they would do. As Paul has so graphically expressed it, "The good that I would I do not; but the evil which I would not, that I do. . . . I find then a law, that when I would do good, evil is present with me. For I delight in the law of God after the inward man: but I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members. O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from this body of death?" I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord." Rom. 7:19-25.

This deliverance from the bondage of sin, so that an individual can do the good that he would do,—in other words, can keep that law which is the standard of goodness, is the liberty that is obtained through Christ. In Christ we are no longer under the condemnation of the law, but are created new and made in harmony with the law of God, as was Adam when he was created in Eden.

The trouble is not with the law, but with man, who is fallen. Not the abolition of the law, but the regeneration of man, is the purpose of God in the gospel. "For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh; that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit." Rom. 8:3, 4.

Thus the law of God has not passed away, nor the Sabbath commandment which was set in its bosom. The Sabbath of the Lord rests to-day, as it ever has rested, upon the authority of God's word, and that word is as clear and plain to-day, as solemn and as binding, as it was when spoken from Sinai.
