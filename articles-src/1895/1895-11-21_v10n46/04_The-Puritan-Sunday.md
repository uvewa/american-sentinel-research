# THE PURITAN SUNDAY.

WHILE so much sighing is being done in our land by zealous Sunday "law" advocates for "a breath of the Puritan," it is of interest to look upon a picture of the Puritan sabbath as exemplified in the lives of the Puritans of colonial New England. This we find in an article which forms part of a symposium on the Sunday question in the Independent, of Nov. 7, entitled, "The Sunday of the Puritan Colonies," by Alice Morse Earle, from which we quote:

The strict observance of the daylight hours of the sabbath was carefully cherished and protected by colonial law. The act of the Massachusetts Court in 1649 that "whoever shall proplane the Lords days by doeing any seruill work or such like abuses shall forfeite for every such defaults ten shillings or be whipt," was no dead letter. The New Haven code of laws, sterner still, ordered that profanation of the Lord's day should be punished by fine, imprisonment, or corporal punishment, "and if proudly, and with a high hand against the authority of God, with death." Everywhere throughout the colonies "Wanton Gospeliers," who profaned the sabbath, were caged and labeled and fined and imprisoned; but none were put to death.

The so-called "Blue Laws" of Connecticut, while false and belittling in wording, afford, after all, in spirit true exemplification of the old Puritan laws of sabbath observance which existed and were regarded throughout New England in colonial times. People were fined, reprimanded and punished for traveling, for riding, for unnecessary walking, for doing housework and farmwork on the sabbath. In the colonial court records scores, almost hundreds, of examples can be found of offenders and offenses of this class. For shooting wild fowl, for fishing, for driving cows, for grinding corn, for raking hay, for wringing and hanging out a washing, for gathering vegetables, for pulling flax, and many similar and more simple offenses the punishments were most mortifying and relatively severe. Some of these offenses were so natural as to appear to us to-day thoroughly harmless—such as sitting under an apple tree in an orchard, for which illegality and sabbath profanation two innocent New London lovers, John Lewis and Sarah Chapman, were tried in 1670. Let their names be posthumously honored as an expression of regard for their romantic and bold sentiment.

Not only were the colonists fined and punished for active disregard and violation of the sabbath, but they could not passively neglect the day. The church records throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries show prompt censure and action in the church against persons of all ranks and stations in life who failed to attend public worship. As matters of Church and State were never widely separated in early New England, the action of the court promptly supplemented that of the church. It was one of the duties of the ubiquitous felting man to report "all sons of Belial, lying at home, strutting about, setting on fences, or otherwise desecrating the day."

In 1760 the legislature of Massachusetts passed afresh the law that "any person able of body who shall absent themselves from publick worship of God on the Lords day shall pay ten shillings fine." In Connecticut a similar law was not suspended till 1770. Strictly were these laws enforced in the seventeenth century. No petty excuses served to exonerate or permit escape from punishment. Often even sickness in the family was deemed an insufficient reason for church absence. Not only the Puritans themselves, but those of other denominations, such as Episcopalians and Quakers, were fined for non-attendance on public worship in the Puritan meeting house. The Quakers were fined and set in the stocks and caged and whipped for refusing to attend the meetings of the church they hated, and where numbers hated them. And as they were whipped if they came within the Puritan meeting-house and expressed dissatisfaction by word or demeanor, and whipped if they stayed away, it was truly well for them to fly to Rhode Island's welcoming arms as "a place for their setting down satisfying."

It would not seem to us to-day that the church services of the Puritans could always have proved attractive to church-goers. The meeting houses were barren, uncomfortable edifices; unheated in winter, unshaded in summer. The seats therein were usually hard and narrow. The services were over-long. Interminable prayers were followed by still longer sermons, the reading of which to-day seems to us well-nigh impossible not only through the bewilderment of mind occasioned by the use of obsolete doctrinal and symbolical phrases, but also through the depth of chilling dullness into which the reader sinks through the absence of spirituality of theme and treatment. As Carlyle said: "By human volition they may be read to-day, but not by human volition remembered." Let us have faith that in the original delivery of these sermons, the earnestness and Christian endeavor of the preacher gave a purport and interest to the words that we lose to day in the manuscript or printed pages. They were certainly deeply beloved of the original hearers, and cherished as powerful exponents of God's Word, as were also the hour-long prayers, and even the tuneless psalm-singing which survived a century of singing by ear, of leadership through memory only, with no sustaining instrumental accompaniment, no recruit of new music, no positive knowledge of the old, and above all with the odious custom of "lining" or "deaconing" the words. Truly, nothing but absolute religious faith could have preserved that cacophonous remnant of music a century and made it the source of spiritual inspiration which it proved to the Puritan then and ever after in its renovated life.

The distance from the home to the meeting house was often great, and often obstructed. The roads were poor, the means of conveyance inadequate; but all this proved no hindrance to church-going. We must remember, throughout the recounting of the many obstacles to church attendance, the many drawbacks, inconveniences and failings of the church services that the true Puritan loved the sabbath, and all it represented to him, with a devotion so intense that he gloried in the obstacles and clung to the drawbacks. He was, like Elijah, jealous for his Lord of hosts. But there was also an element of tenderness in their devotion which found some expression in the quiet and orderliness of the day.

Dear to the children of the Puritans and the Pilgrims was the descending bush of their sabbath eve, and the tranquil rigidity of their sabbath day; true token it seemed to them, not only of the rest decreed in the creation of the world, but of the eternal rest of the hereafter. The universal quiet of the day showed also a pure and unquesting faith which knew no compromise in religion, no halfway obedience to God's law, but rested absolutely on the Lord's day, as was commanded.

This implicit obedience to the letter as well as the spirit of the Word was one of the typical traits of the character of the Puritans, and was to them a vital point of their belief. To this day, among those of Puritan descent, and of faith in the truth and value of the lives of their Puritan ancestors, there still clings a somewhat Puritanic regard of the sabbath; and it is certainly true that in many communities, if a meeting were held, as of old, to get the "Town's Mind" with regard to sabbath observance, that if orderliness and quiet and religious respect to the day could not be enforced by law through fine or imprisonment, there would at least be expressed with force the old-time sentiment of the town of Belfast as to sabbath-breaking and sabbath-breakers—"that all who work or make unnecessary Visits on the Sabbath, they shall be Look't on with Contempt."

One may be pardoned for doubting that the "sabbath" described in these paragraphs was indeed "dear to the children of the Puritans and the Pilgrims." The Puritan "sabbath" resembled too much the "sabbath" of the Pharisees, which, though occurring on the divinely-appointed day, was made burdensome by human regulations. The true Sabbath—the Sabbath of the Lord—our Lord kept, as he himself had made it; but the sabbath of the Jews, as they had made it, he violated by doing upon it acts of mercy which their law, or traditions rather, forbade.

In the light of the plain statement of the Scripture that "the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord," it seems strange to read that "implicit obedience to the latter as well as the spirit of the Word was one of the typical traits of the character of the Puritans." Where in all the Word of God is anybody directed to keep the day held sacred by the Puritans?
