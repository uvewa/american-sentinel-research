NOT AN ADVENTIST.

[Cincinnati Times, Sept. 12.]

WARDEN DYER, of the State convict mining camp at Tracey City, Tenn., has been discharged for embezzlement of State funds, assault on convicts and a variety of misdemeanors. He was one of Governor Turney's pets, and though investigated a half-dozen different times by State commissions and legislative committees, he managed to get whitewashed each time and now goes scot free. Had he been a poor Adventist who attended church on Saturday and sawd stove-wood on Sunday, he would now be serving the sovereign State of Tennessee in a chain-gang.
