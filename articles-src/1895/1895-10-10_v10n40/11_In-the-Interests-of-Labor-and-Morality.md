"IN THE INTERESTS OF LABOR AND MORALITY."

[New York World, Oct. 1.]

Among the criminals who stood before Magistrate Crane in the Jefferson Market Court yesterday [September 30], was Reuben Becker, who keeps a hosiery store at No. 122 Seventh Avenue. He pleaded guilty. Policeman Reilly, who was on the lookout for law breakers, found Reubens store open on Sunday and asked Reuben if he had a pair of stockings for lady's wear. A member of his family, he said, had hung her best Sunday stockings on the clothes line where they attracted the attention of a hungry goat. The goat had eaten them and the now stockingless lady could not go to church.

Reuben sympathized with the unhappy lady and brought out a presentable pair of stockings, price 10 cents. Reilly bought them and arrested Reuben.

"I thought I would be helping the cause of religion," Reuben pleaded in court.

"I don't like to hold you, my good man," said the magistrate, "but it's the law, and I must. Fifty dollars bail for trial in General Sessions."
