# THAT RESOLUTION AT SARATOGA.

[Rev. E. T. Hiscock, D. D., in Western Recorder (Baptist), Sept. 19.]

CONSIDERABLE interest was excited during the late Saratoga meetings by a resolution expressive of sympathy with the Seventh-day Baptists, who, for several years past, have been subjected to prosecutions, fines and imprisonment in several of the States, particularly in the South, because of their secular labors on Sunday, they observing Saturday as their Sabbath. The resolution was offered by Dr. Wayland, first before the Home Mission Society, by which it was finally laid on the table, and then before the Publication Society by which, after a spirited debate, it was enthusiastically passed and substantially by a unanimous vote. The resolution not only expressed sympathy for the sufferers in such cases, but severely and justly condemned the existence of laws inflicting such penalties on any class of citizens because they worship God in a manner different from their fellow-citizens but according to their consciences and their understanding of God's word.

The rejection of the resolution by the Home Mission Society was most unfortunate, because it gave occasion for some to suppose that they favored the enactment and execution of laws compelling men to observe Sunday as a Christian holy day, even though they may honestly believe that the seventh day is still by divine appointment the Sabbath of the Lord our God. Such, however, was not the case. It was said by some that the facts were not well ascertained, and that statements made by the public press were not trustworthy, and they had better wait. When, however, it came before the Publication Society, though the persons acting were largely the same as acted in the other society, yet the debate took a wider range, and the principles involved, rather than the specific acts of persecution, were emphasized, with the result as stated.

It is well known by intelligent readers of the religious as well as the secular press that not unfrequently, for years past, persons who observed Saturday as a Sabbath have been prosecuted for secular labor on Sunday as a violation of some State law requiring abstinence from such labor, except works of charity or necessity. Such laws are intended to preserve the sanctity of Sunday as the day commonly regarded and observed as the Christian sabbath. The Seventh-day Baptists, in common with the Jews, hold that the seventh, and not the first day of the week, is the day divinely appointed for a Sabbath, and that that command has never been abrogated. Therefore they observe it conscientiously as such, and attend to their worldly affairs on Sunday, as others do theirs on Monday. Moreover, they insist, and rightly, that the Constitution gives every man the right to hold and exercise such forms of faith and worship as he may choose without hindrance or exposure to harm. And further, that all laws which abridge the freedom of faith and worship are not only unrighteous, but unconstitutional.

Within the present year, it is asserted, persons have been arrested and suffered civil penalties for secular labor on Sunday in Maryland, Tennessee, Georgia, Mississippi, Florida, Massachusetts and Illinois. Not less than two hundred and seventy days' imprisonment have been suffered by different persons for these so-called offenses. One man in Georgia was condemned to the chain-gang as penalty for his offense, but some unknown friend paid his fine, which he refused to pay, and saved him from the disgrace. And saved Georgia from the disgrace of its infliction, it may also be said. One man in Maryland served thirty days in a prison cell for setting out tomato plants on Sunday.

No true Baptist can contemplate such acts as any other than most disgraceful, and a shame to our civilization. It recalls the persecutions of our fathers in New England and Virginia, who endured a great fight of affliction, fines, imprisonment, even to the whipping post, because they would worship God contrary to perverse and iniquitous human laws. No man is worthy to share the honor of Baptist history who will not protest against applying civil penalties to dissent, or attempting to make conformity compulsory in matters of faith and worship. If men have wrong religious notions, convince them by argument and not by thumb-screws, or prison cells, or chain-gangs, or whipping-posts.

The Seventh-day Baptists I have known from my childhood up, and no more peaceable, orderly and well conducted class of citizens can be found. As religionists they are conscientious, devout, and loyal to their convictions. And they suffer more inconvenience and temporal disadvantage for their religious views than any other class of citizens. And it has never been proven true, as sometimes enviously declared, that they take special pains to make their work on Sunday offensive to their neighbors who keep sacred that day. They do, as of course they must, carry on their farms, their work shops, their factories on Sundays. But having known and lived in the midst of them for years, I believe they do it as quietly as their "first-day neighbors" do theirs on Saturday. If they should make themselves disturbers of the peace, there is in every community a legal remedy.

The Seventh-day Adventists constitute a separate and distinct denomination, of whom I know nothing by personal experience and observation. The charge has been made repeatedly against these people as taking peculiar pains to disturb Sunday and annoy those who wished to keep it holy. As to the truth of such charges I know nothing. But we protest against persecution for conscience' sake, and every man has equal rights with all others to such faith and worship as he may choose, so long as he invades the rights of no one else in the exercise of such rights.
