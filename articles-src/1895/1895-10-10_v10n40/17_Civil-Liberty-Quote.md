"CIVIL liberty is the proper end and object of authority, and cannot subsist without it. It is liberty to that only which is good, just and honest. This liberty you are to stand for with the hazard not only of your goods, but, if need be, of your lives. Whatsoever crosseth this is not authority, but a distemper thereof."

—Winthrop, 1645.
