## HOW A BAPTIST VIEWS IT.

[Copy of a letter to the Editor of the Kentucky Baptist Standard.]

Dear Brother: I was surprised and pained this morning at reading a quotation from your paper of Aug. 15, 1895, supposed to be a part of your comments on articles in the *Indiana Baptist* and *Journal and Messenger*, dealing with the imprisonment in Tennessee and elsewhere, of Seventh-day Adventists, for violating Sunday laws.

Below I give the quotation, which I could wish was a false one, for to me it is sickening to realize that liberty-loving, persecuted Baptists could fall so far below their standard of justice and charity. It says:—

The Adventists are entirely familiar with the laws of the land on the Sunday question, and they get in jail for the very purpose of eliciting the sympathy of the public. We do not blubber over them at all. If they want to keep out of jail let them obey the law like other decent people and they will be certain not to get into trouble. We think the authorities in Tennessee did exactly right in enforcing the law and believe the Sunday laws we have are good, and that they ought to be kept on our statute books and rigidly enforced.

So said the pagan persecutors to the Jews; so said the papal leaders in the days of the Inquisition; so said the New England Puritans to Roger Williams and the Quakers. No, they did not "blubber" over the torture of the rack, the stake and its stifling flames, the saw, the hot irons and the death-dealing sword. No, no, they did not blubber, but they did glory in their shame and in the sufferings of their victims, in the confiscation of their goods, the breaking up of families, imprisonments, and the attempt to utterly annihilate liberty of conscience and the individual right to seek the truth.

Yes, they said, Let them obey the laws (priesthood) like other decent people, and they will be certain not to get into trouble. They also said, Our laws are good; the officers do exactly right in enforcing them, and they should be kept on the statute books. Their actions said this in thunder tones. O shades of the bloody Dark Ages! are we hiding under their covering? are we being led to that hiding place by those bearing the proud name of Baptist, the synonym of freedom of religious belief and conduct?

The writer has perused the pages of the *Indiana Baptist* and *Journal and Messenger* for years, and knows their editors to be loyal Baptists, loyal Christian advocates, loyal Protestants, and loyal citizens of the United States.

With such a record how could they forbear to "cry aloud, and spare not," when the "man of sin" is insinuating by sly, slow, but sure methods, his power over this great people? Union of Church and State is his settled purpose, and all his powers are centered toward that end.

Now, it is shown much larger than a "man's hand" that Protestants are unwittingly becoming his allies. For proof, see resolutions of late conventions of Y. P. S. C. E., W. C. T. U., B. Y. P. U., and nearly every pedo-Baptist gathering in the land, adding also your issue of Aug. 15 as to the enforcement of Sunday laws. I set us analyze:

Nine out of ten who believe in keeping the first day, openly, and often shamefully, violate the Bible and statutory laws on sabbath keeping. Over against this, the practice is, that out of fifty arrests, forty-nine are those who conscientiously observe another day as the Sabbath of the Lord. This proves that religious intolerance and persecution is at the bottom of this virtuous spasm of law observance. How easy to deceive ourselves, and be blinded by a one-idea teaching and example!

When we succeed in making every one bow to the Sunday law, we will next try to distribute the school fund to parochial schools, starting easy, with the Indian schools. Following this, everybody must be christened by a manufactured priest, and a penalty attached for failure to submit. Then come restrictions and burdens laid on us at the dictation of a corrupt, gross, and avaricious Church-and-State power.

Tyranny and oppression in all their forms are likely to creep upon us by such hidden pathways as to be unseen till they are on us with an iron grasp, dealing death to their helpless victims.

Is it possible that Baptists and other Protestants in America can sleep while the monster of popish control is gradually fastening its fangs into the very vitals of our political and religious institutions—yes, in their blind apathy even hasten the inauguration of his fearful reign?

I have been a Baptist since 1859, breaking loose from a strong Presbyterian training. I am also a Sunday keeper, and have taken for granted the righteousness of Sunday laws, till investigation led me to see in them the beginning of civil-law meddling with conscience and religious liberty. This is even more apparent than were the errors of Presbyterianism, from which I fled as dangerous to the truth. I appeal to you as one who loves to stand by the old "land marks," to stand firmly by the principles of our cherished church, adopting the motto, Religious liberty and non-interference by the State with conscience and religious observance of God's ordinances.

Think of it! While we compel the observance of our sabbath, another compels us to desist from immersion because "vulgar and obscene;" still another requires you to christen your baby or have it and yourself debarred the blessings due it from Church and State; another demands a tax on all to support a church, possibly unworthy the name, and with no benefit or virtue as a return.

Let us in the light of history study well the points ahead, and ask ourselves whither are we drifting. Free America may be overthrown with six million open enemies within and eighteen million without her borders subject to orders, and twenty million more drowally indifferent to the issues.

Fraternally yours,

W. A. STUART.

College Place, Wash., Sept. 20.

We believe in a liberal Sabbath, and we have it in the Sabbath which God has given to man. God is the most liberal being in the universe, and in his Sabbath he has given everything that could tend to man's physical, mental, and moral uplifting. He who will keep the Sabbath as God has made it, and as he directs it to be kept (Isa. 58:13), will have a free and most delightful time upon that day.
