## TEACHING RELIGION IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS.

The following from the Daily Sun, St. John, N. B., presents the question of religious instruction in the public schools as viewed by influential church people of Canada, and notices the efforts being made there to make this proposed feature of public-school teaching teaching an accomplished fact:—

The Church of England is a large and influential body in Canada, and in the absence of information to the contrary, may be assumed to have been fairly represented in the synod meeting at Montreal. It is, therefore, a matter of great significance at the present time that the synod has taken such strong ground in favor of religious instruction in the common schools. The discussion occupied several sessions, covering a great part of three days, and nearly every speaker expressed regret that in the schools so little attention was given to the Scriptures and to religious truth and duty.

So far as destructive criticism on this line went there was in the provincial synod almost unanimity. But when it came to positive recommendations, the delegates were not so well agreed. Only a few of those who took part in the discussion would announce themselves in favor of denominational schools as a substitute for the non-sectarian system. Several, however, took the ground that if, as in Ontario, separate schools, with public grants, were permitted to one denomination, they should be allowed to the Church of England.

It is, however, recognized by the Episcopalians, as well as by others, that it is impossible to provide a system in this country under which each church would have its own schools, wherever that church has adherents. We have too many churches and too few people for this. The system which is to live must admit of the cooperation of all the people in scattered country communities for the purpose of primary education. In towns and cities, classification by sects is to some extent possible, but even in the largest cities this separation has only gone to the extent of dividing the Roman Catholics from the Protestants.

A few members of the synod urged that the distinct doctrines of the Church of England should be taught in the schools, but this, of course, would mean that Episcopalians and other Protestants would not work together. The prevailing feeling of the synod seemed, however, to be that the church should not place herself in antagonism to or get out of sympathy with the other religious bodies. It was felt that while the Episcopal body took stronger ground for religious instruction in the public schools than was taken by other Protestant bodies, the other denominations were also becoming more and more anxious over the results of a common school training which has been practically unrelarited.

Recent resolutions passed by the Presbyterian Assembly and by various other church conventions support the belief that the Church of England does not stand alone with the Roman Catholics in favor of combining in the schools religious teaching with secular instruction. A good deal is made of the fact that some of the Australian colonies are giving up the secular system, which had been their boast. The Australians find, or think, that the schools have to some extent failed to accomplish that great part of their proper work, the laying of the foundation of a strong, virtuous and kindly character.

It is complained in this country that our youth are growing up with less reverence than their fathers had. But supposing this to be true, and granting also that the boys and girls are growing up less familiar with the Scriptures than the last generation were, it perhaps is not all the fault of the schools. This is an age of many books, instead of one book, and it may be found that many grown people read the Bible less than they did when they were children. However this may be, it is much easier to declare in favor of religious teaching in schools than to devise a scheme which will provide for such teaching and yet furnish free education, and give guarantees of efficiency.

The synod seems to have recognized the weakness of an abstract resolution which asked for religious instruction and made no suggestion of ways and means. The original report and motion was amended in such a way as to recommend the establishment of parochial or church schools where these are possible.

The tendency of the times is to lay altogether too much upon the shoulders of law and the public schools. Human law is not a panacea; neither has the public school power to cure all of the evils that arise from defective education. It is important that every person should have the right religious education; but the establishment of religious instruction in the public schools affords no guaranty that those attending them will get it; they may be taught religious error, and the wrong kind of religious instruction is very likely to be worse than none at all.

The secular public school is the only one which represents the American principle of equal and exact justice toward all parties. Let each denomination erect and maintain its own schools for religious instruction; and especially, let parents see that a strong influence for morality and uprightness is exerted upon the youth in their homes, for it is the home teaching and influence that is most powerful in shaping the youthful course for usefulness and honor, or for crime and disgrace.
