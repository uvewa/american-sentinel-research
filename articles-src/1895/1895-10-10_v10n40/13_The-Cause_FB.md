THE CAUSE.

BY FANNIE BOLTON.

We look at the multitudes, we sum
The aggregate, espouse
The work that's large, and shun
The feeble, struggling cause.
The small minority we pass.
We love the great success.
We follow with the shouting mass,
And coldly scorn the less.

E'en in the minor throng we choose
The leaders in the van.
E'en in the little scheme abuse
The unpretending man.
We miss the humble and the meek,
And draw toward the proud,
And in the stranger town we seek
For the footsteps of the crowd.

This is the world's way, though we frown
That heathen kill the weak.
O we too on the poor press down
And set aside the meek.
We prove ourselves akin to those
On whom we lay our blame,
And coldly turning from men's woes
We brand ourselves with shame.

But heaven's way hath light divine
To flood our darkness with.
So high its thought o'er thine and mine,
We cry, "God is no myth."
That Light, that Life, that Love that shone
In Jesus and his plan,
Make heaven's cause embrace the lone
And bless the humble man.

"The Cause," we cry, who name his name;
And yet allured by pride,
Or missing of love's heavenly flame,
We pass the other side,
And leave the one poor wandering one
Robbed, bruised beside the way,
Indifferent that in one so lone
Christ pleads our steps to stay.

"The Cause" is that one wandering sheep
Upon the hills astray.
"The Cause" is he who sits to weep;
This is Christ's cause to-day.
And though the multitudes rush on,
God looks for those who pause
To lift the faint, to cheer the lone,
And advocate his cause.
