## Specific Uncertainties

### Page 1, Line 27-28
- **Issue:** Editor names formatting unclear due to dots/spacing
- **Transcribed as:** "ALONEO T. JONES, | · · · EDITORS." and "CALVIN P. BOLLMAN, |"
- **Confidence:** HIGH - "ALONZO" spelling confirmed from masthead (appears to be OCR misread of "Z" as "E")
- **Corrected to:** "ALONZO T. JONES"
- **Note:** The dots appear to be decorative spacing in the original layout

### Page 1, Line 32
- **Issue:** "LEON A. SMITH" listed as third editor with dots/spacing
- **Transcribed as:** "LEON A. SMITH, |"
- **Confidence:** HIGH - name is clear
- **Note:** This matches known editor "L. A. Smith" (LAS) from memory

### Page 1, Line 109
- **Issue:** Scripture reference appears inconsistent
- **Transcribed as:** "Ex. 31:13. This statement of the purpose of the Sabbath is repeated in Exe. 20:12, 20."
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM - "Exe. 20:12, 20" is likely "Ezek. 20:12, 20" (Ezekiel)
- **Decision:** Preserved as "Exe." since that's what appears in scan, though likely abbreviation error in original

### Page 3, Line 153
- **Issue:** Word appears unclear
- **Transcribed as:** "unrelarited"
- **Confidence:** LOW - likely should be "unreligious" but scan shows "unrelarited"
- **Decision:** Preserved as scanned; possible OCR error or original typo

### Page 5, Line 363
- **Issue:** Author attribution unclear
- **Context:** Article "Secular Organizations Not a Means of Grace" attributed to "Francis P. Mullally, D. D."
- **Confidence:** HIGH - clear attribution with source note "From 'The Limit of the Church's Power to Make Declarations'"
- **Decision:** Treated as explicit attribution (author FPM)

- **Transcribed as:** "The Catholic Review, of this city"
- **Confidence:** HIGH
- **Note:** Italics added for newspaper name per standard practice

### Page 7, Line 641
- **Issue:** Text appears garbled
- **Transcribed as:** "THE LINK THAT SINDS TWO GREAT NATIONS"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM - likely "BINDS" not "SINDS" but preserved as scanned
- **Decision:** Kept as appears (advertisement text)

### Page 8, Line 689
- **Issue:** Word unclear in context
- **Transcribed as:** "QUEEN scene"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM - likely should be "QUEER scene" but "QUEEN" appears in scan
- **Decision:** Preserved as "QUEEN" (possibly intentional archaic usage)

### Page 8, Line 291
- **Issue:** Word appears unclear
- **Transcribed as:** "drowally indifferent"
- **Confidence:** LOW - possibly "dully" or "drowsily" but scan shows "drowally"
- **Decision:** Preserved as scanned
