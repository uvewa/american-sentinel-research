A BLUE LAW "CASE IN POINT."

[New York World, Sept. 30.]

August Markert is a Brooklyn barber. He has a baby. He was going to have the baby christened yesterday. A neighbor came in and asked Markert to shave him. When Markert was half through the job a policeman came in and arrested him.

The policeman permitted him, however, to finish the commission of his "crime," thereby making himself a party to it. Then he marched Markert off to court and the court broke up the christening party by sending the poor fellow to jail. But it did not send the policeman to jail as particeps criminis, as it should have done.

If Markert had lived in New York or Saratoga his act would have been lawful and laudable. As he lived in Brooklyn it was what Mr. Roosevelt calls a "crime," and it is punishable by both fine and imprisonment.

That is to say, the "sanctity of the American Sabbath" begins at midnight on Saturday in Brooklyn and everywhere else in the State except New York City and Saratoga. In those two places the day does not become "sacred" so far as barbers are concerned till 1 P.M. But for all other purposes its sanctity is recognized from start to finish.
