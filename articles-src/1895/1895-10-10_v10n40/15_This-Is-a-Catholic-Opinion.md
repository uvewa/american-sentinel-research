THIS IS A CATHOLIC OPINION.

[The Western Watchman (Roman Catholic), Sept. 26.]

BISHOP KEANE, of the University, was one of the speakers at the Law and Order meeting in Buffalo on the 18th, and spoke on Sunday observance. He expressed himself as heartily in favor of the legal enforcement of the Christian Sunday. Bishop Keane has been before the country for twenty years, and spoken on almost every subject that has occupied public attention during that time; and we can honestly aver that he has never failed in a single instance to choose the wrong side of his subject where there were two sides to choose from.

Bishop Keane began making speeches when he was four years of age, and has been doing little else since. His infantile efforts were his best; they lacked much of the pomposity that characterized his subsequent efforts, but they far outstripped them in point and perspicuity. An institution of learning differs from a man of learning in one thing; its brains do not necessarily reside in its head.
