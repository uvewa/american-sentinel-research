# SECULAR ORGANIZATIONS NOT A MEANS OF GRACE.

[From "The Limit of the Church's Power to Make Declarations," by Francis P. Mullally, D. D.]

It has been said that secular societies operating for moral ends are often great helps to the Church in respect to her spiritual work, and that, therefore, the Church should ally herself with them.

If this argument in favor of secular deliverances on the part of the Church is good in one given case, then it is good in an argument in favor of the handling by the Church of all secular matters. Money helps the Church, therefore the Church may tell her people how to make money, and land the successful accumulator of riches. Health helps the Church, therefore it should make scientific deliverances on hygiene and material medicine; and therefore the benefit of education authorizes ecclesiastical deliverances on the best system of government for schools and colleges and universities, and on pedagogy and kindred topics in general.

Dr. Thornwell's answer to this plea for secularity in pulpits and judicatories is conclusive. Writing to his friend, the Rev. John Douglass, he says, speaking directly in relation to temperance societies: "I regard them as secular enterprises for temporal good, having no connection whatever with the kingdom of Christ, a mere embalming of the corpse to arrest the progress of putrification. In this light I think it well that the potsherds of the earth engage in them. They are a great service to society. Others regard them as really helps to the cause of Christ, instruments of building up his kingdom—that is, as a means of grace, for the kingdom of Christ consists in grace. In this sense I oppose them, because they are not appointed by Christ. Their true position is among the institutions of civil society. There I cordially recommend and encourage them." Acting as a citizen, the great theologian recommended societies for moral ends, if they were useful to society, but acting as a preacher and presbyter, he could not recognize them at all, because they were not appointed by Christ as means of grace.

Such means of grace instituted by man are very dangerous. To propose any other good to the sinner than Jesus Christ is very apt, if the sinner complies with the proposal, to result in making the man a self-righteous moralist, and erecting between him and the Saviour the barrier of decency and self-complacency, than which perhaps none affords so great security to unbelief. The work of the Church is to bring men to Christ, and that, in no roundabout way of reform, but directly and immediately by faith in him, even though the sinner be a Philippian jailer, a Corinthian drunkard, or a persecuting Pharisee, or even a greater sinner than either.
