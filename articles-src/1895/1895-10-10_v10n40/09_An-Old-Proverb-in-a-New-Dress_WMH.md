# AN OLD PROVERB IN A NEW DRESS.

BY W. M. HERD.

Some fifteen or twenty years ago the following phrase was frequently repeated and often quoted in the newspapers: "A bad law is more honored in the breach than in the observance."

Strangely enough, it seems to be good currency no longer; or, at least, we see and hear nothing of it since the preachers have taken hold of the law-enforcing business.

I do not know the author of this maxim, but believe it to be at least fifty years old. While in form it is not strictly correct, the idea intended to be conveyed is a good one; for, although one cannot possibly honor a law by breaking it, nor do honor to the law-making power in any such manner, yet it must be conceded that it is more honorable to break a bad law than to observe it.

Otherwise, Daniel and his three friends, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, should have waited for the bad laws to be repealed before they dared to disobey them. So also, the apostles, if modern clergymen are right, should have disobeyed the injunction of the angel when he said, "Go, stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life;" for, had not the rulers, and elders, and scribes, and the chief priests, decided that it was unlawful to do that very thing that the angel commanded?

The rulers commanded one thing; God, through his angel, commanded the very opposite. Ought the apostles to have waited until the unjust decision was reversed, before they obeyed God? Nay, verily; they created public sentiment in their favor by refusing to heed the unjust dictum, and, although, by "due process of law," they were put in prison, the angel of the Lord opened the prison doors and brought them out and commanded them to repeat the very act for which they had been imprisoned!

When asked why they had disregarded the command of the council, they replied, "We ought to obey God rather than men." And that doctrine is just as good for Christians to follow in the United States of America, in the present year of grace, as it was in Jerusalem in A. D. 31.

They would rather die than conform to any law that would interfere with their duty to God, and real Christians to-day have the same mind. Any law which interferes with a man's religion, when his religion does not lead him to trespass on the equal rights of any other individual, is a bad law; bad in its inception, bad in its enforcement, bad in every way. And chief among such laws in the earth to-day, are those which make it a crime to do honest labor on Sunday, thus elevating, as far as civil government can do it, the first day of the week above all other days, and thus discriminating in favor of those whose religious prejudices lead them to regard that day as holy.

Therefore, I would like to see the old maxim, modified a little, obtain popular currency again. Thus: the breach of a bad law is more honorable than its observance.
