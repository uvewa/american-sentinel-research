DAWN IN RUSSIA.

[The Examiner, Sept. 26.]

UNDER this title the New York Tribune publishes a letter, presumably from a well-informed source, to the effect that the new Czar proposes for himself and for his country a policy in harmony with the spirit of the times. It is stated that the startling reactionary address which the young Czar delivered last spring, in which he said, "The Russian throne is based upon the principle of autocracy," and in which he announced "the intention of maintaining this principle, unimpaired, as a heritage from his ancestors," was drawn up by Dournovo, the Minister of the Interior, and that it was very reluctantly delivered by the Czar, in deference to the entreaties of his mother, a very pronounced reactionist, and at the urgent demand of his ministers, enforced by their threats of resignation.

He has now announced his intention of removing Dournovo from the office of the Minister of the Interior, and has requested Pobiedonotzoff, Procurator of the Holy Synod of the Orthodox State Church, to confine himself to his duties in connection with the State Church, and to abstain from interfering with other religious sects, and with the administration of the government generally. Dournovo is said to be the enemy of constitutional government, and of anything like popular freedom. His successor, Sippayine, was formerly governor-general of Courland, and was distinguished for his gentle and considerate treatment of the people. He is a man of liberal and progressive views, and his appointment is regarded as a pledge of the new Czar's inclinations toward a more liberal policy.

If these statements be true, it is a matter for the utmost gratitude. No one can look without profound interest upon a nation including, perhaps, a hundred and twenty million souls; and every Christian may well lift his voice to God, asking that the days of absolutism and persecution may come to an end, and that religions and civil liberty may be enjoyed by all the citizens of the great Northern Empire.
