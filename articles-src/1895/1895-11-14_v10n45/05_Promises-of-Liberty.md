# PROMISES OF LIBERTY.

The Apostle Peter speaks of certain ones going about in the world vaunting their own wisdom and promising the people liberty if they will be guided thereby, yet being themselves "the servants of corruption." 2 Peter 2:19. Under such leadership no real liberty can be attained.

We are to beware of such men and of their promises. Any person who is a servant of corruption,—a man of sinful habits and life,—is not in a position to lead his followers to liberty.

Sin never tends toward liberty, but always in the opposite direction. It tends directly and always toward the enslavement of the soul, the mind, and the body. It is the direct cause of all the slavery that has ever existed.

Many a captive of sin has posed in this world as a leader to bring people into greater liberty, deceiving himself as well as those whom he induced to follow him. The captive of sin can lead only where sin leads; and while seeming at times to approximate to the desired state of freedom, never attains to liberty that is real and permanent. His vision of liberty is an ignis fatuus. Sin is so deceitful in its nature that the human mind is incapable of discerning the end to which it leads.

We should beware of men who go about today speaking vaunting words with which they promise liberty to us if we will be their followers. We are cautioned by the Word of Omnissience to "believe not every spirit," but first to try them, whether they be of God. 1 John 4:1. If their lives and their words be not in harmony with the Word of God, we may safely turn aside from their leadership, however alluring the word picture which they may be able to paint before us. "To the law and to the testimony; if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them." Isa. 8:20.

If we would have the liberty that we desire,—liberty that is real and lasting,—we must follow the lead of righteousness. "Where the Spirit of God is, there is liberty" (2 Cor. 3:17), and that liberty is ours when we have that Spirit with us and are following its lead. And this is only saying in other words that we are walking in the way of liberty when we have the Word of God in our hearts, and our lives are ordered therefor. "I will walk at liberty, for I seek thy precepts."

Whatever liberty it is that we desire, so that it be liberty and not license, we can find no shorter path thereto than the path of those divine precepts which constitute "the perfect law of liberty." James 1:25.
