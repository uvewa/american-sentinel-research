# PROTECTION OF MISSIONARIES.

[By G. B. Thompson, missionary to Africa.]

The recent atrocities committed upon the missionaries in Ku-chang, China, have called forth much comment concerning the duty of protecting missionaries stationed in various countries. It is unquestionably the proper function of nations to protect those who are missionaries.

But judging from the tone of the press the idea seems to prevail, that persons are entitled to governmental protection because they are missionaries, and that special exertions should be put forth to avenge their death for this reason. This is a mistake. It is the province of governments to protect their subjects, both at home and abroad, not because they are missionaries, but because they are citizens. They should demand explanation for the looting of a mission station for the same reason that they would that of a private residence, because it is uncivil, and an invasion of the inherent rights of their citizens. It is their duty to restrain mobs whether those being mobbed are Christians or followers of Confucius. The civil law should not punish because the persons molested were missionaries. The question which concerns the government is not the occupation in which they were engaged, but whether or not they were its citizens. They are entitled to the same protection if engaged in secular work as in a religious calling, whether they be Christians or those who profess no religion.

Governments are instituted among men to protect individuals, not religions, to secure to all the right to worship, or not to worship, according as their conscience may dictate. They are not to foster one religion more than another. They should protect equally those who live in squalor, and those who live in luxury, the irreligious as well as the religious. It is not within the sphere of any department of Government, either legislative or judicial, to determine what constitutes the Christian religion. Christians, Jews, Mohammedans, or infidels, are all equally entitled to protection, regardless of their faith. Governments should protect all and favor none. And true religion asks for no favors, and flourishes in greater purity without governmental aid.
