# LEGISLATING ON MORALITY.

The Outlook (New York), of October 26, notices with approval a recent sermon by the pastor of Grace Church, which laid down the doctrine that "the protected rest day is part of the moral law of Christendom," and therefore that "only sovereign power—such power, I mean, as regulates the tenure of property, the validity of contracts, the conditions of marriage, and the penalty of death—has any right to legislate about it."

"In this contention," says the Outlook, "he seems to us to be clearly right. The adoption of a general Sunday law and the protection of Sunday rest from the incursions of covetousness, clearly belong to the State authority, at least as much as the designation of any other legal holiday."

Are the American people prepared to accept, with its logical consequences, such doctrines as this,—namely, that "the moral law of Christendom" comes within the proper sphere of human legislation? Can man by legislation change that law, or legislate anything into it? In other words, can moral duty be determined by act of Congress or of the State or municipal legislative bodies? If so, then moral duty is as uncertain and changeable a thing as human law.

Of course, no power below that which we term "sovereign power" can rightfully legislate upon the moral law of Christendom; but can any human power rightfully enact such legislation? If so, it must be on a par with God himself; for he has never undertaken any higher legislation than that which constitutes "the moral law of Christendom."

Can it be that some present day theologians have made the discovery that this moral law is incomplete as related to the moral needs of our times, so that there must be human legislation to supply the deficiency? There may be some appearance of this so far as Sunday rest is concerned, for there is no law for Sunday rest anywhere to be found in the moral code of Jehovah.

This fact, however, comes very far short of justifying an attempt to legislate Sunday rest into that law.

Is not the "moral law of Christendom," and every part of it, complete and perfect? Did the Omnipotent ever leave a piece of his work unfinished? and if he had, should man set his puny erring hand to the task of completing it? Then verily would it be seen that "fools rush in where angels fear to tread."

The truth is that God has himself legislated concerning Sabbath observance, and his work is perfect and covers the subject completely, so that there is no room for any further legislation in the matter. And therefore any further sabbath legislation must conflict with that enacted by the Creator, and can work only harm and confusion. And this is exactly what we see. The man-made Sunday law puts another day in the place of the Sabbath of Jehovah, and puts those who keep His Sabbath into the dungeon and the chaingang.

Nor can it be true, as the Outlook says, that "the adoption of a general Sunday law and the protection of the Sunday rest from the incursions of covetousness clearly belong to the State authority, at least as much as the designation of any other legal holiday." Sunday stands upon an entirely different basis from "any other legal holiday," for the simple reason that rest is not made compulsory upon any other legal holiday, as it is on the "protected" Sunday.

The commandment of God says, "The seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work." These are the words of the infinite One, and when they were spoken the earth shook. Heb. 12: 26. The precept of which they are a part is in force to-day, and it would be exceedingly proper for man to refrain from meddling with it. In ancient times, when that law, with the other nine precepts of the Decalogue, was written in the tables of stone, no human hand might touch the ark in which the visible expression of it was contained; and sacrilegious indeed is the hand that would strike at the law itself to-day, by presuming to enact into its place a sabbath law which exalts another day than the one God sanctified at creation. Time cannot diminish anght from the sacredness and the obligation of God's moral law.

"Every word of God is pure. . . . Add thou not unto his words, lest he reprove thee, and thou be found a liar." Prov. 30:6.
