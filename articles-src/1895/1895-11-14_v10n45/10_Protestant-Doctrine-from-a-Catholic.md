# PROTESTANT DOCTRINE FROM A CATHOLIC?

[Evangel and Sabbath Outlook, Nov. 7.]

ARCHBISHOP RIOEDAN, of San Francisco, preached Sunday, Sept. 22, on "The Need of Better Sunday Observance." According to the Examiner of the next day, he said:—

The observance of Sunday lies at the root of our religious life. The Sunday is not the Sabbath; the Sabbath is not the Sunday. The Sabbath was the festival day of the old law, and was the last day of the week. The Sunday is the religious day of the new law, and is the first day of the week. There is nothing in ecclesiastical history to warrant their confusion. By the special ordinance of the early church the first day of the week was set aside in memory of our Lord's resurrection on that day and the descent of the Holy Ghost upon that day. The first day was especially consecrated as that upon which all Christians should worship their Lord. The Sabbath exists no longer for us.

Whether this be Protestant doctrine from a Catholic, or not, it is the exact echo of what Protestants preach, and since the Catholic was in the field with this theory for several centuries before any "Protestant" existed, we are compelled to answer the query which stands above by concluding that Protestants preach the doctrines of the Romish Church touching Sunday, and hence the growth of the "Continental Sunday" in the United States. It is useless to sow tares and then rail at the harvest.
