# BE IT REMEMBERED.

BY W. H. FALCONER.

Canada,
Province of Manitoba,
Town of Gladstone.

WM. BURR, Compt., against
HENRY WHITEHOUSE, Defndt.

BE IT REMEMBERED, That on the twenty-first day of October, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and ninety-five, at the Town of Gladstone, in the said Province of Manitoba, one Henry Whitehouse, of the Town of Gladstone, in the said Province of Manitoba, is convicted before the undersigned, one of Her Majesty's Justices of the Peace for the said Town of Gladstone, for that he the said Henry Whitehouse did pursue his ordinary calling and occupation on Sunday, namely, was picking potatoes on that day on the farm of George Alcock, contrary to a by-law of the Town of Gladstone in that behalf made and provided; and I adjudge the said Henry Whitehouse for his said offense to forfeit and pay the sum of ten dollars to be paid and applied according to law; and also to pay the said complainant the sum of three dollars and fifty cents for his costs in this behalf; and if the said several sums be not paid forthwith, I adjudge the said Henry Whitehouse to be imprisoned in the Common Gaol of the Central Judicial District at Portage La Prairie, and there to be kept at hard labor for the space of twenty days, unless the said sums and the costs and charges of conveying the said Henry Whitehouse to the said Common Gaol shall be sooner paid.

Given under my hand and seal the day and year first mentioned, at Gladstone, in the Province aforesaid.

J. L. LOUIE, J. P. (Seal.)

Yes, be it remembered that in the town of Gladstone, Province of Manitoba, not in Turkey, or Spain, or even in heathen China, but in enlightened Manitoba, in the year 1895, not in the Dark Ages, not during the Spanish Inquisition, but in the age of greatest light and progress, and with an open Bible in the hands of every person, with the warning history of the dark past before us; here and at this time, an honest, God-fearing man is sentenced to fine or imprisonment for doing honest work on a day he does not regard as sacred.

Be it remembered that this same Henry Whitehouse had observed the previous day to the Lord in obedience to His divine command, which says: "The seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work," and imitating our Lord's example, had gone forth to work on the first day of the week. The work was not a noisy, disturbing kind of labor, but quietly picking up potatoes.

Be it also remembered that other men in this same town who do not observe the seventh day, do work on Sunday, and no complaint is made. It is well known that work is carried on in the grist mill, cleaning boilers, etc., but this is decided to be necessary, and why, forsooth? Oh, because the owner would not realize quite as many dollars and cents if this work were done some other day.

Let it be also remembered and come into mind, that the "law" under which this man was convicted does not specify Sunday, or the first day of the week, but simply says, "Whereas it is desirable that a proper observance of the sabbath be enforced in this corporation, the Town Council of Gladstone enact as follows: 1. No person shall pursue on the sabbath his usual vocation in the town of Gladstone, excepting clergymen, doctors, and others engaged in the works of necessity and mercy" (such as cleaning boilers in the mills, etc.) There are other clauses of this law, but in none of them is the day called anything but the sabbath day.

It will also be well to remember that it was in view of this fact that Mr. Whitehouse pleaded "not guilty." He maintained that God himself had said, in living words of which every jot and tittle shall stand as long as heaven and earth exist, that "the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord." And as he had rested on that day, he was not guilty of pursuing his usual vocation on the Sabbath day. The conviction is for pursuing his ordinary calling and occupation on Sunday, which is not the Sabbath, hence the conviction is unjust and wrong.

The men who are engaged in this work of bigotry and persecution should recall the words of the scripture which says: "Who art thou that judgment another man's servant? to his own master he standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall be holden up: for God is able to make him stand." Rom. 14:4.

Be it remembered too, that Her Majesty Queen Victoria issued a proclamation in 1858, in which she said:—

Firmly relying ourselves on the truth of Christianity, and acknowledging with gratitude the solace of religion, we disclaim alike the right and the desire to impose our convictions on any of our subjects. We declare it to be our royal will and pleasure that none be in anywise favored, none molested nor disquieted, by reason of their religious faith or observance, but that all shall alike enjoy the equal and impartial protection of the law; and we do strictly charge and enjoin all those who may be in authority under us, that they abstain from all interference with the religious belief or worship of any of our subjects, under pain of our highest displeasure.

How then can one of Her Majesty's justices of the peace disobey this command of Her Majesty? Does he wish to incur Her Majesty's highest displeasure? Well, why should he fear her displeasure, seeing that he manifests no fear of God's displeasure, in that he disobeys God's plain Sabbath law, and endeavors to enforce a rival sabbath law upon those who honor and revere the law of Jehovah?

These are some of the things to be remembered by these authors of persecution; and we can warn them that this work they are doing will not be forgotten by Him who keeps a faithful record of every thought, word, and act of men. There is kept a book of remembrance in which all the wrongs and injustices done God's people are written.

There is a day coming, and that not far away, when great Babylon will come in remembrance before God to give unto her the cup of the wine of the Sereeness of his wrath. When God will have remembered her iniquities and will say, "Reward her even as she rewarded you, and double unto her double according to her works;" "and in her way found the blood of prophets and of saints." But now we entreat these men to cease their work, and learn in the school of Christ a lesson of meekness and love which will prepare them for the judgments so soon to be revealed; and to all we say, "Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues." See Rev. 10:19; 18:4-8, 24.

And once more be it remembered that "the dragon [Satan] was wroth with the woman [the church] and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ." May the Spirit of Christ open the eyes of our persecutors before it is too late to see that they are fulfilling this prophecy, and may they be led to repent of this work and unite with those of whom it is said: "Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus." Rev. 12:17, and 14:13. And if this shall not be, still we can say in the words of the Master, "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do."

Winnepeg, Manitoba.
