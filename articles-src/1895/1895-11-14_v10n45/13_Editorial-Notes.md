# EDITORIAL NOTES

THE Catholic Review, of the 26th ult., has an editorial on "Persecution not an Unmixed Evil," in which it says: "There are strong indications at the present time that the providence of God is providing, or at least is about to permit, a severe persecution of the church in this country." The Review need not be alarmed; the only "persecution" the Roman Catholic Church will suffer in this country will be having the truth told about her history, doctrines and practices. True, some might desire to go further, and foolish things may be said in the future as they have in the past, but Rome is too large a factor in politics to suffer in this country except from free speech and free press.

THE Western Watchman (Roman Catholic) says: "We are a stout upholder of the Catholic Sunday, as contradistinguished from the Puritan and Continental Sunday; but we do not ask the State to help enforce it. If they close the saloons in the forenoon we will do the rest." That is to say, if the State will close the saloons at the hour of worship in Catholic churches Rome will ask no more. But if the State does that for the Roman Catholic Church why not go further and do all that is demanded by united "Protestantism"? The only consistent and safe course for the State is neither to make nor maintain any law regarding Sunday based in any way upon its supposed sacred character.

"RECENTLY Father Thomas E. Sherman, 'son of the illustrious general,' lectured before a very large audience in this city on 'Americanism and Catholicism,'" says the Christian Leader, of Cincinnati. The Leader continues: "He says, 'In theory I hold that Church and State should be united.' But he is very careful to put in a caveat by adding that 'the theory of a union of Church and State could never be carried out in America.' But we assure him that that is not the fault of the Roman hierarchy, but of a free and independent republic, for Rome, boasting that she is always the same (semper eadem), is only watching her chance to bind her mystical ecclesiastical yoke upon the ignorant, unsuspecting masses of the Republic of America."

CERTAIN "Protestants" were mightily pleased sometime since when certain papal prelates declared in favor of teaching the Protestant religion in the public schools rather than no religion. It seems they laughed too soon; the Western Watchman, in its issue of October 24, says:

When Bishop Keane went over the country a few years ago advocating Protestant teaching in the public schools where the people submitted to it, and Catholic teaching where the people desired it, we pronounced the scheme silly and almost heretical. The holy father [the pope] has just knocked in the head the neo-pelagiarism that teaches that Protestantism is better than no religion.

Those "Protestants" who imagine that the gulf between Romanism and Protestantism is growing less wide because of Rome's yielding anything should remember that "Rome never changes." The drift is altogether on the part of Protestants, and it is decidedly Romeward.
