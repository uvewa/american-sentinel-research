# Uncertainties Log: v10n45 (1895-11-14)

## General Notes
This issue was transcribed from OCR text. The source OCR quality was generally good, but several corrections and uncertainties were noted during transcription.

## Specific Uncertainties

### Page 1, Line 11
- **Issue:** OCR shows "Vol. 10. No. 43." but based on file naming and other references, this should be "Vol. 10. No. 45."
- **Transcribed as:** Left as "No. 43" in masthead since this appears to be a printing error in the original
- **Confidence:** HIGH - this is a known discrepancy between the masthead number and the actual issue number

### Page 2, Line 79
- **Heading formatting:** OCR shows "**LEGISLATING ON MORALITY.**" with bold markers
- **Transcribed as:** Regular heading without bold formatting for consistency
- **Confidence:** HIGH - formatting artifact from OCR

### Page 3, Line 206
- **OCR artifact:** "Sereeness" appears to be OCR error
- **Transcribed as:** "fierceness" (standard biblical phrase "wine of the fierceness of his wrath")
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM - corrected based on biblical context

### Page 5, Line 326
- **OCR error:** "milk adultery" clearly should be "commit adultery"
- **Transcribed as:** "commit adultery"
- **Confidence:** HIGH - obvious OCR misread

### Page 6, Line 358
- **OCR error:** "honde" should be "bonds"
- **Transcribed as:** "bonds"
- **Confidence:** HIGH - clear OCR error

### Page 7, Author initials
- **Attribution:** D. W. Hravis appears in the signature, but this is likely D. W. Reavis
- **Transcribed as:** "D. W. HRAVIS" as it appears, but noted in author_short as "DWH"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM - "Hravis" may be OCR error for "Reavis"

### Article 09, Author
- **Issue:** Byline shows "G. B. Thompson, missionary to Africa" but no matching initials in known authors list
- **Transcribed as:** Full name used, author_short="GBT"
- **Confidence:** HIGH - explicit byline

### Article 11, Author
- **Issue:** "P. C. Mills" appears in reprint attribution
- **Transcribed as:** Full name used, author_short="PCM"
- **Confidence:** HIGH - explicit attribution in source

## OCR Corrections Applied

The following obvious OCR errors were corrected:
- "anght" → "aught" (Page 2)
- "milk adultery" → "commit adultery" (Page 5)
- "honde" → "bonds" (Page 6)
- "pealiery" → "psaltery" (appears twice in Daniel 3 quote)
- "Sereeness" → "fierceness" (Page 3)

## Format Notes

- Running headers and page numbers were omitted from article transcriptions
- Horizontal rule dividers (---) were used to separate articles in the working file
- Advertisement content on pages 7-8 was skipped per instructions
- Masthead includes note "LEON A. SMITH, | AMERICAN EDITOR" which differs from standard editor listing
