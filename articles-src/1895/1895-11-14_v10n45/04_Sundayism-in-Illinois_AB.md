# SUNDAYISM IN ILLINOIS.

BY ADDISON BLAKELY, PH. D.

CHICAGO is taking a hand in the Sunday "law" contest. At the last session of the legislature, a Sunday statute was passed containing no exemption clause for those observing the seventh day as the Sabbath; and now the authorities are undertaking to enforce it. The observers of the seventh day, the observers of no day, and even many believers in Sunday observance regard the statute as unconstitutional and void for several reasons.

The statute specifies that "it shall be unlawful for any person or persons to keep open any barber shop or carry on the business of shaving, hair cutting, or tonacrial work on Sunday within the State;" and that "any person by himself, agent, or employe" violating the act, "shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined in any sum not exceeding two hundred (200) dollars for each and every offense."

An association has been organized to secure the enforcement of the "law," retaining the services of the same attorney that assisted those ministers who, two years ago, endeavored to close the World's Exposition on Sunday. They are raising money and swearing out warrants against all violators of the provisions of the statute. They assert both loudly and frequently that they will maintain their work of prosecution as long as the statute remains in the code.

The man who introduced the bill, and who has given to the "law" his name, is Representative Cody, who, it is said, introduced the bill at the request of two barber friends who wanted to close Sunday themselves, but whose religion was not sufficiently strong to induce them to do so unless they could get a "law" to compel all other barbers to do as they desired to do. And so the "law" was passed.

But just as the "law" got through the two houses of the legislature, opposition began to develop, and letters both pro and con began pouring in on the governor. He was between the horns of a dilemma. Should he veto it and be anathematized by the pros, or sign it and be blanked by the cons? He hesitated—he did neither. The secretary of State therefore took the bill and wrote upon it: "This bill having remained with the governor for a period of ten days (Sundays excepted) after the adjournment of the general assembly, and he not having filed it with his objections thereto in the office of the secretary of State, it becomes a law in like manner as if he had signed it."

But no sooner was it law than a storm of opposition arose in Chicago. Mass meetings were held, and money raised to test the constitutionality of the "law" in the courts of the State. The people went so far as to organize a corporation known as "The Barbers' Mutual Protective Association," and got a charter from Springfield.

The constitution of the association was then adopted, containing the following preamble setting forth the purposes of the organization:—

We, citizens of the United States, State of Illinois, and City of Chicago, all of whom are barbers, in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, provide the common defense and protection, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty and right of property to ourselves, as guaranteed by Section 1, of Amendment XIV., of the Constitution of the United States, and Secs. 1 and 2 of Art. 2, of the Constitution of the State of Illinois, do ordain and establish the constitution for the Barbers' Mutual Protective Association of Chicago.

At the last meeting of the association a Seventh-day Adventist barber got up and addressed the people, relating the effect the "law" had upon his work. He observed the seventh day; the statutes sought to compel him to keep the first also. "Under these circumstances," he said to his listeners, "how can a man be expected to earn an honest living? What right, I ask, has the 'law' of Illinois to take the bread out of the mouths of my family? What right has the legislature to dictate religion to me? By whose authority does the law-maker make religion and define a man's duty to his God? By what delegated power does the man who is sent down to Springfield to protect rights and prevent robbery—by what authority, I ask, does he deprive us of our living, break up our business, and trample our private rights under his feet?" He closed his remarks amid great applause.

Several hundred dollars were then raised in membership, donations and dues, and the association started out on its crusade against religious laws and Sundayism. An interesting time is expected on all hands, and one of the most important legal contests since the Lincoln-Douglas controversy seems to be in store for the people of the State of Illinois.
