# BOARD SCHOOL "BIBLE TEACHING."

BY E. J. WAGGONER, M. D.

FOR the benefit of those who think that there is no hope for the salvation of children unless they are taught religion in the board schools, we give two incidents that have come under our immediate notice, so that they may see the kind of "religion" that is sometimes taught.

One teacher was giving a lesson on the days of the week. Having elicited from the pupils the fact that Tuesday is the third of the week, she asked, "What day do we keep as the Sabbath?" The reply was, "Sunday." On being asked what day of the week that is, the children replied that it is the first day of the week. Then the teacher continued, "But the Bible says that the seventh day is the Sabbath; why do we not keep that day?" The children very naturally could see no reason for not doing as the Bible commands, and so the teacher informs them that although the Bible tells us to keep the seventh day, "we" keep the first day instead, because Christ rose from the dead on that day.

It is not likely that any member of the board, whether in favor of the "compromise," or zealous for denominational teaching, would find any fault with the above. And that shows what they mean by desiring to have the Bible taught in the board schools. The last thing in the world that they desire, is to have the Bible really taught. If that teacher should teach the Bible just as it reads, in the matter of the Sabbath, and in many other things as well, she would not be able to keep her position.

In the above instance the Bible was squarely ignored. The teacher set forth the undeniable fact that the seventh day is the Sabbath, and then gave the children to understand that it makes no difference what the Bible says, if people choose to do differently. And this is called Bible teaching!

The other instance illustrates another phase of so-called "Bible teaching." The lesson for the day was in the eighteenth chapter of Genesis, which begins thus: "And the Lord appeared unto him [Abraham] in the plains of Mamre; and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day." The teacher proceeded to draw on her imagination after this fashion: "Abraham was sitting in his tent door in the evening, resting himself after his hard day's work, and I suppose he was smoking a long pipe to refresh himself; don't you?"!!!

Ignoring the statement that it was "in the heat of the day," the teacher allowed her "warm, ungoverned imagination" to picture the scene as evening; and then, to cap the climax, pictured Abraham, the patriarch and prophet, "the friend of God," smoking a long pipe! Here her imagination seemed to fail her, for she did not represent him as hospitably offering pipes to his heavenly visitors, so that they might refresh themselves after their journey.

Here we have an illustration of the two most common methods of "Bible teaching." One is to contradict the scripture statement, or to teach that it is of no importance, and the other is to read a text, and then soar into the realms of fancy. Perhaps some people may think that it is better to have the Bible "taught" in that way, than that the children should have no "Bible instruction;" but we most emphatically dissent. We think that all who regard the Bible as the sacred word of the living God, will agree with us that it is better to leave the soil of the mind free, than to cumber it with such stuff.

"Every word of God is pure; he is a shield unto them that put their trust in him. Add thou not unto his words, lest he reprove thee, and thou be found a liar." Prov. 30:5, 6.

In the foregoing we have looked at the matter only from the Bible point of view. We have not said anything about the impropriety of leading the children to think that smoking is both decent and healthful, nor the wickedness of making the Bible appear to sanction the pernicious and degrading habit. Of course the children, as well as grown people, take the imaginings of their Bible teachers as being Bible truths.

It is worth while, also, to note how indulging one's fancy in regard to the Bible, is at the expense of other things as well. In this instance the teacher's fancy led her wholly to ignore the fact that tobacco is a native of America, and was unknown to the Eastern Continent until about three hundred years ago. Civilization is indebted to barbarism for the tobacco habit.

"The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom." This is a truth that is not very much regarded; but it is a fact that the ignoring of strict Bible truth is a sure way to foolishness in general matters.
