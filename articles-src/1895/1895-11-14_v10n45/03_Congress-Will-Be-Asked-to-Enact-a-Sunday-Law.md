# CONGRESS WILL BE ASKED TO ENACT A SUNDAY LAW.

The Baltimore Sun, of the 5th inst., had the following special dispatch from Washington:—

WASHINGTON, D. C., Nov. 4.—The Churchman's League, an Episcopal organization which meets four times a year, held its November meeting to night in Epiphany Sunday-school. The principal action taken was on a report of a committee appointed some time ago to search the statutes of the District of Columbia, to find a law for the closer observance of the Sabbath, and in case such law was not found, to draft one to be presented to Congress. The committee found a law which was passed when Washington was a corporation and which remained on the statute books for twenty-two years. One day some one found out that it had never been signed by the mayor of Washington and it was thrown out. The league indorsed the law, and will present it at the coming session for enactment by Congress. The law reads as follows:—

"It shall not be lawful for any person to keep open any place of business or maintain a stand for the sale of any article or articles of profit during Sunday except apothecaries for the dispensing of medicines, and undertakers for the purpose of providing for the dead, or others for the purpose of charity or necessity. Nor shall any public playing at football, or baseball, or any other kind of playing, sports, pastimes, or discussions disturbing the peace and quiet of the day, be practiced by any person or persons within the District of Columbia on Sunday, and for any violations of this act any person offending shall for each offense be liable to a fine of not less than five or more than fifty dollars."

What Congress will do with this "law" remains to be seen. That body ought to refuse to take any action toward any such legislation. It ought to declare that any Sunday legislation whatever would be contrary to the principles of the Government and a menace to religious liberty. It would not be a bad idea for the Senate and House respectively to order printed a number of copies of the Sunday-mail reports of 1829 and 1830, and declare that these set forth the principles of this Government upon the matter of all legislation in any way meddling in religious affairs; and that wherein Congress or any other branch of the Government has not been governed by this principle, it has usurped authority and acted without constitutional warrant. If we had in Congress a few men like Richard M. Johnson, we might hope for something of this kind.
