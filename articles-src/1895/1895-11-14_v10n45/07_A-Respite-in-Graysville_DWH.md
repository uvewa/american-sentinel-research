# A RESPITE IN GRAYSVILLE.

CONTRARY to expectations, a respite has come to the persecuted Adventists in Graysville, Tenn., and it is now probable that for some time they will be permitted to live in peace. The following letter tells the story of the disposition of the cases that have been pending in the Dayton court:—

EDITOR SENTINEL: All the cases at Dayton, Tenn., are now a matter of history. The last case was settled a few moments ago. All our people are now clear, there being no convictions in the five cases tried, and no new indictments. There was one case against E. R. Gillett, one against Wallace Ridgeway, one against N. B. England, and two against E. S. Abbott.

EX-Congressman H. C. Snodgrass and Judge Lewis Shepherd, attorney for the Cincinnati Southern Railroad of Chattanooga, Tenn., volunteered their services in the defense of all our people here, and their influence and arguments had much to do with the favorable results at this court. Hon. Mr. Snodgrass has been in Congress from this State for some time, and Judge Shepherd is one of the most prominent attorneys in the State. They first showed that from the nature of the work done it could not be construed to be a "nuisance" in the meaning of the law; and that quiet work done without intent to offend can never be a "nuisance" when done on Sunday any more than when done on any other day of the week. Then they entered upon the Sunday law in no mild manner, showing thoroughly, though briefly, its evil effects, also showing the origin of Sunday and the mistake of the American courts in forcing its observance upon Christians in the face of the positive command of the Almighty. In doing this they traced the life of Christ and his experience with the Pharisees regarding the Sabbath and its observance, showing that the Pharisees were doing no more than these people in Rhea County, Tenn., are doing now, who are prosecuting the Adventists because they do not observe the Sabbath according to their straight-jacketed ideas.

The first case that came up was that of Wallace Ridgeway, who was charged with ceiling a house on Sunday. The jury was out some time and came back once for further instruction on account of one member who was in favor of conviction. They finally came back with the verdict, "not guilty."

The next was that of E. R. Gillett, which was dismissed from the docket for lack of a prosecutor.

N. B. England's case was then taken up, and two witnesses were used to prove that he sowed oats on Sunday, but they failed to prove the case, as the jury soon rendered a verdict of "not guilty."

E. S. Abbott's two cases then remained on the docket and the judge had permitted them to be carried over on account of Mr. Abbott's absence in Alabama. On motion of Judge Shepherd, with the consent of the attorney general, one case was entered "not guilty," and the costs of the other were secured by one of Mr. Abbott's friends.

This ends the cases that have been pending in this court for more than a year; and as there are no new indictments, and probably will not be very soon, we can thank God for a temporary relief from persecution at this place.
