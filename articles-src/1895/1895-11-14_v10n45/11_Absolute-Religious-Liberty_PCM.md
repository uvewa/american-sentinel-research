# ABSOLUTE RELIGIOUS LIBERTY.

[By P. C. Mills, in A. P. A. Magazine, Nov., 1895.]

"ABSOLUTE religious liberty" for every citizen and prospective citizen of this glorious country. How much that embraces; how broad, how grand the conception. How many there are, born under the folds of the Stars and Stripes, reared under that banner that denotes freedom in every graceful wave in the breeze; where they are taught that this country was the one that proclaimed to every citizen the "right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness;" whose Constitution expressly declares that no religious intolerance shall be allowed in its affairs. And yet they do not seem to comprehend the first principle of these utterances. But we find such men to-day organizing conventions, forming societies, instituting leagues, publishing periodicals, making speeches, with no other object than the avowed purpose of tearing that Constitution into shreds, destroying its very sentiments of religious freedom, and placing in its stead religious dogmas, literally disfranchising millions of as good citizens as the world can produce.

What is those people's idea of religious liberty? It must be liberty to practice their own peculiar religion and proscribe every other person's. To arbitrarily dictate to others what their conscience shall dictate, or make consciences for other people. I ask every such mind how they define liberty? Is it the freedom to trample upon every other person's rights? Is it the freedom to make slaves? Is it true freedom to allow one to take his neighbor's property, despoil his goods, if he thinks it to his temporal advantage to do so? And yet this is exactly the kind of freedom this class of minds adopt, proclaim and defend when they advocate the amendment of our Constitution, placing therein a religious dogma; or maintaining the right to religious teaching in our common schools; or the enacting of laws, by which conscientious people may be prosecuted and persecuted for doing no person an injury, but doing only what their consciences dictate on the Christians' Sunday.

It is this class of minds that have made it possible, by the enacting of laws, by which Second Adventists in several States of our country have been placed behind prison bars, and worked in chain-gangs.

O, Goddess of Liberty, shade thy face with the drapery of blackness, to hide that burning shame from thy pure eyes—that Americans, rocked in the cradle of liberty, shall so forget their manhood as to allow such a stain upon their record, as to be guilty of imprisoning fellow-citizens for their religion! And yet it gives me pain to record that these intolerant bigots are quite numerous, and claim they are increasing in this country. Fellow-citizens of this Republic, awake! shake off the drowsiness from your eyes, scatter the fogs from your vision, clear the cobwebs from your minds, and with our noble Hodeises proclaim "absolute religious liberty" for yourselves, your posterity, and our glorious country's inhabitants to all time; sweep every vestige of law from the statute books of States and nation, municipalities and districts, that shall look towards restricting any person's religious liberty.

It does seem that those people, who everyone call themselves Christians, have entirely forgotten a law laid down by the one they pretend to adore and love: "Therefore, all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets." Matt. 7:12.
