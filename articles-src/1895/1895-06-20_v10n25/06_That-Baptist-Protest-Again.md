## THAT BAPTIST PROTEST AGAIN.

We printed last week, as reported in the daily papers, the protest of the American Baptist Publication Society against religious persecution in various States of the Union. We discover from the official report, that the telegraphic report was inaccurate, and therefore give it as it appears in the *Examiner National Baptist and Christian Inquirer*, of June 6:

H. L. Wayland presented the following:

"Whereas, It has been widely reported that, in some portions of the United States, professing Christians who have conscientiously observed the seventh day of the week as a day of religious rest and worship, and who thereafter on the first day of the week have conscientiously engaged in labor which in no wise disturbed their fellow citizens who desire to observe the first day, have for this act been arrested and fined and imprisoned and sent to the chain gang; therefore,

"Resolved, That (assuming the facts to be as reported) we earnestly and solemnly protest against this violation of the right of religious liberty, a right for which our fathers suffered imprisonment, the spoiling of their goods, stripes, exile and death itself."

Dr. MacLaurin, Mich., objected to the resolution, as did Dr. H. C. Mabie, who thought that it was outside the line of the society. Dr. Seymour advocated it, as did Rev. W. F. Baston, Adams, N. Y. Mr. Hiscox expressed his sense of the wicked persecution of these people. If Baptists cannot to-day protest against these acts, what are we hope for? Dr. J. B. Hawthorne, Ga., said: "If these acts have taken place in Georgia, the 275,000 Baptists of that State will be heard from. We have not yet religious liberty, but only toleration. When the battle for religious liberty begins, the Baptists will be found in the front, if they are true to their traditions." Prof. W. C. Wilkinson: "I heartily support the resolution. I would not wait till the outrageous facts are legally proved. I would try to prevent their re-occurrence." The resolution was adopted by a rising vote, with but one dissentient.

We feel sorry for the one who voted against the resolution. He must feel sadly out of place among liberty-loving Christians.
