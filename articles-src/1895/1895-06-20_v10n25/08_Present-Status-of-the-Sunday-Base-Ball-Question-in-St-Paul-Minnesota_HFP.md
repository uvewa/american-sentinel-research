**PRESENT STATUS OF THE SUNDAY BASE BALL QUESTION IN ST. PAUL, MINNESOTA.**

BY H. F. PHELPS.

As related in a former communication, the opposition to the Sunday baseball game in this city was such that the opponents, led by Mr. Haupt, pastor of the Church of the Messiah, had given bonds for costs and secured an injunction restraining the playing of Sunday games.

The case was argued, the defense giving evidence, as set forth in the complaint itself, that the playing of the game only upon Sunday was sought to be enjoined, while such games were played upon other days of the week, therefore it was argued as being an effort to prevent Sabbath-breaking, a matter of which the court had no equitable cognizance; and that if a nuisance at all is being committed it is as much so on one day as another, and that the relief demanded evidenced the fact that these acts did not constitute a nuisance per se.

In answer to this it was pleaded that it did not appear that the week-day gatherings are of the same objectionable character as those on Sunday, and that such gatherings are much less disturbing upon week days when members of the household are actively engaged in the performance of their respective secular duties.

"But," said the judge, after reviewing these points, "I am not disposed to rest my decision upon such narrow grounds."

Inasmuch as it is a fact that a nuisance is such every day in the week, and as the complainants only pleaded that the games were such on Sunday, therefore it follows that the court could not, of right, enjoin the playing of the game on Sunday on the ground that it is a nuisance; and, inasmuch as they only asked that the games be prohibited on Sunday and not on other days, this being clearly in evidence that it is an effort to prevent the desecration of the Sabbath (Sunday), and, therefore, not cognizable at the bar; it will be of interest to know on what grounds the judge rested his decision. This we will give in his own words:—

From the earliest time in this country, one day in the week for rest and tranquility has been everywhere recognized as an absolute right of the citizen who may desire to avail himself of such immunity from toil and business cares, and this right has been again and again recognized, established and confirmed by express statute, by the setting aside of the seventh day for such purpose, invalidating all contracts attempted to be made thereon and inhibiting all manner of work save only that of charity and necessity. The citizen may spend the day as he will, provided he does not disturb his neighbor, and courts of equity will not interfere, but this right to a quiet and restful day must not be invaded.

It is therefore as clear as the noon-day that the judge renders his decision upon religious grounds and no other. This will be more apparent when we consider for a moment the case of the Jew or Seventh-day Adventist. Have not these an equal "right to a quiet and restful day" as all others? And would the courts enjoin the playing of ball on Saturday, the true Sabbath day, on the ground that it is a disturbance of this restfulness? Evidently not. The answer would be: Let these people accept as their "quiet and restful day" the day set aside by the majority. But the judge argues still further, as follows:—

Meetings of the character complained of and continued for months to come must necessarily for the time being disturb the peace and quietude of the home, and must, to use the statutory definition of nuisance, constitute "an obstruction to the free use of property so as to interfere with the comfortable enjoyment of life and property."

All of this was contradicted as a matter of fact by property owners upon all sides, who would crowd windows and balconies every day, Sundays and all (unless with some few possible exceptions), in order that they might watch the progress of the games.

But the games are prohibited in that locality, and the church has gained one "victory" by an appeal to Caesar in behalf of her idol, a false Sabbath.
