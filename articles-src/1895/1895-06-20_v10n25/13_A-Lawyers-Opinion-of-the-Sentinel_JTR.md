**A LAWYER'S OPINION OF THE "SENTINEL"**

Baltimore, Md., June 6, 1895.

EDITOR AMERICAN SENTINEL: I esteem it one of the most fortunate occurrences of my life, of becoming acquainted with the AMERICAN SENTINEL and the people it represents. Up to a few years ago I had no idea that any organization existed in this country, or indeed in the world, for the purpose of fighting for liberty of conscience in the name of Christianity, notwithstanding the fact that this is the only religion in the world, so far as I am aware, which proclaims that doctrine as its corner-stone. I had always supposed that this cardinal principle of Christianity was left to be defended by agnostics, etc.

As wonderful to me as the discovery of the International Religious Liberty Association and the Seventh-day Adventist Church with this extraordinary appreciation of true Christianity, not less marvelous has been the unerring balance and strict and discriminating sense of justice with which, under all circumstances, your people and your paper serve the great cause to which they are devoted. In my judgment your paper cannot be too widely circulated for the good of the country and for the preservation of mankind against the most insidious form of religious tyranny,—namely, that which musters itself under the guise of "law and order," and under the base pretense of civil regulation-seeks to force upon one set of men an external compliance with the religious dogmas of another. The religious persecutions of the past were at least honest in that they were undertaken avowedly for religious purposes. This was of course absurd, but it was decent.

It has been reserved for our age to commit the unspeakable blasphemy of invoking the name of Christianity to support a warfare upon conscience while hypocritically and vilely pretending that only civil interests are in view. To add a lie to cruelty and to practice falsehood along with persecution is a triumph of infamy which so far as I am aware began with the present century. To connect the whole dirty business with the name of Christianity is a climax of wickedness to which no preceding age has attained.

It is the glorious mission of the SENTINEL and its supporters to expose this atrocity and to fight against it.

Success to the paper and all its friends.

Truly yours,

JAMES T. RINGGOLD.
