**SUNDAY ENFORCEMENT IN MANITOBA.**

60 Wardlaw Ave., Winnipeg, Manitoba.
June 2, 1895.

Editors American Sentinel: I write to show you that the Sunday-law spirit is not confined to the United States and Europe, but here in Manitoba, it is beginning to be manifested.

George Alcock is a Seventh-day Adventist, living near Gladstone. He is a farmer, and is looked upon as a very consistent Christian by all who are acquainted with him. Last Sunday, his son, who makes no profession of religion, and two Seventh-day Adventists, were at work planting potatoes on Mr. Alcock's farm. Mr. Alcock himself was engaged in building a fence through his bush. As the farm is situated just inside the corporation, the mayor has taken upon himself the task of saving these wicked(?) people by force, if necessary. So last Sunday he sent a man to stop their working or to arrest them on the spot.

Mr. Alcock's son, who was plowing the drills with the team, became frightened and quit work, but the other men replied to the threats made by the officer that they were not afraid of being arrested; but as the team had stopped they would have to stop planting potatoes, but would continue at some other kind of work. As the officer could not find Mr. Alcock, he waited at the house till he (Mr. A.) came up to dinner. On his arrival the officer made known his business, and Mr. Alcock told him that he was ready to be arrested then, but that he was not ready to stop work on Sunday, for God had said, "Six days shalt thou labor," and he was going to do so. Mr. A. then explained why he worked on Sunday. The officer departed without making any arrests, but threatened that if the work went on the next Sunday he would surely arrest them. Since then the threats have been louder and stronger, but Mr. Alcock and his brethren are firm and say they shall continue to work on Sunday. So I expect we shall soon see good Christian men imprisoned in Manitoba for obeying God and disobeying a Romish law which contravenes the law of the Most High.

We await with interest the outcome of this affair.
W. H. FALCONER.
