## MARYLAND JUSTICE.

### BY E. R. FRANKE.

JOHN A. FAUST, a member of the Seventh-day Adventist Church in Baltimore, was arrested for working on Sunday, June 10, 1895.

Mr. Faust has been a canvasser for religious books, but during the last two years, has been so much crippled by rheumatism that at times it has been exceedingly difficult for him to walk. For this reason he has been compelled to give up his employment, and since then it has been difficult for him to support himself and family, consisting of a wife and three children.

About three weeks ago Mr. Faust began to repair shoes and do such odd jobs as his health would permit, very often suffering intense pain while sitting at his cobbler's bench, besides making hardly enough to sustain life. Mr. Faust, as stated, is a Seventh-day Adventist, and in harmony with the Bible, keeps the seventh day (Saturday), working the six other days (including Sunday), when his health will permit and when he has work to do.

The work was performed in his private room in the house where the writer also lives. Last Sunday Mr. Faust was engaged in repairing a pair of shoes when the policeman, urged by the good religious(?) neighbors, came into the house and gave him to understand that he would have him arrested when a warrant could be made out. At the same time he said, "I'll make away with you folks."

The store directly opposite was open all day (the writer's children made purchases there). At the rear of Mr. Faust's house a number of men (not Adventists) were pitching quoits, making noise enough to be heard distinctly on the front street, but this did not disturb the good religious people or the officer who made the arrest. The fact is, the whole thing is a case of religious persecution, because Mr. Faust happens to differ from these neighbors as to which day should be observed as the Sabbath.

On a warrant issued by the police justice and served by the inquisitorial policeman, Mr. Faust appeared at the afternoon session of the police court. It was quite evident to those who attended court that the so-called justice and the policeman understood each other thoroughly. The rulings of the justice were arbitrary in the extreme. He would listen neither to argument nor common sense.

But this is not all. This man, crippled as he was with rheumatism, was placed in a cell all night with nothing but a hard bench to sleep on, without any cover to wrap himself in, and was actually compelled to use his own shoes for a pillow in order to get any rest. About 10 o'clock, P. M., a friend (the prisoner's pastor) called, and seeing his condition, went out and stated the facts concerning his health to the police-lieutenant in charge, and asked him if he could not give him a bed.

The answer was a flat, indignant "no." "But," said the minister, "the man is in ill health, and it is not safe for him to sleep on a bench without mattress or cover." "He was well enough to work yesterday," was the reply. "Do you have beds for any who are brought here?" "Yes, if they are sick we send them to the hospital." "But do you not have beds here for some?" "Yes," was the reply. "Do you not believe my statement about this man?" said the minister. "Yes, I believe your word and take you for a gentleman." "Then why cannot this man have a bed?" "Because I won't give him one." "But will you not let him have a bed if I pay for it?" asked the minister. "No," was the answer. "For what reason?" "Because I won't," was the flat reply.

This morning bond was furnished for his appearance at court, and Mr. Faust came home limping and sore from the effects of his treatment.

Baltimore, Md., June 11, 1895.
