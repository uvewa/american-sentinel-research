# Uncertainties Log - v10n25 (1895-06-20)

## General OCR Quality
The source OCR quality was good overall. Most text was clear and readable.

## Specific Uncertainties

### Page 2, Column 1, Article "The Sabbath and the Sufficiency of Scripture"
- **Transcribed as:** "Atttermost" (line 97)
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM
- **Reason:** OCR appears to show three 't's, but likely should be "uttermost" - common biblical phrase. Left as OCR'd per instructions to preserve exactly what appears.

### Page 3, Column 1, Article "Are They Minding Their Own Business?"
- **Transcribed as:** "oceremness" (line 107)
- **Confidence:** LOW
- **Reason:** OCR error for "sacredness" - clearly a corruption, but preserved as transcribed per strict accuracy requirement.

### Page 4, Column 2, Article "Present Status of the Sunday Base Ball Question"
- **Note:** Allison case footnote marker appears as asterisk
- **Transcribed as:** "Allison in the chain-gang.*"
- **Confidence:** HIGH
- **Reason:** Asterisk appears in original to reference earlier coverage

### Page 5, Author initials
- **Article:** "Maryland Justice"
- **Transcribed as:** E. R. Franke
- **Confidence:** HIGH
- **Reason:** Full name given in article byline

### Page 7, Advertisement text
- **Multiple advertisements contain OCR artifacts:**
- "Aromypes" (likely "Artotypes")
- "attorneys" (context unclear - likely "artotypes")
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM
- **Reason:** Advertisement technical terms difficult to verify; preserved as OCR'd

### General Note on Reprints
All reprinted articles preserve the source attribution pattern "—*Source Name*" at article end or in introduction brackets.
