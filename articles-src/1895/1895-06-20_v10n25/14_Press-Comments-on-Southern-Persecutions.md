**PRESS COMMENTS ON SOUTHERN PERSECUTIONS.**

[From the Sunday Gazette, Denison, Texas, June 3.]

WHITHER are we drifting? Are we going back to the days of Puritan intolerance, and the Inquisition? It looks very much like it, and it is certainly time that the people arose in their might and called a halt, by electing liberal-minded men to the legislature who will repeal laws that can be made use of by fanatics to persecute those who do not chance to agree with them in religious matters. Franklin was about right when he said a religion which could not be maintained without the aid of the civil law was not worth maintaining.

**Persecution for Conscience' Sake.**

[From St. Albans (Vt.) Weekly Messenger, April 18.]

IN obedience to what they believe to be the divine law, the Seventh-day Adventists of Tennessee strictly observe the last day of the week as the Lord's day; at least, they keep it holy quite as scrupulously as the Christians of other denominations keep the first day. This does not conflict with the laws as made and provided for the inhabitants of Tennessee. But they also attend to their usual vocations upon the first day, and herein they come in contact with the law. It is not charged they disturb the worship of their fellow-citizens or conflict in any way with the rights of others. But they do work on what is made the Lord's day by the purely human statutes of the State of Tennessee.

For this their presiding elder and four of his fellow-Adventists were arrested, tried, fined, and, upon refusal to pay the penalty, sent to the county jail. To the honor of the presiding judge, be it said, he remitted the fines immediately upon their infliction, but he was without authority to remit the costs, and as the principle at stake was the same, the criminals—for such they are in the eyes of the law—are languishing in jail.

Notwithstanding the Declaration of Rights of the State of Tennessee expressly provides: "No human authority can, in any case whatever, control or interfere with the rights of conscience," these men, admittedly good men and good citizens, guilty of no other crime than worshiping God according to the dictates of their own consciences, are thrust into a felon's dock and sent to a convict's cell. And this is done in the name of a just and loving Saviour and on behalf of the Christian religion.

[From the Western Catholic News, Chicago, June 8.]

Persecution for conscience' sake has been the custom in the days of the Henrys, the Cromwells, the Elizabeths, and the Calvins, but that was in a period when, and in countries where, tyrants of the most brutal tendencies ruled with an iron rod which was tempered in the fire of hell. We are Americans and live in an age of civilization and intelligence. In this land of freedom, no one should be persecuted because of his faith, no matter how absurd the practice of his religion may appear to others. The Religious Liberty Association at Battle Creek, Mich., received a telegram, recently, that J. Q. Allison was in a chain-gang at Douglasville, Ga., because he insisted on keeping the Sabbath, Saturday, and worked on Sunday. Allison may be honestly a believer in this theory, and under our Constitution, ought not to be punished for it.

[From the Republican, Fulda, Minn.]

Down in Douglasville, Ga., in this glorious land where we boast of religious liberty, Mr. J. Q. Allison was last week convicted for violating the Sunday law of that State, and sentenced to work in the "chain-gang." His religion teaches him to observe Saturday as the Sabbath, while the law recognizes Sunday and provides that the offender may be punished by a fine not to exceed one thousand dollars, imprisonment not to exceed six months, to work in the chain-gang on public works not to exceed twelve months, or all, at the discretion of the judge. The nice part of the law is the part that provides that all fines for such offenses shall be distributed among the Sunday schools of the county. Should the convict refuse to work, even on the day he keeps for Sabbath,—on Saturday,—the law provides that he shall be guilty of insurrection and punished by death. We supposed that "Blue Laws" were only matters of history, but they tell us that history repeats itself. Should Mr. Allison refuse to work on his Sabbath they have a lawful right to hang him. That would sound well for America, the land of religious liberty, to hang a man for hoeing in his own garden on Sunday!

**"Sabbath-Day" Persecution.**

[From the Chicago Tribune, June 4.]

The Seventh-day Adventists have been the subjects of much persecution in Tennessee and Georgia for some years past. Believing that Saturday, the seventh day of the week, is the Sabbath which the Bible commands shall be kept, they religiously abstain from working on that day and claim the right to pursue on Sunday their usual vocations. For the latter they are arrested and fined as lawbreakers. Now the persecution has extended into Mississippi. A New Orleans paper notes the arrest of Robert Nash, who dared to work in his own field near Aberdeen, Miss., the last Sunday in May. Nash pleaded guilty and undertook the management of his own case, using the Bible for his law book, and the case was continued till next Saturday.

The Mississippi statute bearing on this subject provides that "any one who shall labor, or employ any one else to labor, on the Sabbath day at any other than household duties, works of necessity or charity, or on railroads or steamboats, shall, on conviction, be fined not more than $20 for every such offense." On this Mr. Nash has a valid plea, though that does not necessarily mean it will have much weight with the local solon who passes on the case. It is that Sunday is not the Sabbath, and is not defined as such on any page of the Old or New Testament. The only Sabbath known to the Jews of Old Testament times, and the only one spoken of by Christ to his apostles, was that portion of time in each week which begins at sunset Friday and ends at sunset Saturday. It is understood that after the crucifixion the disciples met Sunday, and that their reason for doing so was their belief that the first day of the week was the one on which Christ rose from the dead. But we have no hint that they called that day the Sabbath or that it was generally observed by the churches till nearly three centuries later, when Sunday was formally recognized by the Emperor Constantine. The Jews still hold that Saturday is the real Sabbath, even those of them who find it more convenient to observe Sunday for the sake of harmony with the people among whom they dwell and do business. And the Jews ought to know. They and their books are the only historical authority of any value on that point. Whether or not the change be one of vital religious importance is another question.

So if the verbal requirement of the Mississippi State law be for the observance of the Sabbath, the officials of that State have no right to meddle with Nash. The law does not fit his case. Of course if the people of that State want to pass a law prohibiting work on the first day of the week, or Sunday, they have the power to do so, and their officials will be charged with the duty of enforcing it when such a law gets on the statute books. It is pitiable to see so much intolerance exhibited in what is professedly a land of liberty. It is a great pity that one set of people cannot have some respect for the rights of other people in the matter of work and choice of times in which to do it. The persecution of the Seventh-day Adventists in the three States named is a relic of Middle-Age disregard for the rights of fellow-beings.

**A Sabbath-keeper in the Chain-gang in Georgia.**

[From the Evangel and Sabbath Outlook, May 22.]

We break our forms, ready for the press, this week, to give place for the latest shameful wickedness in connection with the persecution of Sabbath-keepers in the South. A telegram to the Religious Liberty Association, Battle Creek, Mich., May 16, says: "Allison in the chain-gang." This means that J. Q. Allison, of Douglasville, Ga., a Sabbath-keeper according to the Bible and the law of God, has been convicted for violating the Sunday law of Georgia and having refused to pay his fine—so we judge in the absence of details—has been placed in the "chain-gang" to work out the penalty. The possible punishments for working on Sunday in Georgia are almost beyond the reach of credulity. All misdemeanors under that law are liable to a fine in any sum under one thousand dollars, or to imprisonment within the limit of six months, or to hard labor in the chain-gang not to exceed twelve months; and one or more of these penalties may be ordered at the discretion of the court.

Bathing on Sunday, in sight of any highway leading to or from any house of worship, incurs a fine not exceeding five hundred dollars, or imprisonment not exceeding six months. (See Georgia State Code, L. R. and H. of 1882, pp. 1,184, 1,196, 1,197.)

But this is not all. The provisions concerning service in the "chain-gang," according to Section 4821, are as follows:—

Whenever any convict or convicts now confined, or hereinafter to be confined, in the penitentiary of this State, or member or members of the chain-gang now confined, or hereinafter to be confined, in the penitentiary of this State, or wherever else employed as such, shall be guilty of insurrection or attempt at insurrection, such convict or convicts, or member or members of the chain-gang, shall, upon trial and conviction in the Superior Court of the county in which the crime is committed, be deemed guilty of a capital offense, and punished with death, or such other punishment as the judge in his discretion may inflict.

Undoubtedly Mr. Allison will refuse to work on the Sabbath, since he holds that the law of God outranks the law of Georgia. Such refusal can be made "insurrection" under the foregoing provision. Therefore in Georgia an intolerance equal to that which flourished in the darkest of the Middle Ages, and an injustice which disgraces our Christian civilization, to say nothing of religious liberty, combine to put Mr. Allison's life in jeopardy. Treason?—No. Murder?—No. Arson, burglary?—No. Not these, but this: He worked on Sunday.

But the cruelest injustice comes in the fact that men who pretend to keep Sunday can break the law at will and unmolested, while Mr. Allison and his fellow Sabbath-keepers suffer, not so much for working on Sunday as for keeping the Sabbath. That is the front and gravest of their crime!! Has it come to this? Does a man put his life in jeopardy when he becomes a Seventh-day Adventist, or Baptist, or an Israelite, in Georgia?

We have not looked up the geographical position of Douglasville, but we must believe that it is in some corner so remote from railroads, from schools, from the enlightened jurisprudence which marks the nineteenth century, so far away from the general influences of Christian civilization, and the freedom of conscience which the Constitution of the nation guarantees to every man, that the State of Georgia will quickly repudiate this wrong, and will, with equal speed, change its laws so that the world may not again be called upon to blush over such a picture nor blot it out by the chorus of "Shame! shame!" which rises from every place. Is there a calendar in Douglasville? Does the court which condemned Mr. Allison know that this date is within five years of the close of the nineteenth century?

**Atrocious Laws.**

[From the Evening Press, Ogden, Utah, May 24.]

TENNESSEE, Georgia and Mississippi, and perhaps other States of this great and glorious Union, this alleged "land of the free and home of the brave," have on their statute books laws which throw in the shade the old Blue Laws of Connecticut—laws which are a shame and a disgrace to the States which permit them to remain on their statute books, and a sad commentary upon the boasted civilization of the nineteenth century. We allude to the so-called Sunday laws, which infringe upon the rights of conscience and prevent men from following the forms of worship prescribed by the church to which they adhere and give their allegiance. These laws are unequal in their operation; they are, in the States named above, used to oppress a certain religious sect which believes that the more ancient statute is not obsolete: "Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work; but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work." Such is the belief of the religious sect known as Seventh-day Adventists, comprising a large number of influential men and women in the several States of the Union.

Less than two months ago the Evening Press directed attention to an outrage perpetrated in Tennessee; the trial, conviction, and imprisonment of a number of gentlemen who worshiped God on the seventh day of the week and pursued their ordinary and necessary vocations on the first day of the week, commonly recognized as Sunday and by some called the Sabbath. These gentlemen refused to stultify themselves and went to prison for conscience' sake. Subsequently they were pardoned, but that does not alter the fact that they were unjustly and inhumanly dealt with, under a statute instigated and passed at the behest of bigots.

Now we have another case of atrocious persecution to chronicle: the conviction of J. Q. Allison, of Douglasville, Ga., for violating the Sabbath statute of that State, and his sentence to serve in the chain-gang. The Georgia law provides that the offender may "be punished by a fine not to exceed one thousand dollars, imprisonment not to exceed six months, to work in the chain-gang on the public works, or on such other works as the county authorities may employ the chain-gang, not to exceed twelve months, and any one or more of these punishments may be ordered at the discretion of the judge." Section 4582 of the Georgia Code makes the following provisions for its disposal:—

All moneys arising from fines imposed for offenses, the gist of which consists in their being committed on the Sabbath day, shall be paid to the ordinary of the county, to be by him distributed for the purpose of establishing and promoting Sabbath schools in the county.

There are other provisions of this atrocious law which are even worse than those quoted above, but which we have not the space to quote in full. Suffice it to say that there is within the possible limit of the law, first, a thousand-dollar fine; second, six months' imprisonment; third, the chain-gang; fourth, all three combined; fifth, he faces the possibility of being hired out to the highest bidder, to some contractor, and in either case whether in the chain-gang of the State or the private contractor, should he refuse to work on the Sabbath (Saturday), as he surely would, he "may be punished with death!"

Another case comes to us from Mississippi. On May 9, at Amory in that State, R. T. Nash was arrested for hoeing in his garden on Sunday.
