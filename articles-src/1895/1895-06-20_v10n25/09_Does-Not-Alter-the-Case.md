**DOES NOT ALTER THE CASE.**

[From Die Rundschau, Chicago, May 29.]

The American Sentinel reports the release of J. Q. Allison, the Seventh-day Adventist of Georgia. He was, indeed, found guilty of the crime of Sabbath desecration for plowing his field on Sunday; however, the judge was more merciful with him than was at first reported. He sentenced him to pay the costs of the court amounting to $22, and only in case of default of payment, to the chain-gang for one year. Allison chose the latter punishment, although his neighbors offered to pay the fine for him. He was, therefore, given into the custody of the sheriff who boarded a train to Atlanta with him and other prisoners, there to "hire" him "out" to a contractor to do convict labor. But when the train reached Austell, Allison's home, the sheriff ordered him to get off and go home, at the same time warning him to desist in future from all Sunday labor, or the full penalty of the law would be inflicted. As was afterwards learned, unknown parties had paid the costs for Allison.

Self-evidently, this really gratifying result does in nowise alter our judgment on the Sunday laws generally, and that of Georgia especially. We rather maintain every law to be objectionable which in any way encroaches upon the religious liberty and freedom of conscience of the citizen of this country; and we assert now, as then, that nearly all Sunday laws have been enacted from religious motives in favor of some certain religion. And this Georgia Sunday law, if we may so call it, bears just such a religious character. For Section 4582 of the State Code explicitly defines that all money arising from fines imposed for offenses committed on the "Sabbath day" shall be "distributed for the purpose of establishing and promoting Sabbath schools in the county." Thus making of a merely ecclesiastical institution,—the Sunday school,—a State institution; and, in fine, contemptuously trampling under foot the American principle of complete separation of State and Church.
