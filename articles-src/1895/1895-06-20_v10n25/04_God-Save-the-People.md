## "GOD SAVE THE PEOPLE."

The termination of the trial of R. T. Nash, of Amory, Mississippi, an account of which appeared in our last issue, is deserving of notice. It is indeed gratifying, though not astonishing, that Mr. Nash was rescued from the penalties of a persecuting, priest-born statute, "at the earnest solicitation of the people," who first appealed to the judge to reconsider his decision, and when the final judgment was rendered, immediately satisfied the demands of the court and had the satisfaction of seeing their irreproachable neighbor return to his home, a free man.

Human liberties, both civil and religious, have always been more clearly appreciated and more jealously guarded by the people than by princes or prelates.

It is recorded of Christ that when condemned and persecuted by the priests and rulers as a Sabbath-breaker, because he healed on the Sabbath, "the people rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him." And when "the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might take him by craft and put him to death," it is recorded that "they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar of the people."

May the "Lord of the Sabbath" bless the "people" of Mississippi, whose love of justice led them to save an honest Sabbath-keeper from punishment as a Sabbath-breaker.
