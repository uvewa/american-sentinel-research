## ARE THEY MINDING THEIR OWN BUSINESS?

### BY EUGENE LELAND.

It requires a great deal of grace and a great deal of grit for a man to mind his own business, especially when he occupies so prominent and so influential a position as that of a minister of the gospel. His business is thus pointed out in the Scriptures: "Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature." Mark 16:15. The gospel which it is the minister's business to preach, is thus defined in the Scriptures: "I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth."

Rom. 1:16. From these scriptures it is plain that the business of a minister of the gospel is to go into all the world and preach the power of God as the only means of salvation from sin. That it is sin from which men are to be saved by the preaching of the gospel,—the power of God,—is shown from another scripture: "Thou shalt call his name Jesus: for he shall save his people from their sins." Matt. 1:21.

Mark it, the business of a minister of the gospel is to preach the power of God, not the power of civil law, as the only means of salvation from sin. Now, we submit the question to any candid minister of the gospel: Are you minding your own business when you seek for the power of civil law to restrain the street-car companies from the sin of "Sabbath-breaking"? It is not, in any proper sense of the word, a crime to run the street cars on Sunday any more than it would be to run them on any other day of the week: and if there were any sin about it, those who commit the sin should be left free to answer for their sin to God, and not to the ministers.

The power of God alone can save the members of the street-car companies from the sin of "Sabbath-breaking," but this power can be secured to them only by the "foolishness of preaching," and never by the strong arm of civil law. The street-car men are just as much sinners in the sight of God if they desire to do business on the Sabbath, and are restrained from it only by the power of civil law, as they would be if they actually carried on their business on that day. Why, then, should a minister of the gospel desire to compel the street car men to act as though they were righteous, when they desire to be sinners, and when they really are sinners? And in doing it, does not the man cease to be a minister of the gospel and become a minister of the law instead? In short, is he minding his business?

To be sure the Bible teaches that the civil government is the minister of God to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil; but is there no limit to the execution of its wrath for evil doing? Must it execute wrath for every evil that is done under the sun? If so, we ought to give ourselves up into the hands of the government to be nursed and swaddled like other babies and be done with it. What a fine condition of affairs it would be indeed to apply to government officials for directions in personal matters, such as diet, dress, religion, etc.

No, sir. The government ought to have nothing to do with such things further than to protect the individual in the exercise of his own taste about them. If he chooses to eat roast cheese and mince pie for supper, and to suffer with night-mare and indigestion in consequence, that is his own business. If he chooses to wear tight shoes, and to suffer with corns in consequence, that is his own business. And if he chose to run street cars on Sunday, and to take the consequences of his sin, if it were a sin, that would be his own business. It is a very great evil to be irreligious, but it is that kind of an evil with which the government has no business to deal, because it has not the power to eradicate it. The power of God alone can do that, and when that power fails, there is no remedy, for there is no power stronger than the power of God.

It is the business of the government to deal with crime, but never with sin or irreligion. But running the street cars on Sunday, even if that day were the Sabbath, would be only sin, it would be irreligion, nothing more. It could never be shown to be crime, and therefore the civil authorities, municipal, provincial, or otherwise, are not minding their own business when they restrain the street-car companies from carrying on their business on Sunday. And the ministers of the gospel are very far from minding their own business when they ask them to do it, or when they use their influence in any way to get others to do it.

This can be shown in another way. The commission which requires the minister to preach the gospel, says further: "He that believeth . . . shall be saved, but he that believeth not shall be damned." It is the business of the minister to preach the gospel. It is the business of the sinner to believe or to disbelieve, just as he pleases, and it is the prerogative of God alone to condemn him if he does not believe. But the minister is not satisfied with attending to his part of the business. He must needs attend to the sinner's business by compelling him to act as though he believed. And that, too, to the neglect of his own business; for he accomplishes his work, not by persuasion, but by force,—not by preaching the gospel, but by the power of the policeman's club. And at the same time he takes God's part of the business into his own hands by condemning and punishing the sinner for his unbelief.

Are the ministers minding their own business?
