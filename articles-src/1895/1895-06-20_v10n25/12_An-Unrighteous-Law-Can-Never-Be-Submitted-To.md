**AN UNRIGHTEOUS LAW CAN NEVER BE SUBMITTED TO.**

[From the New York Independent, June 13.]

Last week we had occasion to speak words of commendation of the Florida Legislature on account of the two laws passed during this session—one to prevent prize-fighting and the other to prohibit the lottery. We also expressed the hope that the Sheats bill would not become a law. We now learn that it has been passed by both the House and the Senate and has received the signature of the governor. It is now the law of the State.

This law was proposed by the Superintendent of Education for Florida. The history of it is this: It was called to his attention that there is a good private school supported by Northern benevolence at Orange Park for the education of those who will avail themselves of its advantages. It admitted and invited negroes: but it being the best school in the neighborhood a number of Northern people who desired their children to be well educated sent them to it. It thus became, and has been for several years, a mixed school. The fact has been known to the public, and we have published two articles about it. We have known perfectly well that every effort would be made as soon as the facts became fairly known to the people of Florida to have this co-education of the races stopped. Similar attempts were made to destroy Berea College, in Kentucky, and Maryville College, in Tennessee; and when one or two children of white teachers were received as pupils in Atlanta University, the State of Georgia withdrew its annual appropriation as a penalty for co-education. Such opposition is a necessary stage in progress.

When the condition of things at Orange Park became known to Superintendent Sheats, he called the attention of the State Legislature to it, and without mentioning this school by name, but with it and it only in view, he recommended the passage of a law which would make it a criminal offense to allow in any school, within the State, whether public or private, the two races to receive education together; no colored scholar must be received in a white school and no white scholar in a colored school. The law which he proposed applied not merely to schools supported by the State, but to all other schools as well, whatever their grade or character. He also proposed that hereafter no white teacher should be allowed in any colored schools, whether public or private, supported by the State or by benevolence, with the exception of certain summer schools or institutes provided by the State.

The purpose of this provision was evidently to break down the character of negro schools. The pretense was that negroes should have the whole field of instruction secured for them; that it would be of advantage to the negro teachers to have the monopoly of such schools.

The real purpose was to lower the standard of the schools; for he knew perfectly well that in the infant condition of negro education in Florida it would be impossible to supply as good colored teachers as white in the higher grades. His purpose was to destroy such a school as that at Orange Park, supported by a Northern missionary society, by preventing thoroughly trained Northern teachers from being employed who should be competent, from their acquaintance with the best normal methods, to instruct the colored youth and thus raise up those colored men and women who should in time be fit to compete with white teachers.

Such a bill we now understand has become law. Under it the American Missionary Association will be required to withdraw its teachers from Orange Park and to forbid white scholars to attend its instruction. We are not informed what that association will do, but we can guess with some assurance. It is not an association which has been in the habit of dodging unpleasant duties; it has not run away from the field of conflict. It believes that God equally loves white and black and red and yellow; and that the caste prejudice which attempts to keep down one race in its struggle for emancipation and elevation is wicked and hateful.

We guess, with some assurance, that its teachers have the same spirit; that they wish to provoke no conflict, but that if a conflict is forced upon them and an unrighteous law is thrust in their faces, they will not run away. They will believe it better to obey God than man; they will not refuse to teach colored pupils; they will welcome all pupils, white and colored alike. And if we are not mistaken they will, if arrested, with the American Missionary Association behind them, test the constitutionality of the Florida law in the courts of the State and of the United States, and will find out whether a State has any such right to interfere with the liberty of its citizens in their private education in schools for which the State does not pay out one cent. An unrighteous law can never be submitted to.
