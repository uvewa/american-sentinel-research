## CLASHING VOICES.

A copy of the *Evangel and Sabbath Outlook*, containing an account of the conviction of J. Q. Allison, of Georgia, for laboring in his field on Sunday, with some observations on the unscriptural character of Sunday observance, was sent to the Western Catholic News of Chicago.

The Catholic paper in a most commendable manner condemned the persecution of Mr. Allison, but attempted to produce scriptural authority for Sunday observance in the following paragraph:—

What does it [the *Evangel and Sabbath Outlook*] say to the following texts of Scripture in reference to Sunday as the Lord's day:—Apoc. or Rev. 1:10—"I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet." Again, Acts 20:7: "And on the first day of the week, when we assembled to break bread, Paul discovered with them, being to depart on the morrow, and he continued his speech until midnight." 1 Cor. 16:2: "On the first day of the week let every one of you put apart with himself, laying up what it shall well please him; that when I shall come, the gathering be not then to be made."

We don't ask our contemporary to send us the ten thousand copies he promised to anyone who would furnish him scriptural proofs of Sunday. We only ask him to publish in his journal that scriptural proofs have been furnished, and that Sabbath-keepers are wrong.

We are sure our friend, the *Sabbath Outlook*, will "say" some pertinent things about these alleged "scriptural proofs:" but we desire to call the attention of the editor of the *News* to some Roman Catholic comments on the value of the "scriptural proofs" cited. We quote first from "A Doctrinal Catechism" "by Rev. Stephen Keenan." This work is indorsed by "John Cardinal McCloskey, Archbishop of New York," and announces on its title page that it is "revised, corrected, conformably to the decrees of the council of the Vatican." On pages 352–354 are found the following comments on the value of the "scriptural proofs" for Sunday observance cited by our Roman Catholic contemporary:—

Q. Is the observance of Sunday, as the day of rest, a matter clearly laid down in Scripture?

A. It certainly is not; and yet all Protestants consider the observance of this particular day as essentially necessary to salvation. To say, we observe the Sunday because Christ rose from the dead on that day, is to say we act without warrant of Scripture; and we might as well say that we should rest on Thursday because Christ ascended to heaven on that day, and rested in reality from the work of redemption.

Q. Is it not said, in the book of Revelations, that St. John was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, that is, Sunday, and is not this scriptural proof that Sunday is the day to be observed in the New Law?

A. Are we then to observe this particular day merely because St. John had a revelation upon it,—must we observe as a day of rest and holiness, any day upon which an apostle was in the Spirit?

Q. But it is called the Lord's day?

A. And is not every day the Lord's day,—does this text tell you not to work upon that day,—does it tell you that the obligation of keeping Saturday is done away with, or that it was not the day of the resurrection or ascension which St. John here calls the Lord's day?

Q. Is it not said in the Acts, "And upon the first day of the week, when the disciples came together to break bread, Paul preached unto them, ready to depart on the morrow," and is not this sufficient scriptural authority for the observance of the first day of the week?

A. But does this text abrogate the observance of Saturday, the seventh day, or allow Protestants to do profane work on that day?—Certainly not. They should then rest upon both days, if they hold the above text as any argument. The text in question does not say that the apostle preached, or that the people assembled every first day of the week, but merely on this particular day, for which a good reason is given, namely, that St. Paul was to depart next day. It is quite clear, however, that they met every Saturday; for the same Acts say, St. Paul preached in the synagogue every Sabbath, and exhorted the Jews and the Greeks. Besides, it is not wonderful that the disciples came together on this first day of the week, since, according to Acts 2, they continued daily in the temple breaking bread.

Q. Does not St. Paul order the Galatians and Corinthians to make collections on the first day of the week?

A. Yes, but again, this does not abolish the observance of Saturday. St. Paul does not say that the people would be at church on that day,—that they were to keep that day, to the exclusion of Saturday, holy,—or that these collections were to be made at church, but merely that every man should lay up by himself in store upon that day.

The editor of the *Western Catholic News* will find more Catholic testimony of this same character in the first article of this paper. But if he desires still more testimony we recommend that he send ten cents to the Catholic Mirror, Baltimore, and secure a copy of a work entitled, "The Christian Sabbath," consisting of four editorials which appeared in that paper under the dates, Sept. 2, 9, 16, and 23, 1893, and which were written to show that the texts quoted by the editor of the *News* do not contain "scriptural proofs" for Sunday observance. But for fear that the editor will not secure this pamphlet, we quote the following from page 13:—

Thus, it is impossible to find in the New Testament the slightest interference by the Saviour, or his apostles, with the original Sabbath, but, on the contrary, an entire acquiescence in the original arrangement; nay, a plenary endorsement by him, whilst living; and an unvaried, active participation in the keeping of that day and no other by the apostles, for thirty years after his death, as the Acts of the Apostles have abundantly testified to us.

Hence the conclusion is inevitable; viz., that of those who follow the Bible as their guide, the Israelites and Seventh-day Adventists have the exclusive weight of evidence on their side, whilst the biblical Protestant has not a word in self-defense for his substitution of Sunday for Saturday.

And now will the *News* print these quotations from Catholic authorities in its columns, with a humble recantation of its error, together with the statement that, according to the Bible, Sabbath-keepers are right?
