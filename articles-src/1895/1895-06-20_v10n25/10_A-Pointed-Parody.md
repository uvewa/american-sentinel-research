**A POINTED PARODY.**

That valuable paper, *Our Dumb Animals*, publishes in its May number, the following pointed poetical parody by M. E. Beck, and introduces it with the bracketed words, "For the consideration of lots of our so-called Christian churches":—

**The Boys' Brigade.**

I want to be a soldier,
And with the soldiers stand,
A cap upon my forehead,
A rifle in my hand.
I want to drill for service
With military skill,
And master modern tactics,—
The most approved to kill.

I want to face a battle,
Where bristling sabres gleam,
And hear the wounded shrieking,
And see the life blood stream.
I want to wear a starry coat,
And ride a prancing steed,
And write my name in history,
By some heroic deed.

We're drilling now in church and school
The Loyal Boys' Brigade;
We represent the highest type
Of soldiers ever made.
That error, "Love your enemies,"
That has so long been taught,
Would wreck the State, and surely bring
This Government to naught.

And that stale nonsense—beaten spears
Made into "pruning hooks,"
And "swords to ploughshares,"—silly stuff,
How weak and tame it looks!
Peace Conferences must be set back;
The Sermon on the Mount,
For special drill of Boys' Brigades,
Most surely will not count.

We'll help the Church to march in line
With this progressive age;
Ring out the old, ring in the new,
With fighting on the stage.
Rule out the patient Nazarene;
Rule out the Golden Rule;
And base our creeds and catechisms
On the military school.

We'll file around the pulpit steps,
With spear, and sword, and gun,
And sing and shout in Sunday School
"Fight on! fight on!! fight on!!!"
