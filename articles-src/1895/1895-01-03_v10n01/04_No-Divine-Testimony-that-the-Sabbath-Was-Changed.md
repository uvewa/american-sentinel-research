# No Divine Testimony that the Sabbath Was Changed: Hence There Can Be no Divine Faith in It.

[In 1820 there was organized in West Middletown, Washington Co., Pa., a society, called the West Middletown Moral Society. The principal object of the society was to enforce the Pennsylvania Sunday law of 1784, which is still on the statute books of the State. This Moral Society was organized by the United Presbyterian, the same people who, later in 1863, organized the National Reform Association. Alexander Campbell, the founder of the Christian or Disciple Church, ably opposed the society in a series of articles published in the Reporter, of Washington, county seat of Washington County. His articles were signed "Candidies," A United Presbyterian minister, by the name of Wylie, attempted to defend the society, and signed himself "Timothy." The discussion continued from April 17, 1820, the date of Mr. Campbell's first article, to February 22, 1822, during which time almost every phase of the compulsory Sunday law question was treated. As a result the Moral Society perished, not to appear again until 1863 when it was revived by the same denomination under the name, National Reform Association. Every word of Mr. Campbell's invincible logic and withering denunciation is applicable to the association, reenactiated under the name, National Reform Association, and kindred organizations, such as the American Sabbath Union, the Pennsylvania Sabbath Association, etc.]

The popular doctrine taught from many pulpits which has given rise to the many errors of the religious public on the nature and observance of the Lord's day,* is that it came in room of the Jewish Sabbath, or that the Sabbath was changed from the seventh to the first day of the week, a notion which originated in the dark night of popery, or which obtained credit in the same ratio as the following article of the Catholic Church obtained credit; viz., "The unwritten word of God, or the apostolic traditions [i.e., the traditions of men] are equally the rule of Christian faith, and Christian holiness, as the written word." A zealous and intelligent defender of the faith and practice of the "holy mother church," told me in a late conversation that if I would not admit the above article in the Catholic sense, I must renounce the Protestant faith in the Christian Sabbath and infant baptism, for they have no other foundation than "the unwritten word of God or the tradition of the holy Catholic Church." I told him that I agreed with him in this, but that I renounced the above article, and also the Protestant faith in the Christian Sabbath and infant baptism as being contrary to the written word of God, by which alone I was regulated. Then, said he, you must be considered a heretic, not only by the Catholic Church, but also by many Protestant churches. Yes, said I, an heretic of the first magnitude; "for this I confess unto thee that after the way which they call heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law, in the prophets, and in the apostles." I do not believe that the Lord's day came in room of the Jewish Sabbath, or that the Sabbath was changed from the seventh to the first day; for this plain reason, that where there is no testimony there can be no faith. Now there is no testimony in all the oracles of heaven that the Sabbath was changed, or that the Lord's day came in the room of it; therefore no man can properly believe that the Sabbath is changed, or that the Lord's day came in the room of it. As a great deal depends upon the truth of the preceding argument, we shall take some pains to illustrate it.

Dr. Owen, Locke, and all writers with which I am acquainted on the subject of moral evidence or moral certainty, agree that faith and testimony are correlate terms, or that faith is of the same nature as the testimony on which it is founded, or into which it is resolved; and that faith and testimony are consequently equally extensive. A human faith is a faith that is founded on the testimony of men; and a divine faith is a faith that is founded upon the testimony of God. For instance, I believe that Napoleon Bonaparte is dead. In this instance, my faith is a human faith; a faith founded upon the testimony of men. No man can believe with divine faith that Napoleon is dead, for there is no divine testimony to that effect.

Again, I believe "that the dead shall be raised." My faith in this instance is a divine faith, or a faith founded upon divine testimony; viz., "There shall be a resurrection of the just and of the unjust." I presume no man of sense, not even "Timothy" himself, will deny the above. The argument deducible from the above is fairly this: Where there is no divine testimony there is no divine faith. But there is no divine testimony that the Sabbath was changed, or that the Lord's day came in the room of it; therefore there can be no divine faith that the Sabbath was changed, or that the Lord's day came in the room of it. The above can be overthrown only by producing a divine testimony that the Sabbath was changed or that the Lord's day came in the room of it. But this cannot be done by any man. Therefore the above argument is irrefutable.

The truth proved in the above syllogism may be exhibited in another form thus, everything that is believed upon human testimony alone is received and acted upon by a mere human faith, but that the Sabbath is changed from the seventh to the first day of the week, or that the Lord's day came in the room of it, is believed upon human testimony alone; therefore, he that believes that the Sabbath was thus changed, etc., receives it upon a mere human faith. — Candidas (Alexander Campbell) in Washington (Pa.) Reporter, Oct. 8, 1821.

*By "Lord's day" Mr. Campbell means the Sunday institution. But this use of the term is altogether accompanied by the Scriptures. The expression "Lord's day" occurs but once in the Sub-Britan, namely the first 1/3! where the Apostle John says: "I was in the spirit on the Lord's day." There is not the slightest hint that the first day of the week is meant; while other texts make it certain that John referred to the seventh day, which we are told in Ex. 20:10 in the "Sabbath of the Lord" of the Lord's day: In Int. 10:11, the Lord again calls it "my holy day;" while in Mark 2:25 our Saviour declares himself "Lord also of the Sabbath." Mr. Campbell's invincible logic applied to this point would read like this: Where there is no divine testimony there can be no divine faith. But there is no divine testimony that the first day of the week is the Lord's day; therefore there can be no divine faith that the first day of the week is the Lord's day. But this cannot be done by any man. Therefore the above argument is irrefutable.
