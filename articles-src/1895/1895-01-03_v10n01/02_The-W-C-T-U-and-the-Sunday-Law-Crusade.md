# The W. C. T. U. and the Sunday Law Crusade.

The following report of the "Sabbath Observance" department of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, made by Mrs. J. C. Bateham at the national convention, held at Cleveland, Ohio, Nov. 17, will narrate the real and success with which the union has pushed its Sunday law crusade and its enthusiastic hopes for the future:

The Sabbath Observance report to the National Woman's Christian Temperance Union, in convention at Cleveland, Ohio, to-day [Nov. 17], was presented by Mrs. J. C. Bateham, of Williamsburg, Ky., national superintendent. She said:

"This being the decennium of this department, we ask what has been accomplished. Ten years ago camp meetings with Sunday excursions, gate fees and sales attached, were common: now they are almost unknown. This was the first evil combated. Then ministers used Sunday trains freely; now they rarely defend it or use them to save week-day time. Sunday funerals, then common, are now uncommon.

"When we first assailed the Sunday newspaper, that arch enemy of the Sabbath, nearly every one, ministers included, said: 'Let it alone; it has come to stay; use it, not abuse it;' now the Christian press and pulpit are against it, and it defends its low character by saying the best people do not patronize it, and it is forced to cater to the baser element. We believe it will prolong be banished from Christian homes.

"Over thirty five thousand people have signed our Sabbath observance pledge against Sunday travel and excursions, unnecessary labor, the Sunday newspaper, Sunday purchases, and use of post-offices, and in favor of proper legislation.

"For years we were the only national organization for defense of the rest day; now we count a strong ally in the branches of the American Sabbath Union, and we count it no small thing to have secured the cooperation of all Sabbath associations in recommending the first week of April for special prayer, sermons, and work for the Sabbath.

"We were pioneers in the systematic effort to educate and raise the national public sentiment by means of leaflets, and to-day doubtless publish and circulate more than any other organization. Without a dollar of capital, and with but eight hundred dollars given by the national union in ten years, not enough to cover postage, we have sent out nearly nine million pages. We have over one thousand four hundred superintendents, who, with all white clibbers, are rapidly molding sentiment.

"Places of business, including saloons, have been closed in vast numbers, and baseball and other forms of desecration suppressed. The ministry, once so apathetic, now give, at our request, thousands of sermons yearly, and many Sabbath schools give special instruction.

"Our fundamental work of education has been pushed nearly as much by petition as leaflets. Few were at first willing to circulate or sign, deeming it useless, yet the mightiest impulse ever given to Sabbath reform was when we confronted Congress in '88 with a petition for a Sunday rest law representing ten millions of people. It accomplished far more than we had dared hope, for it brought the reform into the forefront of public interest, from which it has never since dropped.

"We were first to point the danger of an open World's Fair and circulate petitions against it, and through the long campaign, though less was said of it, no organization worked more untiringly by letters, telegrams, memorials, and petitions to all parties concerned; and while we mourn that through an accidental decision the moral effect of closed gates was discounted, yet the nation had said the day should be honored, and all peoples had had a great arrest of thought.

"Vastly more is said, written, and thought about the Sabbath than ever before, and through law enforcements there is outward gain in many places; public sentiment seems, by the reports from nearly all States, to be steadily rising; even railroad managers profess to seek the minimum of Sabbath labor, meaning the least that will satisfy the business public that demands rapid transit. Yet the Sabbath is slipping from us so rapidly it is alarming.

"We must save the Sabbath or the country is lost. The Church will never do the special work to which God calls us, of reaching and educating the masses by literature and personal influence, till they desire and demand the Sabbath and so use it as to make it a blessing; in fact, the church membership needs our earnest work, and we must have their help. As a whole, we have scarcely worked at all in this line; most of us have contented ourselves with signing a petition, securing a sermon, and giving leaflets to those who listened; verily we must do more if we would be guiltless.

"We must reach the neglected and non-church goers, the foreigners, the toilers, the railroad men and their families with talk and leaflets about the Sabbath, and not neglect any others. We must deny ourselves and make sacrifices of time and money to save the day, and God and victory will be our sure reward. Four new leaflets will soon be ready—two in German (Mrs. Grubb, Kirkwood, Mo., has others), two in English, one of which, 'Remember the Sabbath,' we hope will be pushed everywhere; forty leaflets are still furnished, most of them at fifteen cents, and with every dollar's worth ordered I will give a manual if desired.

"First: Let us reach more people and use more leaflets. Second: Push the Sabbath pledge. Third: Secure all possible names and indorsements to our petition to Congress for Sunday rest. Fourth: Enforce the Sabbath laws."—New York Mail and Express.

"We must save the Sabbath [Sunday] or the country is lost," is now the universal war cry; and woe to the faithful observer of the "Sabbath of the Lord," the seventh day. Since Sunday-keeping is the salvation of the nation, Sabbath-keepers who oppose the papal institution are enemies of the nation and must be crucified to save the nation as was the "Lord of the Sabbath."
