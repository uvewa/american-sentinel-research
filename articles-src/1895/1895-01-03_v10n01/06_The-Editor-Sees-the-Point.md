# The Editor Sees the Point.

Without exception the religious press of the country, outside the circle of seventh-day observers, refuse to recognize the vital principle at stake in the Seventh-day Adventist's refusal to obey laws enforcing Sunday observance; but here is the editor of a secular paper of wide circulation and influence who sees it clearly. After narrating the recent imprisonment of Seventh-day Adventists in Tennessee and Maryland, the editor of the Portland Transcript says:—

His reason for preferring to suffer imprisonment to keeping Sunday is that he regards that day as the rival of the Sabbath of the Lord, and to honor it would be a denial of the Lord of the Sabbath. It is not with him a question of convenience, a simple choice of day, but it is a question of loyalty to God. It is monstrous and out of harmony with our age to imprison a man honestly acting upon such convictions, however mistaken he may be in entertaining them. It is not enough to say that these people are not forbidden to keep their Sabbath, and that they are only required not to work on Sunday. The early Christians suffered martyrdom rather than offer incense on the altars of the gods. They were not forbidden to pay respect to Jehovah; they were only asked to pay respect to pretended divinities in addition. Some of the Adventists have scruples against refraining from work on Sunday which certainly ought to be respected, if they regard it as disloyalty to a conscientious conviction. Men who are acting upon such convictions will not needlessly annoy those who desire quiet and rest on the first day.

We recommend this paragraph to the careful attention of Sunday-law theologians.
