# Sunday Closing in Denver.

The people of Denver—led by the Christian people, regardless of sect or denomination—are up in arms against the gambling evil. This is proper. Gambling is easily proven a detriment and menace to society. For this reason society has a right to suppress it.

But the ministers, especially the Protestant ministers of Denver, propose to make a crusade in the religious interest. They propose to close all places of business and amusement on Sunday. In other words, they propose to use the power of the State to enhance the power of the Church.

It is claimed that a "violation" of the Sabbath outrages the Bible. Now, not one person in every twenty throughout the world, and not one in every three throughout this country, regards the Bible as a divinely inspired volume. Personally, we so regard it, and we would like to bring all others to our way of thinking, but we deny our own, or any other person's, right to force that belief upon any one.

The State has no right to suppress on Sunday that which it claims no right to suppress on any other day of the week.—Denver American, Dec. 8, 1894.
