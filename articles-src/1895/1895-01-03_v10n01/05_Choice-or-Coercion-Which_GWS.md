# Choice or Coercion, Which?

Public sentiment is rapidly being educated, by a class of zealous but deluded reformers, into a belief that the salvation of our nation depends upon a more general obedience to certain religious enactments, and especially the observance of Sunday, the first day of the week, as the "Christian Sabbath;" and hence we find that popular opinion is rapidly being crystallized into a desire for the enactment of various coercive religious measures. And this compulsion, in matters of religion, generally originates with, and emanates from, those who call themselves Christians. These dictatorial, coercive reformers claim to be followers of the humble, non-coercive Nazarene.

However, these principles of coercion in religion, and physical resistance under oppression, are antichristian both in their nature and tendency. The principles of the gospel of Christ upon these points, are very decidedly non-coercive in religion (or anything else), and non-resistant under oppression. Let us establish the propositions by Scripture citations.

First as to non-coercion. When the Jewish nation had ruthlessly thrust aside the last offer of mercy that was ever to be extended to it, Jesus said: "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, . . . how often would I have gathered thy children together even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, but ye would not." When the ardent disciples, James and John, so far ignored their Master's method of extending his religion as to resort to coercive measures,—wishing to destroy the Samaritans by calling down fire from heaven upon them because of their unbelief,—Christ forcibly rebuked their uncharitable and unchristlike conduct by the following significant words: "Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of. For the Son of man is not come to destroy men's lives, but to save them." They did not know what manner of spirit they were of—what spirit prompted them to this violent act. It was the spirit of Satan that prompted this destruction of the Samaritans. It was the spirit of Satan then, and always will be the spirit of Satan, whenever and wherever this coercive spirit is manifested.

The first scripture quoted, regarding Jerusalem, shows that the religion taught by Jesus Christ, was one to be chosen by the recipient, and not forced upon an unwilling subject. Not once, not even in the least degree, did the divine Master resort to force to compel men to become Christians.

Now as to non-resistance. Jesus gives us this positive declaration: "But I say unto you that ye resist not evil." The vehement, impulsive Peter, on that memorable night when his divine Lord was betrayed into the hands of a murderous mob, so far deviated from his Master's principles as to physically resist Christ's enemies; and the loving Master was again obliged to correct him. The excited disciples asked, "Lord, shall we smite with the sword?" Peter, taking this as a signal for an onslaught, "having a sword, drew it, and smote the high priest's servant, and cut off his right ear." Jesus touched the ear, and healed it; then, turning to Peter, he said: "Put up again thy sword into his place; for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword." Here Jesus laid down the ever-lasting principle, that any one who resorts to force, or civil power, to advance the cause of Christ, or to resist its opposers, thereby alienates himself from the power of God, and if he persists therein, will perish with the spirit of coercion to which he has allied himself. Here, then, we have the lesson taught, both by precept and example, that Christ's followers are not to resist evil.

Now, from the foregoing facts, it is positively certain that our modern Reformers, who are praying to the National and State legislatures in place of to God, have separated themselves from the power of God; and duped and deluded, they know not what manner of spirit they are of. They are working out a satanic principle, and unless they change their course, must eventually perish with their leader and his satanic principles.
