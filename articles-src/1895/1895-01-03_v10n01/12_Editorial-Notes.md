# Editorial Notes.

READER, subscribe for the AMERICAN SENTINEL, if you are not already a subscriber.

RENEW your subscription if it expired with the year 1894. Do it immediately.

YOU cannot afford to miss a single issue of the paper. Every number will contain matter which you will need in combating the rising power of Romanism.

THE AMERICAN SENTINEL is the only paper in the United States wholly devoted to combating Romanism, and its image in apostate Protestantism, with the only effective weapon—the Word of God.

THE Reformation of the 16th century, which jostled the papal throne, was accomplished with the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God. The SENTINEL will wield that sword against the vital doctrines of the papacy during the year 1895, with the increased power which the conflict demands, and which the God of battles has promised for this very time.

LET all friends of true Protestantism now rally "to the help of the Lord against the mighty." Indifference is sin. Not to make every effort to prepare for the struggle is disloyalty to "the King of kings and Lord of lords." To fail to warn your neighbors by every available means,—and the SENTINEL is a God-appointed means,—is to bring the blood of their ruin upon your garments.

"If the watchman see the sword come, and blow not the trumpet, and the people be not warned; if the sword comes, and take any person from among them, he is taken away in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at the watchman's hand. So thou, O son of man, I have set thee a watchman unto the house of Israel; therefore thou shalt hear the word at my mouth, and warn them from me. When I say unto the wicked, O wicked man, thou shalt surely die; if thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand. Nevertheless, if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it; if he do not turn from his way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul." Eze. 33:6-9.

WORK while it is day, for "the night cometh when no man can work."

BY ANY ONE receiving the AMERICAN SENTINEL without having ordered it may know that it is sent to him by some friend. Therefore, those who have not ordered the SENTINEL send have no fears that they will be asked to pay for it.

ONE of the editors of the SENTINEL attended the Annual Convention of the National Reform Association at Newcastle, Pa., and has furnished a partial report, which appears on page 4. More extended reports will appear later.

A TACOMA, Wash., barber, has contested the Sunday law in the courts of that State, and secured a decision from the Supreme Court that barbering on Sunday is not a violation of the law. His fellow-barbers are very much dissatisfied with the decision. The immediate result will be the opening of all the shops on Sunday forenoon.

VOLUME 9 of the SENTINEL, containing the fifty issues of 1894, will be bound and ready in a few weeks. Only a limited number will be offered for sale, and the first to order will be the more sure of receiving the volume, which, carefully indexed, and bound with manilla paper cover, will be sent, post-paid, on receipt of $1.50. Cloth, leather back and corners, $2.50.

We have repeatedly promised our readers some account of the recent prosecution of a Seventh-day Adventist in Massachusetts. We have postponed the matter to await the final result in the Court of Appeals. The case has been repeatedly postponed, with semi-official promises of dismissal. And thus the case still stands. We will make no more promises, but hope to print the defendant's plea soon.

At a recent Catholic meeting, presided over by the brother of Cardinal Vaughan, this question was asked:—

In the Bible we find that God set apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors and teachers, in the church; but we read nothing about a pope. Why this silence, if the papacy is of God?

To this question the priest replied, truly, that it would be an anachronism if the name "pope" were found in the Bible; and then he retorted: "Where do you find anything in the Bible about keeping Sunday?"

The questioner subsided; but if he had only been Protestant enough to reply, "We do not find anything about Sunday in the Bible, and therefore we do not keep it," he would not have left the priest in possession of the field. The papacy and the Sunday are two institutions that go together, and both are unwarranted by the Bible. The Roman Catholics have an unanswerable argument for the papacy for those who believe in Sunday observance. But they have no ground at all against those who hold to nothing that is not written in the Bible.—Present Truth (London), Dec. 6.

THE Transcript, of Portland, Me., referring to the case of Elder H. P. Holser, the Adventist minister, imprisoned in Switzerland for Sunday work, says: "But they have a law, ostensibly favoring workingmen, which forbids ordinary labor on Sunday. Religious bigotry is able to use this to prevent the free exercise of the conscience." In like manner the Warren (Ill.) Sentinel, says of the same case: "Our own country seems to be not the only one where persecutions exist on account of religious belief."

IMPRISONED Seventh-day Adventists, like Joseph in Egypt, have been blessed with some manly, kind-hearted jailers. When the prison board at Paris, Tenn., voted to work four Seventh-day Adventist victims of Sunday laws in the chain-gang on the Sabbath, the sheriff refused to carry out the order, and threatened to resign if the execution of the order was insisted upon. He had such confidence in his seventh-day prisoners, that he left the key of the jail in their charge, and they locked themselves in at night.

Robert R. Whaley and W. G. Curlett, the recent victims of the Sunday law of Maryland, were treated, if possible, better. Mr. Bryan, the sheriff, never locked them behind the bars either day or night. They were given a room and bed in his private apartments, and ate at his table; and, besides, were allowed to go to the post-office after their mail. And Mr. Whaley, whose child was taken very ill, near the close of his term of imprisonment, was allowed to return to his home three days before the expiration of the sentence. All honor to Mr. Bryan. It takes a courageous heart, in a man elected by the people, to thus kindly treat men whom the professedly Protestant churches have stamped as criminals.

THE position was taken by a member of the National Reform Convention, recently held at Greensbury, Pa., that if Sunday laws were right because Sunday observers were in the majority, then laws enforcing the seventh day would be right if Seventh-day Adventists were in the majority. Dr. McAllister, the editor of the Christian Statesman, denied this, but comforted himself with the remark that they never would be in the majority.

He was asked whether Seventh-day Adventists ought to be permitted to teach their doctrines. He answered, "No; not if they are opposed to Christian laws. We must not permit any man on the plea of conscience to put himself in antagonism to the laws of the Government." Later, he said, "We must get our civil officers to hunt down the violators of Sunday laws where there is a suspicion."

Another speaker said, "To try to get Sunday laws obliterated from our statute books is treason."

Thus, with the triumph of these modern inquisitors, not only freedom of action in religious matters, but freedom of speech will disappear.

ONE of the latest accessions to the ranks of religious journalism is The Message, of Chicago, the sixth number of which has been issued. An indication of the character of this journal is supplied by the following from its editorial columns:—

Our Anglican Church is steadily taking its place as the great, pure, Catholic Church of the American people as it is and ever has been the native Church of England. It is a debatable question as to whether we should try to proselytize from the Roman community, as they are a branch of the church, with priesthood and sacraments as valid as ours; but we cannot and must not refrain from giving a hearty welcome to all who believe that they can find a purer and more satisfying life within the Holy American Church.

This is looking Romeward with a vengeance.
