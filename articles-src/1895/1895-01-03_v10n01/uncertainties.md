# Uncertainties and OCR Corrections

## OCR Errors Corrected

**Page 1, Line 19:**
- **OCR read:** "BORN STREET"
- **Corrected to:** "BOND STREET"
- **Reason:** The Pacific Press Publishing Company was located at 43 Bond Street, New York. "BORN" is an obvious OCR error.

**Page 3, Line 210:**
- **OCR read:** "Sub-Britan, namely the first 1/3!"
- **Likely should be:** "New Testament, namely Rev. 1:10" (context suggests this is a scripture reference)
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM - the OCR garbled this footnote text significantly; based on context discussing "Lord's day" and John's reference

**Page 5, Line 310:**
- **OCR read:** "in 1896" (in Queen Victoria proclamation note)
- **Likely should be:** "in 1858"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM - the proclamation predates 1894 events discussed; 1896 is after the article date of 1895

**General Notes:**
- The OCR quality for this issue is reasonably good overall
- Some words like "amplied" (line 98) may be OCR errors for "ample" or period spelling
- "safth" (line 142) likely should be "saith"
- "sine" (line 146) likely should be "sins"
- "clibbers" (line 164) appears to be an OCR error, possibly for "clubbers" or "ribboners"
- "Iroualdes" (line 388) is unclear - possibly "Ironsides" (Cromwell's cavalry)

## Uncertain Readings

**Page 4, Lines 456-457:**
- **Text:** "HIS EVERYBOS AND AMUSEMENTS"
- **Context:** Chapter title in book advertisement
- **Likely:** "HIS EVERYDAY BOYS AND AMUSEMENTS" or similar
- **Confidence:** LOW - OCR clearly garbled this text

**General Observation:**
The Mistral OCR performed well on this issue. Most corrections were obvious errors (BORN→BOND) or contextually determinable (dates, scripture references). The quality is superior to some earlier OCR attempts.
