# "Render unto Caesar."

The brilliant pastor of the Portland Avenue Church of Christ, Rev. Carey E. Morgan, in his sermon yesterday morning, gave utterance to a new gospel in Minneapolis. His subject was, "Christ in History," and toward the close he expressed himself very forcibly regarding the attitude of the Church toward the State, and public affairs in general, taking the ground that Christ influences governments by influencing individuals and would make man a better citizen by making him a better man. This doctrine is so contrary in its teaching to much that has been heard in Minneapolis pulpits during the past few years, that the public will be interested in having Mr. Morgan's words on the subject practically in full.

While Christ had directly influenced government, Mr. Morgan said that he had done it inadvertently. "He did not come to supplant earthly rulers, nor to enter into competition with them, nor to legislate for them. He said, 'My kingdom is not of this world,' and, 'Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's.' Paul exhorted the disciples to be 'obedient unto the higher powers.' Neither Christ nor his apostles stopped to deliver Philippics against the emperor or his representatives; and yet there was plenty of occasion for it, if they had had time. Paul said, 'This one thing I do.' It was Christ's purpose to get men to be good and to do good. This he would accomplish, not by government, but by the gospel. He did not attempt to make men good by law. He knew that men could not be made righteous by an enactment of the legislature—that spirituality is a growth, and that it cannot be commanded, but must be cultivated.

"Let us not misunderstand his mission," said Mr. Morgan. "He did not come primarily to save men from hunger, or sickness, or bondage. He did not promise them bread, or health, or liberty. He did not come to take the place of the baker, the doctor, or the legislator. Men may be good and do good in a monarchy as well as in a republic. He did not involve himself in these questions; and it would have been well if the Church, as such, had followed his example."—Minneapolis Journal, Dec. 5.
