# Subject Unto the Higher Powers.

The first verse of the thirteenth chapter of Romans is often quoted to convince those who oppose the Sunday law that it is their duty to obey without question. It reads: "Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God."

The Saviour himself ordained the "powers that be" (civil government) and commanded his followers to obey them; but he never ordained civil government to legislate on religious institutions, or commanded the civil authorities to punish in any way any of their subjects for the non-performance of any religious duty. He has told us to follow his example. Hear his words, as recorded by his Apostle John: "He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked." 1 John 2:6.

Now, He did not always obey the civil authority when on earth; for we read in Acts 4:26, 27: "The kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord, and against his Christ. For of a truth against thy holy child Jesus, whom thou hast anointed, both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and the people of Israel, were gathered together."

The kings of the earth and Herod and Pilate were opposed to the Saviour of men, and as administrators of civil power, used it against him. Jesus refused to obey them. It is very clear that if he who ordained "the powers that be" refused to obey them, and tells us to walk as he walked, whenever these powers legislate contrary to him and his Word, it is our duty to disobey them. He taught, in his sermon on the mount, that not a jot or tittle of his Father's holy law should pass till heaven and earth pass. That law teaches that the seventh day is the Sabbath. If the "powers that be" enact a law that enjoins the observance of Sunday, if we follow Christ's example we will not obey it. For the Government to legislate against the fourth commandment of God's law, is to stand up "against the Lord, and against his Christ."

Another text is sometimes quoted to convince seventh-day observers that they should be subject unto "the powers that be." It is found in 1 Peter 2:13, 14, and reads: "Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake: whether it be to the king, as supreme; or unto governors, as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evil-doers, and for the praise of them that do well." We are to submit to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake. But when an ordinance of man is against God's law it is not for the Lord's sake to obey it. Those sent by the governor are sent to punish evil-doers. Now, he who obeys the fourth command of God's law, which enjoins the observance of the seventh day (Saturday), and refuses to obey man's law that enjoins the first day (Sunday), is not an evil-doer, and no government has any right to send its officers to arrest and punish him as such.

The Apostle Peter, who penned the last text quoted, with his companion John, disobeyed the civil power. They were called before the council and commanded "not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus." Acts 4:18. They replied, "We cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard." Verse 20. They did continue to speak the things that they had seen and heard from Christ, and as the result were cast into prison. But the angel of the Lord opened the prison doors, and brought them forth, and said, "Go, stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life." Acts 5:19, 20.

The ordinance of man put these apostles behind prison bars for speaking the words of life to the perishing people. They forbade their speaking and put them in prison for doing so; but God delivered them by his angel and told them to speak "all the words of this life." God, who ordained the powers that be and told us to submit to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake, told these apostles to disobey the civil authorities. They did right in disobeying. It was for the Lord's sake that they disobeyed. When they were interrogated by the magistrates, who asked, "Did not we straitly command you that you should not teach in this name?" Peter and the other apostles answered, "We ought to obey God rather than men." Acts 5:28, 29. So say Seventh-day Adventists. When God commands us to observe the seventh day and to labor on the first, it is not for the Lord's sake that the ordinance of man, which enjoins Sunday rest, is obeyed. It is clear to every truth-loving soul, that when the powers that be enact any ordinance contrary to God's Word, it is the imperative duty of every person to disobey that ordinance. He who ordained "the powers that be," ordained also the limit of their jurisdiction. This is evident from the divine assistance given to those who were brought in contact with the laws of men that contravened the law of God. Daniel, in the lions' den, the Hebrew children in the fiery furnace, the apostles in prison, and the martyrs in the flames, are encouraging examples to all who love God and his law above the laws of men, to disobey, without hesitation, any law that is against the law of their God. The Sunday-Sabbath law is against God and his law, and Seventh-day Adventists are not evil-doers when they disobey it.
