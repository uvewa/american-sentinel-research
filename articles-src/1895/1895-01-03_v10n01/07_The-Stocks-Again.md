# The Stocks Again.

## More Religious Persecution in New South Wales.

After an interval of some three months, religious intolerance has again manifested itself in Australia. Another member of the Seventh-day Adventist Church has been summoned to court, prosecuted, fined, and sentenced to the stocks for working on Sunday. The following account of this prosecution is taken from one of the Sydney papers:—

### SUNDAY LABOR PROSECUTION.

### "TWO BOUND IN THE STOCKS."

Before Mr. Smithers, S.M., in the summons division of the Glebe Police Court today, Sub-Inspector Elliott proceeded against an understed man named Robert Shannon on an information laid under section 1 of the Act 29, Charles II., charging him that being a person above the age of fourteen he did, on Sunday, July 29, work at his ordinary calling of a bricklayer, such work not being of necessity or of charity.

Constable Burke, stationed at Leitchhardt, stated that at 1:30 P. M., on Sunday, July 29, he saw defendant engaged building a house in Albion Street, Leitchhardt. He was laying bricks, and afterwards mixing mortar. Witness spoke to him, and asked him if he was aware it was Sunday. Defendant replied that it was not Sunday. Witness told him that it was a breach of the law to follow his calling on the Sabbath. Defendant replied that he didn't care about the law; that he had been working every Sunday and would continue to do so.

Defendant asked for a postponement, but Mr. Smithers refused the application on learning that the summons had been served on Monday last. Defendant then gave evidence on his own behalf.

Mr. Smithers.—What have you to say?

Defendant.—I told him it was not the Sabbath day. The information against me is laid for working on the Lord's day. There is no precedent in the Bible for calling it the Lord's day.

Mr. Smithers.—I am not prepared to go into that.

Defendant.—I have here a proclamation* I would like to read.

Mr. Smithers.—I can only be guided by the act. I have nothing to do with any proclamation, and the act forbids working on the Lord's day.

Defendant.—I was not working on the Lord's day. I was working on Sunday, and I contend that it was not the Lord's day, but the first day.

Mr. Smithers.—Do you admit doing the work?

Defendant (after some hesitation).—Yes, but not on the Lord's day. I believe in keeping the seventh day.

Defendant then handed the proclamation he was at about to read, to Mr. Smithers, who, after perusing it, said it could not alter the act.

Defendant.—Will you postpone the case?

Mr. Smithers.—I cannot; you have practically admitted the offense.

Defendant.—Not on the Lord's day, though.

Mr. Smithers.—I can only administer the law, but no doubt you were actuated by conscientious scruples. You are fined 2s. 8d. and costs, or in default to be set publicly in the stocks for two hours.

Defendant.—I will prefer the stocks to paying.

The Charge-Sergeant.—All right, you will find them ready for you!

Defendant then left the court, after again expressing his determination to "take it out."—Sydney Evening News, Aug. 9, 1894.

A warrant was issued to levy on his goods during the afternoon.—Sydney Morning Herald, Aug. 10, 1894.

But for some reason not known to us, the warrant failed to operate. The Glebe authorities were therefore brought to face the serious question of placing Mr. Shannon in the stocks. One great difficulty that confronted them was the fact that there were no stocks. Because of this, they were obliged to bring the whole case before the government. As Mr. Gould, Minister for Justice, was in the country, the papers setting forth the case were placed in the hands of Mr. Fraser, Under-Secretary for Justice.

It appears that Mr. Justice Backhouse happened to be with the under-secretary when Mr. Shannon's case was brought before his attention, and that he informally solicited the opinion of the judge. After examining the papers, also the law under which Mr. Shannon was prosecuted, the learned judge gave the opinion that the proceedings were illegal. The fine prescribed by the law is five shillings. The fine imposed by the magistrate was only two shillings and sixpence. This was robbing justice of half a crown. The sentence was therefore considered illegal.

The papers and the opinion of the judge were immediately forwarded to the Minister of Justice to be dealt with. But as he was unable to attend to the matter, it was referred to Mr. Simpson, the attorney-general. The result was this:—

We learn from the attorney-general's department that the case of Robert Shannon has been under the consideration of the head of that department, and that Mr. Simpson has officially recommended to the governor that the sentence be remitted. The ground upon which this recommendation is based is that the sentence itself was not strictly legal—that whereas the statute provides for a fine of 5s. or two hours in the stocks, the magistrate imposed a fine of only 2s. 6d. The recommendation for a remission of the sentence was to have been forwarded to the governor to-day.—Sydney Evening News, Aug. 13, 1894.

The last act in this interesting proceeding is given in the following telegram:—

Sydney, Monday.

The Minister of Justice [attorney-general] having decided to recommend remission of the fine of 2s. 8d. imposed on Robert Shannon, a Seventh-day Adventist, or two hours of public confinement in the stocks, for working on Sunday, the governor to-day approved of the recommendation.—Melbourne Argus, Aug. 14, 1894.

Thus ends the legal proceedings of the second prosecution of Seventh-day Adventists in Australia. It was only by the little technicality in the fine imposed by the magistrate that the government of New South Wales was saved the disgrace of placing an upright, honest citizen in the stocks for his religious opinions. We are glad to see, on the part of the officers connected with the case, a disposition to evade such a step. We do not believe that the police or the magistrate undertook this prosecution on their own account. And the history of the case shows that the under-secretary, the judge, the attorney-general, and the governor, all manifested a desire to prevent this shameful proceeding from being carried to its utmost limit. Upon whom, then, we ask, does the responsibility of this prosecution rest?—A. G. D., in Australian Sentinel.

*Defendant here referred to the celebrated Religious Liberty Proclamation, issued by Queen Victoria, in 1896, as follows:—"Firmly relying ourselves on the truth of Christianity, and acknowledging with gratitude the solace of religion, we disclaim alike the right and the desire to impose our conviction on any of our subjects. We declare it to be our royal will and require that none of our citizens be held, and we do not be punished, or disquieted by reason of their religious faith or observance, but that they shall alike enjoy the equal and impartial protection of the law; and we do strictly charge and enjoin all those who may be in authority under us that they abstain from all interference with the religious belief or worship of any of our subjects, on pain of our highest displeasure."
