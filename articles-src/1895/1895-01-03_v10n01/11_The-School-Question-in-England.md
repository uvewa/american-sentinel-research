# The School Question in England.

The school question is destined to bring on such a religio political fight as has not been known in England for long years. The Roman Catholic Bishop of Middlesbrough, in a recent speech, intimated that if Catholics did not soon succeed in securing for their schools a share in the public rates, they would "make a stand and refuse to pay the unjust rates." A correspondent of the Catholic Times, commenting on this utterance, says:—

I venture to express the hope that their lordships will forthwith see their way to send an ultimatum to Parliament, giving notice that if, after a reasonable interval of stipulated time (say six or twelve months), Catholics are left without some assurance that their claim to the rates will be considered, they will be advised in the various dioceses to refuse to pay the school board levy, and to throw the onus of the resulting wholesale prosecution on the local authorities.

Another priest goes still further, and says, "We Catholics must be ready, if need be, to part with our lives." He says that in the event of their demands not being granted, "resistance to blood and death would be the order of the day."

Not to be behind in the fray, the editor of the Methodist Times writes a stirring article, entitled, "Nonconformists! Close Your Ranks," in which he says:—

And what are we to do? Not to waste our time in useless laments, but to prepare at once, and with all our might, for the next pitched battle. The Church of England has now declared herself the warm friend of Rome and the implacable enemy of evangelistic nonconformity. She has made her choice, and we have made ours. She talks about Laud, and we will remember Oliver Cromwell. When the friends of freedom and pure Christianity were united in their earlier encounters with Charles and Laud, Oliver Cromwell did not waste his time in unworthy lamentations, but he quietly organized his Iroualdes, who ultimately crushed tyranny and clericalism. We, too, must quietly organize.

As between the two there is nothing to choose. While they look to Laud and Cromwell, we must look to Christ, "who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not." He is the only example of pure Christianity. "The wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God."—Present Truth (London), Dec. 6.
