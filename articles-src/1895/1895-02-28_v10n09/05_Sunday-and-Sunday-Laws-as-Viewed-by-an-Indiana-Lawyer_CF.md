# Sunday and Sunday Laws as Viewed by an Indiana Lawyer.

I learn by the News that the amendment offered by Representative Melendy to the Sunday-observance bill, exempting from its provisions those who observe the seventh day of the week as the Sabbath, was voted down in the House. That proposition was, in substance, a provision in Section 2,000 of the statutes now in force.

Large numbers of our people who believe in the observance of one day of each week as a religious duty, believe that the seventh day (Saturday) is the day that should be observed. The bill in question seeks to compel observance of the first day of each week as a religious obligation, providing penalties for its violation, and as it now stands it violates the rights and consciences of those who conscientiously observe the seventh day—notably, the Seventh-day Adventists and the Jews, to say nothing as to the rights of those who do not believe in any holy days.

I believe that comparatively few persons have ever investigated the question. How can it be proven that observance of the first day of the week (Sunday) is a religious duty? I think no person who is intelligent on the subject will pretend that there is any biblical requirement of the observance of the first day as a religious duty.

The Roman Catholic Church, which is conceded by Protestant historians to have had within its pale, for the eleven centuries preceding Martin Luther, practically all of the Christian forces of the world, and which today numbers a large majority of all Christian believers, boldly avers that there is no biblical authority for the observance of Sunday as a holy day. That church claims that the biblical day for observance is the seventh, and that there is nothing in the Bible tending to show the abrogation of the seventh and the substitution of the first, as a holy day. It further claims that by virtue of divine authority conferred on it, it changed the day of observance from the seventh to the first, and that Protestant Christians are guilty of great inconsistency in recognizing the authority of that church to change the day of observance—as Protestants do by keeping Sunday—and denying the authority of that church to prescribe other days as holy, and rules and regulations for the government of both clergy and laity.

If any Protestant would like to know the attitude of the Catholic Church as to the sanctity of Sunday, let him consult the catechisms and manuals for religious instruction of that church. "Encyclopaedia Britannica," article "Trent, Council of," furnishes good reading. The Augsburg Confession, 1530, admits that "the observation of the Lord's day" had been appointed by "the church" only.

With Christians divided as they are concerning the day that should be observed, as well as the authority for the observance, and as large numbers of the community do, like the writer, not believe at all in holy days, it seems to me the Indiana legislature should go slow with its religious legislation. It should not try to create and establish holy days, and compel observance thereof as a religious duty, with penalties. That is the hated Inquisition in a mild form.

Each and every person is entitled to full protection in his religious belief and practices, from interruption from all other persons. To that end, penalties are prescribed for those who interrupt lawful assemblies, whether they be religious, or any other kind, and there is no complaint that such enactments are not sufficient for the purpose intended. These laws apply equally to all assemblies, whether held on Sundays or other days. It is to such laws that the prosecuting attorney looks when investigating interruptions of religious meetings, and not to any law that seeks to compel observance of Sunday as a holy day.

Let it be remembered that the purpose of Sunday legislation is not to protect religious meetings from interruption, nor to protect individuals in their religious privileges—other enactments do that—but is wholly religious. It is an attempt to force religious practices on the people by the strong arm of the police. Such enactments are a union of Church and State, so far as they go.

But if the legislature of 1895 will dabble with religious compulsory-observance laws, would it not be the fair thing to exempt from the penalties thereof those who conscientiously observe some other day as the Sabbath, also those who do not feel a duty devolving on them to observe any day as holy? Such exemptions would not afford any license to interrupt any assembly, whether religious or otherwise, or any individual in his religious practices. Other laws protect such.—Charles Foley, Danville, Ind., in Indianapolis News, Feb. 14.
