# Silencing the Echo of the Reformation.

The Protestant bishops seem to be far superior men to the clergy under their charge. A few weeks ago we chronicled the rebuke administered by Bishop Potter, of New York, to the Churchman. In another place in this issue we quote Bishop Hurst's opinion on immigration. Both of these statements were from Americans, but we notice that in Edinburgh another Protestant bishop has reprimanded one of his docessans for intemperate statements concerning Catholics. The Rev. Dr. Teape, incumbent of St. Andrew's Episcopal Church, Edinburgh, a member of the extreme Evangelical Party, at a recent meeting of the Irish Society, assured his hearers that "the Roman Catholic has no Saviour, no Bible, no heaven." The bishop at once took Dr. Teape to task, and the reverend gentleman in reply made a lame and impotent attempt to defend his assertion, with the result that the bishop again wrote to him as follows: "The words, as they appeared in the report, seemed to me so monstrous an outrage upon truth—not to say charity—that it was impossible for me to pass over in silence such a statement made by a clergyman holding a responsible position as an incumbent in the diocese. Some correspondence has since passed between us, but the upshot (and I deeply regret it) is only that you acknowledge the accuracy of the report, and attempt by argument to justify your words. I cannot enter into discussion but must content myself with simply, as your bishop, severely censuring the employment of such language, and expressing my sorrow that you could have allowed yourself to be betrayed into making a public charge so base and so offensive." By this manly letter Dr. Dowden not only gives proof of his love of honesty in controversy, but does honor to himself and to his church.—The Monitor (Roman Catholic), February 2.
