# Father Chiniquy to Archbishop Fabre.

When the venerable Father Chiniquy was ill at his home in Montreal a few months ago, several Roman Catholics, including a Jesuit priest, called to see him for the purpose of bringing him back to the Roman Catholic faith. He firmly but courteously refused to be led back to Rome, and when he had regained his health he wrote a letter to Archbishop Fabre of Montreal, in which he said:—

"MONTREAL, 65 Hutchison Street,
"December 8, 1894.

"To My Lord Fabre, Roman Catholic Bishop of Montreal:

"My bodily strength is so perfectly restored that I write you this letter without the use of any spectacles, and my hand does not shake more than when I was only thirty years old, though I am in my eighty-sixth year.

"I am cured, perfectly cured, though I have not had a single drop of your waters of Notre Dame de Lourdes, and without going to the good St. Anne of Beaupre! I am cured in spite of the maledictions and excommunications of the bishops and priests of Rome!

"And, what will puzzle you the more, I am cured, perfectly cured, without having accepted any one of your medals or scapularies—without even having bought any of your blessed candies which I might have got from you for five cents!

"But, to prevent you from suspecting that the devil alone, or some witches, could have healed such a bad man as I am, I must give you the secret of that cure. May our merciful God grant that you may have recourse to the same remedy with the multitudes of our dear countrymen you are leading in the perishing ways of Rome.

"From the very day that I broke the chains which were tying me to the feet of the idols of the pope, I put myself under the care of the best physician the world has ever seen. His name is Jesus. He is both the Sun of God and the Sun of man. He came from heaven more than 1,800 years ago to save us from all our spiritual and even bodily miseries. But his condition was that those who wanted to be cured by him should not invoke any other name but his own. For his Apostle Peter wrote in his Testament these very words: 'There is no other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved.' Acts 4:12. His Testament is called 'The Gospel.'

"These last 1,800 years, all the echoes of heaven and earth are repeating His sweet words: 'Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.' Matt. 11:28.

"'Whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.' John 14:13.

"'If ye shall ask anything in my name, I will do it.' John 14:14.

"'If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him.' John 14:23.

"'I am the vine, ye are the branches.' 'Abide in me, and I in you.' John 15:4, 5.

"'And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me.' John 12:32.

"From the day I gave up the pope to follow Christ I have found more and more every day that the greatest joys, the greatest happiness in this world were to love and serve him. I have kept myself, then, united to him with all the faculties of my heart and my soul, as being my only light, my only strength, my only wisdom, and I have always found him true to his promises.

"But when I found that it was good to be united to that mighty and merciful Friend in the days of prosperity, I have found that it was still more my interest to be united to him in the days of trial through which I had to pass. He was my shield when I was attacked by the thousands of assassins whom you, or your priests, have so often sent to take away my life, either with their pistols, or with their murderous sticks, or with their sharp stones.

"When these stones were falling upon me as hail on a stormy day, in the streets of Montreal, Quebec, Halifax, Charlottetown, Antigonish, Ottawa, etc., I was throwing myself into the arms of that mighty and loving Friend, I was pressing myself on his heart—and I felt secure as a little child when in his loving mother's arms. I was invoking his all mighty name, and it seemed I was seeing his merciful arms around me to protect me. I was hearing his sweet voice telling me, 'Fear not, for I am with thee!' And when I was escaping from my would-be murderers' hands, bruised, wounded, bleeding, I felt happy for having suffered something for the sake of that beloved Saviour who, on the cross, had shed his blood for me.

"But it was when I was attacked by the last terrible sickness that I felt the necessity of having that mighty and merciful Friend near me as my physician. With Peter I cried, 'Lord, save me.' And you can come and see with what merciful and mighty hand he has come to my help and cured me!

"You may imagine my surprise and my sadness when, in that very time, I saw your priests and priestesses coming to tell me that I was out of the way of salvation, and that I was to be damned if I would not come back to the church of Rome of which you are a bishop.

"For, what had these priests of Rome to give me to take the place of that divine Friend and Physician, Jesus the Son of God, that I might forget that he was my only hope, my only life, my only Saviour, my only refuge? What did they offer me to prevent me from saying with Paul, 'I do not want to know any other but Jesus and Him crucified'? They had nothing but a few rags, called scapulars, and some small idols of copper, iron and silver, probably found in the crumbling remains of the temples of Venus, Minerva, Bacchus and Jupiter!

"Yes! what had your priests to give me that I might forget and forsake that dear Saviour Jesus, whose presence in my heart was, very often, making me so happy that I was not only forgetting my terrible sufferings, but was changing those sufferings into feelings of unspeakable joy? They had to offer me a little god, only about an inch in diameter, made with a little flour baked by their servant girls between two heated irons.

"Be not surprised, then, if I have ordered those ambassadors of Rome out of doors with the utmost indignation!

"C. CHINQUY."
