# What Some Swiss Editors Think and Say.

An item has lately appeared in La Semaine Religieuse, published in Geneva, Switzerland, which is interesting, as containing in condensed shape the thought and expression of several Swiss editors in reference to Seventh-day Adventists and their publications. The article, as it appeared in La Semaine Religieuse, on February 2, is as follows:—

In the month of December, Le Pays, Catholic organ of the Bernese Juras, published an article in which it complained vigorously of the distribution in the Catholic parishes of little streets for the propagation of Protestantism, which were, it said, "an artful attempt to excite contempt for the confessional." La Gazette du Vidais and Le Courrier de Genère, journals of the same shade of belief, hastened to reproduce the article, enlarging upon it with many comments. Le Pays denounced especially the little journal, entitled, Les Signes des Temps, which is sent, it says, by mail to a multitude of people who do not wish it, and which "calls the eucharist a wafer and the pope anti-christ." It imagines that the expenses of this "paltry proselytism" are drawn from "the well-filled pastoral coffees of Basler pietism."

The Catholic organ, then, does not know that the sheet which it documents is the organ of the Seventh-day Adventists, and that this sect has no better opinion of our Reformed churches, national or independent, than of the Roman Catholic Church. Do they not urge the adherents of all other denominations, Catholic or Protestant, "to come out of their Babylon," join these new saints of the last days who observe Saturday in the place of Sunday, and are the only Christians who have not apostatized by receiving upon their foreheads the mark of the heart? If the liberty of propagation was not for us a sacred principle, and if our co-religiosists had not been trained to free investigation by three centuries of controversy, we should also have as good reasons as the Catholic papers for deploring the importation into our parishes of these "packages of waste paper" which excite in these editors so peculiar a mixture of fear and scorn.

This article La Tribune de Genève reprinted in its issue of February 4, under the title "Intolerance," simply crediting it to its source and making no comment other than that contained in the pithily exclamatory title.

The Semaine Religieuse, which has heretofore been aptly called the Semaine "Furieuse," describes itself, on its title page, as "Organe du Protestantisme Evangélique," or Organ of Evangelical Protestantism. It makes itself the mouthpiece of the Independent Church of French-speaking Switzerland, and is edited with a pointed pen and keen rhetoric. This article, which it addresses "To the Catholic Papers,"—as originally entitled,—is an interesting example of subtlety and acuteness of method. It masses the expressions of three Catholic editors and calls the attention of all Catholic papers to them. Thoughtful care is taken to cull for the benefit of the citizens of Basel that expressive phrase, "the well-filled pastoral coffees of Basler pietism," and thus to canker the gold, with which their coffees are unquestionably well filled, with the information of their undesired reputation for evangelical and missionary effort.

But having administered this bitter draught, as an incentive for the further development of Basler antagonism toward Seventh-day Adventists, it proceeds to inform them all, with a graciousness which is almost a reminder of the sweet suavity of Mark Antony with which he stirred the Roman populace to violence, who it is against whom they should direct their attacks.

Thus having stirred them all, at the last, with unexpected and treacherous reverse of its poisonous weapon, upon its comrades of the moment, like the wasp, it leaves its inflammatory sting to rankle in the sudden and unlooked-for thrust of its last sentence.

How many centuries more of controversy would it take to show religious controversialists that controversy with individuals or sects rather than with principles, is itself irreligious, and an unquestionable evidence of failure to comprehend the spirit of true religion?
