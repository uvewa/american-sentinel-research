# Personal Liberty in Chicago.

On the fifteenth day of December, in the year of our Lord eighteen hundred and ninety-four, and of the Independence of the United States the one hundred and nineteenth, there was legally organized in the county of Cook, Illinois, a corporation entitled the "Chicago Personal Liberty Association," its object being to promote the cause of personal liberty and to defend this cause from attacks from all sources. The management of this association is vested in a board of five doctors, to be elected annually.

Is it extraordinary that anyone hundred and nineteen years of national dependence, five earnest men meet to realize for self-preservation? Is it still more extraordinary that this league is gaining membership so fast as to warrant the belief that in a few months fifty thousand names will be enrolled? The wheels of progress go round very fast in Chicago when they move at all, and their revolution has begun. No political party can now afford to ignore the uprising against fanaticism and corruption. Non-partisan in politics, Chicago's Personal Liberty Association welcomes Democrats, Republicans and Independents, demanding no pledge but that of allegiance to the principles upon which the Republic was founded and upon the perpetuity of which our institutions depend.

The founders of this league are profoundly convinced that the world is too much governed; that such government is best as governs least; that a stream cannot rise higher than its source; that a community is no better than the individuals composing it; that the development of individualism is the Republic's greatest need; that the besetting sin of our people—and more's the shame—is dishonesty; that the only road to reform in national and municipal affairs is in reform of the individual, not by making laws, but by making character strong enough to resist temptations in which the world abounds.

With all my heart and head I welcome a league for which I have long prayed. Their fight is mine. For eight years I have been preaching their gospel, and have been reviled and rejected by those who mistake their liver for their conscience. It is futile to fly in the face of the Almighty and build a fence around humanity beyond which vision may not range. Freedom in thought and deed, independence of character, are the very bulwarks of a republic. Without such freedom, without individuality, a government of the people, for the people, by the people is a fraud. Let the new league go to the Bible for its inspiration and its watchword: "Son of man, stand on thy feet!"—Kate Field's Washington, Jan. 5, 1895.
