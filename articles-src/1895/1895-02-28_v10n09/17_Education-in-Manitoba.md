# Education in Manitoba.

## A Series of Judicial Decisions.

Pennina, Feb. 12.—The school system of Manitoba, now practically modeled upon that of the United States, has been the subject of bitter and determined contention there since 1890, in which year it was adopted. Formerly the system prevailing in Ontario and Quebec was in force there, providing separate schools for Protestant and Roman Catholic children and giving the Catholics a portion of the school fund. The Catholics rose in arms against the new ordinance and have fought it tooth and nail ever since, being beaten at all points and at last worsted before the authority of final appeal. Their first application in opposition to the new law was to the courts of the province, which pronounced the statute valid. It was carried to an appellate tribunal consisting of one Catholic and two Protestant judges, and the decree of the former court was sustained by the majority, the Catholic judge voting against it. It was then carried to the supreme court at Ottawa, consisting of six judges, three being Protestant and three Catholic, and this high tribunal unanimously reversed the preceding decisions.

The Manitoba government then carried the case before the privy council in London, which reversed the Ottawa decision, restoring the rulings of the various courts. The Catholics then appealed to the governor-general under a clause in the same providing for remedial legislation in certain cases, and the governor-general referred them to the supreme court at Ottawa, a special act being passed by the Dominion Government conferring competent authority on the court to render such a decision. It decided that the government had no such power, all the judges, Protestant and Catholics, concurring. From this decision the Catholics again appealed to the privy council with a result as yet undetermined, but it is likely to reaffirm its former decisions. There is little doubt that Manitoba prefers her new school system, and that it will be adhered to notwithstanding all efforts from every quarter against it.—The Sun, Feb. 17.
