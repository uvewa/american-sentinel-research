# A Delaware Sunday Bill.

In the legislature of the State of Delaware on Wednesday last an "Anti-Sunday-Work Bill" was introduced, the representative presenting it stating that he did so at the request of the Wilmington branch of the International Plasterers' Association. The bill is so sweeping in its provisions that we give it in full:

SECTION 1. That chapter 131 of the Revised Code of this State be amended by inserting the following between the first and second paragraphs of section 4, and immediately after the word "hours:" "If any person, corporation, or firm engaged in business of any kind shall carry on or operate the same, or shall attempt to carry on or operate the same on the Lord's day, commonly called Sunday, or shall engage, employ or hire any person to carry on or operate the same on the Lord's day or Sunday, he, it or they shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof shall pay a fine of $100 and costs of prosecution for each and every such offense and may also be obtained one month in addition to such fine and costs. And any person, corporation, or firm engaged in business as aforesaid that shall carry on or operate the same clandestinely, or that shall look or fasten up the entrance or means of ingress thereto for the purpose of concealing their operations or work, or shall compel or coerce their employés by threats or suggestions of discharge or other disadvantage, injury or loss because such employee refuse or decline to work on the Lord's day, shall be guilty in like manner and punished accordingly. And besides and in addition to such prosecution such offenders shall forfeit and pay a fine of like amount to any one who may within one year sue for the same either before a justice of the peace or in the superior court."

Never before in our national history has there been such a universal demand for more rigid State Sunday laws as there is this winter. By general agreement the church agitators for national Sunday legislation have practically abandoned Washington and are now engaged in a State crusade. With a view to concealing the religious character of legislation demanded, much work has been done among labor organizations with a view to enlisting their coöperation. This is the published plan of Dr. Crafts' "Sabbath Reform Committee in Affiliation with the National Bureau of Reform," under the sub-heading "Securing Coöperation of Labor Unions;" and the plan is succeeding.

Since the above was written we have learned that the proposed bill was defeated at its second reading on motion of Representative Pyle who introduced it. Now Mr. Pyle may expect to be boycotted by a certain religious element which is the real "power behind the throne" of all such measures.
