# France Clings to the Church.

## Deputies Reject Measures to Suppress the Public Worship Ministry and Separate Church and State.

Paris, Feb. 16.—In the Chamber of Deputies this afternoon M. Chauvin offered a resolution to abolish the public worship budget. It was defeated by a vote of 379 to 111. The object of the resolution, of course, was to do away with the Ministry of Public Worship by cutting off the appropriation for its support.

M. Faure then introduced a bill for the separation of Church and State.

M. Ribot, the Premier, declared that the enactment of such a measure would threaten the peace of the country.

The bill was rejected by a vote of 305 to 205—The World, Feb. 17.
