# Freedom of Conscience and Sunday Laws.

[It is not sufficiently emphasized that the Jew is left absolutely free to observe the seventh day. He can close his shop; he can refuse to work."—Rev. Wilbur F. Crafts.]

It should be emphasized that all the Jews
Are free to rest whatever day they choose;
A law to guard the Christian day of rest
Leaves conscience free, so none will be oppressed.

Such is the sophistry of those who plead
For Sunday laws—laws to sustain their creed.
In candor now we ask, Is it no crime
To take from man one-sixth part of his time?

Let it be emphasized that all are free
To rest on Sunday, whosee'er they be,
If conscience lead them thus, there is no cause
That they should be compelled by statute laws.

For those who've not that conscience 'tis too bad
To be compelled to act as if they had;
For, let this simple truth be understood,
Compelling men by law can't make them good.

If hypocrites are what they wish to make,
No surer way they possibly could take
Than using tests religious as a bait
To office-seeking parties in the State.

When they convert the world by means like these,
Base hypocrites will play their games with ease;
And their millennium, with such a brood,
Will be the vilest era since the flood.

—R. F. C.
