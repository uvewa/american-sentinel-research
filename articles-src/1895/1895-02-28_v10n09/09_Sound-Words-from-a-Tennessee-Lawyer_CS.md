# Sound Words from a Tennessee Lawyer.

When considering Sabbatarianism why advocate a divorcement of religious from civil laws, or a relaxation of their enforcement, upon the theory, as Dr. Rylance has done, that the Mosaic Sabbath is obsolete? As long as we discuss in what manner the civil law may compel the keeping of a rest day, so long do we concede that right to the State. Is not keeping it by a certain day in the week a religious order, and as much a matter of faith as being, as the eucharist, etc.? Is it not a danger to example, in our popular government, Christians to compel the observance of their rest day simply because they are in the majority? The heathen, upon the same policy, a would have the right to prohibit the keeping of that day, or to compel the day, should they become numerically the stronger. And like "the struck eagle" the Christian pangs would be keen to find that they had "nursed the pinion which impelled the steel."

In theory, judging from the organic laws, our country is an asylum for all kinds of faith. Here the Chinese may build his joss-house, the Hindoo his temple, the Mohammedan his mosque, and the Buddhist may rock-new his tope. In practice it is the country where only the Christian may freely worship, and that Christian must keep Sunday, the first day of the week, which day is not mentioned in the Decalogue nor made holy in the Sacred Canon. What right has the State to make the Moslems, the Hebrews, the Seventh-day Baptists, the Seventh-day Adventists observe a rest day other than that which is in harmony with their faith? What right has the State to make atheists, infidels, and pagans observe any day?—Cyrus Simmons, Knoxville, Tenn., in the World, Feb. 12.
