# The Latest Sunday Bill.

There is an epidemic of reform legislation sweeping over the legislatures of the several States. It assumes all the symptoms of a deep-seated malady in some of them and the outcome of it threatens to be the resurrection and rehabilitation of many of the Blue Laws which have made Connecticut a byword and reproach among the enlightened people of the country.

The most virulent outbreak of the epidemic occurred in Missouri last week when a member from one of the lower counties gave notice that he would introduce a bill abolishing tall theater hats, prohibiting barter and sale of every kind and forbidding the playing of baseball, football, and cards on the first day of the week. This aroused a storm among the members of the legislature from St. Louis and Sedalia and they severally noticed as many bills forbidding the playing of marbles, leap-frog, and other nursery games, and proscribing riding, driving, smiling and kissing on Sunday.

One of the members of the upper house, to add to the absurdity of the situation, gave notice of this bill and moved its adoption as a substitute for all pending bills:—

SECTION 1.

It is a sin

To steal a pin,

Or shave a chin,

On Sunday.

SECTION 2.

No one shall smile,

Or think of gulle,

Or wicked wile,

On Sunday.

SECTION 3.

No one shall kiss,

A wife or miss,

Or taste of bliss,

On Sunday.

He thinks that this will cover everything desired by the reformers and check the spread of the epidemic.—Detroit Journal, Feb. 13.
