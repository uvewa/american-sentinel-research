# Good News for Cotton Mather.

Now that the government of the great State of New York has brought its power to bear for the punishment of a wretch who was detected in the heinous crime of selling earmuffs on Sunday with the thermometer at zero, word ought to be got to Cotton Mather that the millennium is coming at last in what was once Stuyvesant's ungodly village.—The World, Feb. 13.
