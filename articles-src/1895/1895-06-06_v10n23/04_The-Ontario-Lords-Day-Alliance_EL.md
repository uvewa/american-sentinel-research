# THE ONTARIO LORD'S DAY ALLIANCE.

BY EUGENE LELAND.

This organization was formed early in the spring of the present year for the purpose of promoting the observance of the "Lord's day" in the Province of Ontario. The means which it proposes to adopt in order to meet the purpose of its organization have been so well stated in an article signed by the president and secretary of the association, and published in the Toronto Star, of April 8, that I shall not be charged with misrepresentation if I take the work of the Alliance to be just what it is there stated to be, especially as the object of the article referred to was to correct some misrepresentations concerning it. It says:—

The Alliance is formed, not for the purpose of advancing any particular religious view respecting the nature and obligation of the Sabbath; but for the purpose of protecting the individual God-given right of every one to rest and worship on the Lord's day.

This is the only passage in the article which I shall take the time to notice. The "nature" of the Sabbath, respecting which the Alliance purposes to take no particular religious view, is rest; and as to its "obligation," we find that it is simply a requirement of God to do on the Sabbath what its nature demands, and that is rest. So far, then, as the "nature and obligation of the Sabbath" are concerned, we find simply rest, and religious rest at that; for the "obligation" is to "keep it holy." If it is not kept holy, it is not kept at all; and therefore the only "view" which can be taken "respecting the nature and obligation of the Sabbath," is a religious view. It is impossible to take any other view of it. To view the Sabbath from a secular standpoint, or to speak of it as being a "civil" institution, is as absurd in principle as it would be to speak of the Queen's birthday, or of any other national holiday, as being sacred or religious in character.

The Sabbath is called in the Bible "My holy day," "The Lord's day." It is a sacred, not a secular, day; and the only "view" of the Sabbath which can possibly be advanced that will cause the people to "honor it," is the religious view. But "it is not the purpose of the Alliance to advance any particular religious view respecting the nature and obligation of the Sabbath." Officially, and publicly, the Alliance announces to the world its purpose to disregard the only view of the Sabbath that can truthfully be taken, and to treat the sacred institution of the Lord's day from a secular point of view. It announces its purpose to use the power of civil law to compel men who are Sabbath-breakers to act as if they were Sabbath-keepers.

But if a man has the God-given right to rest and worship on the Lord's day, does it follow that he must be compelled to exercise that right? Isn't it possible for him to exercise that right without the protection of civil law? Every one in the world has the God-given right to breathe, to sleep, to eat; but does he need the power of civil law to assist him in the exercise of these rights? If so, in what way? The answer comes: The law protects him in his right to breathe by prohibiting any unwholesome business locating in his vicinity, such as a slaughter-house or a tannery. It protects his right to eat by forbidding the sale of decayed or adulterated foods, such as would produce disease; and it protects his right to sleep by prohibiting boisterous or unbecoming conduct which would disturb his sleep. But does it protect a man in his God-given right to breathe, to eat, or to sleep, by compelling every one else to do these things in the same way?

And so it is of rest and worship on the Lord's day. Does it protect a man in his right to rest and worship on the Lord's day by compelling every other man to rest and worship on that day? The man who has the desire and the disposition to rest and worship on the Lord's day can do so whether any other man on the face of the earth does or not. It is not necessary that every other man, nor any other man should be compelled to rest and worship on the Lord's day simply because I want to rest and worship on that day. It is an act of arbitrary power, of usurpation, of tyranny, to compel one man to perform an act of religious worship because some other man, or some association of men, wishes to worship in that manner.

And that we have not misrepresented the work of the Alliance will be plainly seen by reading the quotation from their official announcement as given above. The object of the Alliance is thus stated: "The Alliance is formed . . . for the purpose of protecting the individual, God-given right of every one to rest and worship on the Lord's day. The legislature does not create this right, but recognizes and safeguards it." That is a very worthy object, if by the protection, recognition, and safe-guardianship, is meant simply the protection of the individual from injury and incivility which is afforded by the governmental power on the Lord's day the same as on other days of the week, and no more so; but that is not what the Alliance means. It means by "protection," the power which the State exercises to compel the individual to observe the Lord's day. But such protection and safe-guardianship does not protect the individual in any right, but it does protect the day.

The person who is thus under the guardianship of the governmental power "rests," and perhaps (?) "worships" on the Lord's day, not because he has a God-given right to do so, but because he is compelled to do so; not because God commands him to observe the day, but because the State requires it; not because he loves God, but because he fears man; and it is time that people should know that such rest and worship is sheer hypocrisy!

"The individual, God-given right to rest and worship on the Lord's day," or on any other day, can have no existence without the existence at the same time of the individual, and equally God-given, right not to rest and worship, if the individual does not choose to do either. What kind of a right, forsooth, is it which one is compelled to exercise? Does the man who is drafted into the army, or who pays his taxes, exercise any right in doing either? A right can have no existence where there is not a freedom of choice. The volunteer exercises a right when he joins the army, because he has the freedom to choose whether he will go or stay at home; but the man who is drafted into the army exercises no right when he goes, because he has no choice in the matter; he must go. The volunteer may go. In the observance of religious practices,—in the service of God,—volunteers are wanted, not conscripts. "Whosoever will" may come.

But carry this point further. The government exercises a right when it demands the payment of taxes from the individual, but the individual does not exercise a right when he pays them; and for the very simple reason, if for no other, that he has no right to refuse to pay them. He must pay them. The same reasoning is true with reference to the observance of the Lord's day. If the governmental power has a right to demand Sabbath observance of the individual, then the individual has no right to refuse to render it, and therefore he has no "individual, God-given right to rest and worship on the Lord's day."

But, on the other hand, if the individual has a God-given right to rest and worship on the Lord's day, as he has, and as the officers of the Alliance admit, then the governmental power has no right to demand either rest or worship from him. The government has no right to exercise any power which has not been delegated to it by the people; and the right to rest and worship on the Lord's day can never be delegated by the individual to the government.

Rights are of two kinds, natural and artificial. Natural rights are such as are possessed by every one in the world without distinction as to age or sex, race or creed. They are inherent in the individual alone, and consequently cannot be delegated to another. With such rights no government can justly have anything to do, further than to protect the individual in his exercise of them. One of these rights is "the individual, God-given right to rest and worship on the Lord's day."

Artificial rights are such as are created by the government. If there were no such thing as government, these rights would not exist. Such rights are possessed only by the favored few. As for instance, the right to vote is granted only to males who have attained to the age of twenty-one years. The right of the government to demand taxes of the individual is another example of artificial rights; but it is a just claim, for the State is supposed to render an equivalent to the individual for them in the protection of person and property. He has the right to demand the services of the police force, or of the entire fire department of the city for his protection, if need be, and they have no right to refuse the demand, because his taxes have been paid for that very purpose. In the payment of his taxes, he exercises no right, but in the demand for their equivalent, he does. A right is a just claim, but there can be no just claim where an equivalent is not rendered.

Now, if the government has a right to demand Lord's day observance of the individual, he has no right to refuse to render it, but he has a right to demand an equivalent. But this can never be given, and therefore the government, in demanding Lord's day observance, is demanding something for nothing. The government does not exercise a right in this demand, but it does perform an act of usurpation of the individual's right. It is simply an act of tyranny on the part of those who demand it, and an act of slavery on the part of those who render such Lord's day observance.

The man who observes the Lord's day because it is right, needs no law to compel him to do it; and the man who observes it simply because he is afraid that some one will lay violent hands on him if he doesn't do it, is in servile bondage to just that extent. What he needs is to have more love preached to him and less law, for "love is the fulfilling of the law," and "by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight."
