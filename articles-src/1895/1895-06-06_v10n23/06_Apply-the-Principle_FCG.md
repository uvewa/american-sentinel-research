# APPLY THE PRINCIPLE.

F. C. GILBERT.

DOUBTLESS many of the readers of the SENTINEL are familiar with the persecutions that were waged against Protestant missionaries about a year ago, in some of the South American republics—in which places the papacy has supremacy—and which have not yet entirely ceased. In these persecutions the missionaries of the Methodist Episcopal Church suffered much, and were deprived of many of their rights and privileges. Finally about May, 1894, the Rock River (Ill.) Methodist Episcopal Conference, embracing some of the wealthiest churches of Chicago as well as its suburbs, sent a kind of protest to the papal legate in this country, by him to be forwarded to the supreme pontiff at Rome, reminding the pope that his subjects were enjoying perfect religious liberty in the United States, and that he ought to grant the same rights and privileges to the Protestants in the dominions over which he has supremacy.

The following was the message:—

Resolved, That as representatives of the Methodist Episcopal Church in Chicago, we forward the following request to Archbishop Ireland, asking him to pass it on to Mgr. Satolli, in order that he may, in the most effective manner, bring it to the notice of the head of the Roman Catholic Church. In view of the repeated and warm approval by the clergy and laymen of the Roman Catholic Church in this country of religious freedom as existing by law in these United States, we respectfully and earnestly request that the proper authorities of that church use their good offices, under the direction of Pope Leo XIII., to secure for the Protestants of Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia, the same liberty of conscience that is enjoyed by Roman Catholic citizens in this country.

Prefixed to this resolution was the following preamble:—

It has been made evident to us that our Protestant brethren in the republics of Peru, Ecuador, and Bolivia, labor under oppressive disabilities that affect not only their faith and the public worship of God according to the dictates of their conscience, but also their civil and inalienable right to be married without being compelled to forswear their religious convictions.

To the student of history, familiar with the workings of the Roman Catholic Church, such actions on the part of the papacy are not at all surprising. It is but the result of her teachings. For she teaches that religious liberty is the right to worship God according to the dictates of a "right conscience." And since the church claims to be the judge of conscience, all who believe differently from the church's teachings, and act in harmony with their belief, are not following a "right conscience," hence are in error. If they are not willing to follow the teachings of the church, they ought not to be allowed to propagate any other doctrines in papal dominions.

So we see that such deeds of the papacy are the logical result of her teachings. True she claims to grant toleration at times, to a certain degree; it generally goes about as far as the ink on the paper.

One would naturally suppose that Protestants making such an earnest protest in behalf of their children because of persecution, would never do the same thing to others had they the power. But it is a fact familiar to thousands of people to-day that members of the same church which protested against the actions of the Catholic Church in persecuting her followers, have been persecutors themselves; not against people in Roman Catholic countries, but in the free United States of America. And these persecutions have been waged against honest, conscientious Christian men, who were simply following the dictates of their own consciences.

It is a matter of history to-day that in the State of Maryland, Methodist ministers have been instrumental in securing the arrest and conviction of sincere worshipers of God who were simply following their God-given right of worshiping the Lord in the manner prescribed in his holy Word,—keeping the seventh-day Sabbath (Saturday) (Ex. 20:8-11), and following their regular vocations on Sunday, the first day of the week, one of the six working days (Eze. 46:1), which God gave to man to perform all his labor. And for this act of worship these men have been incarcerated in jail as vile and base criminals.

It is evident that these people were obliged to "labor under oppressive disabilities that affect . . . their faith and public worship of God according to the dictates of their conscience." But their persecutors were not very much troubled about it, and probably did not think they were depriving these men of equal rights and privileges that they were enjoying in this free country. Nor is this State an exception to many other of the sister States that have joined in persecuting men and even women, because they felt they ought to worship God as he has indicated. And let us not forget that these persecutions were not conducted in a country that is under the jurisdiction of the Roman Catholic Church; but in a land dominated by Protestants and which declares to all the world that all men are created equal, and are endowed with certain inalienable rights.

It is still fresh in the minds of thousands of American citizens to-day, what Tennessee has lately done in confining in jail some of the most respected and honorable citizens of Rhea County, and how an entire community has become almost disintegrated by this wicked deed, as well as the closing of a fine academy. There is an adage familiar to many that is quite applicable in this case,—"It all depends upon which foot the shoe is on, as to whether it hurts." Let our Protestant brethren who have been, and still are, protesting against this iniquity in the previously-named countries, apply the principle here at home, and give to their Christian brethren in this country the same God-given rights that they are enjoying, and which they seek for their brethren in papal dominions; and then they will have learned somewhat of the significance of the Golden Rule, "Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them."
