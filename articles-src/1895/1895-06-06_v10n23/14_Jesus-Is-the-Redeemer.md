# Jesus Is the Redeemer

The Lester (Iowa) Recorder prints an announcement of a prospective summer school to be held at Grennell, Iowa, June 29 to July 3, which its projectors hope, according to the printed program, will be largely attended by those "who believe that Jesus is the Redeemer of society and of the nation."

Commenting on this object of the school the Recorder well says:—

The only way Jesus is to redeem society is the redemption of the individual members of society. Christ has left no promise that he will ever redeem a nation; but he has promised that he would "break them with a rod of iron;" and "dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel." All the "schools of the kingdom" that can be convened from this time onward will not change this decree.

Some clergyman could learn some Bible truth, especially concerning this question, from some editors.
