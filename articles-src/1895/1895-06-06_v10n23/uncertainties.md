## Specific Uncertainties

### Page 1, Masthead
- **Transcribed as:** "CALVIN P. BOLLMAN, | AS-INTANT EDITOR."
- **Confidence:** LOW
- **Issue:** The word appears to be "AS-INTANT" but this is clearly an OCR error for "ASSISTANT"
- **Resolution:** Corrected to "ASSISTANT EDITOR" based on standard masthead format and context

### Page 1, Article "Why, What Evil Hath He Done?"
- **Transcribed as:** "Stano officials"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM
- **Issue:** Word "Stano" in line 107 appears unclear - likely should be "State"
- **Resolution:** Corrected to "State officials" based on context

### Page 1, Article "Why, What Evil Hath He Done?"
- **Transcribed as:** "battlements roze"
- **Confidence:** LOW
- **Issue:** Word "roze" in line 149 - unclear if this is "rose" or intentional archaic spelling
- **Resolution:** Kept as "roze" - may be poetic license or archaic spelling in original poem

### Page 1, Article "Why, What Evil Hath He Done?"
- **Transcribed as:** "With love that scores at the grave"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM
- **Issue:** Word "scores" in line 167 - unclear if this should be "scorns"
- **Resolution:** Kept as "scores" - could be archaic usage meaning "mocks" or "disdains"

### Page 2, Article "Paternalism"
- **Transcribed as:** "it is unhealthy, no American, and unladylike"
- **Confidence:** LOW
- **Issue:** "no American" clearly should be "un-American"
- **Resolution:** Corrected to "un-American" based on obvious context and parallel structure

### Page 3, Article "What Is Rome's System?"
- **Transcribed as:** "rite at as means of grace"
- **Confidence:** LOW
- **Issue:** "rite at" should be "ritual"
- **Resolution:** Corrected to "ritual" based on context

### Page 5, Footnote
- **Transcribed as:** "Translated by Rev. Oscar Goels, Gretna, La."
- **Confidence:** HIGH
- **Note:** Name appears clear in original

### Page 5, Article "Religious Persecution in America"
- **Transcribed as:** "He refused to pay a single sum of $1000"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM
- **Issue:** The sentence structure is awkward - may have OCR issues
- **Resolution:** Kept as transcribed - appears to be the original wording despite awkwardness

### Page 6, Advertisements
- **Note:** Skipped all book advertisements and promotional material as per instructions
- Bible specimen text appears garbled in OCR but was preserved as-is since it's advertisement material

### Page 7, Article "Mediaeval Georgia"
- **Transcribed as:** "at this end of the nineteenth century"
- **Confidence:** HIGH
- **Note:** Original uses "mediaeval" spelling consistently, preserved as written

## Summary
