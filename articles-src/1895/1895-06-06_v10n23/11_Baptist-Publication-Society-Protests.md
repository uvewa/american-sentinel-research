# BAPTIST PUBLICATION SOCIETY

### Protests Against the Arrest of Seventh-day Baptists and Seventh-day Adventists.

[From the New York Sun. June 2.]

Saratoga, June 1.—After the address of its president, the seventy-first annual report of the Board of Managers of the American Baptist Publication Society was presented this morning. Its headquarters are in Philadelphia. The gross amount of sales exceeds that of the previous year. The sales for 1894 were $497,807.48, those for 1895 are $532,763.53. The receipts from all sources other than sales for the year, amount to $19,949.80. Three thousand seven hundred and sixty-six dollars have been transferred from the profits of the publishing department to the missionary department. The sum of $6,766, the contributions for the missionary work of the society, has not been sufficient to meet the demand and a deficit of $3,868.04 is reported. This added to the deficit of last year gives a total deficit in the missionary department of $18,401.88. Measures will be set on foot to remove this deficit. The entire amount received the past year for Bible work was $15,242.84, and for missionary work $112,508.78. Whatever profits are made in the publishing department beyond what is needed for the conduct and exigencies of business go directly to the benevolent work of the society.

The Rev. H. L. Wayland, of Philadelphia, offered a resolution to the effect that it having been reported in the public press that in some portions of the United States citizens who have conscientiously observed the seventh day as a day of religious rest and worship, and who have thereafter, on the first day of the week, conscientiously been engaged in labor which in no wise disturbed their fellow-citizens, have for this act been arrested and fined and imprisoned and put upon the chain-gang;

Resolved, That we most solemnly protest against the violation of the right of religious liberty, for which our fathers have contended at the cost of imprisonment and spoliation of their goods and stripes and exile, and even of life itself.

Several speeches followed the introduction of the resolution. J. B. Hawthorne, of Atlanta, Ga., said: "I know of no legislation in Georgia that will tolerate such an outrage as this, but, if they do, 275,000 Georgia Baptists will be heard from. We haven't any religious liberty in this Republic, but I believe we are coming toward it. We have simply religious tolerance." He closed by saying he was heartily in favor of the adoption of the resolution.

The resolution passed by a nearly unanimous vote.
