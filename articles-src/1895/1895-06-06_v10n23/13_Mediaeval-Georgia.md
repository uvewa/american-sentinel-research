# Mediaeval Georgia.

[From the Times-Democrat, New Orleans, La., May 23.]

The Times-Democrat has had sent to it a communication to the effect that "Mr. J. Q. Allison, of Douglasville, Ga., has been convicted for violating the Sabbath statute of the State of Georgia," and that, in consequence, "he is now in the chain-gang."

As the Times-Democrat has not learned the particulars of Mr. Allison's violation of the Sabbath, we are not in a position to compare the precise heinousness of the crime with the barbarity of the sentence. We have to say generally, however, without knowing the details of the affair in Douglasville, as we said a week or two ago in reference to a similar case of religious persecution in Tennessee, that a State which retains on its statute book laws that punish an industrious and honest man for keeping his Sabbath on the seventh day and working on the first day of the week, is a State both whose civilization and whose Christianity are of a questionable and mediaeval character. There is an ancient statute, known to most people, which says: "Six days shalt thou labor and do all thy work; but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work." We have not heard that that ancient statute, given by Jehovah himself to the leader of his chosen people, has ever been officially or authoritatively repealed; nor are we aware of any logical reason why people calling themselves Christians should take it upon themselves to maintain all the other commands of the Decalogue intact, and interfere, for their convenience, with this statute alone. Indeed, we are of the opinion that people calling themselves Christians are considerably unchristian when they punish their fellow-citizens for keeping one of the commands of the moral law, which they themselves are in the habit of breaking.

But it is positively appalling, at this end of the nineteenth century, to contemplate Georgia's code of Blue Laws respecting this "crime" of Sabbath-breaking. It provides that the offender may "be punished by a fine not to exceed $1,000, imprisonment not to exceed six months, to work in the chain-gang on the public works, or on such other works as the county authorities may employ the chain-gang, not to exceed twelve months, and any one or more of these punishments may be ordered in the discretion of the judge."

That is surely a steep enough punishment for obeying his conscience in preference to the dictates of a mere secular authority; but even that is not the worst of it. In case of "insurrection," under which head would naturally be included a refusal to work in the chain-gang on the Sabbath, this delightful Georgia law directs that "such . . . member or members of the chain-gang shall, upon trial and conviction in the Supreme Court of the county in which the crime is committed, be deemed guilty of a capital offense, and be punished with death, or such other punishment as the judge in his discretion may inflict."

If, therefore, a Georgian who does his religious devotions and keeps his weekly "day of rest" on Saturday, according to the explicit order of the Almighty, be found hoeing in his garden on Sunday, and be informed against, he is liable to a thousand dollars' fine, imprisonment for six months, and inclusion in the chain-gang; and in the event that while in the chain-gang, he refuses to work on his Sabbath, he is liable to be tried for "insurrection," to be convicted and to be put to death!

What a delightful land of religious liberty Georgia must be, to be sure!

Would it not be well for our sister State to make concession to the spirit of religious tolerance of which we are given to boast, to the extent of quashing Allison's sentence and of erasing from her statute book the mediaeval law against Sabbath-breaking which we have quoted? It is the nineteenth century that is now closing, not the fourteenth.
