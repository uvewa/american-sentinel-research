# AN IMPROVED PLAN TO INCREASE ATTENDANCE AT SUNDAY SCHOOL.

### Sunday School Up to Date.

[From the New York Press. May 23.]

Newark, N. J., May 22.—At the session of the Universalist Sunday School Union held here yesterday Rev. J. Coleman Adams announced that in six months he would agree to double or treble the attendance of any Sunday School if he were allowed to carry out his plans. He would organize the boys into companies and brigades. He would uniform them in red coats and white trousers, with plenty of gold trimmings; he would have a full brass band and a muscular drum corps. Every Sunday he would have the boys mount guard before the opening of the session of the school and have the rifles stacked in the aisles. He would have a library provided with good detective and cowboy stories. With these things and drills on Tuesdays and Thursdays he would increase the attendance of boys.

For the girls he would have bicycle clubs. The uniform would be a bright and attractive one. He would let them wear bloomers if they so desired. He would drill the girls in evolutions on the cycles. He said these plans would draw a crowd, if that was what was wanted. The great danger would be that a Sunday school near by might get brighter uniforms and a louder band. Energy and determination were what would build up a Sunday school. Mr. Adams said his first step would be, if he were allowed to carry out the plan outlined, to chain down the old fogies who might oppose his plan.
