# RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION IN AMERICA.

[From Die Rundschau* (Chicago), May 22.]

Die Rundschau deems it her duty to again call public attention to the persecution of Adventists for violating Sunday laws. Recently we were informed of a new case of this character. This time a Sabbatarian, by name, J. Q. Allison, of Douglasville, Georgia, is the victim. A telegram of the 16th inst. briefly, yet with terrible distinctness, announces: "ALLISON IN THE CHAIN-GANG!"†

The Sunday law of Georgia—entire and verbatim before us—does not essentially differ from those of other States. It prohibits every kind of Sunday labor, with the exception of works of necessity and charity. No exceptions are made in favor of Sabbatarians. But peculiar to it is the penalty against violators. Anyone convicted of Sabbath desecration, "shall be punished as prescribed in Section 4310 of this Code." And what does this section prescribe?—A fine not to exceed one thousand dollars, imprisonment not to exceed six months, work in the chain-gang not to exceed twelve months; and, forsooth, any one of these penalties separately or more of them combined, in the discretion of the judge. Consequently there might have been imposed on the ill-fated Allison by an ill-disposed judge the whole of this barbarous penalty. It has been his good fortune, however, to have had enforced upon him only(!) the penalty, "to work in the chain-gang on the public works, or on such other works as the county authorities may employ the chain-gang." The "county authorities" have also the right to "hire out" a member of the chain-gang to some private contractor, manifestly to the highest bidder. Allison might, too, under certain circumstances come into the position of being compelled to do servile labor for a private individual. Thus does Section 4582 of the glorious Code of the State of Georgia prescribe.

But what if Allison, after having been sentenced to compulsory labor for Sabbath desecration, were to refuse to do work on Saturday? It is very probable that such a case will come to pass; because Allison is an Adventist who believes the seventh day of the week to be the divinely enjoined day of rest upon which no secular labor may be performed. His conscience is bound to this alleged divine injunction, and experience teaches that Sabbatarians will rather suffer the worst than wantonly act contrary to their conscience. Then what will be the consequence? The State of Georgia has in its wisdom also provided for such a case. Then Mr. Allison would be guilty of the crime of "insurrection," as may be read in Section 4821. And if convicted of this crime, that is, if he be convicted before the supreme court of his county of having, as a member of the chain-gang, obstinately refused to obey orders by not doing convict labor on Saturday, then,—listen and marvel!—shall be "BE DEEMED GUILTY OF A CAPITAL OFFENSE, AND PUNISHED WITH DEATH, OR SUCH OTHER PUNISHMENT AS THE JUDGE IN HIS DISCRETION MAY INFLICT." Then he is, consequently, guilty of a capital offense; then he is, consequently, altogether exposed to the clemency or inclemency of the county judge; then this judge may in his discretion SENTENCE HIM TO DEATH!!

Presumably our readers know that Georgia belongs to the United States of America. Here, too, old and young sing:—

My country 'tis of thee,
Sweet land of liberty!

A precious liberty, forsooth! Let everyone clearly put before his mind the case under discussion. A citizen of this country, whose Constitution warrants and guarantees him perfect religious liberty, conscientiously believes he must perform the duties of his daily occupation on Sunday. It is not the province of the State to investigate if he has an erring conscience; for the State has nothing whatever to do with the conscience of its citizens. What Allison conscientiously did and for which the State tried him, is not at all a crime against the body and life of his fellow-citizens; by his Sunday work he did not at all encroach upon the equal rights of his fellowmen, so that it became the duty of the State to protect these against him. Notwithstanding he was deprived of that religious liberty and liberty of conscience which is guaranteed to him as well as to all. For what is religious liberty? According to the perfectly correct definition of the sainted Dr. Walther, this:—

It is the liberty the State grants to its citizens to privately and publicly EXERCISE WITHOUT RESTRAINT the religion each one conscientiously believes to be true and to publicly declare and defend its principles. In such a country, therefore, religious liberty exists, in which there be not one or more religious faiths that be exclusively tolerated therein and recognized as State religions and one of which all those must, therefore, profess who wish to enjoy the protection of the State, but in which every one is entitled to the rights and privileges of a citizen whatever may be the religion he professes.

But just this religious liberty, one of the brightest stars in the banner of our country, is, as much as is in their power to do so, manifestly destroyed by the Sunday laws of most States, and especially by the Sunday law of Georgia.

The State of Georgia demands of one of its citizens whose faith prohibits Saturday labor and enjoins Sunday labor to slight his conscience and unconditionally submit to the religious convictions of the majority of his fellow-citizens concerning the Sabbath. Now because he does not submit—and he may not submit even though his be an erring conscience—he is indicted, sentenced to disgraceful convict labor, stamped a disreputable criminal,—possibly, too, an insurgent and rebel, guilty of death and his neck forfeited to the rope of the hangman.

Ought not the entire liberty-loving press of the country to denounce the savagery of Georgia and take an energetic stand against the tyrannical, murderous, puritanical Sunday laws, the existence and occasional enforcement of which bring shame and ignominy upon our whole country, in which at one time religious liberty and liberty of conscience were made the fundamental law of the States?

And so much more, for the reason that just in the course of the previous week the General Assembly of Presbyterians assembled in Pittsburgh passed the liberty-hating resolution: "WE HEARTILY COMMEND ALL SUNDAY LEGISLATION DESIGNED TO PROTECT THE CHRISTIAN SABBATH AS A DAY OF REST AND WORSHIP."

From all of which every one may perceive: the enemies of the true liberty of our country are powerfully bestirring and preparing themselves to battle against the greatest treasure of our nation. Their battle cry is, Union of religion and State. They possess influence, and "their followers do fall in line with them." For God's sake, let us not be inactive, but let us make preparations for the battle. The most precious liberty of our country is at stake!
