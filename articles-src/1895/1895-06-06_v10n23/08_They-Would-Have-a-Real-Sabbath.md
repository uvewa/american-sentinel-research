# THEY WOULD HAVE A REAL "SABBATH."

[From the Evening News, Michigan City, May 18.]

VICTORIA, B. C., May 17.—The British Columbia Conference, which has just concluded its annual session here, adopted by a unanimous vote the report of the Sabbath Observance Committee. This document binds the conference and church to work as a unit toward securing legislation making it illegal to conduct excursions by rail or water on Sunday, to engage in hunting, fishing or boating on that day; to engage in any game of ball or kindred sport, and to ride for the purpose of pleasure in any hack, sleigh, buggy or other public vehicle, or to operate or patronize any Sunday street car.
