# THE "INTER-OCEAN" ON THE SABBATH QUESTION.

[From the Chicago Inter-Ocean. (Editorial.)]

The season being dull, Rev. J. M. Caldwell, of the South Park Avenue Methodist Episcopal Church, took for his Sunday morning text, "Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy," and meandered into a denunciation of the Sunday newspaper. The Sunday newspaper is not published or read on the Sabbath day. The Saturday newspaper is published on the Sabbath. "The seventh day" is that on which Israel was commanded to "do no work, thou, nor thy sons, nor thy daughters, nor thy manuscript, nor thy misderevant, nor the stranger that is within thy gates." We believe Mr. Caldwell reads the Sabbath, i.e., the Saturday papers with commendable regularity. Once for all, this clerical juggling with words should cease. Sunday is not the Sabbath of the Bible, and every preacher knows that it is not.

Not only is Sunday not the Sabbath, but it is not a holy day observed for or because of the reason that bound Israel to Sabbath observance. Of the Sabbath—our Saturday—it was written: "Thou shalt keep it holy, for in six days God created the heavens and earth, and rested on the seventh, wherefore he hallowed it." . . . There is not a passage of scripture, not one, in which commandment is given for change of the Sabbath from the seventh to the first. The fourth commandment is one of those that Christ came not "to destroy, but to fulfill." . . . The observance of Sunday is customary with Christians, but, as we conceive, by habit of reverence only. We know of no divine command for the observance of Sunday. We make bold to say that there is no direct divine command for its usage.
