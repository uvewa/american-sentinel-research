# PRESS COMMENTS ON SOUTHERN PERSECUTIONS.

[From the American Israelite, Cincinnati, May 23.]

It seems strange that the State of Georgia, in whose chief metropolis a grand fair is to be held next fall, should tolerate such fanaticism and persecution. But the only way to secure personal liberty is to bring the law in the light of day when its hideousness and its cruelty are patent to all. In time, its repeal will be demanded in the name of justice and humanity.

[From the Daily Telegraph, Sharon, Pa., May 18.]

What a horrible offense it must be to exercise religious liberty in the State of Georgia, if you be subject to death for its violation. Shame on the people of Georgia who will allow a true and loyal citizen to be condemned, and convicted of unharmful work and exercising his conviction relative to the Lord's commandments, for "six days shalt thou labor and do all thy work: but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God," etc.

[From the Progress, Minneapolis, May 18.]

In a recent issue of the Progress appeared an editorial entitled, "Modern Religious Persecution," in which was noted the outrageous, unjust treatment, which Seventh-day Adventists were being made the victims of, in Tennessee and elsewhere, all being done under the cover of old laws which the popular sentiment of the nation has long since outgrown. The persecution legally termed prosecution, has arisen from malicious personal motives on the part of a few persons who have long since forgotten the Golden Rule of the Master whom they profess to follow.

[From the Evening News, Michigan City, Ind., May 17.]

Mr. Allison's teachings and conscience prompt him to a strict observance of the popular Saturday as his Sabbath day, and on the next day he pursues necessary labors about his home and premises. For this he is arrested, jailed, fined, put to work with the chain-gang, hired out to the highest bidder as a convict; and may, upon refusal to labor thus, even upon the Sabbath day observed by his church, "be punished by death." What a law! What a persecution! What an outrage upon civilization, that such proceedings should be tolerated in any State, in the present age of enlightenment and free thought! It is a disgrace to the fair name of America and an outrage upon its citizens which should not be tolerated.
