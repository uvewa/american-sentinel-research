# RELIGIOUS LIBERTY AGAIN VIOLATED.

[From the Examiner and National Baptist, New York, May 30, 1895.]

We learn that Mr. J. Q. Allison, of Douglasville, Ga., has been convicted of violating the Sunday law, and that he has been put in the chain-gang,* in accordance with the laws of the State. The same law which provides that those who work on Sunday shall be punished by fine or imprisonment, or by working in the chain-gang on public works, also specifies that the money arising from fines in these cases shall be devoted to establishing and promoting Sunday schools in the county where the conviction has taken place; and that in case of insurrection or attempt at insurrection (which we suppose would include refusing to work upon the chain-gang) the offender shall be punished with death, or such other punishment as the judge in his discretion may inflict.

At Amory, Miss., Mr. R. T. Nash was arrested, May 9, for hoeing in his garden on Sunday. The trial is set for June 1. Are these States relapsing into barbarism? Are they deliberately going back to the practices which civilized States abandoned centuries ago?

Experience and medical science concur in the belief that the physical and mental welfare of the human race requires a weekly day of rest. As to the particular day which shall be selected, the State merely pursues the course which will meet the views of the majority of its citizens. If the majority of the people were Jews, they would have a perfect right to select the seventh day of the week. But inasmuch as the majority of the people prefer the first day of the week as the rest day, that day is selected, and the State very properly forbids that any one should exact on that day, from those in his employ, any labor that is not required by necessity or mercy. The same choice of the majority also designates the same day as the day for public worship, and forbids that any one shall do anything to deprive others of the right to enjoy their worship. Hence, Sunday parades accompanied by music are forbidden on that day; and it would be quite within the right of society to restrict the running of cars, or to forbid it altogether. Society also forbids the opening of shops, because this leads to a demand upon the employed for work on Sunday, and also because the opening of one shop on Sunday almost necessarily leads to the opening of other shops or all shops, of the same description. But here society must stop. It has no right to forbid any one pursuing, on a Sunday, any vocation which shall not disturb his fellowmen, nor interfere with their rights. If a man, on a Sunday, chooses to hoe in his garden, or to engage in any other peaceful occupation which disturbs no one, he is within his right.

Religious liberty is violated if he is molested by the law. This holds good, whatever faith he professes, or if he professes no faith at all. But the case is still stronger when the man is a conscientious follower of a faith which holds sacred the seventh day, and when he attests his conscientiousness by abstaining from labor on that day, and by engaging in public worship.

These, the principles of religious liberty, were held dear by our Baptist fathers, who suffered for their maintenance. The Baptists of Georgia are a great host, numbering 161,000 white and 206,000 colored people, probably exceeding in number any other denomination. The principles of religious liberty have been firmly and intelligently held by leading Baptists of the State, eminently by Hon. J. L. M. Curry, LL.D., a native of Georgia, now secretary of the Peabody Fund, a distinguished Baptist, than whom no one in the Southern States has a more potent voice.

We respectfully and earnestly urge upon Dr. Curry and upon ex-Governor Northen, of Georgia, and other Georgia Baptists, laymen and ministers, to protest against these violations of religious liberty, and to plead with their fellow-citizens to do away with laws which belong to the Dark Ages. To the men who are suffering for conscience' sake we extend our most sincere sympathy, as we extend it to the Stundists and to all others of the noble army of men who are enduring hardship for following out their religious convictions.

* Mr. Allison did not actually go into the chain-gang. His sentence was to pay the costs or else serve twelve months in the chain-gang. He refused to pay a single sum of $1000, and he started to Atlanta with him to sell him to the chain-gang contractors for one year. But some unknown friend paid the costs. Mr. Allison was released on the way to Atlanta.—ED. SENTINEL.
