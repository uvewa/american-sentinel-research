**IS THIS THE LAND OF THE FREE?**

We are in receipt of a copy of the AMERICAN SENTINEL, published in New York, containing a marked article on the persecution of W. T. Gibson, a Seventh-day Adventist of Everett, Mass., who sold a half pound of candy to a purchaser on Sunday, or "the Lord's day," as it is termed, for which he was arrested and fined $50 and costs. Is this the world-famed country in which every man is free to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience? By what authority can the officials of a State arrest a man because he happens to have different views on religious matters? It seems to us to be just as reasonable to arrest a man because he differs with you politically. Away with such balderdash.
—Lawler (Iowa) Dispatch, Feb. 14.
