**The Catholic Question In Canadian Politics.**

A CANADIAN correspondent writes us as follows: "The members of the Dominion Government have a real 'white elephant' on their hands." The Privy Council has decided that the Manitoba Government has a right to appeal to them, on the question of separate schools. The Roman Catholics are crowding the ministry with petitions demanding that they shall set aside the action of the Manitoba legislature on the vexed question. If they refuse, the Romanists will be sure to oppose the Conservatives at the Dominion election, soon to be held. If they accede, then the Protestant electors, or at least many of them, will refuse their support. Quite recently, a

teacher in a collegiate school in British Columbia got into difficulty while explaining to one of his classes in English history, the doctrine of transubstantiation, and narrowly escaped six months' suspension. This shows the difficulty connected with teaching in a school at which both Protestant and Roman Catholic children are scholars." From the same source we learn that a little breeze has been created in Montreal and Ottawa anent the "requiem mass" which was sung in the Roman Catholic Church at the latter city for the repose of the soul of Sir John Thompson. It was a State affair, the expenses being borne by the government. Of course, Protestants feel annoyed that $1,000 should be taken from public funds for such a purpose. Nobody objects to the Roman Catholics enjoying such services, providing that the church, and not the public, bear the cost.—New York Observer, Feb. 21.
