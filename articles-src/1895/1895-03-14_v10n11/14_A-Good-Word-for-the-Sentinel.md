**A GOOD WORD FOR THE "SENTINEL"**

[The following editorial is somewhat unique in the use of the term Sunday, but the editor's heart is in the right place, and we will charge the use of the word Sunday for Sabbath to Constantine and his ecclesiastical imitators—]

W. T. GIBSON, a Seventh-day Adventist, of Everett, Mass., has been arrested for conducting his business on Sunday as other persons do on the other days of the week. He believes Saturday to be the real Sunday, not Sunday; his right to that belief is guaranteed by the constitution of the State and by that of the United States, and yet for his faith in guarantees that don't guarantee freedom from the pranks of foolish cranks he is arrested. More than that he was fined, though the judge made no attempt to defend the decision or the fine. The decision was foolish and the fine an imposition. Saturday, being the seventh day, is the Sunday of the Bible, and, it may be said, the only Sunday. On that day God rested from his labors. To assert that the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday, is the Bible or the true and only Sunday, is arrant nonsense. The AMERICAN SENTINEL, in fighting this foolish notion, is doing the cause of truth a monumental and enduring service.—The Bayonne (N. J.) Democrat, Feb. 7.
