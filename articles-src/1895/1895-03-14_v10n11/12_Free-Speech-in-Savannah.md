**FREE SPEECH IN SAVANNAH.**

SAVANNAH, March 4.—The recent attempts by mob violence to prevent ex-Priest Slattery and his wife from speaking here were the subject of Judge Falligant's charge to the Grand Jury of the Superior Court to-day. He did not directly refer to them, but confined himself to an exposition of free speech. Judge Falligant laid special stress on the privileges of American citizenship and the rights individuals enjoy in this country to freedom of thought and speech within the pale of the law.

Free speech, he said, is implanted in the Constitution, and is the cardinal principle of American freedom. No man has the right to interfere with its exercise unless it becomes violation of law, and then the law is to be resorted to as a preventive or correction. The founders of the Government were farsighted in their wisdom when they made free speech a constitutional right. This right is one that all thinking citizens will aim to protect in its integrity. Free speech is necessary to the preservation of liberty in a country of popular sovereignty.

Judge Falligant plainly demonstrated the necessity of preserving free speech unimpaired as a protector of public and individual rights. Any abuse of the right must be deplored, but an illegal suppression of it would be fraught with dangerous tendencies and would not be permitted.

The cases of the men arrested for rioting will probably come before this Grand Jury.
