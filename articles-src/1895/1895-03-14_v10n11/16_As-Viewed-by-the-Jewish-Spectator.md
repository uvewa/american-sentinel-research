**AS VIEWED BY THE "JEWISH SPECTATOR."**

[The Jewish Spectator, published simultaneously at Memphis and New Orleans, in its issue of February 15, publishes the defense of W. T. Gibson before the district court of eastern Middlesex County, Mass., charged with violating the Lord's day. The defense is preceded by the following able editorial—]

This impression of the Spectator contains an account of the trial of a Seventh-day Adventist for the violation of the Sunday laws. The arguments he uses in his own defense are reasonable and just. Sunday laws are an encroachment upon the rights of conscience in the individual who believes in the sanctity of the seventh day. Adventists are more conscientious in struggling and suffering for those rights than the modern Jew, who surrendered without much complaint and resistance. Sunday laws are at best but vestiges of the unholy alliance of Church and State as they survived in the English law and then were inserted into American legislation. The plea, so frequently brought forward, that Sunday laws are in force to provide for the laborer's physical rest is a specious and gratuitous allegation, for if national legislation would provide for eight or nine hours of work each day there would be quite a period of rest for the laborer, and nature in her benign provision of refreshing sleep has certainly revealed the fact that the seven nights of the week are the seven sabbaths of the workingman and for every human toiler under the sun, as far as rest for the body is concerned. As to the religious requirements as to spiritual regeneration, every man and woman, every church and synagogue, must provide according to the dictates of their conscience and in obedience to the tenets of their faith, without invoking the force of the policeman's club and without the interference of civil courts and secular law. If the meaning and significance of political freedom and religious liberty would be rightly understood and more correctly interpreted, trials for non-observance of any particular day of rest—be it Sabbath or Sunday—would be excluded from the civil courts as promptly as an attempt to have trials for hereay submitted to the same tribunals of justice.
