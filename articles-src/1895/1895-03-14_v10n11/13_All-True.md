**ALL TRUE.**

A few weeks ago a clergyman of the Episcopal Church preached a sermon before the synod of the State of Illinois. The sermon has been indorsed by the bishop of Springfield, Ill., and published to the world. The author of the sermon, in referring to those who are preaching the Sabbath question, says:—

It is true that of late years a sect has arisen which seeks to overthrow the Christian Sunday, and substitute, or rather redetablish, the Jewish Sabbath. And it is also true that this sect is rapidly increasing in numbers. The cause is not hard to find. A large number of those who profess and call themselves Christians have unwisely rallied to the cry of "the Bible, and the Bible only, as the religion of Protestants," and as the change from Saturday to Sunday is neither authorized nor even mentioned in the Bible, they are of course defenseless against the attack of the Sabbatarians. When these advance their arguments, the so-called Bible Christians have nothing to reply, and if they are really consistent, they must leave the denomination to which they belong, and unite with the Sabbatarians. Many of them are doing so; more will certainly follow, and it need not be a matter of surprise if the boundary lines of Protestantism are entirely changed by the attacking forces of this comparatively new sect.

A few more admissions like the above, and those the church of Rome has made, and that hundreds of ministers are constantly making, will convince people everywhere that Sunday as the Sabbath has no Bible claims. Let the agitation go on as the truth will prevail.—S. H. Lane, in the Indicator (Rome, N. Y.), Feb. 27.
