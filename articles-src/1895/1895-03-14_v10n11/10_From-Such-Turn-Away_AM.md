# "FROM SUCH TURN AWAY."

In several places in the Word of God we are told that in the last days perilous times will come. These perilous times are, to come in different ways and upon different classes. There are perilous times to come upon the people of God as the result of persecution by those calling themselves Christians; but there is a more perilous time for them than persecution. We find this stated in 2 Tim. 3:1-5: "This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good, traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God; having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof."

Notice the class of men here spoken of. They are members of the church, for the Word says that they have "a form of godliness." The Lord, through Paul, is here speaking to those who would be His followers, for He gives a warning: "From such turn away."

The class spoken of in the scripture quoted is to have "a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof." How can men deny the power of God? In Rom. 1:16, we are told that the gospel of Christ "is the power of God unto salvation." Then when men refuse to follow the teachings of Christ, they deny the power of the gospel—the power of God. When they appeal to the civil power to aid them in enforcing obedience to their doctrines, they deny the power of God. They say by such action that Christ does not manifest the power he promised to his followers. The warning from the Lord to his followers is, "From such turn away."

The gospel of Christ "is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth." Then is there not power enough in the gospel to turn men to God and to his law without appealing to the civil power? The Apostle Paul was not ashamed of this gospel, this power; he said to the Romans: "So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also. For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ." Paul had a practical knowledge of the power there is in the gospel. He had seen through his preaching thousands added to the church. The Lord added them to the church by the power of the gospel, not by the power of the State. They were added to the church through the preaching of the gospel, which is the power of God.

If the ministers of to-day would preach the gospel of Christ instead of calling upon the State to force people into keeping Sunday, they, too, would realize Paul's experience, for there is just as much power in the gospel today as there was in apostolic days, and God is just as ready to manifest his power now as he ever was.

So long as the churches are corrupt and seek for other power than that of the Lord Jesus Christ, the members in those churches, who know and see that the power of God is not there, should heed the warning of God, "From such turn away," and seek for the true Church of God, where the power is to be found. To such the Lord says, "Babylon is fallen," and exhorts them in the words, "Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues." Rev. 18:4.
