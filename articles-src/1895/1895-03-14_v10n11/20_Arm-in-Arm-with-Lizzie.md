"Arm in Arm with Lizzie," etc.

We are much interested to observe that our highly esteemed contemporary, the Presbyterian, of which the Rev. S. A. Mutchmore, D. D., LL. D., is one of the editors and proprietors, is recognizing the important office of music in the service of religion, and is offering a tasteful selection of songs and roundelays, doubtless with a view to promote the interests of the church, and extend his paper's circulation and influence among the masses. In the list of premiums offered we notice such sacred gems as the following:

Arm in Arm with Lizzie.
Flirting in the Starlight Waltz.
Hoppity, Kickity, High and Low.
Champagne Charlie.
I'm a Hustler Just the Same.
Johnny Doolan's Cat.
Honey Don't You Grieve.
I've Been There Myself.
Tara-ra Boom De-ay.
You Should Have Seen Her Boots.
Pious Orgies.
They Discharged Him Because He Was Old.

These are but a few of the many charming, not to say rollicking, melodies which our Philadelphia contemporary offers to a waiting constituency; confident, it would seem, that Presbyterians generally will hasten to obtain a family repertory so promotive of a lively Sunday afternoon around the piano. Just where these chaste ballads should come in, in a home service of praise which might include the reading of a few editorials from the Presbyterian, we must leave for it to determine. We have the word of the tuneful Watts that religion never was designed to make our pleasures less, and perhaps selections from the Presbyterian's Premium Hymnal might solve the problem of the evening service! The singing of these agreeable ballads would surely have a tendency to "fill the galleries" quite as much, perhaps, as a sermon from the great patriarch of our last assembly.—The Evangelist, Feb. 28.
