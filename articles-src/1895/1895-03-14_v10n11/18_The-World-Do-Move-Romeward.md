**The World "Do Move"—Romeward.**

FOLLOWING the appointment of a Catholic priest to teach the philosophy of Saint Thomas in the Protestant University of Amsterdam, comes the appointment of the Catholic Lord Acton to be regius professor of modern history in the University of Cambridge in succession to the late Professor Seeley. So the world "do move" and the time may come again when "history" will not be, what it has long been among those separated from the church, "a conspiracy against truth."—Catholic Review, March 2.
