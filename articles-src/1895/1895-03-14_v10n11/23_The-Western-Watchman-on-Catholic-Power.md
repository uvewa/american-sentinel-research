THE WESTERN WATCHMAN (Roman Catholic) speaks thus defiantly of the power of its church:

The German Emperor applauded the statement made in the Reichstag the other day that the two practical dangers that now menaced the Fatherland were Socialism and Catholicism. If the church is an enemy then is she the greatest under the stars. Whatsoever she falls on shall be crushed to powder.

WE SURMISE FROM THE LAST SENTENCE THAT THE WATCHMAN REFERS TO "THE STONE WHICH THE BUILDERS REJECTED," WHICH "IS BECOME THE HEAD OF THE CORNER." IT IS SAID OF THIS STONE, WHICH IS CHRIST (Eph. 2:20), "Whosoever shall fall upon that stone shall be broken; but on whomever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder." Luke 20:18. If it is upon the authority of this text that the Watchman predicts the crushing of the German Empire by the Roman Catholic Church, it is terribly mistaken, for that stone is Christ. However, the fate of the Roman Catholic Church is symbolized by a stone. We refer to Rev. 18:21, which reads: "And a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone, and cast it into the sea, saying, Thus with violence shall that great city Babylon be thrown down, and shall be found no more at all."
