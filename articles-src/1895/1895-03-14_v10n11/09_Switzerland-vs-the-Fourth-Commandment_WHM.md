# SWITZERLAND VS. THE FOURTH COMMANDMENT.

In the last case of Switzerland against the fourth commandment, the city court of Basel failed to make out its case. This was not because the fourth commandment had not been obeyed, and the factory law disobeyed. It was clearly shown in court, by the statement of Mr. Revilly, the book-keeper, by the ready acknowledgment of the workers themselves, and by the minute report of the police, that labor was regularly performed in the publishing house on Sunday. The fourth commandment was obeyed. The factory law was disobeyed. Nothing could be more clear. However, no one could be found upon whom the penalties of the law could be visited for this. That faithful minister of the gospel whom the law holds alone responsible for this observance of the commandment of God by those working under his management, is in the United States attending the General Conference of his denomination. The factory law, though not in the Sunday clause, but in another paragraph, particularly specifies that no employé, not even the foreman, but the manager alone, is responsible. Therefore, if the court were to have held the book-keeper it would have been necessary for it to have gone outside the terms of the law to have done so.

In obedience to the summons of the court, Mr. Revilly presented himself at the hour appointed. Before entering the court room he was assured that it was not the intention of the court to attempt to make him personally responsible, but to examine him as to the facts in the case. Yet, in the face of that, and the positive terms of the factory law, the public prosecutor formally asked the court to hold him as the responsible head of the business, and suggested that as a matter of consideration towards him the penalty be limited to two hundred francs. And this, too, after a clear statement to the court by Mr. Revilly of the position which he held and his duties as office-clerk and book-keeper.

In reply to this formal demand for his conviction, the duties of the book-keeper were restated, and his limited authority shown, the court being also asked, if in any doubt as to the matter, to call any of the employés of the establishment, most of whom were in the court room, to testify upon this point. The court did not call the witnesses, but after consideration, dismissed Mr. Revilly as not being, under the factory law, the responsible person against whom action could be brought, and penalties imposed for Sunday labor done in the publishing house.

There is no clue as to what, if any, will be the further action of the authorities in the attempt to compel the observance of Sunday by the Imprimerie Polyglotte.
