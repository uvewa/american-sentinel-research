**A THEOCRACY.**

IN Tennessee and Maryland to-day, there are men being prosecuted and persecuted and sent to jail, practically because they believe that the seventh day of the week is the "Sabbath of the Lord thy God." They religiously observe Saturday, and frequently work on Sunday. For this they are prosecuted, though believers in Sunday as the Sabbath are never questioned, no matter what may be their work or play on that day. The rulings of the judges in these cases are frequently such as to practically declare that this is a religious government, and the logical result of these rulings will be to make a theocracy.—The Age, Boulder, Mont., Jan. 16.
