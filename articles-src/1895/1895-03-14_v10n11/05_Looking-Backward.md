## LOOKING BACKWARD.

UNDER the title "Can Sunday Laws be Enforced," Rev. J. J. M'Carrell in the Christian Statesman of February 2, furnishes the following encouragement to modern "Blue Law" advocates:—

Two hundred years ago if anyone in Boston or New England in general had any doubt as to the possibility of enforcing such laws, he need only attempt to go out of town, or come into town, or walk out for an airing, or stand talking to his neighbor, on Sunday, or keep his shop open after sundown Saturday. He would be soundly and probably sorely convinced that such a thing is possible.

The compulsory Sunday observance champion of to-day looks back upon the palmy days of the New England theocracy with longing heart and wishful eye.
