A GENTLEMAN of North Fork, Tenn., signing himself "Dr. Jas. M. Williams," has attacked ex-Senator Wm. P. Tolley, our indefatigable champion of religious liberty in Tennessee, for the views he expressed in these columns last fall, against prosecuting Seventh-day Adventists for performing Sunday labor. Mr. Tolley's article was reprinted in the Martin Mail, of Martin, Weakley County, Tenn., near where Mr. Capps was imprisoned last fall. Dr. Williams has written an alleged reply to the article, and we are well satisfied to leave him to the tender mercies of Mr. Tolley, but we cannot refrain from quoting one paragraph, which gives a new but impressive reason for the enactment and enforcement of Sunday laws. Here it is:

When I was a boy my people showed me a man in the moon, and said he was put there for burning brush on Sunday, and that has always had a bearing on me.

Those persons who have been wondering what influence had been brought to bear on those professedly Christian people of Tennessee, who are so thoroughly convinced that they ought to put their Seventh-day Adventist neighbors in jail for working on Sunday, will read this explanation with interest.
