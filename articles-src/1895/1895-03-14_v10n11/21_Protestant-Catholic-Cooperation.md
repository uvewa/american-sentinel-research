SPEAKING against the proposed legislation to open the rum-shops in this city on the Lord's day, the Reverend Doctor Banks, pastor of the Hanson Place Methodist Episcopal Church in Brooklyn, said in his sermon last Sunday: "All honor to the large company of Roman Catholic priests who have announced so clearly their warfare against the Sunday saloon. Let every honest, pure-minded Protestant and Catholic, Jew and Gentile, unite on a determined effort to defeat this unholy purpose." In this movement against Sunday saloons, as in all others for the best interests of the city, Catholics are eager to cooperate with Protestants, Jews, and Gentiles. For good government we are all fellow-citizens.—Catholic Review, March 2.
