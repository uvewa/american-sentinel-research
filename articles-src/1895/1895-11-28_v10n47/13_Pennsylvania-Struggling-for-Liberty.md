**PENNSYLVANIA STRUGGLING FOR LIBERTY.**

[The Philadelphia Record, Aug. 8.]

There is at present on the statute books of this commonwealth a law which is in itself a reproach to the intelligence, the liberality and the justice of any Democratic-Republican community. This law strikes at the very root of personal liberty. Every American citizen should have respect for law; and, in fact, most Americans have an ardent and constant regard for proper authority. But when laws like the Sunday law of 1794 are made, and obedience to them is required, the citizen should protest frankly and emphatically against their operation. Laws of this character have no place in our civil code. They are a relic of mediavial monasticism. . . . The people have borne with them long enough. They have obeyed them with the same spirit that one complies with the whims and caprices of an old maid. But now they are tired, nauseated, and disgusted with the long-standing farce. And in the name of decency, and out of respect for the personal liberty guaranteed by the men of 1776 and 1789, they demand the immediate repeal of the Sunday law of 1794. Its provisions are subversive of true liberty; its restraint is opposed to the spirit of religious tolerance; it is in itself unreasonable, iniquitous and tyrannical. Liberty requires that it be repealed; the people demand it! Blot it out!
