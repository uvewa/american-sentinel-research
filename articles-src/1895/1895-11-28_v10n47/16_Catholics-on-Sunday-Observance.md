**CATHOLICS ON SUNDAY OBSERVANCE.**

SEVERAL of the Catholic papers have had in them recently, various notices relative to the part "Protestant" ministers are taking in trying to follow Dr. Parkhurst. One of the strongest items of the kind which has come to our notice was a letter from "Father" O'Keefe to some ministers in Towson, Md. It seems the Protestant clergy had thought it was incumbent upon them to investigate the infractions of Sunday laws, and wishing to make the matter as universal as possible they invited "Father" O'Keefe to be present at and to take part in their deliberations. "Father" O'Keefe took occasion to reply to the invitation, and at the same time gave them a terrible scoring for the efforts they were putting forth, to do, as he called it, the work of "spies and detectives." And now comes the following, from the Pittsburg Catholic, of Nov. 14:—

That Ohio minister, a candidate for the State legislature, who thought he could put money in his pocket by promising his vote, if elected, to Senator Price, is in bad odor. His polipiteers reject him, and his fellow-citizens regard him as a Judge. In the days of "Old Hickory," a minister called on him for an office, stating that he had stumped for his election every week-day of his campaign and preached for the Lord on Sundays. Jackson turned short to him, and looking him squarely in the face, said: "By the Eternal, if you would cheat for the Lord you would cheat the country. I will have nothing to do with you nor with anything like you. Good morning!" The political preacher was justly estimated.

As a rule we take issue with those of the Catholic faith upon nearly every point, and it gives us a good deal of satisfaction to be able to say "Amen" to much which "Father" O'Keefe says. (We print this letter for the information of our readers, on page 373.) It is certainly true that the Lord has never put it upon any of his ministers to meddle in civil affairs, and this only goes to show that the Church, having lost the power of God, still retaining the form of godliness, tries to make up for the deficiency by getting the State to legislate in its behalf, and then the ministers of the church freely assist the officers of the law in enforcing those measures which have been adopted at the instigation of the clerical party.
