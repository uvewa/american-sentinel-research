## NOT A VICTORY FOR LIBERTY OF CONSCIENCE.

Last week we published on our last page a special dispatch from Chicago, announcing the decision of Judge Gibbons of the Criminal Court of Cook County, declaring unconstitutional the special act passed by the Illinois Legislature in 1895, prohibiting barbering on Sunday.

We have since received the full text of the decision which is deserving of more than passing notice, because it has been hailed in some quarters as a victory for religious liberty.

Judge Gibbons held the act to be void, because it was class legislation; and the fundamental law of the State of Illinois provides that "the General Assembly shall not pass local or special laws" in any of a long list of enumerated cases; and special legislation is likewise prohibited "in all other cases, where general law can be made applicable."

Judge Gibbons very properly held that the act in question was in flagrant violation of the section alluded to. He said:—

I could never willingly consent to a law which would single out one class of citizens and visit them with penalties and punishment for actions which are innocent in themselves, from which all other classes are exempted.

This is good law and good sense, but we are sorry to say that the judge is not consistent throughout. Why should there be any "law" visiting anybody "with penalties and punishment for actions which are innocent in themselves"?

The judge seemed to fear that he would be understood as being opposed to Sunday legislation in toto, and apparently to guard against such an impression, he said:—

I should gladly uphold impartial legislation ordaining one day of rest in every seven; and if that day of rest should fall on Sunday, it would meet with hearty approval from the great majority of the American people.

Then follows his declaration that he could not "consent to a law which would single out one class of citizens and visit them with penalties and punishment" "from which all other classes are exempted." He then continues, "Nor should I willingly assent to legislation which would place the ban of outlawry upon persons who believe in innocent and lawful recreation combined with rest on the sabbath day, which shall deprive persons pursuing a particular profession or vocation of their property, unless there was something in the nature of the property aimed at or in the vocation pursued hurtful to society."

It is difficult to understand what kind of a Sunday "law" Judge Gibbons would sanction. He declares that neither under the constitution of Illinois nor of the United States could an act be maintained requiring the observance of Sunday on religious grounds. He says: "The courts cannot take cognizance of the moral aspect of the case, even though a seventh day of rest seems to be established by divine decree." And again, his honor remarks:—

It must be apparent to every one that if the law under consideration is to be upheld, the action of the court can be justified upon no other theory than that the law promotes Sunday observance. Based upon such a theory, it finds no warrant in the Constitution, State or Federal. It is not within the province of the legislature to enforce an observance of religious duty on the sabbath.

Yet, he declares himself in favor of "impartial legislation ordaining one day of rest in every seven," and says, "If that day of rest should fall on Sunday, it would meet with the hearty approval of the great majority of the American people."

This proposition the judge attempts to justify by quoting approvingly the statement from the opinion of the Supreme Court of Virginia that "in all countries and ages among civilized peoples, governments have set apart days of rest recurring at short periods. This has been, and still is, regarded as necessary for the temporal welfare of the people as a certain amount of rest is regarded as absolutely necessary to men and animals subject to labor."

It is not strange that Judge Gibbons adopts this view, since it is very common indeed, and has long been urged by jurists and scientists in justification of so-called sabbath legislation. But notwithstanding the array of authorities quoted in its support it is not sustained by facts. A regular weekly rest has been the exception and not the rule among the nations of earth. And so far as physical strength and length of days are concerned, sabbath-keeping peoples have no advantage over those who know no weekly rest-day.

This custom has prevailed only among Jews and Christians. Even at the present time but little more than one-third of the inhabitants of the world have a stated weekly rest. Notwithstanding the fact that those having a set day of rest are more advanced in civilization and in sanitary science than are those not having such rest, it does not appear that the average of life is longer with them than with those who have no weekly rest day.

At a meeting held in Association Hall, this city, March 11, 1890, the writer heard Bishop Andrews, of the Methodist Episcopal Church, make the statement that "in China [from which he had but recently returned] they have no septennial division of time; no weekly rest-day, merely annual festivals. They work right along all the time with no day of rest as such; yet they live to a very advanced age. This fact has led one of the most careful thinkers who has ever been sent as missionary to China, to raise a serious question, whether the great purpose of the Sabbath is not for worship and communion with the other world."

This fact, stated by Bishop Andrews, completely refutes the physical-necessity argument so often made in justification of Sunday legislation. The truth is that a large element of the people demand Sunday laws. But the logic of our free institutions and of our written constitutions forbids such legislation; and it must be maintained, if maintained at all, upon other than the real grounds. Sunday "laws" are demanded only because of the religious regard in which Sunday is held by a large number of the people. The physical-necessity plea has been sought out in justification of that which is unjustifiable upon its own merits. So true is this, that the courts of a large number of States have ignored the constitutional prohibitions which Judge Gibbons theoretically recognizes, and have upheld Sunday legislation upon moral grounds; the very grounds upon which Judge Gibbons declares that "it finds no warrant in the Constitution, State or Federal."

The fact is, that we find nowhere else in our statute books any legislation similar to the Sunday statutes of the several States. The prohibition of Sunday labor is openly declared in some States to rest upon moral and religious grounds. This is notably true in Tennessee, Maryland, Georgia, and New York. Sunday work is likewise prohibited in other States, but in most of them professedly on so-called civil grounds, as a "police regulation," or a kind of "sanitary measure," because "man's physical necessities demand stated periods of rest," etc. But no corresponding attempt has ever been made to provide for the physical necessities of the people in the matter of rest. It is necessary that people should rest at night, and they should not over-work during the day; but, who ever heard of a law forbidding anyone to work whenever he desired to do so, except on Sunday? or requiring everybody to retire to bed at a certain hour and to spend a given number of hours in bed? The nearest approach that we have to this are laws fixing the number of hours that shall constitute a day's work; but such laws do not forbid persons to labor longer if they see fit.

Moreover the Sunday laws of most of the States bear upon their face evidence of their religious character. Such terms as "sabbath" and "Lord's day," and "sabbath desecration," and "whoever shall profane the sabbath," are too common in Sunday legislation to permit the idea that such statutes are simply "sanitary measures" or "police regulations."

Judge Gibbons' decision marks no advancement in the direction of religious liberty in this country; on the contrary, it rivets more firmly the fetters which bind the American people to the Sunday Juggernaut. He declares the act in question unconstitutional solely because it is class legislation. He confesses that barbering is in itself innocent; yea, that "it has long been recognized as a handiwork that very materially adds to the cleanliness and comeliness of the human family." He even finds scriptural indorsement of the trade, and yet he holds the act to be unconstitutional and beyond the legitimate power of the legislature, only because other equally harmless and even necessary occupations are not likewise prohibited! If the act had been general in its terms, if it had prohibited all manner of labor and business on Sunday, "works of necessity and charity only excepted," there is no question, judging by his own words, that Judge Gibbons would have sustained it.
