### WE STAND FOR LAW.

WHILE so much is being said about the necessity of abiding by the law, the AMERICAN SENTINEL would, if possible, lift its voice higher than all others in behalf of the principle of allegiance to law,—to that which is the law, in the paramount sense of the word.

It is for this principle that the AMERICAN SENTINEL stands, and for it every word that it speaks is uttered.

We stand for law,—for right, for justice, for those eternal principles of the same which pertain to man's relation to his fellow-man, and to his God. This is law, and ever has been and must be law, independently of the ideas, the customs, and the statutes which have temporarily prevailed, in successive generations of human history.

What is law? Let us seek an answer from that Word which is infallible: "There is one Lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy." Jas. 4:12. "The Lord is our judge, the Lord is our lawgiver, the Lord is our king; he will save us." Isa. 33:22.

All law is of God; he is the Creator of all, and in him therefore the eternal principles of right and justice must have their origin. Even the "laws of nature" are the laws of God.

"The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament showeth his handiwork." Sun and moon and shining stars in their orderly courses, without the sound of speech or language, proclaim, "The law of the Lord is perfect." Ps. 19:7.

Shall man, in the name of law, make void that law? Shall we stand in defense of anything which presumes to set aside one of the precepts of the Creator, under the plea of allegiance to law? To such questions we cannot so ably voice a fitting reply as is done in the following words by the Rev. Gen. Elliott, in his essay, "The Abiding Sabbath,"—the Fletcher Prize Essay for 1884:

Long should pause the erring hand of man before it dares to chip away with the chisel of human reasoning—one single word graven on the enduring tables by the hand of the infinite God! What is proposed?

—To make an erasure in a heaven-born code; to expunge one article from the recorded will of the Eternal! Is the eternal tablet of his law to be defaced by a creature's hand? He who proposes such an act should fortify himself by reasons as holy as God and as mighty as his power. None but consecrated hands could touch the ark of God; thrice holy should be the hands which would dare alter the testimony which lay within the ark. By the lasting authority of the whole Decalogue with which the fourth commandment is inseparably connected, which is the embodiment of intractable moral law, and by the very words used in framing the command, the Sabbath is shown to be an institution of absolute, universal, and unchanging obligation.

But what has been done by the statutes of men? That precept of the eternal code which says, "The seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God; in it thou shalt not do any work,"—which points out the true God, the creator of the heavens and the earth,—has been set aside and a rival day exalted in its place. The first day of the week is sought to be forced upon people as the weekly rest-day by the law of the land.

Is it allegiance to law to side with this daring attempt to set aside the law of the Highest? Are the well-being of society and the interests of good government to be promoted in that way?

The SENTINEL says, No; and therefore it is constrained to lift its voice of warning against the Sunday-exalting statutes, which are based, one and all, upon the assumption that Sunday is the Sabbath. In so doing it does not strike against law, but stands for the law of the Eternal, which cannot be set aside without the most disastrous consequences to mankind.
