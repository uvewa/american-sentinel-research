**A PRAYER FOR LIBERTY.**

BY FANNIE BOLTON.

DARK were the clouds that once shadowed the land,
When the State held the conscience with stern, iron hand,
When freedom of worship, by law was curtailed,
And sweet Liberty's banner no more was unfurled.
Oh! oh! then were sighs of woe.
Oh! oh! then were tears allow.
Oh! oh! prayers were whispered low,—
"Father in heaven, we look to thee,
Earth's mighty nations speak tyranny,
Turn this fierce tide, and calm this wild din,
And keep us from sin. . . . Hear our prayer."
And God above listened in love;
Sent down the light that scattered night,
Till Liberty once more was free
To lend her help to you and me.

Sweet peace rules the world where Liberty reigns;
Injustice is banished with torture and pains.
The Dark Ages flee 'neath the light of her smile,
And kindness and beauty touch nations the while.
Oh! oh! shall it not be so?
Oh! oh! bring us no more woe.
Oh, oh, let our prayers breathe low,—
Father in heaven, we look to thee;
Sweep from our country dread tyranny.
Quell this fierce strife, and calm this wild din,
And keep us from sin. . . . Thus we pray.
But should the storm break on our path
Let no alarm come from earth's wrath.
Calmly in love, we'll look to thee,
Father, in whom is Liberty.
