## A PITIFUL PIECE OF SPECIAL PLEADING.

[St. Louis Globe Democrat, July 14, 1895.]

FROM the orthodox standpoint, the Adventist is absolutely right in the premises. If the Decalogue is to be regarded as perpetually binding upon the conscience of Christians, and all parts of it equally binding, there is not the slightest doubt that the seventh day should be observed as the Sabbath. There is not a shred of testimony in existence that either the Old or New Testament ever substituted any other day as a Sabbath. We are to "remember the Sabbath day," and there is no "Sabbath day" except Saturday. Any attempt to show that the sanctity of the day was transferred to any other day is a pitiful piece of special pleading, unworthy an honest mind. There is not an argument to sustain such a view that any court in the land would have the patience to listen to. The facts are all against the "Christian sabbath." The term is a misnomer and ought never to be used. The simple historic fact is, that the early Church dropped the observance of the fourth commandment just as they dropped the observance of many Jewish ceremonies, simply because these things belonged to an outgrown faith. . . . Luther and Calvin and the early Reformers understood this plainly. With them Sunday was not the substitute for the Sabbath. They never quoted the fourth commandment as having any relation to the Christian day of rest. They observed Sunday simply because it was the weekly anniversary of the Lord's resurrection. They abstained from labor, not because of the Decalogue, but because servile labor was one of the consequences of the fall of man from which Christ had redeemed them. But it is intolerant, bigoted and cruel to persecute and prosecute a sincere, earnest and truly religious body of men and women simply because they observe a day of rest which does not please the majority of people. It is not claimed that they interfere with the liberty or comfort or worship of any of their fellow-citizens, but only that they are offending the dominant religious sense of the community. That is what it practically amounts to.
