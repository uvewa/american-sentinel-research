### EX-CONGRESSMAN SNODGRASS.

In the course of his speech in the Adventist cases at Dayton, Tenn., Nov. 5, Ex-Congressman Snodgrass said, as reported in the Chattanooga Times, of the 6th inst.:

"So far as I am concerned, the very law is obnoxious. I believe it is a violation of the organic law of the land. I believe that if the highest court in the land should ever have an opportunity to pass upon it, it would be declared void.

"They have as much right to keep the seventh day if they believe that it is the day they ought to keep holy as you have to keep the first day. One man believes in sprinkling, another in immersion. It is simply a difference in opinion; it is simply the exercise of judgment and conscience.

"Some governments said to which church you should belong and what money you should pay to the church; and to raise your voice against these decrees was certain death; and this statute on our books is a relic of that past; it is a part of that barbarism—it is a part of the Dark Ages. Why, the idea of such a law in a free country like this, where a man believes he is serving God by keeping Saturday, and he is doing his duty to both God and man to rest on the seventh day. It is a violation of personal liberty to punish him."

Continuing, Mr. Snodgrass argued that the law was a violation of the bill of rights, and concluded by telling the jury that regardless of this question they should acquit the defendant, as the one act proven was not sufficient to constitute the offense charged in the indictment.
