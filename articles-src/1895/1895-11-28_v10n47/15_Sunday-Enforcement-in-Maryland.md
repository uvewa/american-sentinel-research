**SUNDAY ENFORCEMENT IN MARYLAND.**

The Baltimore Methodist, "published by the authority and with the patronage of the Baltimore Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church," is making a strong fight for general Sunday-law enforcement in that city.

All that was required in Baltimore to secure the prosecution of a poor Seventh-day Adventist cobbler, was for one or two Sunday-keepers to lodge complaint against him with the police authorities. He was then watched and arrested for mending shoes in his own rooms on Sunday. But thus far, to the best of our knowledge, the Baltimore Methodist has called in vain upon the police authorities to close the saloons upon Sunday. The editor complains, in his issue of Oct. 3, that notwithstanding the fact that he "went under oath before the grand jury and most plainly told those gentlemen some startling facts," the saloons complained of are still open on Sunday. "We write this with the blush of shame," says this Methodist editor. Almost in despair he says:—

Information comes to us direct that after our testimony was given, the grand jury had a prolonged discussion, as a number of jurors contended that the evidence furnished was not sufficient upon which to frame indictments. We stand amazed. Is Towsonton waiting for more evidence? What stronger testimony can be given? We have done filthier work than we ever dreamed of doing to get satisfactory evidence. The editor himself trudged through heat and sand much to his discomfort, sabbath after sabbath, secured incontrovertible testimony, and at sacrifice of time and placing ease in the background, spent hours at the county seat.

And all this was practically to no purpose, which goes to emphasize the fact that there is not sufficient public sentiment back of Sunday laws to secure their enforcement, except against a small minority, whose religious belief and practice is not in accord with that of their neighbors.
