### THANKSGIVING.

TO-DAY is Thanksgiving, set apart by the President of the United States "as a day of thanksgiving and prayer, to be kept by all our people." "On this day," says the President, "let us forego our usual occupations, and, in our accustomed places of worship, join in rendering thanks to the Giver of every good and perfect gift, for the bounteous returns that have rewarded our labors in the field and in the busy marts of trade, for the peace and order that have prevailed throughout the land, for our protection from pestilence and dire calamity, and for the other blessings that have been showered upon us from an open hand. And with our thanksgiving, let us humbly beseech the Lord to so incline the hearts of our people unto him that he will not leave us nor forsake us as a nation, but will continue to us his mercy and protecting care, guiding us in the path of national prosperity and happiness, enduing us with rectitude and virtue, and keeping alive within us a patriotic love for the free institutions which have been given us as our national heritage."

And this is officially done, as is witnessed by the these words: "I, Grover Cleveland, President of the United States, do hereby appoint and set apart Thursday, the 28th day of the present month of November, as the day of thanksgiving and prayer, to be kept and observed by all our people."

But by what right does the President of the United States set apart a day of thanksgiving, "to be kept and observed by all our people"? Who has appointed the President of the United States the high priest of the nation, the pontifex maximus of the American stomach, which once a year demands a sacrifice of roast turkey, cranberry sauce and pumpkin pie?

Who does not know that this whole Thanksgiving business is a hollow mockery, and that it is impossible for the nation as such to give thanks to God, and that the only genuine thanksgiving is that which wells up from individual hearts?

Thomas Jefferson, when President, considered himself prohibited by the Constitution from issuing any such proclamation. He said:

I consider the Government of the United States as interdicted by the Constitution from intermeddling with religious institutions, their doctrines, discipline, or exercises.

But it is only proposed that I should recommend, not prescribe, a day of fasting and prayer. That is, that I should indirectly assume to the United States an authority over religious exercises, which the Constitution has directly precluded them from.

It must be meant, too, that this recommendation is to carry some authority, and to be sanctioned by some penalty on those who disregard it; not, indeed, of fine and imprisonment, but of some degree of proscription, perhaps in public opinion. And does the change in the nature of the penalty make the recommendation less a law of conduct for those to whom it is directed?

I do not believe it is for the interest of religion to invite the civil magistrate to direct its exercises, its discipline, or its doctrines; nor of the religious societies, that the general government should be invested with the power of effecting any uniformity of time or matter among them.

Fasting and prayer are religious exercises; the enjoining them, an act of discipline. Every religious society has a right to determine for itself the times for these exercises, and the objects proper for them, according to their own particular tenets; and this right can never be safer than in their own hands, where the Constitution has deposited it.

It is certain that there would be no less true thanksgiving than there now is if this matter were left just where Jefferson left it and where the Constitution leaves it, namely, with the churches and the people.
