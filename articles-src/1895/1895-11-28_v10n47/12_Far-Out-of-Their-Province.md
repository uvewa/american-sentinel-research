**"FAR OUT OF THEIR PROVINCE."**

[Free Press, Murfreesboro, Tenn., Nov. 23.]

We have no respect for that man or that body of men who arrogate to themselves the right to say by what method a man shall address himself to a higher being. Man may control man's fleshy tendencies, but when he presumes to dictate to a fellow-being what he shall or shall not do when that fellow-being is making petition by word or deed to God is unwarranted and even blasphemous. He who throws obstacles in the way of him who is earnestly and conscientiously seeking to carry out the teaching of his Maker treads on dangerous territory.
