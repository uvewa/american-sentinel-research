## WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A CHRISTIAN.

[Christian Leader.]

The attainment of the Christian is to be in the "likeness of Christ." What the devil hates most in man is the image of God in his heart. "Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them that despitefully use you and persecute you, that ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven." "Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect." "Be ye therefore followers of God as dear children." "Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven."
