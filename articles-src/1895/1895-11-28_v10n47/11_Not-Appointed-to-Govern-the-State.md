**NOT APPOINTED TO GOVERN THE STATE.**

[The Outlook, Nov. 2.]

The minister is not sent to govern, either in Church or in State. Whether individuals or parties come before him, he may reply, with Christ, "Who set me to be a judge over you?" He makes a mistake if he endeavors to carry his ministerial authority into the realm of politics. His kingdom is not of this world; it is a kingdom of truth, and he that is of the truth heareth his voice. When ministers have undertaken to control the political administration of the world, they have made a poor business of it—and this whether they were Roman Catholic priests in medieval Europe, or Presbyterian elders in the Barebones Parliament, or Episcopal bishops in the House of Lords, or Congregational clergy in the Puritan hierarchy of New England. It is true that the minister is also a private citizen, and as a private citizen may take his part in political discussions, but even this he would better do cautiously, if at all. He has a grander service than that of reforming society, namely, regenerating it. To inspire a higher spirit of justice, purity, and patriotism in men of all parties is a nobler service than to shape the political platform or influence the political nominations of any one party.

And as he is not appointed to govern in the State, so neither is he appointed to govern in the Church. He is not a lord over God's heritage; he is not to be called master, nor is he ever to forget that he who is the greatest is the servant of all. Nor is this any real self-annegation. Influence is more valuable than power. Pilate and Caiaphas had power, one in the State, the other in the Church; and the State and Church where they respectively ruled are both disintegrated. Christ had influence; it survived his death and has created new States and a new church. Power belongs to the form of organization, and perishes when the form changes; influence is vital, and is as immortal as life itself.
