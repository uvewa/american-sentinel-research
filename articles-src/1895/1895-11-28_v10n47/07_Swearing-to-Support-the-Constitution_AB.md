## SWEARING TO SUPPORT THE CONSTITUTION.

[By Addison Bishop, Ph. D., Lecturer in Political Science and History, University of Chicago.]

EVERY public official, before he enters upon the duties of his office, swears to support the Constitution. In this all are agreed. But right here an important question arises. Language conveys to different persons different meanings. In fact, by the very nature of things, no person can see material objects exactly as another sees them; this truth is more pronounced when it applies to a mental description of institutions and law, such as is the Constitution. Now the question is, Does the man in taking his oath to support the Constitution swear to support it as he understands that it is? or, Does he swear to support it as he understands that somebody else understands it?

These two views are the only views that can be taken of this much debated question. All are agreed that he must support the Constitution as it is. But how is he to know how it is? Is he to take John Doe's or Richard Roe's word for it? Or is he to endeavor to make up his mind himself from all sources bearing upon the question according to the best of his ability? Most assuredly, the latter.

If he were not to obey the Constitution as he himself understood it, the oath should read "that I will obey the Constitution as John Smith understands it," or "as the President of the United States understands it," or "as the Supreme Court understands it," etc., which oath would then mean that he would obey the Constitution as he understood that John Smith understood it, and so on. An oath, in law, always means the truth or facts as the deponent or speaker sees them. It is psychologically impossible that it should be otherwise. Whatever is (to me) is what is as I see it; and so when I swear what is, I swear what is as I understand it. Things could not be otherwise.

The most notable discussion ever had on this question was when Andrew Jackson was President of the United States. In reciting this controversy, Bishop, one of the very best legal authorities, lays down the law very clearly. "It will be remembered," says Bishop, "that during the administration of President Jackson, the question of rechartering the United States Bank came up for decision by Congress. And the two houses having passed a bill for its recharter, the President vetoed it on the ground, among others, that it was unconstitutional, notwithstanding the question of its constitutionality had been decided in the affirmative by the Supreme Court of the United States.

"The veto-message, which was sent to the Senate, contained the following passage: 'The Congress, the Executive, and the Court must each for itself be guided by its own opinion of the Constitution. Each public officer who takes an oath to support the Constitution, swears that he will support it as he understands it, and not as it is understood by others. It is as much the duty of the House of Representatives, of the Senate, and of the President to decide upon the constitutionality of any bill or resolution, which may be presented to them for passage or approval, as it is of the supreme judges, when it may be brought before them for judicial decision. The opinion of the judges has no more authority over Congress than the opinion of the Congress has over the judges; and on that point the President is independent of both. The authority of the Supreme Court must not therefore be permitted to control the Congress or the Executive, when acting in their legislative capacities, but to have only such influence as the force of their reasonings may deserve.'

"As soon as this message was read, a tempest began to rage in the Senate, and it raged through the whole country during the succeeding presidential election, and it has scarcely ceased raging now. The very clear and most accurate statement of the law just quoted, was denounced by the political opponents of the President in unmeasured terms, and all the people who could be influenced by them were made to believe it was rank heresy. 'No one,' said Mr. Clay, who in the Senate followed Mr. Webster in denouncing the message, 'swears to support it [the Constitution] as he understands it, but to support it simply as it is in truth.'"

If we bring the issue thus made up between Jackson and Clay to the test of authority, we shall find the question readily settled; and, as a legal question, it is not one about which there are two opinions. Suppose then, the violation, by the President, or by a member of Congress, of his official oath, is by a statute made punishable as perjury; and suppose a member of Congress, having voted for a measure which he believed to be unconstitutional, while the Supreme Court held it to be constitutional, is indicted before a judicial tribunal under the statute, and the facts appear as thus stated. The court, following the decision of the Supreme Court, would affirm the constitutionality of the measure for which the defendant had voted. It would next direct the jury to find the defendant guilty; because, though his vote was constitutional, he thought it was not, and for one to swear to what is true in fact, while he believes it to be false, is perjury.

"The proposition is that when a man swears to anything, though the oath is in form general, in matter of law he swears to the thing 'as he understands it.' This is an old doctrine, as old as the common law itself, and it has constantly maintained the vigor of its youth, both in England and this country, and at the present day it is as fresh and strong with us as ever. Thus, to go back to the time of Lord Coke, who is the great and even shadowing law authority, he says: 'Falshood in knowledge and mind may be punished, though the words be true. For example, damages were awarded to the plaintiff in the Star Chamber according to the value of his goods riotously taken away by the defendant: the plaintiff caused two men to swear the value of his goods, that never saw nor knew them; and, though that which they swore was true, yet, because they know it not, it was a false oath in them, for the which both the procurer and the witnesses were sentenced in the Star Chamber.

"Now, it will be observed, that the form of the oath which the witness takes in court is, to speak the 'truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.' Yet, in contemplation of law, it is, as the reader sees, to speak the truth as 'he understands it.' So, in like manner, the form of the oath which the legislator or the President takes is to support the Constitution; while, in contemplation of law, it is to support the Constitution as 'he understands it.' We have seen that, if the witness tells what is really true, but he does not understand it to be so, he swears falsely; so, on the other hand, if what the witness states is false, yet he believes it to be true, on what seems to be good ground of belief, he is innocent of perjury.' And the latter part of this doctrine, as well as the former, applies to the President or a legislator, in respect of the official oath to support the Constitution."

"The author has just stated that this doctrine is old. Thus, Lord Coke has traced it back to the earliest dawn of light concerning the common law. He continues: 'For, as Fleta saith, Ad rectum juramentum exiguntur tria, veritas, conscientia, judicium; truth and conscience in the witness, and judgment in the judge. And herewith agreed Bracton, that a man may swear the truth, and yet be perjured. Dicunt quidam verum, et mentiuntur, et pejarant, co quod contra mentem vadunt. Ut si Judacus juravavit Christum natum ex virgine, perjuriam committet, quia mentem vadit, quia non credit its esse et jurat.'"

"In like manner we may trace the doctrine down from Lord Coke through all the books on the original law, and through the adjudged cases, to the present time. The student who is curious on this point, will find help from consulting the note."

The last statement of the doctrine by any text-writer is in the author's work on the Criminal Law. It is there set down as follows: "If the witness supposes he is testifying falsely, it is corrupt as to him, and a perversion of the truth in the court of justice; it is therefore perjury, though in fact what he says is true." Among the American cases is one in Indiana, decided in 1841, when the bench was occupied by able judges; and Blackford, a very competent judge, said: "To constitute perjury, the oath must, of course, be false; but that may be the case, whilst, at the same time, the matter sworn is true. The law is, that what is sworn to must be either false in fact, or, if true, the defendant must not have known it to be so." The learned judge then quotes Lord Coke, the same as we have done, and adds: "The law is also so stated by the later writers on original law. It follows, we think, that where a man swears that a thing is so, or that he believes it to be so, when, in truth, he does not believe it to be so, the oath is false, though the fact really be as stated."

"The Constitution of the United States, while it is the 'supreme law,' is so only in the sense of excluding all law which is in conflict with it. The law, which we are here considering, is, though unwritten, as obligatory as any written law, except such written law as is contrary to the unwritten provision. The clauses which require the oath to support the Constitution are not adverse to the unwritten law, but are to be construed by it; hence, we see, that the view which President Jackson presented of the oath was merely a statement of what was always the law of the land. . . . The law laid down by President Jackson was the old adjudged law, binding all persons concerned by the force of authority."

It is therefore evident that each officer must declare Sunday laws unconstitutional, except when he believes them to be just and legal, when, according to the law as we have presented it, he is protected in his belief; but otherwise, he violates his oath of office if he does not set the law aside and regard it as though it were not. "An unconstitutional statute," says Judge Conley, "is to be regarded as having never, at any time, been possessed of any legal force."
