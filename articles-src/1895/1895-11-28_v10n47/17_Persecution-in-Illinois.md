## PERSECUTION IN ILLINOIS.

MONDAY, Nov. 11, J. F. Rothrock, a Seventh-day Adventist, was tried at Albion, Edwards County, Ill., for the "crime" of keeping open his store on a certain Sunday in May last. He was found "guilty" and fined ten dollars and costs. The judge, however, granted a new trial, which will defer the decision of the case till next spring.

Wednesday, the 13th, several more Adventists, mostly farmers, were tried at Olney, Richland County, for the like "crime" of pursuing their customary vocations upon the first day of the week. Considerable difficulty was encountered in selecting the jury, the prosecuting attorney being careful to ask each person called if he attended the Adventist camp-meeting held at Olney last fall, and promptly ruling them out if their answer was in the affirmative. The trial resulted in the conviction of those indicted. We have not learned the amount of the fine.

As is usual in such cases, the testimony of the witnesses called revealed that the prosecution was inspired by a spirit of religious animosity. One lady, seventy-two years of age, testified that she was disturbed by plowing done on Sunday by one of the prisoners in a field a quarter of a mile from her home, and that the disturbance consisted mainly in her knowing that a young man of such good character as she knew the prisoner to have, was at work on the sabbath day that she had always been taught to keep. Another witness testified that he was disturbed in his mind by this Sunday plowing, notwithstanding that he had on the previous Sunday, as he admitted, assisted in hiving a swarm of bees. The two leading prosecutors in the case are men who were recently arrested and fined for disturbing a singing-school.

The Sunday statute of Illinois provides that—

Whoever disturbs the peace and good order of society by labor (works of necessity and charity excepted), by any amusement, or diversion on Sunday, shall be fined not exceeding $25. This section shall not be construed to prevent watermen and railroad companies from landing their passengers, or watermen from loading and unloading their cargoes, or ferrymen from carrying over the water travelers and persons moving their families on the first day of the week, nor to prevent the due exercise of the rights of conscripts by whomever thinks proper to keep any other day as a sabbath.

From this it appears that it was the plain intention of the framers of the statute that such persons as observed another day than Sunday as a sabbath, should be protected from interference in the quiet, peaceable pursuit of their regular vocations on the first day of the week. But notwithstanding this, these Adventists are convicted and fined just as though there were no such provision in the statute.

It is probable that an appeal will be taken in these cases to the State Supreme Court.
