## PERSECUTION IN THE TRANSCAUCASUS.

[New York Independent.]

We have received news which has confirmed in all their hideous details the accounts which have already appeared in the English press of the persecution of the Dukhobers in the Transcaucasus. It all began by the Dukhobes' conscripts being obliged by their officers to go to orthodox churches. The young soldiers wrote to their parents for advice, and they were counseled to throw down their arms. This they did, and were at once unmercifully beaten by command of their officers. The exact sequence of events is still wanting; but the next event is the assembling of all the Dukhobes' soldiers in a field with their weapons. A huge fire has been built up and lighted, and on this they are casting their weapons when up gallops a regiment of Cossacks, with the provincial governor at their head. The Dukhobers did not submit and point blank refused to serve in the army. The governor in a rage ordered the Cossacks to do their worst, and for seven long days the wretched religionists were beaten and cuffed about, their women dishonored, their property ruined. Their position is now a terrible one. Their villages have been broken up, and they are scattered about all over the country in twos and threes, none daring to offer them shelter.
