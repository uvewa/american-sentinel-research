In any one receiving the AMERICAN SENTINEL without having ordered it may know that it is sent to him by some friend. Therefore, those who have not ordered the Stamp need have no fears that they will be asked to pay for it.

CAPE COLONY has recently placed another Sunday "law" upon its statute books. Our South African correspondent discusses it in an article which we will print next week.

THE Independent attributes Republican success in this State, in part at least, to Warner Miller's Sunday plank, and says: "He is the true leader of the people on this question, and the Republicans of the Legislature must pay heed to him."

WHILE you are reading this item at home, surrounded by loved ones, enjoying your God-given and constitutionally guaranteed freedom, R. R. Whaley, of Church Hill, Md., is a prisoner in the Centreville Jail for no other offense than hoeing cabbage plants on Sunday in his own garden after having observed "the Sabbath according to the commandment."

We still have on hand a few hundred copies of the illustrated SENTINEL of Sept. 26, containing the historical article, "Religious Toleration in Maryland." Everybody ought to know the facts stated in this article. It is a complete refutation of the claim that Roman Catholics established religious liberty in Maryland.

THE Independent nominates Warner Miller for United States Senator, to succeed David B. Hill in 1897. Our contemporary says of Mr. Miller: "His understanding of what Israel ought to do in an emergency, and his statesman-like qualities highly commend him for the United States Senate." It was Warner Miller who sprung upon the Republican convention "the unqualified endorsement of the so-called Christian sabbath."

ALL communications intended for publication in this paper or for the information of the editors, should be addressed, "Editor AMERICAN SENTINEL," and not to any individual. Business communications, subscriptions, change of address, etc., should be directed to "AMERICAN SENTINEL," and not to the editors or to any individual. The reason is that the editorial work is done in one room, and the subscription books are kept in the counting-room on another floor.

NOVEMBER 11, a street flower vender was arraigned in the Harlem Police Court for selling a bunch of violets on Sunday. To the credit of the justice, be it said, the defendant was promptly discharged. But technically, the sale of a bunch of violets on Sunday is just as much a violation of the "law" as would be the sale of a horse or of a suit of clothes, or any other article of legitimate trade; but the justice before whom this prisoner was arraigned chose to follow the law of justice rather than the statute, in this instance.

It is said that in a recent interview Cardinal Swampa, the probable successor of Leo XIII., laments the national observance of September 20 as equivalent to opening an old sore. In his opinion the papacy can never be reconciled with Italy unless the latter restores to it the fullest territorial liberty. Until this be done he feels that, in civil matters, the position of the pope is very little better than that of a government employe.

THE Northwestern Chronicle (Roman Catholic), in its issue of November 1, prints a synopsis of a lecture by "Rev. Father" Thomas E. Sherman, son of the late General Sherman, in which he is credited with these words: "Our grandfathers found that they could not unite the Church and State if they wished to form a nation. However, we have what amounts to a union of the Church and State. The object of union has been attained after all—they are one in principle, one in action. If there is not a kindly sympathy between the Church and the State, why is it that there are chaplains in our armies, and that our church property is untaxed? The church is content that there should not be a union in the strict sense, because we believe that this form of government is one under which the church can best thrive—a form of government which is to her best interests."

THE Catholic Review says: "Who will tell us? 1. How many Protestants there are in South America? 2. How many of them are natives? 3. What is the text of the laws which the Methodist ministers of Chicago say abridge the civil or religious liberty of those Protestants? We want to get at the exact truth."

In giving this information to the Catholic Review, will the Methodists know enough of the true principles of religious liberty to inform the Review, and through it the pope, and the Roman hierarchy everywhere, that the number of Protestants in South America makes not one bit of difference; that religious liberty is a God-given right, and that a minority of one is entitled to the free enjoyment of it equally with a larger minority or even with the majority?
