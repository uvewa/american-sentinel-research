## General OCR Notes

### Page 1
- Line 21: "ASRISTANT EDITOR" appears to be an OCR error for "ASSISTANT EDITOR" - corrected in transcription

- Line 364: "tears allow" - uncertain reading, possibly "tears a-flow" but transcribed as appears in OCR

### Page 4
- Line 259: Footnote marker "¹" appears before "Gurneir's case" - preserved as is
- Various footnote references and citations preserved exactly as they appear in OCR

### Page 5
- Line 289: "innerring testimony" - appears to be OCR error for "unerring testimony" but preserved as "innerring" based on instruction to preserve obvious OCR errors only when they don't alter meaning significantly

## Categorization Notes
- Father O'Keefe's letter is particularly significant as Catholic clergy defense of Sabbath keepers' rights
- Multiple items discuss selective Sunday law enforcement against minorities
