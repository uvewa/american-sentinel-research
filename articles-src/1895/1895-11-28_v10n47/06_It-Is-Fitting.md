## IT IS FITTING.

EVERY Sunday in the year and every hour of every Sunday, the Sunday "law" is violated in New York City by every street car line in the city, both surface and elevated, as it is also violated by the New York Central and Hudson River, and Hartford and New Haven railways. But no orders have been issued to the police of the city to make any arrests for these violations of the "law," hence, according to his own theory, that the one paramount duty of officials is to enforce the "law," President Roosevelt is guilty of criminal neglect of his official duty. But we do not so charge. We believe that it would be wrong to attempt to enforce the so-called "law" which we have cited. It is contrary to the law of nature, which is paramount to all human law, and it is because experience has demonstrated this, that the statute is not enforced.

The police authorities of New York know perfectly well that the running of street cars and of the elevated trains and of the railway trains and the selling of tickets is all just as illegal and just as much a violation of the "law" on Sunday as is anything else that is done or attempted to be done, and they make no effort to enforce the "law" against these things because they realize that they would not be sustained by the people in so doing, and they know that they will not be sustained by the people because these "laws" are an invasion of the rights of the people. And by their failure to even attempt to enforce the "law" in its entirety, Mr. Roosevelt and his fellow-commissioners confess that they do not regard as "more important than even the question of what a law is, is the question of the honest enforcement of the law." They do not regard it as "the paramount duty of public officials to enforce the law." They no doubt regard it really as a paramount duty of officials to serve the best interests of the whole people; at least this is the light in which they ought to regard it. But while they do this in the matter of street cars and railway trains, they seem to lose sight of it in various minor matters. They are pursuing with the "law" the men and women who might otherwise earn a few much needed dimes and nickles on Sunday, while they close their eyes to the acts of the rich corporations that are reaping rich harvests of dollars every Sunday. But such "enforcement" of the Sunday "law" is fitting and ought to open the eyes of the people not only to the evils of all such legislation, but to the character of the Sunday institution itself.
