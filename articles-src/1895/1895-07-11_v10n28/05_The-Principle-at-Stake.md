## THE PRINCIPLE AT STAKE.

[From the Dayton (Tenn.) Republican, June 21.]

A STRANGE condition confronts the citizens of Rhea County. The personal safety and freedom of a large community of our people are threatened by the unjust and illogical operations of the law. If the letter of the law is enforced and these people are again fined and imprisoned, it will undoubtedly drive them from the county and the State. They pay taxes on property aggregating not less than $50,000, nearly all created through their own industry. There are no better or more desirable people in the county than these Graysville Adventists. It is absurd to the verge of idiocy to treat them as criminals. As a matter of fact the law under which they are being tried has been diverted from its true mission, and its principles are being misapplied. Truly has Justice been represented as blind-folded; let us hope she is not also stupid.

The REPUBLICAN does not take the position it occupies on this question through personal motives or petty prejudices. From the moment the evidence was given which convicted the nine Adventists last March our course was fully made up. The juries themselves saw and admitted the wrong, but thought they had to bring in a "guilty" verdict as in accord with the law and the judge's charge.

To the ministry and those people who call themselves Christians and church-members, and who oppose the Adventists, we have a question to ask: Have you, in the sanctity of your home, with your family gathered round you—or perchance in the solitude of your closet—gotten down on your knees, to the God you love and reverence and asked for help and strength and wisdom to guide you aright in what your duty is as regards these persecuted people? God pity you if you have not!

We stand for an underlying principle that is as broad and deep as this Government—the principle that men are created with certain inalienable rights, and are entitled to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness just so long as they do not infringe upon the natural rights of others; and inseparable from this principle is the freedom to worship the Creator according to the dictates of conscience. Remember that "he who fails to protest against the persecution of his neighbor thereby virtually forfeits the right to protest when he himself is persecuted."

Moncure D. Conway truly says: "No unrepealed statute is ever obsolete. The head of every wrong lives still while its principle is spared, and though it seems antiquated one day, it may be a 'spirited policy' the next;" and Richard M. Johnson says, "One bigot may set the machinery of the law in motion and better men be his victims."

This is the reason that "eternal vigilance is the price of liberty." We are with the Adventists in this struggle because it involves a principle that affects the personal rights of mankind, and indirectly our own liberties.

As true Americans, who have imbibed the principles of freedom from the Constitution, our people should zealously resist the insidious encroachment of ecclesiastical and civil power; else some fine morning we too may wake up and find that the deadly, persistent force that is forever at work in human society undermining the liberties of the individual has crept upon us unawares, and robbed us of some right that should be inseparable from our proud position as an American citizen.
