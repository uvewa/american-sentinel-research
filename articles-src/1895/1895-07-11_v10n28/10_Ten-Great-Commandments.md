**TEN GREAT COMMANDMENTS.**

[From the Chicago Inter-Ocean, June 3.]

There are what David calls "secret sins," and he who knows much of the life of cities knows that they flourish in the shade of puritanic observance. The spiritual life is not of necessity most vigorous where the street cars cease to run and the newspapers to be published on Sunday, and where the day is miscalled the sabbath. The plain fact is that in Chicago, more, we believe, than in any other city of the first magnitude, a teacher whose message is from God to man, as distinct from a sect to man, is sure of a hearing. He who teaches the "ten great commandments," and who expounds their infinite applicability to every act and deed of man, is sure of a following in Chicago.
