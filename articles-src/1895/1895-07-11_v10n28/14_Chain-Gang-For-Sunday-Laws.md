#### Chain-Gang For Sunday Laws.

[From the Iowa State Register.]

All newspaper readers have heard of the cruelties which were inflicted upon the Seventh-day Adventists in the State of Tennessee. But more recently a Georgia case of a similar nature has attracted wide attention. The name of this man is James Allison. He was referred to by the judge before whom he was tried, as an upright, moral and intelligent man, law-abiding in all respects except as to sabbath observance. The fact that he had worked on Sunday was admitted, so was the fact that he had faithfully observed Saturday as his Sunday. But the law left no discretion, and the man was doomed to the chain-gang for a period of twelve months. Think of it! And even then the judge was lenient, so severe are the laws of the State of Georgia, as interpreted in the Douglas County courts. The law imposes a fine of $1,000, imprisonment six months, and twelve months in the chain-gang, any one or all of them in the discretion of the judge.

Is it possible that men are still condemned to chain-gangs for not observing Sunday, the first day of the week, as others think they ought to observe it? It is a reproach to American civilization. Those Georgia laws belong to the period of the Inquisition. The South, with its chain-gangs for theological offenders and lynchings for colored men, and stake-burnings, is two hundred years behind the right time. And yet, no one doubts if certain sour-hearted clerics in even Iowa could have their way, they would have Sunday laws enforced in the same way.
