**JUDGE PARKS' DECISION.**

Dayton, Tenn., July 3, 1895.

"In pronouncing judgment in these cases I have little to add to what was said in similar cases at the last term. My views, as then expressed, have not changed.

"I will take occasion, however, to express again my sincere personal regret, that a necessity exists for inflicting punishment upon these people, for it must be patent even to the most casual observer that they are good citizens, who are thoroughly conscientious in the course they have taken. They are not sabbath-breakers in the ordinary sense of that term. The original intention of the law was certainly not to punish such people. It was directed at that class of persons who, out of sheer wickedness, and want of decent respect for things sacred, violated that day which by the concurrent belief of the Christian world in general had come to be recognized as the sabbath.

"But the Supreme Court of our State, in passing upon cases of this kind, involving the constitutional rights of those who believe in keeping the seventh instead of the first day of the week, has seen fit to make no exceptions in their favor; on the other hand, it has directly and pointedly held that this belief is no bar to a prosecution for a violation of a Sunday law. In addition to this, the last session of the General Assembly, with full knowledge of the fact that these people were being prosecuted under the Sunday law, refused to give them any relief by exempting them as has been done in many States. This fact is a source of regret to a large and respectable element of Christian people who adhere strictly to Sunday as the sabbath, but who believe that one of the corner-stones of Christianity itself is freedom in matters of conscience. On the other hand, there is a considerable element of conservative Christian people who, while they would not engage in anything that savored of religious persecution, fear the result of breaking over any of the time-honored barriers which have, for hundreds of years, protected the day that their traditions and religion have taught them to regard as the sabbath. They take the view that if these people are permitted to carry on the common avocations of life on Sunday, it would be only one step further to the point where any one day would cease to be recognized as the Sabbath, and that we would have no Sabbath at all, except such as each individual might choose for himself. Which of these conflicting views is right is very properly a question with which the courts acting within their proper limits, can have nothing to do.

"Without attempting a discussion of this grave question, which, as they conceive, involves to a very great extent the religious freedom of these people, it only remains for the court to perform its sworn duty by enforcing the law.

"At the last term in several cases of this kind nominal fines were imposed. As these cases were the first persecution of the kind in this court the fines were suspended, leaving only the costs to be paid. In addition to this, upon recommendation of the court, executive clemency was extended to the defendants who, upon their refusal to pay the costs, had been incarcerated in jail. I am glad to note, in passing, that the recommendation for pardon in their cases was, as I am informed, heartily approved of by the governor under the peculiar circumstances. I have no cause for regret in showing the defendants such leniency. Every dictate of justice and mercy demanded it. While it was not expected that the defendants would surrender their belief after their prosecutions, yet it was hoped by many good people that no further occasion would be presented for the time being for further prosecutions.

"It appears, however, that even during the last term of the court while the persecutions were pending, some of the defendants did not seem to recognize the majesty of the law, but continued to work openly on Sunday. It also appears that the practice has been kept up. These facts bring us face to face with the question whether the law can be violated with impunity or not, and whether any number of people can be permitted to defy it on the ground that they think it unjust. The issue is squarely made. As a court there can be no question as to our duty. The law must be enforced—with mercy—but it must be enforced. No man can regret the necessity in these cases more than myself. I am sure that this sentiment is shared by a large element of the people. But there can be no division on the question as to whether the law should be upheld. A court failing to do this but invites contempt for all law."

The court then imposed fines in the several cases, as follows—graded according to the magnitude of the offense, previous conviction, and other circumstances considered:

- H. C. Leach, $7.50.
- J. M. Hall, $7.50.
- W. S. Burchard, $8.50.
- Columbus B. Moyers, $5.00.
- Byrd Terry, $5.00.
- W. J. Kerr, $8.50.
- Dwight Plumb, $12.50.
- Monroe Morgan, $7.50.
- Allen Cathy (2 cases), $15.00.
