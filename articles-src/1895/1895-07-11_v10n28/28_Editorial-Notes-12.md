As will be seen from another page the Ontario justice has decided that the provincial Sunday law does not apply to farmers, and has consequently dismissed the case of Robert Watt, the seventh-day observer, who was charged with sabbath-breaking, because he labored on Sunday. Enraged by their defeat his enemies will now agitate for the passage of the pending bill for a Dominion Sunday law.
