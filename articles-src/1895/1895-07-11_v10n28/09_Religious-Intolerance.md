**RELIGIOUS INTOLERANCE.**

[From Daily Nevada State Journal, Reno, Nev., June 23.]

In some of the Southern and Eastern States honest, industrious and peaceable citizens are being fined and imprisoned because of their religious belief. The victims of this intolerance are members of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. They believe in observing the seventh or Sabbath day, in obedience to the command of the Decalogue, to remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy.

The AMERICAN SENTINEL, a paper which advocates religious liberty, tells of the case of Robert Nash, an Adventist, who was arrested at Aberdeen, Miss., for working on Sunday. He pleaded guilty and conducted his own case, using the Bible for his law book. He keeps Saturday as religiously as priests and ministers of other denominations do Sunday. He quoted:—

Exodus 20: 8-11: Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work; but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maldseervant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates: for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day, and hallowed it.

Mr. Nash then read from the constitution of Mississippi, which says:—

Section 18. No preference shall be given by the law to any religious sect or mode of worship; but the free enjoyment of all religious sentiments and different modes of worship shall be held sacred.

Notwithstanding Mr. Nash fortified his position by the above quotations from the Bible and the constitution of Mississippi, he was fined $10 by the justice of the peace, who subsequently reduced the fine to $1 and costs, amounting to $7.75. This amount was promptly paid by the people attending court, and Mr. Nash was discharged. As he conscientiously believes in keeping the seventh or Sabbath day, and cannot afford to remain idle two days in each week, it is probable that he will again be arrested and fined the full amount allowed by law—twenty dollars for each offense.

In Georgia the laws are more severe against Sunday-breakers than in Mississippi, and the penalty may be $1,000 fine or six months imprisonment for each offense, and Tennessee is but little behind Georgia. Several persons have been arrested and fined in those States as well as in Mississippi for violation of Sunday laws, and respectable men have been subjected to the indignity of working in chain-gangs with the vilest criminals for simply following the dictates of conscience and complying with the command given by Jehovah to Moses amid the thunders of Mount Sinai. And this, too, not in despotic Russia, nor in pagan China, but in the free and enlightened United States of America, whose Constitution expressly states that "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof."
