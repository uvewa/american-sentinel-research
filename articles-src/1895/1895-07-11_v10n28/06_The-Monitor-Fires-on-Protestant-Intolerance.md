**THE "MONITOR" FIRES ON PROTESTANT INTOLERANCE.**

[From the Monitor (Roman Catholic) San Francisco, Cal., June 22.]

We do not believe that there is a Catholic paper or a Catholic citizen in this country that approves of this persecution of the Seventh-day Adventists. If there be such a paper we are ashamed of it, and if there be such a Catholic he is a bigot. This persecution is a disgrace to the States that permit it, and if it occurred in Catholic countries it would be taken up by all the Protestant sects and heralded to the world as an example of papal intolerance. But because it occurs among the dear, good, liberty-loving Methodists nobody seems to consider it anything extraordinary.
