#### What Is The World Coming To?

[From Milton (Ore.) Eagle, May 31.]

The Eagle is in receipt of advices from Douglasville, Georgia, that Mr. J. Q. Allison, of that place, has been convicted of violating the sabbath statute of that State. Following this information comes the word that Mississippi has followed in the footsteps of Georgia and has arrested Mr. R. T. Nash, at Amory, for a similar crime. Both of these men are Adventists, and the conclusion is arrived at that the prosecution is entirely due to their religious preferences.

Now, the Eagle has not a particle of the belief of the Adventists in its composition and never will have; yet we abhor all such proceedings as are above chronicled. Religious and political liberty are the principal foundation stones of our government. We make the boast that every man is at liberty to have his own peculiar political preferences and entitled to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience. These privileges are due him as a citizen of a free, enlightened government in this nineteenth century, and yet many of our citizens have suffered the indignity of late, for the simple act of performing little tasks of manual labor on the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday, of being thrown into prison along with murderers, thugs and thieves. What in the name of decency and common sense is the world coming to? There must be a vast number of religious fanatics holding judicial offices in those States that such things should exist. Fortunately, such instances of persecution are extremely isolated, else a war in behalf of religious freedom would be necessary, similar to that waged by our forefathers in behalf of political freedom when the yoke of British rule was thrown aside and the colonies stepped forth free and untrammeled, as the United States of America.

Here, in Oregon, are many Adventists. They are a thrifty and law-abiding people. They hold their religious services and preach their doctrines the same as other religious denominations. Many of us do not believe in their creed, but we do not seek to controvert it by resorting to the legislatures and courts. In fact, we simply permit them to worship when and where they will, only claiming the same privilege ourselves. If they wish to hoe in the garden on Sunday there are none to say them nay. The premises are theirs, and why should they not if they choose? This is as it should be. Let them worship when they will and if they choose to keep the seventh day instead of the first, let them do so, for in these matters certainly we are not our brother's keeper.
