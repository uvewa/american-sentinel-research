One man was killed and fifty wounded in a fight between a Roman Catholic mob and an A. P. A. parade in East Boston, July 4. It is reported that the city authorities were asked to admit in the customary parade a representation of the "little red school-house," which should typify the public school system, but refused to grant the request; whereupon a permit for an independent parade was secured. In the afternoon of the Fourth, the procession, headed by the miniature school-house, and numbering six hundred or more, began the march. Although escorted by a large company of police, the number was inadequate to protect them from the rage of the Romish mob. A fight ensued, in which one Catholic was killed and about fifty of the marchers and mob more or less hurt. Two A. P. A. members have been arrested on the charge of murder, and an angry papal mob surrounded the court house at the preliminary hearing, loudly demanding the punishment of the alleged murderers.

The Boston Pilot (Roman Catholic), anticipating the trouble, urged Catholics to refrain from violence, but without avail.

This and similar occurrences are but the mutterings of the coming storm.
