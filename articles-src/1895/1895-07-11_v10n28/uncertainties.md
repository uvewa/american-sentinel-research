# Uncertainties Log - v10n28 (1895-07-11)

## Page 1, Column 3
- **Line reference:** "maldseervant" in Exodus 20:8-11 quote
- **Transcribed as:** "maldseervant"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM
- **Reason:** This appears to be an OCR error for "maidservant" but preserved as printed to maintain accuracy. The quote is from the Nevada State Journal article reproducing Robert Nash's Bible reading.

## Page 5, Line 366
- **Line reference:** "Ninctysis pages"
- **Transcribed as:** "Ninctysis pages"
- **Confidence:** LOW
- **Reason:** This appears to be OCR corruption of "Ninety-six pages" or similar, but the scan quality makes it uncertain. This is in an advertisement section for "The Good Shepherd" book.

## General Note
- Several obvious OCR errors were corrected throughout (e.g., "Tran." to "Tenn." in the Dayton Leader attribution)
- Advertisements on pages 7-8 were skipped as instructed
- All article text has been preserved with original spelling, punctuation, and capitalization
