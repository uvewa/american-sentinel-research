#### Religious Intolerance.

[From Custer County Beacon, Broken Bow, Neb., June 30.]

The American people, to-day, read of the persecution of the Quakers, Baptists, Catholics and other religious sects in the early history of the country, with mingled feelings of regret and pity, and congratulate themselves that the days of bigotry and religious intolerance are over. They look upon the intolerance of our ancestors as they look upon the spirit of persecution which characterized the Dark Ages. But let's not allow our joy over the spirit of liberality supposed to prevail today, to transport us beyond reason. It's only been a few days since Elder Colcord, president of a Seventh-day Adventist academy at Graysville, Tenn., and seven co-workers, were arrested under the laws of that State, tried on the charge of "exercising and carrying on the common avocations of life on the Sabbath," convicted, and sent to jail. It seems that the law under which they were indicted remains upon the statute book of that State, contrary to the provision of the Federal Constitution which declares that "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof;" and also a provision of the State constitution which declares "That all men have a natural and indefeasible right to worship Almighty God according to the dictates of their own conscience." The imprisonment of men for worshiping God according to the dictates of their own conscience is barbarous, and a State that practices it in this enlightened age will merit the condemnation of the civilized world. The people of the State of Tennessee ought to repeal the barbarous law, and get in line with the advancing army of progress.
