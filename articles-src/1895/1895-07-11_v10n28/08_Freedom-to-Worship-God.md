**FREEDOM TO WORSHIP GOD.**

[From Rocky Mountain News, June 23.]

On the fourth of next month the American eagle will give his annual shriek and in hundreds of towns and cities trained choirs will sing the national anthems of their beloved land. Orators will tell of the land of the free and the home of the brave, and their hearers will go away in a glow of patriotism to imbibe pink lemonade, and discourse upon the greatness, the grandeur, the nobility, and especially the liberty that marks this nation. School children will raise their fresh young voices to our fathers' God, author of liberty, and recite the story of the gallant band who sought not bright jewels, but "freedom to worship God," and only here and there will there be a smile of quiet cynicism. The sentiment expressed by Mrs. Hemans is very beautiful, no doubt, but it is all sentiment, and has never been true at any time since the year 1620. The talented lady asks: "What sought they thus afar?" and after narrating what they did not seek, goes on to say:—

They sought a faith's pure shrine!

Aye, call it holy ground,
The soil where first they trod.

They have left unstained what there they found—
Freedom to worship God.

Roger Williams and the Quakers didn't find any soil where they could worship God in the vicinity of Plymouth Rock, and they moved on. The Puritans were much like other good and worthy people now cumbering the earth. When they talked of freedom, they meant that the Catholic, the Jew, and the Quaker should be free to worship God according to Cotton Mather. The latter-day Puritan differs essentially in only one particular. He is willing to dispense with any kind of worship at all, rather than have his nerves racked by the sound of a snare drum, or his eye offended by the sight of a man worshiping on Saturday. It is somewhat premature to thank God that we are not as the rest of men in the past, so long as the spirit that burned Servetus at the stake, for the good of his soul, is still extant.

The first of this month a Seventh-day Baptist [Adventist] was tried for hoeing his garden on Sunday, though he keeps Saturday holy; this occurred in Mississippi. The middle of last month an Adventist living in Douglasville, Ga., was sent to the chain-gang. A bill was introduced in the Tennessee legislature last winter making all personal property liable for fines and costs in misdemeanor cases. Its avowed purpose was to strip the Adventists of everything belonging to them as personal property under the State Sunday law.

This week several Salvationists were arrested in Colorado Springs, not for obstructing the highway or disturbing the peace, but under an ordinance which refers specifically to "loafers, loungers, and bums." Yesterday's papers tell of an attempt to drive an ice-wagon over a group of Salvationists in St. Louis, and a proposition of a gentleman to hose them if they did not move on.

What crime have these people committed? Are they heathens? Oh, no, but even if they were we permit the Chinese to have joss-houses. Even if they had committed some misdemeanor they might still go at large. When Captain Cox was arrested as a "bum" for preaching to those who were unmistakably bums, the policeman did not arrest any of them. The intolerable crime which they have committed is preaching Christ crucified, and preaching on the streets as Christ himself was compelled to preach by the Pharisees of his day. Does any officer ever enforce the law against swearing? No, it is only where the name of God is taken reverently, by inspired lips, that warrants are sworn out.

The pity of it is that this is done, or at least is permitted, by the followers of Christ, the good people, the respectable part of the community. The law represents them. They stand like modern Pauls, consenting to the stoning of these followers of Christ. It is when the Church and the world are most friendly that real Christianity fares worst. The Salvation Army will not suffer, nor these other denominations, for it is written: "Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake. Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets." Christian people have need to remember Macaulay's words: "The whole history of the Christian religion shows that it is in far greater danger of being corrupted by the alliance of power than of being crushed by its opponents."
