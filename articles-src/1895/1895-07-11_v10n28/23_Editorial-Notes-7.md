Think of it! One of those convicted Tennessee Adventists is still at large!! How did the criminal break jail, did you ask? He didn't break jail. The kind-hearted judge told him to go home and cut his oats and then return to jail! Although this condemned man is at large there is not a Sunday-keeper in Rhea County that would lock his granary or his money-drawer against him.
