We are devoting much of our space these days to the cause of the persecuted Adventists, but we have no apology to offer. The principles at stake in these persecutions involve the cherished rights of every man, Protestant and Catholic, believer and unbeliever. If the Adventists can be imprisoned for a failure to obey one dogma of the ruling creed, then may the Methodist or the Catholic or the unbeliever be compelled to obey some other dogma when the ever-changing majority happens to be against him and his faith. The wise and courageous will understand this and act accordingly, but the thoughtless or time-serving will see nothing but a few "foolish Adventists" and remain silent, or with "thumbs turned down" demand that the fatal blow be struck the defenseless minority.
