**CHRIST "THE END OF THE LAW."**

May who attempt to set at naught the claims of the Sabbath command in the great moral code, quote Rom. 10:4 to prove that since Christ came the fourth commandment is at an end. The scripture reads: "For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth."

A few plain facts drawn from the Scriptures and reason will enable the reader to comprehend just what the Spirit intended to convey by the foregoing language. There are but two ways in which we can understand the word "end." It either means that the law ceased, ended, stopped; or it means ultimate object, aim, or design (see Webster). If it has the first meaning in this text, and the law ceased at the advent of Christ, then not "one jot or one tittle" of the law has been in force since the cross. To say that Christ nailed the whole law to the cross and then reenacted nine of the commandments to get rid of the fourth, would be like a surgeon cutting off all ten of a man's fingers and thumbs to get rid of one on which there was a felon and then attempting to graft on the nine healthy fingers. Such a position is too absurd for a moment's consideration.

The reader will notice that the text says that Christ is the end of the law only to the believer, not to the unbeliever. If the word "end" means to cease to bind, or release from obligation to obey (and that is just what the advocates of this theory use the text to prove in the case of the fourth commandment), then none but believers are released from obligation to obey any of the ten commandments, while unbelievers are bound to keep them all. Think of it reader, Christians can have other gods, worship images, swear, kill, lie, steal, and commit adultery, in fact, break every one of the ten commandments, including the fourth, because with them "Christ is the end of the law," therefore they are under no obligation to keep the Sabbath or any other one of the ten commandments; while if the unbeliever breaks any of them he will be held to pay the penalty. Many outside the pale of the churches begin to think this is about the true condition of things. And why shouldn't they? When professed ministers and church leaders teach the people that the ten commandments are abolished to the believer and not to the unbeliever, may we not look for a worse state of things in the church than out of it? If not, why not?

If we understand the text to mean that Christ is the object or purpose of the law for righteousness, then all is plain and it establishes every jot and tittle of the law to be as enduring as the heavens and the earth. That the word "end" has the above meaning see the following texts: "Considering the end [or object] of their conversation." Heb. 13:7 "Ye have seen the end [object] of the Lord." James 5:11. No one need mistake the meaning of the word "end" in these texts. Just so with Rom. 10:4: "Christ is the end [object] of the law for righteousness."

The law is a transcript of the Divine mind and contains all the moral attributes of its author. "My righteousness shall not be abolished. Hearken unto me, ye that know righteousness, the people in whose heart is my law." Isa. 51:6, 7. This shows that God's law and his righteousness are the same. Says David, "All thy commandments are righteousness." Ps. 119:172. "The law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good." Rom. 7:12. It "is spiritual." Verse 14. Had man always obeyed the law he would have reflected the glory of God. Paul speaking of the tenth commandment says it was "ordained unto life." Rom. 7:10. Had our first parents never coveted the forbidden fruit, but remained obedient, they could have had life. But through their disobedience many were made sinners. Rom. 5:19. Therefore on account of the weakness of the flesh entailed upon the race by Adam's transgression, "all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God." Rom. 3:23. "Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight" (verse 20), because "by the law is the knowledge of sin." A law that shows man that he is unrighteous cannot give him righteousness; that must come through some other source. "For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh [or on account of the weakness of the flesh], God sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh: that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit." Rom. 8:3, 4.

Here we have a definition of the word "end" as found in Rom. 10:4. That is, that Christ is the object or design of the law for righteousness to every believer. The two statements are exactly parallel. One makes Christ the object of the law for righteousness to us; the other makes him fulfill the righteousness of the law in us.

When God pardons our sins on condition of faith and repentance he at the same time imputes to us the righteousness of the law and we are justified, or are accounted just, as if we had never broken the law. Then as we continue to walk by faith in the Son of God, He imparts to us his righteousness in the work of sanctification, and thus we are "kept [in obedience to the law] by the power of God through faith unto salvation, ready to be revealed in the last time." Then the law and the prophets both witness to the righteousness of the law which Christ fulfills in us, (Rom. 3:21), and in this way the object of the law is fully met in the believer. "Do we then make void [or abolish] the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish [ratify, make sure or enduring] the law." For "it is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than for one tittle of the law to fail." Luke 16:17.

And so the Sabbath will remain as long as the new heavens and the new earth remain.
Isa. 66:22, 23. J. F. BALLENGER.
