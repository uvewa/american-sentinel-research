The extra, which we hoped to publish under this date, has been unavoidably postponed until next week. It will be all the better for the delay. Let all friends of religious liberty make a united effort to circulate the extra. The hundreds of thousands of copies of our recent extras have exerted a powerful influence for truth and right. As will be seen by the first-page article, the misguided zealots who inspired the Tennessee persecutions are weakening under the withering denunciations of the press of the country, whose attention was called to these outrages by the AMERICAN SENTINEL.
