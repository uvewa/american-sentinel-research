#### Where the Blame Rests.

[From the Oakdale (Neb.) Sentinel, June 29.]

Often a court is not so much to blame for an infamous decision as are the laws. As an instance illustrating this point may be cited the case of the eight Adventists arrested in Tennessee and tried during March of this year for violating the Sunday law of that State. These peaceable men who minded their own business and interfered with no one's rights, were on complaint of malicious parties brought into court and thrown into jail for exercising their natural and constitutional right to worship God according to the dictates of their own consciences. The sentence was passed by Judge Parks, in accordance with the law, but in violation of his own sense of justice, and he deplored the fact that he could not do otherwise, and declared that the law ought to be repealed. And it was on his recommendation that the prisoners were pardoned by Governor Turney. In this case no blame was attached to the court, much blame was attached to the law, and the most blame rested on the parties who, out of pure malice, brought on the persecution. No more forcible demonstration is needed of the fact that we have often emphasized, namely, that all Sunday laws are vile relics of the Dark Ages and the union of Church and State, and are absolutely wrong and senseless, and should be repealed—every one of them. And we believe that if the members of any supreme court were as conscientious as Judge Parks, and such a case should be brought before them, they would declare the Sunday law unconstitutional, as it plainly is in a State, not to say nation, that guarantees religious liberty by its constitution. Still these persecutions go on, in Tennessee as well as in other States, and are often brought about by professed Christians of other churches out of pure jealousy and enviousness.
