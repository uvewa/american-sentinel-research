**CANADIAN CORRESPONDENCE.**

Darrell, Ont., July 3, 1895.

The case against Robert Watt, a Seventh-day Adventist, of Selton, Ont., for breaking the Lord's Day Act, was disposed of in the justice court to-day. The crown attorney, after nearly four weeks' consideration, instructed the court to dismiss the case. This decision was made on the grounds that the "Lord's Day Act" does not comprehend the former. This will, doubtless, end the matter of prosecutions until the law is amended or further legislation enacted upon the Sunday observance line.

The Christian(?) people (Methodists) who laid the complaint against Mr. Watt, are very sore over their defeat, and act as if they would like a law such as the Pharisees had, the transgression of which would be death.

It is reported that Mr. Charlton's Sunday bill has passed the House of Commons, with a fair prospect of passing the Senate. This act, if put through, will be a power in the hands of a certain religious element in Ontario, with which to bitterly oppress Sabbath-keepers. Every step taken in America is being followed in this country, and the prophecy of Rev. 13: 15, 16 is being fulfilled before the eyes of all people. P. M. HOWE.
