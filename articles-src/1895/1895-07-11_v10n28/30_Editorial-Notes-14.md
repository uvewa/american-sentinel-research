One of the prisoners now in jail at Dayton, Tenn., said in his defense:—

"We find that Jesus Christ was a carpenter working six days in the week; therefore, Jesus did many hard days' work on the first day of the week, and he is our pattern."

Another said to judge and jury that they were not trying the defendant merely, but the defendant's Lord who had commanded him to do that for which he was on trial.

Another in closing his address to the jury said: "I would rather have the frown of the whole world and face prison bars or chain-gangs, or whatever may be before me, than have the frown of God. I will say further, that I believe in my heart that if it is the wish of my God for me to meet these things, all the good men in Rhea County cannot keep me out of them, and if not, all the bad men in the county cannot put me there. I leave myself in your hands and before God as you expect to meet me in the Judgment, I trust you will decide these things."
