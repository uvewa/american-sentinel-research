**UNFAIR TREATMENT.**

[From Dayton (Tran.) Leader, June 28.]

Without discussing the merits, or the demerits, of the Sunday law, there is no question but the Seventh-day Adventists are being treated unfairly in this county. That they are being prosecuted, or rather, persecuted, because of their religion there can be no question.

The grand juries that indicted them ignored the "lawlessness" of the 400 or 500 men who work within sight of the court house every Sunday, and went five miles away to find indictments against a little band of Seventh-day Adventists down at Graysville. Their neighbors of other religious beliefs say the Adventists are admirable citizens and they denounce their persecution in the most unmeasured terms. That the indictment of the Adventists originated from no worthy motives is quite apparent to the most obtuse-minded.

In the first place, if the motives were pure, the law would have been invoked against all known Sunday law breakers in the county, regardless of their religious convictions, or stations in life. In the second place, the LEADER is credibly informed that some of the very men who were most active in finding indictments against Seventh-day Adventists have been guilty of laboring at their usual vocations of life all day Sunday more than once within the past five weeks. Why make a specialty of the Adventists? Does not the law apply to others, as well as the Adventists?

The LEADER is not discussing the merits of the law, but in the name of justice and decency let us have the law administered impartially. Let us not crucify one class of industrious citizens, because of their religion, for the very same violations of law that we indorse and condone in hundreds of others. Give all citizens a fair and impartial deal under the law, and let us not adopt that relic of the Dark Ages—religious intolerance and bigotry—in this enlightened age and in this favored country. How anyone possessing a spirit of even-handed justice in his heart, can indorse the persecution, or conviction, of the Seventh-day Adventists for violating the sabbath, while many hundreds of others work every Sunday in the very shadow of our court house, is a mystery which would be hard to fathom.
