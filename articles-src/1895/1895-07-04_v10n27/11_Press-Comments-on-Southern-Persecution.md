## PRESS COMMENTS ON SOUTHERN PERSECUTION.

[From the Pine Island (Minn.) Record, May 24.]

From Georgia comes the news that J. Q. Allison has been sentenced to the "chain-gang" for laboring on Sunday. Mississippi is also in for persecution, and arrests are being made. A singular fact in these cases is that only those who observe Saturday as a Sabbath according to the Bible are being prosecuted for violation of a bad law. And yet we are told that the world is getting better.

[From the Republican, Springfield, Mass., May 21.]

The Sunday observance laws of Georgia deal as harshly with those who believe in the observance of some other day as do the laws of Tennessee, and Seventh-day Adventists find prisons and chain-gangs waiting for them if they obey their consciences instead of the statutes made and provided.

Public sentiment in Georgia is grossly misrepresented by the laws of that State, or else it classes Seventh-day Adventists, who think that they are commanded by the Bible to observe the seventh day as the Sabbath and to work on the other six, with criminals of all sorts, black and white, thieves, drunkards and vagabonds. If it does not so class them, why permit them to be sentenced to hard and suffer with such criminals in the chain-gang? —the most humiliating of all punishments to such a man as Judge James said Allison was, honest, moral, and law-abiding in all respects save in this one particular where his conscience and the law run at cross purposes. It does not seem possible that zeal for Sunday observance is so force as these laws indicate in Georgia or in Tennessee, or anywhere else; if it was, there would be no Sunday newspaper, no Sunday trains, no Sunday street cars and no trafficking of any kind, nothing but the Puritan Sabbath. The truth is that such laws are anachronisms, and do not represent the sentiment of the people of any State; not even of Christian people and Sunday-keepers.
