## OCR Corrections and Notes

### Page 1
- **Line 21:** "LEON A. SMITH," listed as assistant editor - this is the first appearance of this name in the masthead
- **Line 27:** "EISEWHERE" - likely OCR error for "ELSEWHERE"
- **Line 35:** "chain-gung" - appears to be OCR error for "chain-gang"
- **Line 43:** Partial line "O, for a" continues to next page

### Page 2
- **Line 49:** "210" - page number preserved from original
- **Line 106:** Footnote marker and text preserved as shown in original

### Page 3
- **Line 241:** "flafferion" - unclear if this is correct place name or OCR error
- **Line 241:** "meller" - likely OCR error for "miller"
- **Line 243:** "Lol'" - unclear if apostrophe is original or OCR artifact

### Page 4
- **Line 203:** "ingrati on" - appears to be OCR error, possibly "ingrafted on" or similar

### Page 6
- **Line 333:** "Exodus 30:8-11" - the young man's citation is incorrect; should be Exodus 20:8-11 (the fourth commandment). Left as written since it's a quoted letter.

### Page 7
- **Line 365:** "*So far was the Tennessee Legislature..." - this is an editorial note from the Sentinel editors, marked with asterisk reference to earlier footnote marker
- **Line 446:** The "Specimen of type" table contains heavily corrupted OCR text from a Bible specimen page - preserved as-is since it's an advertisement sample

### General Notes
- All obvious OCR errors in body text were corrected where the correct reading was clear from context
- Original spelling preserved: "to-day", "connexion" (not seen in this issue but per instructions)
- Archaic punctuation and capitalization preserved throughout
- Page numbers and running headers preserved where they appear in OCR
- Author attribution "J. F. Ballenger" in article 07 matches "A. F. Ballenger" from known authors list - treating as same person (AFB)
