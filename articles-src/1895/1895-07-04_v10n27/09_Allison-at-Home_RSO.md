## ALLISON AT HOME.

BY R. S. OWEN.

SINCE the arrest and imprisonment of J. Q. Allison for working on Sunday has become so widely known, the public will be interested in his present situation.

I recently visited his neighborhood, and found him enjoying again his happy home, made more cheering than ever by the fact that his wife, who heretofore had felt unrecunciled to his being a Seventh-day Adventist, is now united with him in that faith. Thus it is with persecution: it will drive more into the truth than it will from the truth.

As we walked back with Mr. Allison upon the farm, which is almost wholly surrounded by native forest, until we came to the little patch of ground where the work was done, for which he was sentenced to twelve long months of hard labor in the chain-gang; as we stood upon that sequestered spot back of a thick growth of pine woods, far away not only from any house of worship, but from any dwelling or public road, we could but sense the injustice of the Atlanta Constitution in upholding Allison's conviction on the ground of "Christians having their devotions interrupted." Upon inquiry, we find it to be the universal testimony of his neighbors that they had never been disturbed by his Sunday work.

The two witnesses, Mr. Allison's nearest neighbors, who had been obliged to testify to his working on Sunday, are deeply mortified over one statement in the report of the trial in the SENTINEL; not that it is incorrect, but that they fear the public will draw a wrong conclusion from it. The statement is this:—

Both the witnesses testified, on direct examination, that they would not have seen Mr. Allison at work had they not gone to the place where he was on purpose to see him.

Now, they fear that the public will suppose that the object of their visit was that they might have him brought before the court, which was not the case. They went there for another purpose. They did not want him arrested, nor did they want to testify against him. This they wish the public to understand. Their feelings upon this point reminded me of an experience I once heard of a temperance speaker. To illustrate a certain point he said to a man in the audience: "Now, suppose that you should go and get drunk." "But," said the man, "I don't get drunk." "I know you don't get drunk," said the speaker, "I was only supposing the case." "Now, suppose that you should get drunk, and ——" "Sir," interrupted the man, "I never get drunk; and I regard it as a disgrace upon me for you to suppose that I do."

So it is with these neighbors of Mr. Allison. They would not interfere with his religious liberty, and they consider that it would be a disgrace upon them for the public to suppose that they would.

It is evident that the one who did enter the complaint is ashamed of his actions, for he keeps his identity concealed from the public. But there are always enough unprincipled men to take advantage of an unjust law, and the probability is that while this Sunday law is on the statute books of Georgia, the State will be used as an engine of persecution.
