## RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION UN-AMERICAN.

[From the *Primitive Catholic*, New York, June 15.]

It is with great interest we have followed the trial of the Sabbatarian, Mr. J. Q. Allison, of Douglasville, Ga. This gentleman is a member of a Christian denomination that holds that the seventh instead of the first day of the week should be the day of rest.

He observes like the orthodox Jew the Sabbath and works on Sunday. Mind you, he does not deprive anybody on Sunday of his rest, he interferes in no way whatever with the Sunday practice of any other citizen. Yet through the chicanery of some men, members of other Christian organizations, he is brought under the law for working in his own fields on Sunday. He is found guilty of having violated a statute of the State, he is condemned to one year of labor in the chain-gang. And, gentlemen, this is Christian America!

Down in Baltimore, a Mr. Whaley, formerly a member of a Methodist Church, with his family left Methodism and joined the Seventh-day Adventists. Some of his former co-religionists, good Methodist brothers, see him fixing his garden on Sunday. Their right-cousness is shocked, they enter a complaint against him, though they knew that this man conscientiously had observed his "Lord's day," that he was not making himself a public nuisance, but quietly worked in his own private garden. Consequence: Mr. Whaley, who is a journeyman carpenter, has to go to jail for thirty days; he was locked in a cell May 27th to serve out his sentence.

This is Christianity? Gentlemen, where is your consistency? You yell yourselves hoarse sometimes over the persecutions your missionaries have to undergo in foreign lands by the Romish authorities and laws prevailing in those lands. We all cry with you, shame! and are ready to agitate with you to change this state of affairs. But, look around, lo! what are you doing to your brother in America? Next time you go into your class-meetings open your Bible at the 14th chapter of Paul's epistle to the Romans and have it all talked over with the brothers and sisters. For shame's sake let us be consistent, let us have more of the sweet Spirit of Him whom Paul really represents in his writings.

Verily we believe if the Spirit of Jesus Christ were not acutely alive in the hearts of the laity of our churches, some of them with their array of talent and head-religion, as represented by the doctors and the greater than such, would become as despotic and tyrannizing as Rome.

Oh, for more of the Holy Ghost to even matters and smooth them over.
