## RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION.

[From the Lafayette (La.) Gazette, June 8.]

A few days ago that broad-minded journal, the Times-Democrat, commented upon a fresh case of religious persecution reported from Monroe County, Miss. With a few more papers like the T.-D., religious fanaticism and puritanism would soon be at a discount in this country. It never misses an opportunity to speak words of condemnation of the fanatic's work, thereby calling the attention of fair-minded people to the outrages which are committed in the sacred names of religion and of law. The following is the special which called forth the timely editorial from the Times-Democrat:—

ABERDEEN, Miss., May 29.—Mr. R. T. Nash, a Seventh-day Adventist, was yesterday arraigned in Justice Rye's court, at Amory, in this (Monroe) county, on the charge of working in his field on Sunday. Nash pleaded guilty, and undertook the management of his own case, using the Bible for his law book. He keeps Saturday as religiously as a priest keeps Sunday. The case was continued until the second Saturday in June.

The Mississippi statute bearing upon the subject, in Section 1291, provides that "Any one who shall labor on the Sabbath day at any other than household duties, works of necessity or charity, or on railroads or steamboats, shall, on conviction, be fined not more than $20 for every such offense.

By working in his field on Sunday, R. T. Nash has invited the deadly enmity of a few sanctimonious fools who have a peculiar style of serving the Lord. It will hardly meet with the approval of sensible people who are Christians at heart as well as in name. If the Seventh-day Adventists choose to keep Saturday as the Sabbath and do their farm work on Sunday, in what way do they interfere with the rights of the other creeds? Things have reached a pretty pass when a man cannot lose his corn or plant peanuts on Sunday without being dragged before the courts as a common criminal by a lot of religious cranks.

We do not know any of the people who are persecuting the Seventh-day Adventists in Mississippi, but we will venture to say that they have not half as much religion as the victims of their hell-born hatred. The man who persecutes his neighbor on account of religion is more dangerous than the anarchist. The latter is an open enemy to society and is an outlaw, while the former pretends to be a meek follower of Christ when in reality he is an emissary of the devil.
