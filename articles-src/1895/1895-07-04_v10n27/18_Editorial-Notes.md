Last one receiving the American Sentinel, without having ordered it may know that it is sent to him by some friend. Therefore, those who have not ordered the SENTINEL need have no fears that they will be asked to pay for it.

More seventh-day observers are threatened with arrest in Georgia.

No further attempt has been made to prevent SENTINEL employés from working on Sunday.

The Sunday-closing crusade has reached St. John, New Brunswick, and arrests for keeping open store have been made.

The AMERICAN SENTINEL says "amen" to the noble words of the *Primitive Catholic*, reprinted on this page; and let all the people say amen.

The decision in the case of Robert Watt, the Seventh-day Adventist of Darrell, Ont., charged with laboring on Sunday, which was to be rendered June 24, has been postponed. Evidently the judge is perplexed. It is to be hoped that justice will prevail.

The first-page article from the *Dayton (Tenn.) Republican* was written by the editor, W. O. Thomas, who held a consulship under President Harrison. Although Mr. Thomas must be writing dollars out of his pocket in defending the little body of seventh-day observers in his county, he continues the fight with increased zeal.

Robert R. Whaley, of Church Hill, Md., has served out his sentence of thirty days in the county jail, inflicted upon him for setting out plants in his garden on Sunday, and has returned to his wife and children. It is to be hoped that the hearts of his persecuting Methodist neighbors have been touched by this his second imprisonment at their hands, and that they will now cease to harass him.

The SENTINEL has vacated its pulpit this week in favor of the *Dayton (Tenn.) Republican*. This is not because we lack for something to say, but because we want our readers to listen to a new champion of religious freedom. The AMERICAN SENTINEL for nine years fought the battle comparatively alone, but within the last six months other champions have arisen to speak for the oppressed. God bless them all.

This number of the SENTINEL was held several hours to get the result of the trials of the Tennessee Adventists. One of our editors who was in attendance furnished the dispatch printed on this page. Next week we expect to publish a full account of the trials, with appropriate illustrations, secured with that faithful delineator, the kodak. Extra copies will be furnished in any quantity. Price, $1 per hundred; $8 per thousand.
