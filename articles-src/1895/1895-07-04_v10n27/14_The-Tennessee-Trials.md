## THE TENNESSEE TRIALS.

We stop the press to insert the following special telegram from Dayton, Tenn.

"Leach guilty, one case. Burchard and Hall guilty. England not guilty, two cases. Oscar England not guilty. Abbott, two disagreements. Dodson not guilty. Other cases follow. C. P. Bollman."

There are six more cases yet to be tried besides the Abbott case. The telegram indicates that the trials are most interesting, and the reader may look forward to our next issue for important news.

By the time this paper reaches our readers the Dayton jail will contain not only the persons named in the telegram as "found guilty" but others not yet tried. Let all friends of religious liberty awaken and arouse the country to a realization of this cruel injustice.
