## ARE NOT CRIMINALS.

[From the Dayton (Tenn.) Republican.]

EISEWHERE in this issue of the Republican we publish a letter written by D. W. Reavis to Elder G. A. Irwin, regarding the case of an Adventist at Amory, Miss., who was arrested and fined for working, according to his faith, on the first day of the week or Sunday.

We ask the reader to read that letter carefully, and also this article, in view of the fact that at the July term of Circuit Court in this county a number of similar cases will come up for disposal. It is possible that some of our readers may think that we place too much stress upon these cases. We know that some of our subscribers have intimated as much. They want to dismiss the whole affair by saying that the Seventh-day Adventists, by observing Saturday as the Sabbath and working on Sunday, are contravening the law of the land and defying the rule of the majority. They admit that these people are not criminals, in the ordinary meaning of that term, but when appealed to to awaken a public sentiment that will frown down these senseless and useless prosecutions, they shrug their shoulders and say that it is none of their business.

Pontius Pilate said the same thing when the clamoring multitude brought Christ before him for judgment. In all ages men who are tenacious enough of their own rights have regarded with indifference the demand of others for their rights. A simple application of the Golden Rule would settle the whole question: "Do unto others as you would that others should do unto you."

With this rule in view we wish to put to the Sunday observer this question: Suppose, by a factitious advantage, a majority of the people should enact a law making Saturday the legal day of worship and forbidding you to work on that day. Regarding Sunday, as you do, as the holy day of worship, you would still continue to worship on that day. But you would be compelled by law to rest on Saturday, your neighbor's Sabbath. Would you not consider this a hardship? yes, you would. You know you would. By doing this the State deprives you of one-sixth of your time. This places you at a disadvantage in the race of life. It is class legislation of the worst kind.

How we strain at the gnats and swallow camels in this world! A few Seventh-day Baptists here and there worship God according to the dictates of their conscience, yes, in accordance with the command of Holy Writ, by solemnly and consistently observing Saturday as the Sabbath. Having performed their duty to their God they next discharge their obligations to their families and to society by laboring the remaining six days of the week. Is there any sane man who will say that they have not the inalienable right to do this? No divine law has been violated. Society has not been injured. The natural rights of no individual have been invaded; and yet these people are dragged to jail, put in the chain-gung, robbed of their personal liberties and their material possessions, in order that a few bigots and zealots may have the satisfaction of applying the thumb-screws of intolerance and superstition.

See here: The community of Seventh-day Adventists at Graysville numbers about one hundred and forty, including men, women and children. We will give a year's subscription to any one who will prove that they lie, steal, curse, indulge in neighborhood broils or quarrels, cheat in business, refuse to pay their just debts, or in any way fail to live up to the obligations exacted of every citizen by the rules of good society; we mean any one of them. Of course, they are not perfect; but they come about as near it as any set of people on God's green earth. They live very close to the Bible, and consequently, literally obey its teachings. They read in this Book that the seventh day or Saturday, is God's day of rest; and so it is. We will give another year's subscription, yes, ten of them, to any one who can prove the contrary.

A score of these people are to be tried next July for working on Sabbath. Substantially, the charge is worshiping on Saturday, for this necessitates work on Sunday; so the law under which they were arrested is negatively a law restricting them in their mode of worship. Now, what is the sentiment of our people in regard to these cases? Don't say it is none of your business, that they are in the hands of the law. You cannot clear your skirts of their blood in this way. Don't say that we are making too much fuss over these people. They are people of like passions as are we, they are our friends, neighbors and fellow-citizens, and their liberties are threatened. It is no light matter to go to jail, even for conscience' sake, and have your business broken up and your family made wretched. If you think it is, come to Dayton and try it.

We are supposed to be living in an intelligent and Christian age, and yet we do some of the most absurd things. We let our livery stables, our furnaces, our railroads, our barber shops and numerous other forms of industry run wide open on Sunday, and yet if an Adventist is found carrying a few boards across a lot or digging a well or pulling fodder, we arrest him for disturbing the ethics of the public; and although we know he is a good man and a model citizen, we fine him and imprison him and goad him and harass him just as if he were some wild beast threatening to break into and destroy society; and all the while we are doing it we acknowledge that it is somehow and somewhere wrong. But then, we say, it is the law and the law must be obeyed; and a glow of satisfaction permeates our being at having discharged our duty, and we rub our hands and say: "Poor people, we are sorry for them, but they shouldn't be so verdant as to follow God's command in preference to the law of the State;" and the devil grins and the old Spanish Inquisitors smile amid their torments and recount the good old days of the Middle Ages, when the shrieks of agony from tortured Christians were sweet music in their ears.

The statutory law of the State defines the prosecution of the common occupations of life on Sunday as a misdemeanor, triable before a justice of the peace and liable to a fine of a few dollars and costs. But through some hocus-pocus of the law the common law of nuisance has been applied to these cases, and they are thus thrown into the Circuit Court and given an infinitely involved punishment. Just think of it. Making honest toil and honorable industry a nuisance. What a travesty on the spirit of jurisprudence! O, for a spirit of broad and liberal interpretation, that would set at naught bad precedents and establish a landmark of common sense and justice. A nuisance to whom? Has one individual rights over another in matters of freedom of conscience and action that do not violate well-established custom, propriety and good taste? A nuisance instinctively puts one in mind of something repugnant to good taste, obnoxious to the morals, shocking to the sensibilities, injurious to the well-being of society.

We might say much more but space forbids. We ask the reader to think over this matter as something that vitally interests him, and hope that he will array his influence in favor of the broadest possible amount of spiritual and secular liberty consistent with good citizenship and the best interests of society.
