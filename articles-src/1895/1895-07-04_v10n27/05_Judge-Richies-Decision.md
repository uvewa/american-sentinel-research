## JUDGE RICHIE'S DECISION.

The defendants are presented on warrants drawn under Section 1,303, of the Kentucky Statutes, and charged with "keeping open a bar-room for the sale of spirituous, vinous and malt liquors on Sunday." To these warrants a general and special demurrer have been interposed, and upon these demurrers the cases are submitted.

The special demurrer raises the question of jurisdiction. The Criminal Code at Section 13, Subsection 5, provides: "Justices shall have concurrent jurisdiction with the Circuit Courts in the prosecution of offenses, the punishment of which is limited to a fine not exceeding $100."

Subsection 6, of the section aforesaid, declares that "Judges of the County Courts shall have the same original criminal jurisdiction as Justices' Courts."

The misdemeanors with which the defendants are charged are punished by fines of not less than $10 nor more than $50. Clearly then, these offenses are within the jurisdiction of a justice of the peace, and therefore within the jurisdiction of this court. It follows then that the special demurrer to the jurisdiction of this court must be overruled. The general demurrer, conceding the technical sufficiency of the warrant under Section 1,303, questions the constitutionality of that section.

Prior to the adoption of the new constitution we had a general Sunday law, universal in its terms and uniform in its punishments. That law has been more than once considered by the Court of Appeals and always held to be constitutional, and if the law was the same now as then, and the constitution the same now as then, the constitutionality of this act would not be an open question in Kentucky. However, in enacting laws under the new constitution the legislature has seen fit to ingrati on what was the general Sunday law, Sections 1,303 and 1,322, and has also materially changed the intentions and language of the act, and it is now contended that Section 1,303, denouncing a heavier penalty upon persons selling liquor on Sunday than upon any other violator of the act is unconstitutional, because the same is special legislation. On the contrary, it is urged, with much research and learning by the learned assistant county attorney that this section is no part of the Sunday law, but is a part of the liquor law of the State. I can not, however, concur in this view. The mere position in the statute books is immaterial. That the purpose of this act was to compel the observance of the Christian Sabbath by all persons who did not observe some other day of the seven, is, I think, evidenced alike by this prosecution and the construction always given to this act.

That it was intended to operate more severely upon the vender of ardent spirits is demonstrated by the increased penalty.

Section 59 of the constitution of 1880 provides: "No special law shall be passed to regulate the punishment of crimes and misdemeanors," and "in all cases where a general law can be made applicable, no special law shall be enacted."

The Kentucky authorities cited by learned counsel for the prosecution consider alone the general Sunday law existing prior to 1880, the constitutionality of which could not be questioned either upon principle or authority. But the Kentucky Court of Appeals has never construed Section 1,303 of the present statutes at all, nor has it ever construed any Sunday law in the light of the Bill of Rights as amended. I am of the opinion that both under the constitution of 1849 and the constitution of 1890 this section is void as special legislation discriminating against one class of citizens.

That one general law, applicable to all persons, can be made, is demonstrated by the fact that upon our statute books from 1891 to 1880 we had just such a law, but the legislature, by discriminating against one class of citizens, under the act and seeking to exempt certain other classes from the operation of the act, have cast a cloud over the whole law. I am of the opinion that Section 1,303 is violative of Section 59 of the new constitution, and is void. It follows, therefore, that the general demurrer to the three warrants must be sustained and the defendants discharged.

Neither of these defendants is arraigned under Section 1,321, but together with the learned Circuit Judge, I am asked to express my opinion as to its constitutionality. It is not involved in this case, but as counsel with great labor and patience have presented the matter, we have consented to state our views.

General Sunday laws are upheld by the courts as legitimately within the purview of the police power of a State, and not because of any religious idea that they represent. But not even the police power can discriminate. It must apply with equal force to all. The Sunday law, as it existed from 1801 to 1880, applied to all persons and forbade labor on Sunday, except the ordinary household offices and works of necessity and charity, but did not apply to any person who is a member of a religious society who observed any other day of the seven as a Sabbath. The recent revision of our laws, however, undertakes to compel from the operation of this act persons who labor in the maintenance or operation of a ferry, skiff, steamboat or steam or street railway. The statute is silent as to the reason for these exceptions. It is urged that the legislature has construed these to be works of necessity, but it is not the work of the legislature to construe the law; that is the duty of the courts. Counsel for the prosecution concede great trouble at this point, but attempt to meet the objection by arguing that the exceptions are void and not the law. But this is not reconcilable with the usual canons of construction. The Court of Appeals within a month past has held that the operation of an excursion train on Sunday is a labor of necessity, and that the employés and railroad are not punishable under this act. Here, then, is a statute applicable to all persons except wharfmen, steamboatmen, railroaders, ferrymen, and men who may operate skiffs.

These men, notwithstanding their faith in the Christian Sabbath, may be compelled by their employés to work on that day without fear of punishment, while on the other hand a citizen, however sincere his faith and devout his observance of some other day of the seven than Sunday, yet if he be not a member of some religious society, is not exempt from the operation of the act. If this law is to be enforced as a humanitarian measure, bringing to the tired laborer a needed surcease from toil, why except from its benign operation the five classes above referred to, than whom none work more assiduously? It is at this point that the "rest-from-labor" argument fails, and the statute stands upon the religious idea alone. The Act of 1801 was on principle and authority constitutional. With its ingrafted exceptions, I am of the opinion that it is unconstitutional, both because it comes within the inhibitions of the new constitution against special legislation, and because it is a religious statute, violative of Article 5 of the Bill of Rights.

I do not hold that a general Sunday law may not be passed in accordance with the new constitution. On the contrary, I am of the opinion that such a law could be passed, but I am forced to the conclusion that Sections 1,303, 1,321 and 1,322 are each and all out of harmony with the provisions of the organic law, and, therefore, void.

This section of the constitution is unique in its provisions that "the civil rights, privileges, and capacities of no person shall be taken away or in any wise diminished or enlarged on account of his belief or disbelief of any religious tenet, dogma or teaching."

This recognition and protection of the disbeliever as well as the believer I find in no other published constitution. Any punishment for non-observance of a "religious day" is violative of this section.

CHARLES S. RICHIE, Judge.
