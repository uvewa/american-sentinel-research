## AN OPEN LETTER TO JUDGE JANES.

JUDGE JANES.—Dear Sir: As a citizen of Georgia, and a lover of justice and right, I address these lines to you, inspired by the facts of the trial and conviction of Mr. J. Q. Allison, at the court house in Doughaville, May 15.

I have always supposed that laws and courts were instituted for the sole purpose of administering justice and equity between citizens, and to protect individuals in the enjoyment of their inalienable or God-given rights against all invaders. But according to your ruling and that of judges in other States, law seems to be a travesty on justice, because the States and courts themselves become the invaders and criminals against the inalienable rights of individuals. Now, Mr. Janes, I want to know where the State and the courts get the right to invade a man's home and drag him up before a court and extort from him his property, or deprive him of his liberty when he has done no wrong to any one? Is this your highest idea of justice? You admitted what his neighbors said about him, that is, he was a good man, but you must make an example of him so as to deter bad men from committing such a crime against the State and humanity! Is this your highest idea of justice? Is it any less a crime for the State to deprive an individual of his property, liberty, or life, without just cause, than it is for an individual to do it? Did legality make it right to hang Quakers on Boston Common, or to burn heretics in England or Spain? You are versed in the science of law, and a judge, and ought to be able to answer these questions.

Again, does legality transform a wrong into a right? It would seem that you think so, judging from your decision. Your talk to Mr. Allison savored strongly of the character of a certain judge that figured in the interest of King James II. in 1683. You say substantially: "We will, in consideration of your being a good man, let you off by paying costs, or twelve months in the chain-gang; but if you come up here again we will put you where you won't get out of the State for a long time." Again I ask, is this your highest idea of justice and right?

Now, Judge Janes, you have made an example of this good man, Mr. Allison, in order to deter bad men from committing the heinous crime of working on Sunday. Now let me tell you that there is but a few of the good citizens in the State of Georgia who do not violate that Sunday law, every week in the year, and you by that decision have given to every bad man in the State the opportunity to drag any of these good citizens up before you, or some other judge, where they may be deprived of their property, or liberty. Is this the highest idea you can express for the good of humanity?

Then again, here are the cars thundering along right by the court house and churches, making more disturbance than all the Seventh-day Adventists in the State would working Sunday. Isn't this a violation of the Sunday law? The corporation can violate the law with impunity, but the good citizen, Mr. Allison, must be made an example so as to deter all bad men from violating this Sunday law. Your plea about civil law is on a par with the Jeffrey judges that hung Quakers on Boston Common and burned heretics in England, Holland, and Spain. They were good men, but the civil law must be carried out to the letter—that was the oath of these judges.

This case is not the first legal crime that has been committed in the Douglasville court house; it is not the first time that good men have been punished legally, when they had done no wrong to any person; but the law must be carried out even if it grinds good citizens to powder, because this is your oath.

Now Judge Janes, you should keep in mind that you, the same as all the rest of mankind, must, some time in the future, stand up in a court and render an account for all acts done in the past. Your plea of civil law, and of your oath that compels you to injure one in person or property who has committed no crime nor injured anyone (there was no evidence that Mr. Allison had injured anyone in person or property) won't amount to much in a court where eternal justice is to be done. You will find, sir, in that court it is no crime to work on Sunday, and all legislators and lawyers in the world cannot make it a crime either. You will find, sir, that you are the criminal in this Allison case. He had done nothing wrong to anyone. No human enactment can ever abrogate the eternal principle of justice. You, sir, injured him without any just cause, and you may some time in the future find yourself in a state, or condition, that you cannot get out of, until you have paid the last farthing. Chattel slavery was made legal, but the breath of eternal justice swept it away with a vengeance. Deo postulo justitia et rectus ad omnis.

A. M. RICHARDSON.
