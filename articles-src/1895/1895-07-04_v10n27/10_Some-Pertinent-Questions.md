## SOME PERTINENT QUESTIONS.

A young man sends us the following from Atlanta, Ga., and asks for it a place in our columns:—

Why is it that the law of Mississippi and the law of Georgia can punish a man for hoeing in his field on Sunday, and does not punish men for running a railroad engine or street car, or for driving a horse? Is not this all work? and are not those who do it breaking the commandments of God, and will they not be punished for it? If the law punishes a man for hoeing his garden, why not punish him for working at anything else? Jesus Christ said, if an ox fall into the ditch on Sunday, to help him out, but is an engine helping an ox out of a ditch? Is a motor man helping an ox out of a ditch? Is a man that takes a pleasure ride on Sunday afternoon helping an ox out of a ditch?

Now, if the code of Georgia or Mississippi or of any other State is going to punish one man for work of one kind, why not punish all other men for all other kinds of work?

Please read Exodus 30:8-11: "Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy. Six days abalt thou labor, and do all thy work: but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy mannervant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates: for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day, and hallowed it."

The writer of the foregoing seems to think that Sunday is the Sabbath, and that the fourth commandment applies to that day. A little investigation will, we think, satisfy him that such is not the case; that Sunday is not the Sabbath, and that not only does the fourth commandment have no reference to it except as one of "the six working days," but that there is absolutely no scriptural authority for Sunday observance. However, compulsory Sunday observance would be no better if that day were the true Sabbath instead of a mere counterfeit.
