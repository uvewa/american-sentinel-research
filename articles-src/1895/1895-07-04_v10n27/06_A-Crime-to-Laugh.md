## A CRIME TO LAUGH.

[From London Quora.]

The introduction of the Sunday bill by Lord Hobhouse brings us the fact that we are governed in respect to Sunday observations by an act of the year 1781.

It seems that a Sunday lecture can always be made the subject of prosecution. Some time ago a Sunday lecturer at Leeds was actually sacrilegious enough to make his audience laugh. The proprietor of the lecture hall was thereupon prosecuted for keeping a disorderly house.

Music can now be given in the open air on Sunday, but if it is given in a room nothing must be charged for chairs. In other words, it will be possible for any body of men and women to run Sunday concerts and Sunday lectures with the view of making them pay expenses, but not for their own profit.

In the years 1200 and 1201 one Enatace, about of Flare, preached throughout England the observance of the Lord's day. He enjoined that no kind of work should be done after the ninth hour on Saturday until sunrise on Monday.

According to the manner of the times his preaching was backed up by miracles. At Beverly a carpenter persisting in finishing a wedge after the ninth hour fell down in paralysis. In the same town a woman went on with her weaving after the ninth hour. Result, paralysis, with loss of voice.

At flafferion a man made a loaf and baked it on Saturday evening. When he broke it on Sunday morning, blood started from it. At Wakefield a meller, grinding after hours, ground out blood instead of flour.

In Lincolnshire a woman made a loaf and put it in the oven. It remained dough! In the same county a pious woman, finding it was the ninth hour, set aside her leaves. Lol' on Sunday morning the loaves were beautifully baked without any fire at all.

And yet, the chronicler adds, in spite of these miracles the people have returned to the holding of markets on the Sunday!
