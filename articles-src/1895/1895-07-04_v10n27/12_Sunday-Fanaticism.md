## Sunday Fanatic sm.

[From the American Israelite, Cincinnati, April 22.]

Nothing is ever settled in this country until it is settled right. These wise words of the immortal Lincoln are of great comfort to all patriots. Settled right undoubtedly means in accordance with justice, with reason, with common sense. Therefore it is to be hoped that at no distant day the so-called Sunday question will be settled right. In the meantime there will be much persecution, much folly and much suffering. The innocent will suffer with the guilty; the clergy will prove unworthy of the cloth, and the holier-than-thou man will strut abroad so wrapt in the mantle of narrowmindedness and shortsightedness as to be unable to perceive the signs of the times.

In Tennessee there is a law which forbids "doing or exercising any of the common vocations of life on the Lord's day, commonly called the Sabbath." The courts of that State have construed the law to mean that no work may be done on Sunday. Recently one, Wm. S. Burchard, was convicted and sentenced to jail because he had pulled fodder (that is, stripping the blades off the standing corn), out of sight of the public road or any public place, on Sunday, and because he had dug a well on Sunday.

It is impossible to find language adequate enough to condemn and ridicule such a proceeding. Such procedure is a disgrace to Tennessee and to the country at large; and one marvels that the law has not been repealed.

In the Nashville American of April 14, Mr. Wm. P. Tolley, one of the most zealous opponents of the iniquitous law, published an eloquent petition which was presented to the General Assembly of Tennessee for the repeal of the law. It is hoped that the petition will be favorably acted upon.*

In Cincinnati the agitation for the strict enforcement of the Sunday law is renewed again. Charges were recently preferred against a lieutenant of police because he refused to stop a baseball game, etc.

What the outcome will be it is impossible to say. But this much is true, to wit: that the attendance at church will not be affected one way or the other. Those who wish to attend services will go irrespective of Sunday opening or Sunday closing.

*So far was the Tennessee Legislature from favorable action on this petition, that a proposition merely to amend the law was defeated by a vote of 20 to 64.—Eds. Skerroys.

The trouble with the Sunday fanatics, as with all fanatics, lies in this, that they refuse to study the question historically. The Literary Digest, in an article, "How Primitive Christians Observed Sunday," says: "A growing discussion on the proper character of Sabbath observance seems to be one of the features of recent magazine and newspaper literature. The Sunday question is always a live one, not only in theological but in political circles as well, and a contribution recently made to it by Prof. Zahn, of the University of Erlangen, Bavaria, is one of importance. Prof. Zahn is accounted the leading conservative specialist in Germany in the department of early Christian research, his only rival, Harnack, being classed among the Liberals. Zahn's conclusions will not, however, bring strength to the Sabbatarian side of the controversy, as he holds that there is nothing in the earliest Christian literature to support the views of the Sabbatarians. The results of his research are set forth in the sixth of a series of historical studies published together under the title, 'Skizzen aus dem Leben der alten Kirche' (Sketches from the Life of the Primitive Church)."

He speaks of the differences between the early Christians of the St. James type and those of the Pauline type in matters of Jewish ceremonies, but says that they were a unit in regarding the Lord's day as entirely distinct from the Jewish Sabbath. Sometimes both days were observed, "but the Christians of the first three centuries," he says, citing Justin Martyr also in proof, "never thought of regarding the Sunday as the continuation of the Jewish Sabbath, or even to call this day 'Sabbath'"—the Day of the Lord, referring to Christ, being the name uniformly used. Prof. Zahn then continues as follows:—

"If we ask the Christians of the earliest centuries, the oldest witnesses as to the idea of Sunday, for the reason which they had in marking this one day above all the rest, they will with one voice declare, 'We celebrate this day because Christ on this day arose from the dead.' The Sunday was for them a weekly recurrence of the Easter festival. Throughout Sunday was regarded as a day of joy. While the Christians were accustomed on other days to pray kneeling, the resurrection of Christ of which this day was the memorial, gave them courage to stand upright on their feet before their God, and to forget their unworthiness, which has been buried by Christ in death, the memory of which has been celebrated on the preceding days on the knees. On Sunday the early Christians prayed standing. Already at a very early day the custom of celebrating Wednesday and Friday in addition to Sunday had been introduced into the church, and this brought out all the more sharply the characteristic idea of the Sunday worship. Those other days were days of fasting and humiliation; Sunday was a day of joyful and glad worship. On this day only did the services culminate in the memorial feast of the Saviour, the last supper, which belonged exclusively to the 'Day of the Lord.' To fast on Sunday was regarded as unseemly, and later even as a sin. And even apart from the services the Sunday was regarded as a day of rejoicing. Even the rigorous Tertullian, at the close of the second century, again and again emphasizes this.

"That on this day the ordinary business and work of life were laid aside as much as possible, was regarded as a matter of course; but it is characteristic of the original character of Sunday observance that in the oldest Christian literature there is practically not a word about this matter. The negative idea of rest from daily labor did not act as a prime factor in the conception of proper observance of this day. Christians are indeed rebuked for allowing their business to keep them away from the services; but not Sunday work itself but the overestimation of worldly work and indifference therein shown to God's Word and services, is pronounced as a grievous sin. Even as late as the fourth century, when writers warn against the celebration of the (Jewish) Sabbath by abstaining from work, a similar demand is not made as conditional for the Sunday.

"We see that this original conception of Sunday observance departs widely from that idea which zealous friends of Sunday observance are apt to emphasize in our day. It has not been my purpose to present a theory of the Sunday or to oppose false ideas. But history is a great teacher, and by repeating what she teaches, erroneous views of themselves fall to the ground."

Hence it would seem that Sunday, as has always been contended by the Jewish authorities and the Adventists and the like, is not a divine institution, but one merely established by man.
