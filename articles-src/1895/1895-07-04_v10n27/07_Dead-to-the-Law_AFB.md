"DEAD TO THE LAW."

BY J. F. BALLENGER.

Among the opposers of the Seventh-day Sabbath, those who are the most desperate in their efforts to get rid of the fourth commandment, seize upon the expression in Rom. 7:4: "Ye also are become dead to the law," and a few other similar expressions, to prove that the law enforcing the seventh day is dead, and therefore all are released from its observance. I freely admit that if the Sabbath command is dead, no person is under any obligation to keep it. But the reader will notice that the apostle is talking about the law as a whole; hence, if one command is dead, then all are dead, and, consequently, no one is required to obey any one of the ten commandments.

But let us examine the character of the law. In verse 7, Paul says, "Is the law sin? God forbid." If it is not sin it must be righteousness. Surely, there could be no call for the abolition of a righteous law; and in verse 12, he says, "Wherefore the law (as a whole) is holy, and the commandment (the tenth commandment which slew the apostle, see verse 7) holy, and just, and good;" and in verse 14, he says, "For we know that the law is spiritual; but I am carnal, sold under sin." Reader, can you see any reason why a law that is righteous, holy, just, good and spiritual, should be slain? Further, if the law was abolished because it bore the above characteristics, then it was abrogated in order to legalize the opposites,—unrighteousness, unholiness, injustice, evil and carnality.

How any person outside the realm of darkness could ever argue for a moment that the law of Romans 7 could ever have been killed is a mystery only explained in the light of such texts as Matt. 6:23: "If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is that darkness?"

How, then, shall we understand the expression, "dead to the law"? The reader will notice that the apostle adds, "Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ." Then it is through the death of Christ our substitute that we become dead to the law. When the Saviour's body was slain on the cross it was to make satisfaction to the divine law; and every child of Adam was included in that sacrifice. "Christ died for the ungodly" (Rom. 5:6). He gave his flesh for "the life of the world" (John 6:51). "He is the propitiation (or satisfaction) . . . for the sins of the whole world" (1 John 3:2). So that when Christ "bare our sins in his own body on the tree" (1 Peter 2:24), every sinner was included in that death.

Herein is seen the grace or favor of God which bringeth salvation, that hath appeared to all men (Titus 2:11). But all men will not accept the favor of God; many of them may change the truth of God into a lie, and worship the creature more than the Creator (Rom. 1:25); or they may turn the grace of God into lasciviousness, denying the only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ (Jude 4). Yet, notwithstanding all their sins and unbelief, no person will ever die a natural death or the death entailed by the sin of Adam as a penalty for the violation of the divine law.

The penalty is inflicted in the "second death," and as this death cannot hurt the believer who has overcome through faith in the death of Christ (Rev. 2:11), therefore no one who is "dead with Christ" will ever suffer the penalty of the law. He has already done this in the person of Christ, his substitute. Christ was made sin for us, "made under the law." The law had dominion over him and demanded his life; and when he died "the just for the unjust," we died in him; as he died to the law, so we being in him are dead to the law by virtue of his death; and as he was raised to life freed from the condemnation of the law, so we by faith are raised with him to live a spiritual life, free from the condemnation of the law. The carnal mind, which is not subject to the law (Rom. 8:7), is taken away, and in its place the Spirit of God writes the law in the heart (Jer. 31:33; Heb. 8:10), and as the law is spiritual, therefore the believer walks in the Spirit and not in the flesh. The law witnesses to his righteousness (Rom. 3:21), and is established by his faith (verse 31). He delights in the law after the inward man (chap. 7:22). His experience is: "O how love I the law! it is my meditation all the day" (Ps. 119:97). He calls the Sabbath a delight: the holy of the Lord, and honors God in keeping it (Isa. 58:13).
