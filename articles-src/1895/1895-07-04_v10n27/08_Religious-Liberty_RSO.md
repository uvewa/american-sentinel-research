## RELIGIOUS LIBERTY.

[R. S. Owen, in Atlanta Constitution, June 8.]

Editor Constitution: Having read your reply to the New Orleans Times-Democrat on the "Georgia Sunday laws," I beg to present through your columns a plea in behalf of religious liberty. There are principles involved in this question which I believe should be more clearly understood, principles upon which are based the dearest rights of every American citizen—the limit of civil authority and the right of every man to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience.

An honest, conscientious Christian has been sentenced to twelve months in the chain-gang in this State with the possibility of his being put to death for refusing to violate his conscience by working in that chain-gang on the seventh day of the week, and it is no fault of the law that this extreme penalty has not been inflicted. Had it not been that some unknown friend had paid Mr. Allison's fine, he would have now been toiling in the chain-gang, or, perhaps had forfeited his life rather than be disloyal to his God.

For what dark deed was he made subject to such an ordeal? He had defrauded no one, he had harmed no one, he had molested no one, no other man's rights had been invaded in the slightest degree. This he proposed to prove during his trial, but the court informed him that molesting others had nothing to do with his case. His only offense was that he had not practiced the religion of his neighbors. He had not observed the first day of the week as the Sabbath, after keeping the seventh day which he believed God required him to observe.

We shall not here discuss the question of which day is the Sabbath—that is a point on which many men differ, and every man has a right to his own opinion. But what we wish to call attention to is the injustice of the law that decides a religious question and then provides that such hardships may be inflicted upon those who differ from that decision in faith and practice. We have been wont to boast of the religious freedom which is guaranteed to all the inhabitants of this fair land. We have looked with horror upon the religious intolerances of some of the governments of the Old World under which Christians have suffered in past ages such cruel persecutions, because they differed from the prevailing sentiment of those times. We have thanked God that the founders of our Republic, seeing the evils of religious legislation, sought to place in the Constitution a safeguard against it in the following: "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof." We have taken pride in the noble sentiment expressed in the constitution of the State of Georgia—"Perfect freedom of religious sentiment shall be and the same is hereby secured, and no inhabitant of this State shall ever be molested in person or property or prohibited from holding any office or trust on account of his religious opinion." The only limit to this freedom is that "the liberty of conscience hereby secured shall not be so construed as to excuse acts of licentiousness or justify practices inconsistent with the peace and safety of the people."

And now, in the face of all the advancement that has been made in this land of liberty, to behold an honest, inoffensive Christian man sentenced to the chain-gang to toil with common criminals for twelve long, weary months, for no other offense than that of exercising his God-given right to the convictions of his own conscience in regard to a religious observance, brings a shock to our sensibilities and seems to us like a dark blot on the last decade of the nineteenth century and a stain of reproach on the fair fame of the New South.

That Sabbath-keeping is a religious observance is evident not only from the testimony of Scripture and the ministers of all religious sects; but the law of Georgia itself recognizes it as such in declaring it to be the Lord's day. The Lord himself instituted the Sabbath, and calls it a sign between him and his people. Those who observe the seventh day keep it as a memorial of the creation of the world, while those who regard the first day as the Sabbath keep it in commemoration of the resurrection of Christ, so that in either case the Sabbath is as truly a religious memorial day as the Lord's supper and baptism are religious memorials. If the State may decide one religious question, why may it not decide all? And if it may enforce one religious institution, why may it not on the same principle enforce all? These questions have been answered by the United States Senate, in replying to a request for a Sunday law. The committee said, "If a solemn act of legislation shall in one point define the law of God or point out to the citizens one religious duty, it may, with equal propriety, proceed to define every part of divine revelation and enforce every religious obligation." (American State Papers, page 111.) So if this course of religious legislation were pursued to its logical end, we should have a revival of the terrible scenes of the Dark Ages, and our Government would be turned into an engine of persecution as truly as was Rome in the days of Nero.

If we would avoid the worst results in the line of religious persecution, let us beware of the first steps in that direction. Massachusetts once required all parents to have their children sprinkled. The Baptists, who did not believe in sprinkling as the proper mode of baptism, refused to practice contrary to their faith, and were punished for violating the law. John Painter, of those days, was whipped, and like Mr. Allison of to-day, his only offense was that he refused to conform to a religious service which he believed to be contrary to the will of God. The experiences of the Baptist people, in suffering for their faith, lead them to appreciate the situation when other Christians are brought under similar circumstances.

At the sixty-third anniversary of the American Baptist Home Mission Society, held at Saratoga, N. Y., June 1, 1895, the following resolution was unanimously adopted:—

"WHEREAS, It has been widely reported that in some portions of the United States, professing Christians who have conscientiously observed the seventh day of the week as a day of religious rest and worship, and who thereafter on the first day of the week have conscientiously engaged in labor which in no wise disturbed their fellow-citizens who desire to observe the first day, have, for this act, been arrested and fined and imprisoned and sent to the chain-gang; therefore,

"Resolved, That (assuming the facts to be as reported) we earnestly and solemnly protest against this violation of the right of religious liberty, a right for which our fathers suffered imprisonment, the spoiling of their goods, stripes, exile and death itself."
