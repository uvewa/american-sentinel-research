[Jewish Spectator, Nov. 22, 1895.]

The God-in-the-Constitution party is at work again to foist upon the people of the United States declarations which, in their tendencies, are fraught with danger to religious liberty. The following appeared last week as a news item in the columns of the secular press:—

PITTSBURG, PA., Nov. 14.—Hon. Felix R. Brunot, president of the National Reform Association, has issued a call for a meeting of that body in the North Avenue Baptist Church, Baltimore, December 15th and 13th. The object of the convention, as announced, will be to "consider the vital issues of the hour, to promote all wise measures of reform, and to seek such an ammendment to the Constitution of the United States as will suitably acknowledge God, the authority of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the supremacy of his law over the nation." All Christian Churches, societies of Christian Endeavor, and other young people's unions, Women's Christian Temperance Unions, and all such kindred organizations, are invited to send delegates to the convention.

Put into plain language, this means that the State cannot, without self-destruction, separate itself from the church and from its theology, but on the contrary absolutely depends upon it. This movement, labeled "reform" (sic), is therefore a protest against the Constitution of the United States, which is built on a secular view of government, and resolves itself into a most dangerous invasion of religious liberty, guaranteed to all citizens by that Constitution. Some people, and among them many Israelites, suppose that there is not the slightest danger in an attempt like that, and believe that only a small number of cranks participate in that movement. This indulgence in a feeling of security is a most serious mistake. A few years ago a petition to Congress for the same purpose as indicated in the lines above, had one million and a half signatures attached to it. So absorbed are most men in the thoughts familiar to them that they are unable to understand the workings of other men's minds. It does not follow because we Israelites and other liberal and patriotic men are unanimous in favoring the complete separation of Church and State, that there are not thousands of men and women who believe most sincerely that it is a most patriotic sentiment to have God and Jesus Christ recognized in the Constitution of the United States.
