WHEN Christ was before Pilate he said, "My kingdom is not of this world; if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews; but now is my kingdom not from hence." John 18:36. Christ did not refrain from fighting because his following was too small to cope with the Roman government, because each one of his loyal disciples, together with himself could have had a legion of angels at his back. Matt. 26:53. But his kingdom was not of this world, and could not use earthly power. The using of force would have been his ruin, for he himself said, "They that take the sword, shall perish with the sword."

There was a time when the disciples and all the people were going to take Jesus by force to make him king, and if he had consented the whole Jewish nation would have flocked to his standard; but he would not listen to the proposition. Surely if the kingdom of Christ could be advanced by civil power, then was the time to make use of it. The fact that Christ would have nothing to do with it, shows what he expects of his followers. By allowing himself to be betrayed into the hands of wicked men, and suffering the cruel death of the cross, Christ showed how only his kingdom can be gained and advanced. Because of the suffering of death, he was crowned with glory and honor. Let none of the professed servants of Christ think to gain the kingdom in a different manner. To make such an attempt is to deny Christ, and to make his sufferings of no account.

Men have nothing to do with giving Christ his kingdom. All they are called upon to do is to yield themselves to the Holy Spirit, that they may be fashioned into fit subjects for the kingdom which the Lord God will give unto him. True, "the government shall be upon his shoulder," but it is "the zeal of the Lord of hosts" that is to give it to him. Isa. 9:6, 7. The Father has sworn to give unto him the heathen for his inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for a possession (Ps. 2:7, 8); but when he receives them it is that he may dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel. But he will do it in person, and not by deputy.

Christ himself showed how and when he was to receive his kingdom. He spoke a parable for the benefit of those who thought that the kingdom of God should immediately appear. He likened himself to a nobleman who "went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom and to return." "And it came to pass that when he was returned, having received the kingdom," etc. Luke 19:11-27. Christ has now gone to that far country to receive the kingdom. The receiving of it is described in Dan. 7:13, 14. When he comes the second time, he will come in his kingdom. Then he will be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels, in flaming fire, taking vengeance upon them that know not God. 2 Thess. 1:7-9. Then will those that would not have him to rule over them be slain before him,—"punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power." And when he shall have destroyed all the wicked, "then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father." Matt. 13:43. "Who hath ears to hear, let him hear."

Christ is now sitting upon his Father's throne (Rev. 3:21), reigning as a priest, and devising peace for his people. Zech. 6:12, 13. He is the "one Mediator between God and men." 1 Tim. 2:5. He is Mediator between God and men, not between God and nations. Moreover his authority as Mediator is not that of compulsion, but that of love and entreaty. "Behold, I stand at the door and knock; if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me." Rev. 3:20.
