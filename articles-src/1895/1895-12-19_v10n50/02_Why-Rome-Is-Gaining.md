"Protestantism," as it arose in the sixteenth century to combat the papacy, was based on the Word of God. It was not a new thing, but a reassertion of the eternal truths of that Word, which had become largely obscured by the rubbish of papal tradition. For centuries thereafter, "Protestantism" meant an adherence to the inspired Word as the only rule of religious belief and conduct. But today all this is changed; and the evidence of it appears in language like the following, from the *Pilot* (Boston), of Dec. 7:—

It has been said by an observant writer that soon the Catholics will be the only Bible Christians in the world, so greatly has reverence for the sacred books fallen off among that large contingent, who following no special creed, still claim the Protestant name. The "Women's Bible," in the general indifference with which its sacrilegious attacks on the inspired writings have been received, where erstwhile they would have evoked a storm of righteous indignation, moves the Western Watchman to similar expression. Says our e. c.: "The Bible will soon be sent back to Rome whence it went forth to the modern world and in future it will be classed as a popish book and combatted as containing only Romish superstition from Genesis to Revelation. It was a fetish, a divinity, 300 years ago, it now lies broken, like another Dagon, at the feet of modern Protestant enlightenment. Mrs. Stanton can kick it, . . . and there is none to say nay."

Is it any wonder that Rome is gaining, and that papal principles are reasserting themselves even in this boasted land of freedom? It was God's Word that first laid down the principle, "Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's." Matt. 22:21. That Word it is which inculcates most plainly and powerfully the lessons of love, gentleness, kindness and honor to all men. That Word it is which contains the "Golden Rule," which, if practiced by mankind, would bring a golden age. God, the author of liberty, is the great Teacher of the principles upon which it rests. Truthfully has the historian, Bancroft, said:—

No one thought of vindicating religion for the conscience of the individual until a voice in Judea, breaking day for the greatest epoch in the life of humanity by establishing a pure, spiritual, and universal religion for all mankind, enjoined to render to Caesar only that which is Caesar's.

And now that Word is neglected; its principles are becoming obscured; the "Protestant" world is calling for religious legislation, and Rome is triumphing.
