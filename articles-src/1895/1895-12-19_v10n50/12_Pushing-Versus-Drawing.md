THERE are self-styled reformers in these days of intense aggressiveness who think that the loving, drawing method of our Lord and his early disciples is obsolete. Christianity must keep up with the spirit of the age. We, too, must push things. Their idea is to get up the best machinery that they can, put plenty of power behind it, and then go ahead. They would crush opposition instead of trying to win and save the opposers. Such efforts may seem to succeed for a time. But true Gospel progress means hearts won to Christ, and you cannot win hearts by pushing.

When we read of pushing in the Bible it is only in the case of vicious beasts with horns, or of men who are like them. See Ex. 21:29; 1 Kings 22:11; and Dan. 8:3. There is no case where it speaks of pushing in any great and good enterprise. It never represents God or his prophets and apostles as pushing. On the contrary the Bride in Canticles cries: "Draw me; we will run after thee." And our Saviour said: "If I be lifted up from the earth, I will draw all men unto me." John 12:32. The prophets were inspired to cry: "Come;" Jesus himself said: "Come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden," and on the last page of the Bible we read: "The Spirit and the Bride say, Come." When the Good Shepherd putteth forth his own sheep he does not drive them but "goeth before them," and they follow. The whole spirit of the gospel is attraction. Coercion is the distinctive characteristic of false religions, of corrupt Christianity. The true disciples of Christ never persecute; they are not wont to push with their horns like the ox in Ex. 21:29. Like their divine Master, they are meek and patient. They do not strive, but are gentle unto all men. See 2 Tim. 2:24.
