[By Addison Blakely, Ph. D., Lecturer in Political Science and History, University of Chicago.]

The social compact is a fact, not a theory. The political state is a condition, not an idea. Government is a reality, not an abstraction. Whence, then, their origin? There can be no settled condition among rational men unless there exist certain understandings between them. For instance: no man, much less any considerable body of men, will quietly submit to insult, injury, and death without remonstrance. None there are who will give up all that is desirable in life, and quietly acquiesce.

What, then, is the necessary conclusion? That the present state of social peace is conclusive evidence that the people making up the State do understand, as between each other, that they will, as a result of the State, neither be insulted, injured, nor relinquish that which is most desirable in life. In other words, they "understand" that the State and Government is to be for the benefit of each and all, and that therefore they acquiesce in its purposes and work. And this "understanding" is what constitutes the "social compact."

"Although the old idea of a compact between the government and the people be justly exploded," says Madison in his writings, "the idea of a compact among those who are parties to a government is a fundamental principle of free government. The original compact is the one implied or presumed, but nowhere reduced to writing, by which a people agree to form one society. The next is a compact, here for the first time reduced to writing, by which the people in their social state agree to a government over them. These two compacts may be considered as blended in the Constitution of the United States, which recognizes a union or society of States, and makes it the basis of the government formed by the parties to it."

"It must not be forgotten that compact," Madison again says, "express or implied, is the vital principle of free governments, as contradistinguished from governments not free, and that a revolt against this principle leaves no choice but between anarchy and despotism." The Government of the United States, like all governments free in their principles, rests on compact; a compact, not between the government and the parties who formed it and live under it, but among the parties themselves; and the strongest of governments are those in which the compacts were most fairly formed and most faithfully executed."

The question then arises, What are the moral limitations of society? and, What are the legal limitations on government arising from this understanding or compact? Evidently, that such action shall be taken, and such action only, as will secure the carrying out of that which would induce individual—and thus general—acquiescence; or, in other words, individual desire generalized, or that which is wanted by each and all; which resolves itself into the term, "equal rights," or justice. Hence, to secure rights, to establish justice, governments are instituted among men.

Equal rights, though, forbid that any one should have any less legal right than any other one. Therefore, wrong to any is impossible. Hence the maxim, "The king [or State] can do no wrong." Government is forever legally prohibited from doing any injustice. Each one's rights, therefore, are entirely beyond interference on the part of the State. The liberties of none are curtailed by the advent of government, nor are one's rights in the least affected. To government is merely granted the authority before possessed in severalty of defending and protecting the rights which nature gives.

Madison states this specifically: "The sovereignty of the society, as vested in and exercisable by the majority, may do anything that could be rightfully done by the unanimous concurrence of the members; the reserved rights of individuals [conscience, for example], in becoming parties to the original compact being beyond the legitimate reach of sovereignty, wherever vested or however viewed."

By the social compact, then, the State is forever prohibited from interfering, not only with religious questions in general, but with the Sunday question in particular. If one individual, apart from government, has not the right to impose upon another the observance of a sabbath, by the formation of government, no such right can be delegated. Sunday legislation is, therefore, contrary not only to the Constitution, but is contrary to the foundation principles of society itself; and every new statute interfering with freedom in Sunday observance is merely another blow directed against the foundations of our political system. Empire after empire has fallen because of interference with the people's liberties, and no structure can stand when the foundations be destroyed.
