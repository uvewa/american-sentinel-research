Some recent work in this city in the line of Sunday "law" enforcement, called forth the following editorial comment from the *World*, of Dec. 10:—

On Sunday last three policemen in plain clothes discovered, as they believed, that a saloon keeper was selling beer in his saloon. He had a private door opening into his yard. They went to this door and found it locked. They knocked and the door was opened a few inches on the chain. They threw themselves against the door, broke the chain and forced their way in.

This was a clear case of burglary at common law. A policeman has no more right than any other citizen to break a lock, a door or a chain, or in any other way to force entrance to a house. To do so is to violate a right guaranteed to every citizen by the Constitution itself, as it has been guaranteed for ages by fundamental Anglo-Saxon law older than any written constitution.

The man who breaks even a thread by way of forcing entrance to premises not his own is guilty of burglary at common law. And as these men seized and drank beer for which they had not paid, thus committing robbery, they were guilty of burglary under the Penal Code, which makes any housebreaking with intent to commit crime, or any housebreaking followed by crime, a burglary.

What is it about this enforcement of Sunday observance that so bewilders judgment, perverts justice, and even leads officers of the law to become violators of the law? Is it not the fact that such enforcement is itself wrong, and without any foundation in reason? When by act of the legislature such a thing is exalted to the place of reason, and declared to be right and just, it is small wonder that perversion of judgment and of justice is the result.
