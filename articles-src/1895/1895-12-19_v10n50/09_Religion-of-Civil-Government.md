The following from the World (New York), of Dec. 2, illustrates the folly of State supervision and control of religious office:—

Washington, Dec. 1.—Eight men of God wrestled together Saturday for one of the therapists of Egypt and prolonged the contest far into the sabbath. The struggle over the chaplaincy of the House between the ministers who honger for honor and self was the only excitement of the Republican canons. The office is one of great dignity; it is a holy office, but it is also a salaried office at $900 a year. Therefore were dignity and holiness forgot and the scramble made so undignified as to excite the ridicule of the members of the House to whose souls the rival preachers sought to minister.

The candidates were Reva O. A. Brown, W. E. Parsons, W. H. Gottwald, C. B. Ramsdell, W. H. Brooks and J. D. Smith, of this city; H. D. Fisher, of Kansas, and H. U. Couden, of Michigan. Rev. Fisher and Rev. Couden based their claims on their war records, and one or two of the candidates based theirs on their color and the Republican obligations to the negro race. . . . Parson Couden, who proved successful, had sentiment as an ally, for he is blind, and his eyesight was lost in battle, and moreover he waved the ensign of the O. A. R. Parson Fisher had only one war cry: "I am the fighting parson of Kansas, and Jim Lane said in the Senate I saved his brigade by my gallantry." With these recommendations for the office of intercessor between offended heaven and a sinning Congress the battle began.

Long before the canons met last night the parsons were at work in the crowds which filled the House lobby and the committee rooms. They flitted in and out of the rooms, and were here, there and everywhere, and they buttenloiled without mercy. They were the sorry of the little politicians who had flocked to the Capitol to witness the election of men from whose hands they hope to receive the crumbs of patronage. The most active of all was Fisher. He justified his title of "the fighting parson of Kansas." He wore a heavy, soiled, and ancient ulster. The nap of his silk hat bore the marks of battle. His thin, brown face was seamed with age and want, but his eye glowed with the light of warfare from under bushy gray eyebrows. To everybody he was introduced with the old tale about Jim Lane's commendation, and as his gallantry was mentioned he would cast a sidelong glance downward and give a deprecatory assent to the recital. He had the advantage of being on the "combine" ticket, but as some of the Kansas men did not support the other combine candidates he knew that the strength of the coalition would not be his.

"But we know this," he said, "that we'll either lick or be licked," and then he would make a charge upon another foeman. Another very active parson, who was sleek, white necktied and clerical, soon found that he was not in the fight. He had scrambled with the best until then. When he realized his fate he recalled dignity and holiness and said sadly, "Oh, if I had only known what a disgraceful scramble it was to be I should never have become a candidate."

In the canons the friends of the candidates took up the scramble. It required three ballots to nominate. On the first two "the fighting parson" led. The second stood 109 for Fisher, 104 for Couden and 6 scattering. One more vote would elect Fisher, and Couden's men were frightened. It was then Sunday morning, but the commandments had no authority in this strife of parsons. The Couden men got up on desks. They howled and shouted. You could hear them cry, "Mr. Chairman!" through the thick, closed doors of the chamber. Through the door windows you could see men waving their hands over their heads to attract attention. The purpose was to force a third roll-call before any one could change to Fisher. They succeeded, and Couden was nominated.

Some one asked the fighting and licked parson why he wanted to make such a fight for a petty $900 place.

"If you had preached all your life out in Kansas for $700 a year you wouldn't ask," he replied mournfully.

Such scenes are only what could be expected to result from even a limited alliance between the State and religion.
