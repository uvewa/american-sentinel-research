We expected at the time of our last issue to be able to give this week an account of the trial of the four Seventh-day Adventists under indictment at Ridgetown, Ont., for working on Sunday. Only two cases however were tried at the time expected, Dec. 5. These were the cases of A. O. Burrill, the Adventist elder, and P. M. Howe. An Adventist who was present at the trial outlines the proceedings as follows:

There were four of our brethren arrested: Elder A. O. Burrill, brethren P. M. Howe and William Simpson, all laborers in the conference; and Thomas Griffith, one of the local citizens. The latter was charged with cutting wood, and the others with building on Sunday. The Epworth League and other Methodists were prosecutors. On the date mentioned, the cases of the two first-named were tried, and a conviction was secured in both cases. Elder Burrill was fined $20, or sixty days in jail, and Brother Howe $10, or forty days' imprisonment. They have ten days in which to pay the fine. The court room was crowded with those who sympathized with the prosecution, and the justice shared the prejudice with the crowd. He permitted loud cheering and demonstrations of joy each time the decision was averse to the defendants. The final verdict was received with boisterous approval.

But doubtless(?) all this was done not from any feeling of religious prejudice and animosity toward the convicted men, but only to show the necessity of Sunday rest from a hygienic standpoint; for the Sunday sabbath sanctioned by law is, we are told, merely a "civil" institution!
