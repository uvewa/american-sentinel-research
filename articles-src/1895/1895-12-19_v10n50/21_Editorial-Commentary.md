THE Christian Work, of Dec. 12, prints the following:

It isn't often one meets with such an involved sentence as appears in the editorial column of a valued western contemporary:

"If people work six days, they may do all their work, or, at least, as much work as they have strength to do if they would continue to have strength for any extended period."

The sentence was evidently evolved under the inspiration of the idea that Sunday rest by law is based upon physical necessity.

THE American Missionary Association at its recent session took occasion to refer to one manifestation of prevailing lawlessness in our land, by adopting a report "bearing testimony against that form of lawlessness which has become alarmingly prevalent in many sections of our country, by which mobs of infuriated men usurp the functions of judge and jury, and put to death, often with cruelty and torture, persons suspected of crime who have never been proved to be guilty, and who, in some cases, are undoubtedly innocent." "This deliverance," says the Christian Work, "frankly admitted that such crimes are not peculiar to any section of the country, and declared that 'some of the most flagrant outbreaks of this nature have recently occurred in Northern States'—all of which is true."

Individual lawlessness has its seat in the individual heart; and while human law may restrain its manifestations, the power of God alone can work a cure, by making the evil heart good. The work of the gospel is therefore of the utmost importance to the stability of government and the peaceful enjoyment of human rights. It is the Spirit of God that does most to hold earth's lawlessness in check. Then let the professed ministers of the gospel, as they see lawlessness increasing like a flood, redouble their efforts to induce men to yield their hearts to that Spirit, instead of spending their time and energies in calling for religious legislation; and let the government carefully withhold its hand from any interference with those engaged in gospel work, if it would not adopt a policy that is suicidal.

SENATOR HOLL'S recent telegram to President Cleveland shows how deeply the Armenian outrages are stirring the civilized world. The message was as follows:

To the President:

You may depend upon my support in the Senate, both by speech and vote, of the most vigorous action you may take to prevent further crusilities towards the Armenians in Turkey, even if you determine to treat the persons who commit them as pirates or common enemies of the human race.

GEORGE F. HOLL.

The evidences thicken on every hand that the fulfillment of Dan. 11:45 is an event of the near future; and it should not be forgotten that closely connected with the removal of the Turkish capital to Jerusalem are the events of the first verse of the twelfth chapter. The standing up of Michael (Christ) means the destruction of all earthly kingdoms to make way for the everlasting kingdom of God as indicated in Ps. 2:8, 9.

It is said that while religious legislation is not capable of reforming character, it can create a proper moral environment for the citizen, and should be had for this purpose. But when legislation has reached the limit of its utility as the protector of natural rights, it cannot upon any just or reasonable grounds be extended into the domain of morality. There are some glaring evils of our civic life,—the saloon for instance—which stand in the way of the enjoyment by all of "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness," and should therefore, as far as possible, be removed by law; not because they are immoral, but because they are inimical to human rights. Murder is immoral; but it is not dealt with by the law in consideration of the degree of immorality it represents, but as an act destructive of those natural rights which it is the purpose of government to protect.

Murder, theft, false witness, and adultery are forbidden by the Decalogue upon moral grounds, and will be dealt with by God in the Judgment as immoral acts; but human law can deal with them only as acts destructive of that civility necessary to the enjoyment of natural rights and the preservation of civil government.

The law against worshipping idols and the law against stealing stand in the Decalogue upon common ground; but only in the law of God can they thus stand. Human legislation cannot deal with morality, and therefore cannot be properly used to create a moral environment. But it can and should create an environment in which every citizen will be taught to respect the rights of his neighbors; and we would suggest to those calling for religious legislation that they secure this environment first, before attempting to create one which will foster morality. There is work enough for the State at present in producing the former.

When the State undertakes to produce an environment which, in addition to this, shall be a moral environment, it starts upon a task which it has neither the power, the wisdom, nor the authority to carry out, and which will only lead it into mazes of theological discussion and controversy, where justice as well as common sense will become lost, and bigotry and persecution be let free to do again their deadly work. If the men who are calling for a moral environment by force of human law would be as active in seeking to create it by the power of the gospel of which they are professed ministers, they would be working to infinitely better purpose.

If anyone doubts that this is a "Christian" nation, the following item of news from the Cincinnati Enquirer, of Nov. 27, ought to forever settle the question:

LAWRENCEBURG, Ky., Nov. 26.—Mr. John A. Fenton and Miss Carrie Samson, of Ripyville, were married yesterday. The bride is a charming young woman of 19 summers. This is her second matrimonial venture, and Mr. Fenton's third time. He is only 31 years old. The bride's first husband is still alive, as are also the groom's other two wives. Mr. Fenton's first and second wives have both been married and divorced since living with him. The third Mrs. Fenton's first husband has again married, and is now suing for divorce, only four months after his marriage.

Doubtless these "marriages" were all celebrated by professed ministers of Him who said: "Whosever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery: and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from her husband committeth adultery." And doubtless also these same ministers are to a man in favor of Sunday laws, because, forsooth, "we are a Christian people"!
