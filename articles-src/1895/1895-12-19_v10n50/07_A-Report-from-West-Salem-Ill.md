The Silver Creek Rustler, of Custer County, Col., reports and comments as follows upon a case of Sunday "law" persecution in Illinois:—

A merchant at West Salem, Ill., has been convicted in the District Court at Albion, of keeping his store open on Sunday, and fined for the same. He is an earnest and consistent member of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, who closes his business house on Saturday and opens it on Sunday. He is an American citizen who is supposed to have and should have the right to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience. He should have the same rights as any other citizen of this country, and it is against the Constitution of this Government and against all forms of right and decency that he should suffer for what he believed to be right.

Religious oppression is the last of all forms of oppression that should be backed by the courts, and we do not believe the higher courts of fair Illinois, to which Mr. Rotherick has appealed, will sustain the lower decision for a moment.

We are not an Advent, but we believe that Sunday fanatics have as much right to hold up an express car as they have to hold up the religious beliefs of any man who believes in worshiping on Saturday.

From all indications, the enlightened and progressive State of Illinois will emulate the example of other States in the matter of religious intolerance. This terrible scourge of Europe in the Dark Ages seems to have become epidemic in our land to-day.
