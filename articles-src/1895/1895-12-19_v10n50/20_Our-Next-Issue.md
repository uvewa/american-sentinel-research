The demand for our issue of Nov. 28, containing the letter of Father O'Keefe to some M. E. ministers on Sunday observance, has so far exceeded the limits of the edition printed, that we have decided to reprint the letter, together with some additional correspondence between the parties of a no less interesting nature, in our first issue of 1896, the date of which will be Jan. 2. So send in your orders at once for this issue, in order that we may be able to make the supply commensurate with the demand.

DURING the week ending Dec. 14, two sabbath (Sunday) conventions have been in session, one at Reading, Pa., and one at Baltimore, Md., for the purpose of pushing the demand for legislation upon religious questions. The leaders in this work are confidently looking to Congress for such legislation during the present session, and we fear their confidence is but too well founded. A notice of the work of these conventions will appear in our next issue.
