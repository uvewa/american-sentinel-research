In Louisiana, says the New York Sun, "the moral reform element will try to abolish racing, as they have abolished lotteries and glove contests, in spite of the law permitting them. The same element is now engaged in attempting to rigidly enforce the Sunday law, but with only partial success." In that State the "moral reform element" do not have so much reverence for mere "law" as is professed in some States of the North.

An opinion rendered Dec. 10, by Attorney-General Childs, of Minnesota, holds that opening the public schools with a recital of the Lord's Prayer, is a violation of Section 16 of the State constitution, which provides that no person shall be compelled to attend, erect, or support any place of worship. There can be no doubt of the justness of this decision; and in this Minnesota has taken a step in advance of many other States, in which custom, supported by religious sentiment, overrides an equally plain provision of the fundamental law.
