"The law of the Lord is perfect." "The law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good." Webster defines "justice—rendering to every one his due, right or desert." The law of God not only defines all our duties (Eccl. 12:13), but it defends all our rights as well. Accompanying each precept, except the fifth, like a sentinel with drawn sword in hand, is a "Thou shalt not." This guards every one of our inherent rights, with the penalty of death for transgression. "The soul that sinneth, it shall die;" and "sin is the transgression of the law." Are the rights of any human being of little consequence? "The Lord of hosts, which is wonderful in council and excellent in working," knew just what he was about when he made them a vital part of his own great moral law, giving them all the weight and authority of that law.

The framers of the Declaration of Independence, in harmony with the divine ideal of justice, declared: "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."

The law of God is called "the law of liberty." If every one would obey it, freedom from the bondage of sin, and from all oppression of man, would insure universal content and prosperity; there would be no interference with natural rights, because every one would love his neighbor as himself. "Love worketh no ill to his neighbor; therefore love is the fulfilling of the law." Love leads to obedience. On the contrary, selfishness is the root of the transgression of every commandment; selfishness is supreme self-love, disregarding the rights of others.

To every one of us comes the kind injunction: "So speak ye and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty." "Speak not evil one of another, brethren. He that speaketh evil of his brother and judgeeth his brother, speaketh evil of the law and judgeeth the law." When a person,—a professed child of God is here addressed—speaks evil of his brother, or renders any kind of judgment against him, thus injuring him with one hand, while he holds the law of God with the other, he is virtually saying that the law is in harmony with his proceedings. What is this but speaking evil of the law, judging it to be unkind like himself: "Who art thou that judgeest another?" Did you ever think, when you judge another man's servant, that you usurp the place of that servant's master? How far short of blasphemy is this? "There is one Lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy." He alone can administer his law; none other can determine, in any case, the amount of its rewards or punishments; and none but he can execute them.

Oh! fellow-Christians, be entreated, speak not evil of your brother, nor judge him any more, who conscientiously observes the Decalogue as he understands it. Otherwise, you are plainly told that your judgment in the court of heaven will be: "Not a doer of the law!" The fate of all transgressors is eternal death.
