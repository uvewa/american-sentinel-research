With the apparent abandonment of polygamy by the Mormon Church, the impression seemed to become quite general in the country that it was safe to endow the territory with the functions and privileges of Statehood, and steps were taken looking toward the admission of Utah into the Union at an early date. But, as is pointed out by a writer in the Independent, of Dec. 12, the most dangerous and forbidding feature of the situation, as concerns the granting of Utah's long-standing request for admission, did not lie in the Mormon practice of polygamy, but in the fact that the Mormon Church assumed the right to dictate and did dictate to her adherents in civil affairs. And whatever may have become of polygamy, there is little doubt this greater evil still exists. The above-mentioned writer, Mr. Eugene Young, says:—

It is a popular and rather justifiable belief of most casual observers that polygamy is the worst evil of the Mormon system. This has been encouraged by the course of the anti-Mormons in the past in seizing upon polygamy to awaken Eastern sentiment and bring it to bear against the greater evil of Church control. But in reality that thing which is most oppressive to the Gentiles of Utah is the fact that ever since the settlement of the Territory the first presidency of the church has claimed and exercised the right to dictate in temporal as well as spiritual affairs. It has controlled religion, business and government, punishing recalcitrants and rewarding those who have been most obedient, especially those who are relatives.

How the church controls the politics of the Territory is thus told:—

The division on national lines was made in the spring of 1891. In June, Apostle F. M. Lyman went to a southern conference, called the priesthood together, asked "How is it so many of you leading brethren of Beaver are Democrats?" and then went on to say:

"This is not as it should be. The authorities desire that the people should divide themselves about equally between the two great national parties, and it would be proper for some to remain independent or neutral. The object in such a division is that we shall then have more power in the nation, and get a more honest administration from the party in power. Each party will then cater to us, more or less, in order to secure control of the Territory."

I may mention here that representatives from seven counties were at that meeting, and each one of these counties was soon turned Republican, though formerly Democratic.

The views above expressed by Apostle Lyman were those which soon spread throughout the Territory, and were traced satisfactorily back to George Q. Cannon, first counselor in the presidency and virtual head of the church. The idea behind this movement was—first, to secure Statehood; second, to retain control of the State by using a balance of power. The first object was to be accomplished by leading both national parties to believe that they would have an equal chance of carrying the State.

Mr. Young then tells how the church has endeavored in the last two or three years to carry out this purpose; which, however, has proved something of a task, owing to the fact that the founders of Mormonism were staunch Democrats, and their views naturally gave a strong Democratic bias to the politics of the denomination; and the "Gentile" influence has made the Mormon people less plastic in the hands of their church leaders than they once were. But thus far, the church seems to have succeeded in her design.

The Mormon State-Church, or Church-State, as it may perhaps more properly be called, should be a continual object-lesson to the American people, warning them to beware of any movement which tends toward a condition of things that will permit the exercise of political power in support of any religious dogma or institution; for such movements wear always an aspect of innocence at the start quite different from that exhibited by the Mormon system to-day; and once started, the growth is hard to check. If the spectacle of Mormonism operating as a Church and State system were sufficient to arouse the American people to the danger which threatens from the formation of a more gigantic system of like nature in our nation, then would Mormonism have served a useful purpose.
