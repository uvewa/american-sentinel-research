Some of the "Christian" work now being done in Newark in the line of promoting Sunday observance, and more that is likely to be done, is set forth in the following item of news taken from the *Sun* (New York) of December 11:—

In charging the new grand jury of Essex County yesterday, Judge Depue was particularly severe upon the Newark police commissioners for the letter they addressed to the Christian Citizenship Union in regard to Sunday liquor selling, and an indictment is not improbable as a result of his charge. The part of the charge bearing on the letter was:—

"My attention has been called to a communication of the police commissioners of this city to a committee of citizens, with the request that I submit the subject to the grand jury.

"The correspondence relates to the sale of liquor on Sunday, in violation of law. The law prohibiting the sale of liquor on Sunday is contained in statutes of comparatively recent date. The commissioners appear to entertain the opinion that the enforcement of these laws and the city ordinances is neither possible nor expedient.

"These officials are not amenable to prosecution for opinions expressed; but when acts become indictable offenses, if done with a certain intent, opinions distinctly avowed with respect to official conduct may be such evidence of intent as will bring acts done or omitted in the line of official duty within the range of indictable offenses."

The Christian Citizenship Union are trying to get Judge Depue to have the Newark police commissioners indicted for holding and communicating to the Union their opinion that the enforcement of Sunday prohibition in Newark is not expedient or possible.

Whether it is possible or not, we do not say, nor do we at all dissent from the idea that executive officers should be held to a strict account for the enforcement of all just laws. But we do dissent from the idea that such work represents Christianity, or is any proper part of Christian effort. We dissent from the idea that the enforcement of human law, or any form of compulsion, pertains to Christianity. For if it does pertain to Christianity, and securing a person's arrest for a violation of law can properly be called Christian work, then, since Christianity defines our duty towards God, such duty may properly be enforced by civil law, and there is no line of demarcation between the civil and the spiritual realms, between the spheres of the Church and of the State. And this has been the theory of religious bigots and persecutors in all ages.

We commend to this "Christian Citizenship Union" the example of Jesus Christ, who "went about doing good," oppressing none and never calling for anybody's arrest, nor for any help whatever from the civil arm.
