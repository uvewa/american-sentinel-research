At a meeting of the International Health and Temperance Association held Dec. 1, in the Seventh-day Adventist Church on Greenbrier Avenue, St. Paul, Minn., the following resolutions relative to temperance and Sunday-closing were passed, which are representative of the views of the Seventh-day Adventists:—

Inasmuch as there never would have been, and never could have been, such an instrument as a statute Sunday law if the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday, had not been regarded as a day sacred to worship, an institution of the Church; and,

Inasmuch as the logic of the demand for closed saloons on Sunday merely is but to secure the aid of the State in the enforcement of this institution of the Church, and is just so much a union of the Church with the State; therefore,

Resolved, That we cannot unite in calling for closed Sunday saloons and legalizing the rum traffic on all other days of the week; because this course will ultimately result in a complete union of Church and State. And because the power that can close the saloon one day in the week can do so every day and for all time. And, because this would make us partners in the iniquitous traffic and serve only to elevate and make respectable this demon of all traffics, and curse of all curses. And is almost, if not quite, equal to saying that it is a terrible thing for our sons and daughters to frequent such resorts, and drink, and gamble, and carouse and wallow in the gutter on Sunday; but not so very bad on other days. That it is a terrible thing that our sons and daughters should be debased into demons on Sunday; but not so bad to sell themselves soul and body on other days! And, because this Sunday temperance reform is but to exalt the Sunday as a religious institution, enforcing it upon the people, to the detriment of the temperance cause, and a compromise with the powers of darkness.

Resolved, That we note with sorrow the prevailing condition of lawlessness the world over, in the growing inclination to disregard the equal rights of others in the enjoyment of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. And that we regard the cause of this lawlessness and growing desire to infringe upon the exercise of these equal rights as being the selfishness of the human heart, and that this selfishness is made supreme by intemperance; not only in the use of alcoholic drinks alone, but in all the various stimulants and narcotics which inflame the passions and debase the user; not in intemperance upon Sunday alone, but upon each and every day in the week, the year round.

Resolved, That true temperance must be interpreted as a proper use of the various and many blessings of life, and a total disuse of everything harmful. And so we declare ourselves in favor of the total suppression of the rum and tobacco traffic, not upon Sunday only, but upon every day in the week as well; and that we earnestly recommend the total abstinence from the use of tea and coffee as being injurious to the health, and stepping-stones to the use of tobacco and strong drinks.

We know that very many who advocate legal Sunday closing of the saloons, proceed upon the principle that a little is better than nothing; but this is of very doubtful application in this method of dealing with intemperance. The wisdom of such a compromise with this evil is more than doubtful. There was a compromise over the question of slavery in the United States; but under it that evil continued and grew until it involved the country in a most terrible civil war. There is no principle which justifies a compromise between good and evil; and as a mere matter of policy, we may well beware of compromising with this curse of mankind; lest by it the curse be made stronger rather than weaker.
