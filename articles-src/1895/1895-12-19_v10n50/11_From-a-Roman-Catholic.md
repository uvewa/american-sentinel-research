IN the course of a speech made in Baltimore on Thanksgiving Day by "Father" Stafford, the occasion being the raising of the stars and stripes over a Catholic parochial school, "Father" Stafford took occasion to give full recognition to the principle of separation between Church and State. He said:—

When the Roman Empire fell and Europe had to be reorganized, Church and State became more or less mixed, and the clergy, being almost the only people with any knowledge, were from the necessity of the case forced into civil life. It was never intended that the clergy should take charge of the affairs of the State. The Divine Founder of Christianity made Church and State separate.

And when this country began we turned to first principles. We decided that the one was to be supreme in the civil order, the other supreme in the spiritual order. The State with us has no religion, recognizes no church, cannot recognize any church, ought not to recognize any church, but is obliged to recognize that religious liberty is involved in the rights of a man as a citizen, and must protect him in the exercise of it.

Whoever, then, impugns this privilege and denies the right of anybody or any church to their faith; whoever opposes a man in civil or business life because of his religious beliefs; whoever takes from such a man the means whereby he may earn his living; whoever refuses to support him politically or otherwise—whoever does these things, I say, is not an American, but a foreigner. He steals the livery of heaven to do the work of the devil; he wraps himself in the flag of liberty to establish a despotism; he proclaims religious liberty in order to stab his brother because he does not believe as he does; he has introduced into our civilization the very worst forms of religious hate and devilish animosity as they were found in the Old World.

This is far from being "good" Catholic doctrine, but it is not for us to say that it does not represent the real sentiments of the speaker. The SENTINEL judges no man; it condemns no man; it wishes to accord to all men, Catholic or Protestant, full liberty to the most favorable construction that can be placed upon their motives. It deals with principles, and is glad to see any recognition of just principles, wherever made. And it deplores the fact that the "Protestantism" of today has so few representatives who are willing to avow themselves as plainly as does this Catholic priest in favor of the separation of the State from religion.
