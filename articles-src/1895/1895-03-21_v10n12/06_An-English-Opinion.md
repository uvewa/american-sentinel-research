## AN ENGLISH OPINION.

CONSCIENTIOUS scruples should always be treated tenderly, however absurd they may seem to those who have to deal with them; and I am, therefore, sorry that some "Sabbath-day" Christians should have had to suffer in pocket for conscience' sake. There are a few people in this country, but a much larger body in America, who believe as the Jews do that Saturday is a divinely-appointed day of rest, and intended to be observed as such by all men through all time. The opinion is a very innocent one, and the only mischief it does is that it throws those who hold it "out of gear" with the rest of society, as was shown on Tuesday, when the secretary of the International Tract Society, of Holloway Road, appeared to answer a summons for an infraction of the Factory Act, by having employed two women and one young person on a Sunday in last month. It was pleaded in excuse that the institution gave their hands a half-holiday on Friday, and closed the premises on Saturdays, but fines and costs amounting together to £3. 18s. were imposed. If they had been Jews they might have claimed the right to work on Sundays under such an arrangement; as they were not, there was no defense. Then it appeared that there were conscientious objections to paying the fine, which will be recovered therefore by distress. It is a pity some way out of the difficulty could not be found. I do not admire the want of discretion in the factory inspector, who might have passed a case of this description over; or the wisdom of the magistrate, who might have imposed the smallest fine possible.—Doyberry, in *London City Press*, Feb. 16.
