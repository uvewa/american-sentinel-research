## "THE WRATH OF MAN SHALL PRAISE THEE."

[The following is a portion of the address of Elder O. A. Olsen, President of the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists, delivered at the opening session of that body, held February 14.]

The agitation for religious legislation continues, and with the spirit of true Protestantism fast dying out, this movement makes rapid progress. During the past two years the arrests of our brethren for Sunday labor have continued to increase in number. During this time forty-one have been arrested, and thirteen have served a longer or shorter sentence in prison. These experiences are also coming to our people in other parts of the world. In Australia three of our brethren have been arrested and condemned to the stocks. In Basel, Switzerland, Elder Holser suffered three weeks' imprisonment in consequence of work done in our publishing house there on Sunday. In Christiana, Norway, our publishing house has been twice fined for Sunday labor. These fines have not been paid, of course, and arrest is imminent.

These things are intended by the enemy to discourage and intimidate souls, but the result is just the opposite. In this country, in Australia, and in Switzerland, persecution, instead of hindering our work, has given it a new impetus. "Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee: the remainder of wrath shall thou restrain." Psalms 76:10.
