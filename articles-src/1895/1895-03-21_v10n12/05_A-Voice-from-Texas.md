## A VOICE FROM TEXAS.

WHAT a blessing it is that no one religion has a majority of followers in this country. The action of the fanatical Hoboken preachers who tried to throttle free speech, and that of the ignorant Catholic mob at Savannah, who raised a riot because a man and a woman wanted to speak in opposition to their religion, only shows to what extremes religions bigots would go if they only could. The Protestants and Baptists are united in declaring the papal Sunday the Lord's day, and declare that everybody else shall subscribe to the same belief, although they well know, that, from the best information we have, Sunday is the Sabbath of the pagan Constantine, while Saturday is the Sabbath established by the Lord. Strange to say, however, the Catholics do not unite with the Sunday worshipers in enforcing the Catholic day of worship.—Weekly Star (Marshall, Texas), March 6.
