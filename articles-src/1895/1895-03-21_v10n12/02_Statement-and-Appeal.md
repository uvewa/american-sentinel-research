# STATEMENT AND APPEAL.

From the International Tract Society of London to the People of England.

[The following is a portion of a statement and appeal issued by the International Tract Society of London, through its official organ, the Present Truth, (February 28), to the people of England. The Society is a Seventh-day Adventist organization, and after resting "the Sabbath day according to the commandment," its employees labor on Sunday. For this the manager was fined (Feb. 13) 78 shillings ($19), which, for conscientious reasons, he refused to pay. We print an abridgment of the statement and appeal because the principles are as applicable to the situation in America as in England.]

The question, Why not yield to the law until it can be altered? covers the whole ground, and we will answer it in detail.

In a word, we may answer the above question by saying that we are positively forbidden to do so. Here is a higher law, which admits of no exception:—

Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work: but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy masacrivant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates: for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and reded the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day, and hallowed it.

This commandment requires us to keep holy the seventh day. "To hallow" and "to sanctify" are the same thing, both terms being a translation of one and the same Hebrew word. Consequently the following rendering of the fourth commandment, found in Deut. 5:12, is identical with that in Ex. 20:8, "Keep the Sabbath day to sanctify it."

## Meaning of Sanctify.

In the account of the preparation for the giving of the fourth commandment we have the word "sanctify" perfectly illustrated. The Lord told Moses to set bounds about the mountain upon which the Lord was coming down, so that the people should not approach it. Accordingly, after Moses had ascended the mountain to meet the Lord, and the Lord again charged him to warn the people against coming near the mountain, "Moses said unto the Lord, The people cannot come up to Mount Sinai: for thou chargedst us, saying, Set bounds about the mount, and sanctify it." Ex. 10:23.

From this we learn that the mountain was "sanctified" by being set off from all the surrounding country. The ground that was made sacred by the presence of the Lord was so clearly distinguished from the rest, that nobody had any excuse for not recognizing the difference. To sanctify, therefore, or to hallow, means to keep a thing separate and distinct from everything else.

Apply this now to the Sabbath. The commandment says that the seventh day is the Sabbath, and charges us to sanctify it or to keep it holy. We are to keep it separate from other days, by doing none of our own work upon it, while upon the other six days we are charged to do with our might whatsoever our hands find to do. The great and essential difference between the Sabbath and other days is that it is a rest day, while they are laboring days. If now we should labor on the Sabbath the same as on other days, it is very evident that we should not sanctify it. We should be putting no difference between it and ordinary days. But suppose, on the other hand, that we should rest upon the seventh day, and should also regularly rest upon another day as well; it must be just as evident that in this case we should also be breaking down the distinction between the Sabbath and other days. In other words, we should not be sanctifying the Sabbath. So far as our action was concerned, no one would be able to tell which day is the Sabbath.

Now the reader can see why we cannot keep Sunday as well as the Sabbath, pending some proposed alteration to be considered later on. Just as true worship of the true God is impossible while also worshiping another god, so it is impossible to keep the Sabbath of the Lord according to the commandment, and at the same time regard another day. The commandment which tells us to sanctify the seventh day,—the Sabbath of the Lord,—thereby forbids us to give to any other day any of the honor which belongs alone to the Sabbath.

Let it be understood that there is no controversy with those who may not think that the fourth commandment is to be strictly and literally regarded. They are free to think and act as they choose. We are simply taking the commandment as it reads, remembering the words of Christ, "It is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of the law to fail." Luke 16:17. By the commandment we are positively forbidden to recognize Sunday as in any way whatever different from Monday or Tuesday. This is why we cannot keep Sunday as well as the Sabbath, whether for a few weeks or forever.

## The Majesty of the Law.

"But," it will be urged, "the dignity of the law must be maintained, and it must be enforced; you must not expect that the law can be set aside to suit your ideas; and surely, as Christians, it is your duty to obey the law, and not to defy it."

Very good; and in reply we have this to say. First, we by no means expect or desire that any exception should be made to meet our ideas. A law that is not good for everybody and at all times, is not good for anything. Second, we recognize the fact that the Christian, of all persons, must respect the law, and must by no means defy it. "He that resisteth the power, withstandeth the ordinance of God: and they that withstand shall receive to themselves judgment." Rom. 13:2 (R. V.). God forbid that we should ever be found in a position of defiance or opposition to any earthly government.

Here, however, is a point which our friends who have so kindly advised us, seem not to have thought of. While we are upholding the majesty of the law, shall we ignore the claims of the law of God? Is English law superior to the law of God? We yield to no one in respect to the English Government and its laws; but we are bound to regard the government of God, and his laws, as higher still. It is not that we regard English law less, but that we regard the law of God more. Let us put the case squarely: Here is a man who acknowledges that there is a God who is above all, and who has laws; now what becomes of this acknowledged, if, when he talks about the majesty of the law, he sets the laws of men above the laws of God?

Let it be understood then, that this is not a case of opposition to the civil law, but of reverence for the law of God. We are bound above all things to obey the law of God. But here is a case where the civil law directly opposes the law of God. We are forced therefore to say to the rulers, as did the apostles: "Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye." Acts 4:19. The controversy is not between us and government, but between government and the law of God.

As before stated, we are bound to obey the law of the land at no matter what sacrifice of money or convenience. But this is

## Not a Question of Convenience,

but solely one of loyalty to God's law. Our advice* has said that if we do not change our course we shall find that the fines will amount to much more than the profits on Sundays. Very likely; but that has nothing to do with the case. If no principle were involved, then it would be simple stubbornness not to give way; but where principle is at stake, then convenience or profit has no place. Our duty is clear. We must obey God, and we must not resist the laws of the land. If, therefore, the laws of the land come in conflict with the law of God, we must take the consequences, whatever they may be.

We have shown that it is impossible for us to keep the Sunday as well as the Sabbath until the law is altered; let us now say a few words as to the fact itself of

## Getting the Law Altered.

Our friends would have us make an appeal to the Government to have an exception made in our favor, permitting us to labor on Sunday without molestation. But this we cannot do. Why not?—Simply because such a course would be insulting both to God and to Parliament. How so? Thus: God himself has already not only given us permission to labor on the first day of the week, but has commanded us to make a difference between it and his rest day. Surely anybody can see that it would be so insult to him for us to ask men for permission to obey him. It would be holding him inferior to men. It would be to exalt Parliament above God, saying, "We wish to obey the Lord, but we cannot think of doing so without your permission." Or, it would be the same as saying, "Will you not allow us to keep the commandment of the Lord, and protect us in so doing?" Would not the infidel well retort, "What kind of a God do you serve? If you have to appeal to men to protect you in his service, you would do better to forsake him, and to serve the men in whom you trust."

Again, to appeal to Parliament to change the law in our favor, would be so insult to it, for that would imply that if the permission were not granted we would not obey the Lord's commandment; and this alternative could by no means follow. To ask permission to keep the commandment and at the same time to say that if the permission were not granted we should obey it just the same, would be the height of disrespect. So we are not allowed to take any steps toward inducing the Government to make any change in its laws, further than may be done by the simple statement of the truth.

Let us repeat that our personal convenience cuts no figure whatever in the affair. Really, the case concerns the people of England, to whom we appeal, far more than it does us. And let it be further understood that we make this appeal not in our own behalf, but in theirs. It is not that we may be saved from inconvenience or pecuniary loss, but that they, or at least some, may be saved from taking sides against God, in opposing his law.

## Official Responsibility

It is often the case that officers of the law excuse themselves for executing a law which they know to be wrong, and seek to absolve themselves from all responsibility in the matter, by saying, "You know that we are bound to enforce the law; we do not like to do it, but we cannot help ourselves."

That is a mistake. Nobody is forced to do wrong. Nobody can shield himself under the mantle of the government. "Every one of us shall give account of himself to God." The men who make the laws are individually responsible to God for their action. If they exercise their right to do wrong, they will as individuals have to bear the responsibility.

The officers of the law are in the same position of individual responsibility. Lowell has well and quaintly put it:

> Ef you take a sword and dror it,
> And go stick a feller thru,
> Gov'ment aint to answer for it;
> God'll send the bill to you.

God has said, "Though hand join in hand, the wicked shall not be unpunished." Multitudes joined together in any wrong course, do not make it right, and do not lessen the responsibility of each individual. The official is in the same relation to the law as the private citizen. If government commands him to do a thing that is unjust, he must say, "We ought to obey God rather than men," and abide whatever may result. Governments cannot absolve any man, whether he be an official or a private person, from allegiance to God.

## "Acting Conscientiously."

When the magistrate imposed the fine upon the secretary of the society, he very graciously added that he had no doubt but that they were acting conscientiously. Now, reader, whether you are a judge or a private citizen, let me ask you a question. Suppose there was a thing which you conscientiously regarded as a matter of vital principle, but the law forbade it under penalty; would you stifle your conscience, in order to escape the penalty? or would you be true to your conscience, let the consequences be what they might? Let every man answer this for himself.

The freedom of England is a matter of boast; but if there had not been scores and hundreds of men and women in England in time past who would rather suffer death than do what they were convinced was wrong, the very would not be found in England to-day even in the dictionary. The very name of it would be forgotten. We have need to beware lest, while we build the tombs of the prophets and martyrs, we give evidence that we are the children of those who killed them. We cannot honor those noble men, no matter how much we boast of their deeds, if we basely yield our consciences into the keeping of another.

## Parliament and Conscience.

The inspector who conducted the prosecution of the society for Sunday work, referred to the fact that it was a matter of conscience, but said, "Parliament cannot make a law to fit every individual conscience;" and all seemed to think that that settled the matter. "But," our friends say to us, "Do you really think it can?" We reply, No; and therefore it cannot, in justice, legislate with regard to anybody's conscience, since to do so is for it to commit sin, and to attempt to force others to sin.

The idea that a man ought to make his conscience bow to the law of the State, is a most pernicious one. It is to say that the State is the keeper of conscience. It is to make of the State a gigantic priest who shall dole out the measure of faith to every man. It is to say that a man has no business to have any conscience of his own, or even to think anything different from what the men at the head of the government prescribe for him to think. In short, it is to make a god of the State, and even to set it above God, since God himself does not seek to compel any man's mind or conscience. Englishmen are justly very jealous of the encroachments of peppery; but if a man must submit his conscience into the keeping of another, what difference does it make whether that other sits in the Vatican or in Westminster?

But after all, to come back to the main point; this is

## Not Merely a Question of Conscience,

nor of interpretation of Scripture, but of fact. The fourth commandment plainly says that "the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God," and there is no interpretation to it. Interpretation is needed only for those things that are obscure; but this language is very plain. It is not a question of how we understand a portion of Scripture, but of whether or not we believe and will obey it. And we do not make any demand that Parliament shall pay any regard to our conscience; but we do ask the people of England, high and low, to have regard for their own conscience, and to remember that the Word of God is the only true guide of it.

## Christ or Antichrist?

But the crowning point of all is that this question is in reality a question of loyalty to Christ. We will avoid everything like involved argument, and will simply make a few statements that a child can follow.

Speaking of Christ, the beloved disciple, said, "Whose keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God perfected: hereby know we that we are in him. He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked." 1 John 2:5, 6. To be a Christian means to do as Christ did, and not to do differently. There is but one standard of Christianity, and that is Christ.

But Christ did not change the Sabbath.

On the contrary, he kept the seventh-day Sabbath of the commandment, the same day that the Jews regarded. How may you know this? Search the Scriptures, and see for yourself. The fact that in the whole of the New Testament there is not the slightest hint of any change in the day of the Sabbath, is sufficient evidence that the Scripture warrants no change in the practice.

Further, you will find the term "Sabbath" used many times in the New Testament, and invariably with reference to the seventh day of the week, the original Sabbath. But the Scripture was written by holy men under the influence of the Holy Spirit of God. It was written as the guide for Christians. Its language is the language which the Holy Spirit has given for Christians. Therefore the only Christian name for the seventh day is the Sabbath, and the only Sabbath for Christians is the seventh day.

But in the lack of time just at the present to read the New Testament through in order to find the absence of Sunday, let us read one or two impartial statements, since they are from men who believe in Sunday.

Rev. Isaac Williams, B. D., late Fellow of Trinity College, Oxford, in a book entitled, "Plain Sermons on the Catechism," published by Longmans, Green & Co., makes the following candid admissions:

In the first place we are commanded to keep holy the seventh day; but yet we do not think it necessary to keep the seventh day holy; for the seventh day is Saturday. It may be said that we keep the first day instead; but surely this is not the same thing; the first day cannot be the seventh day; and where are we told in Scripture that we are to keep the first day at all? We are commanded to keep the seventh; but we are nowhere commanded to keep the first day.—Page 334.

On the next page but one he says that a difficulty to be explained is "how it is that the observance of the seventh day is done away with, although there is no warrant in Holy Scripture for doing so," and gives the following answer:

The reason why we keep the first day of the week holy instead of the seventh is for the same reason that we observe many other things, not because the Bible, but because the Church, has enjoined it.

The writer of the above seems to represent that branch of the Church of England that does not sympathize with Rome; going to the other branch, we find that Canon Knox-Little, in his book on "Sacerdotalism," in which he argues in favor of Romish practices against the evangelical portion of the Church of England, says:

Well, as to certain specific statements of Scripture which are said to forbid the teaching of fasting communion. What are they? The palmary argument of opponents is that our Lord instituted the Blessed Sacrament "after supper." It is difficult to believe that fairly instructed persons who use this argument are in earnest, and sincerely believe what they say. It would be just as sensible to argue that you are a "sacerdotalist" for observing the Lord's day, instead of observing the Jewish Saturday. It is certain that our Lord when on earth did observe Saturday, and did not observe Sunday; but no one, as far as I know, has ever been called a "sacerdotalist" for departing from His undoubted habit of "resting the seventh day."—Page 75.

And again:

Their effort strictly to adhere to our Lord's example to the letter, in spite of the usage of the Church, implies that they know better what our Lord desired than his Church. If they are consistent, as I have said, they must keep Saturday, not Sunday, as the day of rest.—Page 93.

Here the Sabbath of the fourth commandment is shown to be the crucial test whether with Rome or against her. It is not only admitted that the seventh day, commonly called Saturday, is the only Bible Sabbath, but it is shown that disregarding it involves the acceptance of the ceremonies and authority of Rome.

Now since Christ did not change the Sabbath, but kept it, it necessarily follows that his Church did not and cannot change the Sabbath, but must keep it.

## "The Church" and the Sabbath.

But the church did change its practice in regard to the Sabbath. Yes, that is true, and thereby "the church" proclaimed itself not the church of Christ, but anti-Christian. Let us read "the church's" own testimony on this point.

In "A Sure way to Find Out the True Religion," by Rev. T. Baddely, a Catholic priest, I read:

Lastly, the keeping holy the Sunday is a thing absolutely necessary to salvation; and yet this is nowhere put down in the Bible; on the contrary, the Bible says, "Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy." (Ex. 20:9), which is Saturday, and not Sunday; therefore the Bible does not contain all things necessary to salvation, and, consequently, cannot be a sufficient rule of faith.

In a book which was written in 1801, entitled, "The End of Religious Controversy," consisting of a series of letters by the Rt. Rev. John Milner, addressed to Rev. Dr. Burgess, Lord Bishop of St. David's, in answer to his lordship's Protestant Catechism, I find the following:

The first precept in the Bible is that of sanctifying the seventh day: "God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it." Gen. 2:3. This precept was confirmed by God in the ten commandments: "Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy." "The seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God." Ex. 20. On the other hand, Christ declares that he is not come to destroy the law, but to fulfill it. Mott. 5:17. He himself observed the Sabbath; and, as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day. Luke 4:16. His disciples likewise observed it after his death. They rested on the Sabbath day according to the commandment. Luke 23:56. Yet, with all this weight of Scripture authority for keeping the Sabbath or seventh day holy, Protestants, of all denominations, make this a profane day,* and transfer the obligation of it to the first day of the week, or the Sunday. Now, what authority have they for doing this? None at all, but the unwritten word, or tradition of the Catholic Church, which declares that the apostles made the change in honor of Christ's resurrection, and the descent of the Holy Ghost, on the first day of the week.—Page 89.

This is simple fact. It is true that Protestants generally suppose that they are following the example of the apostles in observing the Sunday, but the fact is that the Bible gives no warrant for such a supposition. The Roman Catholic Church is the only authority for it.

Once more; in "A Plain Talk about the Protestantism of To-day," I find the following very plain language:

It is worth its while to remember that this observance of the Sabbath—in which, after all, the only Protestant worship consists—not only has no foundation in the Bible, but is in flagrant contradiction with its letter, which commands rest on the Sabbath, which is Saturday. It was the Catholic Church which, by the authority of Jesus Christ, has transferred this rest to the Sunday in remembrance of the resurrection of our Lord. Thus the observance of Sunday by the Protestants is an homage which they pay, in spite of themselves, to the authority of the Church.

It will be noticed that these Catholic statements concerning the Sabbath and the Bible are precisely the same as those previously quoted from Protestant writers.

## The "Man of Sin."

Bear in mind two things. First, Christ did not change the Sabbath, and neither he nor the Holy Spirit ever authorized anybody else to do so.

Second: It was "the church" which arrogated to itself the right and power to do that which Jesus Christ declared that he would not do, and which could not by any possibility be done. Therefore we may add to these two points a

Third: namely, that in presuming to make that change, "the church" put itself above the Lord. The doing of it was the sign of apostasy. For bear in mind also the fact that the Sabbath has never been changed, and never could be changed. God's law is as unchangeable as his throne; but the people have changed.

This apostasy was thus foretold by the Apostle Paul, who said that before the coming of the Lord there should be "a falling away first, and the man of sin be revealed, the son of pestition, he that opposeth and exalteth himself against all that is called God or that is worshiped; so that he sitteth in the temple of God setting himself forth as God." 2 Thess. 2:3, 4. (R.V.) In presuming to change the practice of Sabbath-keeping, contrary to the commandment of God and the practice of Jesus Christ, "the church" has confessedly fulfilled this scripture. Not only so, but the State, in attempting to enforce the observance of Sunday, puts itself in the very same place, namely, above and against God.

It matters not that this has been

**Done in Ignorance.**

It is truly said that in proscribing labor on Sunday the Government had no thought of invading anybody's religious convictions. That is why we make this appeal, in order that those who have been led into a wrong course with no evil motive may have opportunity to clear themselves from all complicity in it. An evil is none the less an evil because it is done unintentionally. As much damage may be caused by an infant playing with matches as by an incendiary. But remember that when we speak of the evil, we have not the slightest reference to any inconvenience that we may suffer from the law. Our appeal is

First, to the officers of the law. Will you, for the sake of a position, consent to be the agents of the man of sin? Will you be a party to opposition to God?

Second, to the people generally. Will you, for fear of loss of earthly gain or reputation, follow the papacy instead of Christ?

**England and Rome.**

There is much talk just now as to Rome's influence in England. Remember this, that separation from the Word of God is in itself union with Rome. A partial reformation was effected in the days of Wycliffe and Tyndal, by means of the Word of God. As the result of giving the Bible to the people in their own tongue, and teaching them to read it for themselves, England shook off the papal yoke, and became free. The emancipation was never complete, because the Word was not followed fully; but it is a fact that England's present freedom from paying tribute to a foreign ecclesiastical power is due solely to the Bible. Individual liberty is the basis of all liberty. No State gives freedom to its subjects, but the State becomes free in proportion as the men composing it are free. Individual liberty through the Word of God led to the emancipation of England from vassalage to the pope of Rome. Disregard of that word will rivet the chains again. Therefore this is not by any means primarily a question for the Government, but one for individual consideration. What will you do about it? Men are free only as the truth in Christ makes them free. Will you then choose the freedom of Christ, or the bondage of antichrist?

**Asked to Deny Christ.**

One point more may serve to bring close home the fact that this question is, so far as we are concerned, solely one of loyalty to Christ. As stated before, the law does not provide for any but Jews to be allowed to work on Sunday. Why it is right for Jews to work on Sunday, and wrong for Christians, has never been made clear; but we will pass that. The fact is, that if the directors of the International Tract Society had been willing to sign a paper declaring that they were Jews, they would have been allowed to labor on Sundays unmolested. That is to say, all that was required of them was that they should deny Christ. So that, in very truth, the society, in the peram of its secretary, has been fined in the Clerkenwell Court for refusing to deny Christ. We simply ask our fellow-Christians, Would you do it at the demand of the State?

This is not a matter of small importance. It is a good deal more than a question of a few pounds, or the convenience of a few people. It re olves itself simply into this, which every man should ask himself in all seriousness, "What shall I do then with Jesus which is called Christ?"
