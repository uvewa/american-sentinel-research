# A PROTEST

Addressed to the First-day Adventists of

New England, by a Suspended

Licentiate of their Massachusetts Conference.

THIS protest is not written from hatred nor to insult anyone, but in love, and from an interest in my First-day Adventist brethren.

There came to my hand recently, a tract published by the Advent Christian Publication Society, entitled, "Why We Keep Sunday. A Reply to Cardinal Gibbons' Official Organ, The [Roman] Catholic Mirror, and to Seventh-day Adventists, on the Subject, by Rev. Andrew Gray, D. D." Mr. Gray is an Episcopalian, and right here I would like to ask you, my First-day Adventist brethren, Did the Roman Catholics stagger you so badly that you could find no man in all your ranks able to answer the questions propounded by your Catholic contemporary? I hold no title, neither will this article be indorsed by any "Rt. Rev. Bishop" or any of the great ones of earth. My article will be a remonstrance and a protest against the germs of popery, sacerdotalism, and Puseyism, which your tract contains; coming as it does from you who profess to take the Bible only as your rule of faith.

Henry W. Bowman, in one of your "Ray of Truth" tracts, says we should adhere to the Scriptures as our rule of faith. This is the essence of Protestantism, from which principle you depart when you distribute the above-named tract written by Dr. Gray. Your champion says, on page 8 of this tract: "Besides, 'The Bible and the Bible only' is not, and never was, the rule of faith in the Anglican Church." Now, you often quote, "To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them." If that is so, why spread abroad a tract which, according to the confession of its author, is not based on the Bible, and consequently, has no light in it?

Mr. Gray further says: "Her rule of faith is, and has been all down the ages, the scriptures of the Old and New Testaments, as interpreted by the fathers and the consentient voice of Catholic antiquity, speaking through the ancient creeds and decisions of the four undisputed general councils." By such statements as these, Protestantism is dishonored. Martin Luther said that the Word of God, interpreted by the fathers, is like milk poured or strained through a coal-sack. "The fathers blow hot and blow cold on articles of faith." This you well know, for if we accept the teachings of the fathers, we will be obliged to accept the dogma of the immortality of the soul and other Roman Catholic errors.

In your book, "Future Punishment," by H. Constable, you give the opinions of many early fathers of the Catholic Church, who said the soul is immortal. They are Tatian, Athenagoras, Hippolytus, Augustine, Clement, Tertullian, and Origen. Because they say so, does that make it so?

Mr. Gray says that the phrase, "The Bible and the Bible only," is as absurd as to say, "The Constitution and the Constitution only;" and that the Court of Appeals "is only an authority to settle its meaning." Such logic is anti-American as well as anti-Protestant, for the Constitution is the Magna Charta of our liberties. If, for instance, the clause stating that "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof," should be transgressed and sanctioned by the Supreme Court, every true American with the spirit of 76 would arise in the name of his fathers and protest against it, saying with Patrick Henry, "Give me liberty or give me death."

**The Papal Church and the Sabbath.**

As Mr. Gray asks for information on certain questions, I will try to inform him. First, he asks, What proof is there that the Catholic or Papal Church changed the day? In the first place, the Word of God, in Jan. 7:24, 25, speaks of a little horn that would arise, which is "the mystery of iniquity," and which Paul said began to work in his day. This religion, "having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof," developed into the Roman Catholic Church, and the bishop of Rome became the pope. In Jan. 7:25, it is prophesied that among other things which the papacy would do and has done, "he shall think himself able to change times and laws" (Donay Version). The Bible says the law would be thought to be changed by the mystery of iniquity. By the papacy and in the Catechism of the Roman Church the law of God has been changed; the second commandment has been dropped, the fourth changed, and the tenth divided into two.

Lastly, the popists themselves admit having changed it. What more proof do you want?

Next he asks, "In what year did it occur, and by what council?" Although the change was not sudden, being a gradual work, Saturday had to become dishonorable before Sunday could be regarded as honorable. "Sunday," says a writer in the North British Review, "was the wild solar holiday of all pagan times." Its name implies this, as all know that the pagans worshiped the sun.

The scheming bishops who were the politicians of the third and fourth centuries and onward, used the rites, ceremonies and doctrines of the pagans, and caused paganism to coalesce with the form of Christianity and thus created papal Rome. The principal thing so transferred was Sunday.

**When the Sabbath Was Abolished.**

We can give the date when, and the council by which, the observance of the Sabbath was abolished. William Prynne, a Sunday-writer of 1633, says: "The seventh-day Sabbath was . . . solemnized by Christ, the apostles, and primitive Christians, till the Laodicean Council did, in a manner, quite abolish the observation of it, . . . the Council of Laodicea (A. D. 364) . . . first settled the observation of the Lord's day.* The decree was as follows:—

Because Christians ought not to Judaize, and to rest on the Sabbath, but to work that day. Wherefore, if they shall be found to Judaize, let them be accursed from Christ.⁴

But the law of the Sabbath could be really changed only by the authority that imposed it; and since no man or act of man can be vicegerents of God on earth, therefore this attempted change is a nullity, and is strictly becoming to the mystery of iniquity, as pointed out in Dan. 7:24, 25.

Mr. Gray says: "Sunday-keeping rests on apostolic tradition." Over against such a weak argument I set the words of Jesus: "In vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men." Matt. 15:9. "Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition." Matt. 15:6.

I quote from Mr. Gray again: "Sunday has always been observed as the Lord's day, from the beginning in all the branches of the Holy Catholic Church, Greek, Jacobite, Chaldean, Coptic, Abyssinian, Anglican, as well as Roman." There never was more falsehood to the square inch than in the above statement. It is utterly without proof. While there are volumes of evidence to the contrary, I will content myself with the testimony of Elias B. Sanford, M. A., in his book, "Concise Cyclopædia of Religious Knowledge, Biblical, Geographical, Theological, Historical, and Practical. Charles L. Webster & Co., New York, Publishers." This is not a Sabbatarian work. Under article "Medieval Sabbath," I find the following:—

## The Sabbath in the Dark Ages.

There has been no period since the time of Christ when there were not Sabbath-keeping Christians in the Church. There is no evidence of any form of observance of Sunday by Christians previous to the middle of the second century. Sabbath-keeping continued in the Western Church as late as the fifth century, and in the Eastern even as late as the fifteenth century or later. Since Sabbath-keepers denied the authority of the paganized church, they were persecuted as heretics by the papal power.

The Vandois, Cathari, Touhoanians, Petrobrusians, Passagians, and Waldenses, were not wholly uniform in doctrines and practice, for among them were many seventh-day keepers. The Bohemian Waldenses were the denominational ancestors of modern Seventh-day Baptists. When the Romish Church attempted to proselyte the Abyssinians in the seventeenth century, they found them observing the Sabbath and ready to take up arms in its defense. They had hallowed it from time immemorial. The Armenian Church was founded as early as 302 A.D.; from that time till English missionaries entered Armenia early in the present century Sabbath-keeping continued without interruption. The Nestorian or Chaldean Christians have also continued their original practice of Sabbath-keeping to the present century; and there is every reason for believing that the Sabbath is still kept in those three branches of the Church, except where modern missionary influence has set it aside. These facts are of the greatest importance, as showing what the earliest practice was, and what it has continued to be, except where the papal church has had power to express. When the darkness of the Middle Ages began to recede before the light of the Reformation, scattered Sabbath-keepers appeared at different points. Their history linked with those who died for their faith and fealty to the law of God during the Dark Ages, makes the chain complete.

The above is a part of an extract of said Cyclopædia, and was printed in the columns of the Christian Herald, edited by T. DeWitt Talmage. I cite this merely to show to what lengths of deception a man will go to get around the truth.

But without this proof the Word of God would be and is all that any Protestant, especially an Adventist, needs for proof. But in using the arguments of this author, you have violated the principles of Protestantism, and of Christianity. In commenting on the protest of the German princes at the Diet of Spires, D'Aubigne's History of the Reformation says, "Instead of these abuses, Protestantism sets the power of conscience above the magistrate, and the authority of the Word of God above the visible church."⁴ Your champion sets the visible church above the Word of God. This is papal principle only.

## The Tru: Protestant Position.

Touching this point, Dowling, the Protestant historian, says: "The Bible, I say, the Bible only, is the religion of Protestants." Nor is it any comment, in the estimation of the genuine Protestant, how early a doctrine originated if it is not found in the Bible. He learns from the New Testament itself that there were errors in the time of the apostles, and that their pens were frequently employed in combating those errors. . . . The consistent and true-hearted Protestant, standing upon this rock, "the Bible and the Bible only," can admit no doctrine upon the authority of tradition. . . . He who receives a single doctrine upon the mere authority of tradition, let him be called by what name he will, by so doing, steps down from the Protestant rock, passes over the line which separates Protestantism from papacy, and can give no valid reason why he should not receive all the earlier doctrines and ceremonies of Romanism upon the same authority."

Believing Jesus when he said, "Thy word, O Lord, is truth," we search the Scriptures in vain to find one text whereon to rest the dogma of Sunday or first-day keeping.

Mr. Gray quotes Col. 2:16, but leaves out the part which condemns his position: "Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of a holyday, or of the new moon, or of the Sabbath," and there he stops. Why not be honest and quote the whole text as it reads: "sabbath days: which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ." No fair-minded man will say the memorial of creation was the shadow of anything. It points backward to creation, not forward.

Further, he says: "The Sabbath day published God's claim to men's homage, and it proclaimed the necessity of attending to our spiritual interests in obedience to the Lord's commands. The Christian use of the first day honors God in like manner." Never. For it is a man-made rival institution, and makes of no effect the commandment of God.

On page 28 of this tract, Mr. Gray says: "If we look for any change or direct command for change from seventh to first, we shall not find it in the Gospels." This admission is enough for any genuine Protestant. And if the disciples met on Sunday evenings or on any of the other days of the week, it will not set aside the commandment of God.

## Creation and Recreation.

Mr. Gray's talk about redemption being greater than creation, is without foundation. Redemption is creation; for before a man can be redeemed he has to be created anew, and the Sabbath is the sign of the creative power of Christ. "If any man is in Christ, there is a new creation." 2 Cor. 5:17 (R. V., margin).

In baptism Christ has established a memorial of the resurrection (Rom. 6:4, 5), which Mr. Gray by using sprinkling has lost. There cannot be two memorials of the same event. Consequently, Episcopalians, Catholics, and many others, having no memorial of the resurrection, are obliged to have recourse to Sunday observance, a doctrine which rests on tradition alone.

In closing, I appeal to you as individuals who are judgment-bound to come out of Babylon, "that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues." Come out of confusion, and, like Daniel of old, be zealous for the law of your God; for whoever shall do and teach these commandments shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven. Matt. 5:19.

"Are you 'doers of the word,' O, my brothers?
Are you looking for the coming of the Lord?
All in vain your expectations, O, my brothers.
If you be not 'doers of the word.'"
