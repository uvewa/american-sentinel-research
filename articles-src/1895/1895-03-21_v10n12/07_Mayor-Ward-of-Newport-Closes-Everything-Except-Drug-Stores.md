## MAYOR WARD OF NEWPORT [ARKANSAS] CLOSES EVERYTHING EXCEPT DRUG STORES.

NEWPORT, March 4.—This city is considerably worked up over the action of the mayor in causing every shop and store in town to be closed Sundays. Heretofore some grocery, notion, and confectionery store; have been running on Sundays the same as on any other day. The mayor concluded several weeks ago to stop this as there is a law against selling goods on Sunday. As a consequence several grocery men were arrested and their trial set for next Tuesday.

Yesterday everything in town was closed. Cigars and tobacco could not be bought for love nor money. The mayor says he is going to enforce the law if it "takes the skin off." —Little Rock (Ark.) Gazette, March 5.
