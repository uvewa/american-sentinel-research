# DEFENSE OF BYRD TERRY.

Once Enslaved by the State; now Condemned to the Chain-Gang by the State Church. Crime-Lifting a Wheelbarrow over a Fence on Sunday.

I AM here, gentlemen of the jury, charged with working, doing malicious work, on Sunday. I deny that charge; I don't think I work "maliciously" on any day.

I want to say to this jury that I observe the seventh-day Sabbath; and since I gained a knowledge of the true Sabbath I have thought it my God-given privilege to work on the remaining six days, though I knew that it was in violation of the law of Tennessee. But there are two sabbaths, a rival sabbath and the Sabbath of the Lord. Now, the State says that I must rest on Sunday, and God says that I must observe the seventh day. Well, now, who must I obey? Answer for yourselves. And if you gentlemen require me, as the law says, to rest on the first day of the week, and if you will answer for me before God, and be responsible for me there, then take the case into your hands and compel me to do these things.

I want to say this, gentlemen of the jury: I was born and raised a slave, and until the emancipation, of course I never enjoyed any freedom at all, but since the emancipation, I thought this was free America, and I felt that I was a free man to do just as I pleased, so long as I did not infringe on the rights of others.

I have made some advancement in divine life. In studying the Bible, I found that I was wrong, and that God did not require me to keep the first day of the week as the Sabbath; and my honest conviction was that the seventh day was the Sabbath. From that day to this I have been observing the seventh day to the best of my ability. Yet I am a law-abiding citizen until the law comes in conflict with my conscience. God says for me to observe the seventh day and the State says for me to rest on the first. I call this a parallel case to the three Hebrew worthies. No doubt it was said to them that they could bow down to the image and reverence their God too. But we cannot do this, gentlemen; it is a life and death question with me, and if I tip the hat to the rival sabbath, to the sabbath that the State has set up and says that I shall observe, if I tip the hat to that, I show that I do not reverence the God of the universe.

The Sabbath is God's memorial of his creation, and not only that, but is a sign of his recreation; and I feel to-day, gentlemen of the jury, that a recreation has been wrought in me, and if that be so, I must reverence the laws of my God.

This is the first time that I have ever been brought before the court. I have neither cheated nor defrauded any man; I pay my just and honest debts. I owe some debts and will pay them when I get where I can. I have wronged no man; and there is not a man here under the sound of my voice that can say that I have ever stolen anything from him. I have tried to lift my own people from that degraded state into which they have fallen; and my desire is to live right and be a good citizen. I do want a home in heaven, and just as certainly as I renounce my allegiance to the God of heaven and go against my own convicted conscience, and obey a bad law that has been set up by unthinking men, then I will lose my eternal interest in the kingdom of God.

I don't want to impeach any of the men who made the law, for I respect them; I have nothing against any of them. His honor that sits upon the bench is a gentleman, and I respect him as such. The Bible says to love your enemies, and them that persecute you, and I am so glad that I love the men who have had me indicted.

I call this religious persecution, though you may call it what you please. The reason why I call this religious persecution, is because I have been a citizen of this county for several years, and even lived here in Dayton and worked for the Dayton Coal and Iron Company on Sunday, since I was an Adventist; and went to and fro through the town with my working clothes on, and never was interfered with, molested, or bothered. But as soon as I left this place and moved to Graysville, and there began to exercise my God-given privilege, quietly and peaceably, why then I am charged with violation of the law. But, gentlemen of the jury, look well to the law and see whether it is a good one.

Now I leave the case with you to decide. I can only say with the apostles, "We ought to obey God rather than men." The case is with you; do just as you will with it, but remember that you will have to meet your decision in the Judgment.
