# A SIGNIFICANT MOVEMENT.

There is at present a most significant movement going on in connection with the Christian Endeavor Society, as shown in their convention held in Boston recently, on the line of religion enforced by law; the results of which will be speedily felt. The convention itself was a notable one, probably one of the largest religious gatherings ever held, representing nearly all parts of the world.

The leading purpose of the organization, as expressed by its leaders and public speakers, is to unite all the denominations composing the organization into one determined effort to carry out the principles of "civic reform," as represented by what is now known as "Christian citizenship." Bishop Samuel Fallows, of Chicago, said:—

The Y. P. S. C. E. is one of the grandest movements in the direction of Christian unity the Church of Christ has ever known. It stands for civil service and other phases of civic reform.

Rev. A. M. Phillips, of Montreal, said:—

Mankind must be made to feel that it is absolutely wrong to divorce the sacred from the secular—to separate religion from politics. The true principle is, business is religion, politics is religion. The objective point of Christianity as taught must be changed. The consummation of Christianity is not in a happy land far, far away, but in this real old sin-cursed earth; nor is it to be looked for in the distant visionary good time coming or the sweet by and by, but in the near now and now. Denominational pride and bigotry must give way to Christian unity and cooperation.

Rev. William G. Clark, D. D., of Chicago, said:—

Practical Christianity means, among other things, a Christian politician and a Christian statesman. False to your nation and you are false to your God. Loyal to either and you are loyal to both.

Many columns like the foregoing might be quoted from the sayings at the convention. Christian citizenship, as defined by the tracts of this society, "maintains the supreme right of Jesus Christ to rule municipal and national as well as private life. The city, the State, the nation, should be governed by the principles laid down by him,—principles of righteousness, of justice, of unselfishness. Upon the application of these principles depends the final solution of every present day problem."

Christian citizenship has taken a definite form in the Christian Citizenship League. It is proposed to have auxiliary leagues in every city, ward and town in the country. It is also proposed to watch every candidate for office and see that no one is elected except such as conform to their ideas; and also to influence legislation in whatever direction they may wish, by making a united demand for it, in such a way that legislators will not dare to refuse. When we consider the vast power that can be exercised by these Christian Endeavor societies, numbering as they already do over a million voters, which will probably be multiplied many times soon, it will not require a prophet to tell what future legislation in this country will be.

A prominent object of Christian citizenship is, their views of the Sabbath enforced upon all. Congressman Elijah A. Morse said in the convention:—

Another element of good citizenship, and conducive thereto, is a sacred, religious regard for the sabbath day, as a day of rest and surcease from toil. The command given on Sinai, "Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy," was given for every nation and every people; for that century, for the 19th and 20th centuries, and for the 200th century, if the world shall continue so long. And I firmly believe that the prosperity of any individual, family, State, or nation may be measured by their regard for the holy sabbath day. The command to observe it is side by side with, "Thou shalt not steal," "Thou shalt not bear false witness." Christian Endeavors, love and defend the sabbath day.

Dr. Hoyt also said in the convention, as reported in the secular press:—

They should remember that Christian Endeavor is but a servant of the Church, that the meaning of Christian Endeavor was to withstand drifts, to combat corrupt politics, to keep on saying that the politics of this country, city, State, and county are to be pure. There was another drift which would have to be met also, and that was sabbath desecration. He thought that the most immoral influence of the present day, is the secular Sunday newspaper, and Christian Endeavors ought to declare themselves on this point.

The following is from the Christian Citizen, the organ of the Christian Citizenship League:

One of the significant signs of the times is the increasing number of young men and young women, all over the country, who are identifying themselves with reform movements of various kinds, and especially with the Christian citizenship leagues of their respective localities. In this way, each local society of Christian Endeavor, or Epworth League, or Baptist Union; each Young Men's Christian Association; and each church, is being made a nucleus of reform. The demand for Christian citizenship literature, for public meetings, for speakers on the subject, constantly increases with the increase of the numbers of those interested. Committees are being appointed by the young people's societies, and charged with the superintendance of civic concerns. The churches, not as churches, but through their members, are readily and rapidly federating for good government, and for the conservation of distinctive and imperilled American institutions, such as the American Sunday and the free school system. Sermons and prayer meetings and worship begin to take the form of political activity. The spirit of reform, defensive and offensive, is abroad. Let it stay abroad, and strike quick and strike hard until evil is down and good is up.

The enthusiasm shown in this great convention, in this Christian citizenship movement, was very great; it was the principal line of effort that was to be made; and with the Christian Citizenship League with its machinery for work, all perfected, with enforced Sunday observance one of its main objects, it certainly will not be long before the persecutions now carried on in Tennessee against those who keep the seventh day as the Sabbath, and work the other six days according to the commandment, will be waged all over the country
