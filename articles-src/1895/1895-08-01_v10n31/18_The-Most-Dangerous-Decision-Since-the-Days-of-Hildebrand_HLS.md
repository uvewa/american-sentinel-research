# THE MOST DANGEROUS DECISION SINCE THE DAYS OF HILDEBRAND.

DES MOINES COLLEGE,
AFFILIATED WITH
THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,
H. L. STETSON, PRES.

Des Moines, Iowa, July 2, 1895.

REV. A. H. LEWIS, D. D., Plainfield, N. J.

Dear Brother: While I do not believe in the religious observance of the seventh day as Lord's day or the Sabbath, I desire to enter my hearty protest against the legal prosecution of those who hold and practice the opposite belief. The principle which has been announced by the courts which has condemned these men is one of the most dangerous to religious liberty that has ever been enunciated since the time of Hildebrand. If this is good law, then the fight for religious freedom is before us, and we shall have stern work on our hands.

Very truly,
H. L. STETSON.
