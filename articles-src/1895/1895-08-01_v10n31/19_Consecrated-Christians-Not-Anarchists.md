A WRITER in the Cincinnati Tribune of July 20, closes a vigorous protest against Tennessee's treatment of Seventh-day Adventists thus: "What a bitter feeling must be in the hearts of these people who feel this great injustice. Will they leave prison consecrated Christians or anarchists?" The writer reckons with the natural heart only. The Adventists are Christians and consequently entertain no bitter feelings toward their persecutors. Their Master loved his enemies; so do they. Mr. Terry, whose defense is printed in this issue, said to a crowded court room: "I am so glad that I love the men who have had me indicted." The men will come out of the chain-gang "consecrated Christians" not "anarchists." They will come out as they went in, good citizens. They will obey the laws of Tennessee—not in conflict with the law of God—just as faithfully as before—not from constraint, but for conscience' sake. The same conscientiousness that led them to violate a God-defying statute, will lead them to obey all laws not in conflict with their duty to God.
