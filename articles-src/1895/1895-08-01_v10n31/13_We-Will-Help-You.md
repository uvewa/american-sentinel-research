# WE WILL HELP YOU.

"How I wish all my friends could read that SENTINEL," is a sentiment expressed by many of our readers on receiving some special number of the SENTINEL; but as it costs one cent each to mail the SENTINEL, many have, for this reason, used but a limited number of papers in this way. Here are offers which will enable you to send a single issue of the SENTINEL to scores, yes, hundreds of your friends for the first cost of the paper, without the additional postage:—

## OFFER No. 1.

Send a list of the names and addresses of your friends, plainly written, and we will send the SENTINEL you name to any number of names for one and a quarter cents each.

## OFFER No. 2.

Send us wrappers, shaped and addressed similarly to the following cut, and we will send the SENTINEL you desire to one hundred names for one dollar.

Wrappers of thin manilla paper are the best. Be careful to write the names and addresses plainly, and write them about an inch or an inch and a half from the edge. The wrappers should be about eight by eleven inches; with the corners clipped, as in cut. In mailing the wrappers to us, don't fold them but roll them.

Try one of these plans on our excellent extra of July 18. Keep these directions for future reference.
