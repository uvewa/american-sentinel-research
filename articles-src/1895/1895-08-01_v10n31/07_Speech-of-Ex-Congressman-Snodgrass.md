# SPEECH OF EX-CONGRESSMAN SNODGRASS.

As previously stated in these columns, ex-Congressman Snodgrass, at the recent trial of the Adventists, in Dayton, Tenn., addressed the jury by permission of the prosecuting attorney. We have secured a report of the speech of Mr. Snodgrass, and insert it here:—

These are cases of considerable interest, not only to the unfortunate people who persist in the constant violation of the law, but it is a matter of great moment to all the people, not only in Rhea County, but the whole State of Tennessee.

Now, so far as I am personally concerned, no man is in favor of larger liberty than I am, both religious and personal. I believe that this law under which these people are being prosecuted is bad policy, and is wrong; that is my personal notion about the law. I also believe, notwithstanding the Supreme Court of the State has passed upon the act in question and held it to be constitutional, that it is unconstitutional and an infringement of the Bill of Rights. In the Bill of Rights every American citizen is guaranteed the right to worship God according to his own conscience. No man can force him to keep up a religious denomination. No man, in my judgment, under that law, is compelled to keep any special day. Whatever his conscience dictates, my personal judgment is, under the organic law of the land, he has a right to that so far as the working upon Sunday or Saturday is concerned.

The court is not to make a law, nor to repeal a law, but to enforce a law. It is not the province of the court, nor is it the province of the jury, to say whether a law is a bad law or a good one. The only duty you have to perform when you take your seat in the jury-box, is to render a verdict according to the evidence produced in the case.

I tell you it is a bad law. My sympathies go out to all these misguided people. They are no doubt honest in their convictions, but I want to refer them to another injunction on that point—to the injunction in which they are commanded to obey the "powers that be" and be subject to the law.

The court, or some other power, ought to issue a letter of amnesty and turn all these people loose, and notify the grand jury that they should not again be prosecuted under this law.

I say this law ought to be repealed, but until it is repealed it is the duty of every Christian man—it is the duty of every law-abiding citizen that loves the law—it is his duty to abide by the law and to take such steps that will insure its repeal. That is the action that ought to be taken. Now, if your honor please, I know it is a difficult matter to enforce a law where public sentiment is against it.

If men were imprisoned, or sent to the workhouse, and allowed the ordinary privileges of a citizen; if they can go to and from the jail at will, there is in fact very little punishment inflicted. So it is not the amount of punishment, in my judgment, that forces people to respect the law and to obey it, but it is the certainty of that punishment. It is the certainty with which the judgment is carried out. Now I know that there is a great deal of sympathy for these people. Many of them believe that they are obliged to work on Sunday. It has been contended before this court that it takes all the six days to make a living.

I am not here to say that this does not work a hardship. As a matter of dollars and cents, a man had better work even five days and lose one day rather than pay the fine and penalty for a violation of the law. So there is no theory upon which this can be put, unless a man is controlled by wild fanaticism.

We are not commanded and enforced by God to work every other day, so no man need be stirred on that question. And until the law is repealed, they would only lose one day. And if they are so industrious, why not work a little later at night and a little earlier in the morning to make up the time of the odd day?

The violation of this law simply gets up a spirit of antagonism. And as long as it stands, they have a cudgel to strike you with, and the more you probe a man, the more inclined he is to show some kind of resentment. I am afraid, on both sides, this thing has been carried too far. It would have been far better if the people would have overlooked the work on Sunday, and all joined in the repeal of the law. But I want to say to this people, that I am afraid you are doing worse in violating this law; you are getting up more vexation, more spite, and it is far more injurious to you than the day that you would lose. And so far as I am concerned, they are good citizens; I am satisfied that they are good Christians—do all they can to serve God, and I honor them for it, and I would be glad, may it please your honor, if every one of these prosecutions should be dismissed.

So long as they get up here and confess that they have violated the law; that they believe that Saturday is the day, and that they must work on Sunday in order to support their families, there is nothing left for you, gentlemen of the jury, except to return a verdict of guilty. Here you are to pass upon the facts and the law, and all you can do is to convict them.

Mr. Snodgrass is evidently strongly opposed to the condition of things which makes the prosecution of Seventh-day Adventists possible, and all of these persecuted people and their friends will be pleased with the ex-congressman's sympathy for them and his complimentary words regarding their character as citizens and Christians; but they cannot follow his well-meant advice. The matter is not one of dollars and cents. It is true that it is a hardship for a poor man to be deprived of one-sixth of his time in which to make a living, but this is not the motive for violating the judicial Sunday legislation of Tennessee. The persecuted men in their defense, have sometimes mentioned the fact that they needed the six working days in which to labor for the support of their families, but this was referred to merely as an evidence of the injustice of Sunday statutes.

The reason Seventh-day Adventists refuse to bow to Sunday statutes, was repeatedly stated by the men tried in the hearing of Mr. Snodgrass. It is because Sunday observance is the badge of the great apostate from the Word of God, and Sunday statutes seek to compel all men to wear that badge.

The New Orleans Times-Democrat, of July 5, expresses the situation thus forcibly:—

On the one side is the express command of Jehovah to keep the seventh day holy; and opposed to it is the injunction of secular legislators to keep the first day holy. That is the difficulty in which the Seventh-day Adventists find themselves, and as we said, they obey the voice of God rather than the voice of man.

To this pointed statement of the "difficulty," the Adventists would simply add, that behind these "secular legislators" and acting as their animating spirit, is the religious element which demands that the Adventists bow down to the opposing sabbath which men have set up. To obey the voice of God rather than the voice of man, is an evidence of Christian fortitude, not fanaticism; of a truth-directed, not a misguided mind.
