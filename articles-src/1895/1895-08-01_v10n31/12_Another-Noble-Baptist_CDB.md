# ANOTHER NOBLE BAPTIST.

Camby, Minn., July 11, 1895.

Rev. A. T. JONES, New York, N. Y.

Dear Brother: To-day I was handed a copy of the AMERICAN SENTINEL, dated April 11, 1895.

I wish to say that I admire the Christian courage manifested by those Seventh-day Adventists who suffered for conscience' sake. I have lived amongst Seventh-day Adventists and I can testify that, as a people, they are law-abiding and peaceable.

Will you kindly write me whether you know of any Baptists who have appeared as their prosecutors?

Yours in Christ's bonds,

CHAS. D. BLAKER,

Pastor of Baptist Church.
