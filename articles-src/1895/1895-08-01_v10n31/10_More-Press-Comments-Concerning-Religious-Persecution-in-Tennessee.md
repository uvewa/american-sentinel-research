# MORE PRESS COMMENTS CONCERNING RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION IN TENNESSEE.

## Invited to Kansas.

[From the Evening Standard, Leavenworth, Kans., July 13.]

We advise the Adventists of the South to pull up stakes and come to Kansas where the law gives them permission to live out their religion. It would be well for this country to pluck the beam of religious persecution from its own eye before it rushes off to Constantinople to remove the mote from Turkey's eye.

## Religious Intolerance.

[From the Buffalo (N. Y.) Express, July 18.]

Rhea County, Tenn., has put a lot of Seventh-day Adventists who worked on Sunday, into the chain-gang. This sort of thing savors too much of the bad old days of religious intolerance.

## An Outrage.

[From the Fortress County Gazette, Jamestown, Tenn., July 11.]

The sentencing of the Seventh-day Adventists to jail in Rhea County is simply an outrage and a disgrace to the State. These men are simply worshiping God according to the dictates of their own consciences, and should be protected therein. They are only doing from religious conviction what many of their neighbors will do whenever convenient, although they think it is sin.

[From the Nashville American.]

Perhaps if those Seventh-day Adventists would open a gambling shop or a saloon on Sunday they would not be prosecuted by the energetic fee grabber.

## "Intolerant, Bigoted and Cruel."

[From the St. Louis Globe-Democrat, July 14.]

It is intolerant, bigoted and cruel to persecute and prosecute a sincere, earnest, and religious body of men and women, simply because they observe a day of rest which does not please the majority of people. It is not claimed that they interfere with the liberty or comfort or worship of any of their fellow-citizens, but only that they are offending the dominant religious sense of the community. That is what it practically amounts to.

## Ought Not to Be Silent.

[From the Ashland (Neb.) Gazette, July 12.]

Persecution for religious opinions has not wholly ceased, even in this boasted land of liberty. Even now, in certain States, notably in Tennessee, the most sincere and devout Christians, men of the best character, suffer imprisonment for conscience' sake. Members of the Adventist denomination, a large and respectable class of Christians, have been imprisoned within the last few years in Tennessee, Arkansas, Georgia and Maryland, under circumstances that make it perfectly clear that religious intolerance, rather than a reverent regard for the Christian sabbath, was the animus of their prosecution. When the Sunday beer garden, the gambling house and the brothel are allowed to run unmolested, and a quiet, inoffensive citizen, who conscientiously believes that the Sabbath of the Mosaic Institutes is still binding in the Christian dispensation, and whose impecunious condition would render it a great hardship to be compelled to lose his labor two days in the week, is arrested and carried off to prison for hoeing in his garden on Sunday; the case is so full of persecution that lovers of religious liberty and untrammeled conscience ought not to be silent.
