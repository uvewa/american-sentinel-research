THE authorities of Rhea County, Tenn., have not endeavored, by the means commonly employed in such cases, to force the persecuted Adventists, whom they are robbing of their time, to work on the Sabbath, but they have threatened them with a longer term of imprisonment. They have told them that if they did not work Saturday their time would not count on that day. And it has been further intimated that they will be required to pay for their board on that day, by serving an additional length of time. If anything were needed to show conclusively and plainly that the County Court of Rhea County is in sympathy with the persecution, it would be supplied by these facts.

Section 15, Article 11, of the Constitution of Tennessee, provides that "no person shall, in time of peace, be required to perform any service to the public on any day set apart by his religion as a day of rest." This constitutional guarantee is most palpably violated by the authorities of Rhea County by their threat to increase the term of imprisonment of the persecuted men, unless they work on the day set apart by their religion as a day of rest.

If this additional iniquity shall be attempted, the man whose term first expires could secure a writ of habeas corpus and demand his release of Judge Parks, who, we are sure, would promptly discharge the petitioner.

The authorities of Rhea County are robbing these men of their time and depriving them of their liberty under color of law. It should be seen to that they proceed no farther than that color extends. As they have invoked the so-called Sunday law of Tennessee, they should be required to respect the undisputed provisions of the fundamental law of that State. We do not believe, however, that Sheriff Darwin will become a party to any such violation of the constitution. We believe him to be a man of better principle; but even if he were not, he would realize that such an act might be fraught with serious financial consequences to himself and his bondsmen.
