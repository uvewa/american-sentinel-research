# FROM A TENNESSEE CHAIN-GANG.

[We are permitted to print the following private letters, written by one of the Adventists now serving in the Rhea County chain-gang to a friend in Atlanta, Ga., and by him sent to us.]

Rhea County Chain-Gang,
Spring City, Tenn., July 20, 7:30 P. M.
D. W. REAVIS, Atlanta, Ga.,

Dear Brother: I have just received your two good letters of the 18th and 19th inst., with stamps. We also got Review, Signs, Sentinel, Home Missionary, and Sabbath-School Worker. I am certainly willing to keep you posted, to the best of my ability. I always read the letters to the other brethren and ask them to notice if the news given is perfectly correct. I want to get it all just as it is.

We are all well and happy in the Lord. Brother Abbott was with us to-day. He came up this morning and went back this evening.

Yesterday Mr. Merriman, a reporter from Chattanooga for the New York Recorder, and Mr. Bugler, an artist from Dayton, came up and took our photographs at work at the approaches to the Piney Bridge; also one of the workhouse, and one of our tent. The reporter took many notes and asked many questions in regard to the trials, etc. You can get the pictures from Mr. Bugler, at Dayton, if you wish them.

I got a letter from a photographer at Huntsville, Ohio, sent to the sheriff at Dayton, then to me. It had been on the way a week. The writer had heard we were in Dayton jail, and said he would like to come and take some good pictures of the jail and court house, etc., also of some of our homes, wives, children, etc. He said if we wrote to him, he would be with us over this Sabbath; so I wrote and told him to come. I mailed the letter yesterday.

Mr. Howard (a deputy sheriff) came to us this morning and said he supposed this was the day we did not work. We told him it was. He said we could not work to-morrow (Sunday) or, it would not do for us to work to-morrow. Then at noon he said that our time would not go on to-day. But every day counts in jail to everybody in workhouse or chain-gang, work or play, except to us. We heard this evening that we would have to pay for our board on the Sabbath, that is, work it out. We do not know for sure that they will do that. But they have said that our time does not go on on the Sabbath. Allen Cathey refused to work to-day and they chained him upstairs and gave him bread and water.

Our cooks are two negro women and one man, and real criminals. One cut her husband's throat and is now in for fighting; the other is in for cutting a negro man with a razor; and the negro man is also in for fighting. They are cursing and quarreling at each other and everybody else all the time. It makes us think of, "Behold I send you forth as sheep among wolves." We generally have cold biscuit and syrup for breakfast, and sometimes not enough of that. Sometimes we have potatoes and cabbage cooked by the above-described cooks.

They have hog meat and coffee, but we don't use either. We get enough grease in the other things. Don't think we are complaining. I am only trying to give you the facts in the case. God is helping us to stand this splendidly. We all stand the work, though in a hot place, as well as we ever stood any work in our lives.

We find that there are some people here who have been keeping the Sabbath, and others are convinced. I have more reading and writing than I can do. I am happy, and "my cup runneth over." Pray for us continually, that we may walk right in this position that we occupy as prisoners for Christ.

I had one letter from Brother Moon and two from Brother Tait. The barrel of health foods was shipped to us about the 14th. I suppose we will soon get it.

The Dayton Republican is read by many of the best people up here, and is truly a sentinel.

Your brother in Christ,
W. S. BURCHARD.

Dear Brother: We have just come in from work. All are well except Brother Moyers; he has not been very well since he came here, and he has not worked any yet.

I have nothing very important to write this time. The cooks have been fighting to-day. One snatched up a Winchester and snapped at another, but it did not go off. Two more of the prisoners escaped to-day, and there is $5 reward offered for them.

To-day has been cooler than usual, and we have stood the work splendidly.

We are of the best of courage in the Lord; the blessings of God are truly with us. I have heard the brethren rejoicing many times to-day in the truth. We are standing everything splendidly.

Yesterday (Sunday) was a good day with us; many visitors came to see us and talk with us about the truth. Some of the best people here are convinced of the truth and are almost ready to keep the Sabbath.

Brethren Terry, Kerr and Plumb went to the colored church last night, and they invited Brother Terry to take charge of the meeting, and he did so. Brother Terry says to tell you that the colored people here are very anxious to hear preaching.

Your brother in Christ,
W. S. BURCHARD.
