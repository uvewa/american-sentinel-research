# Earning Their Bread.

COUNTY PRISONERS PUT TO WORK ON THE SPRING CITY BRIDGE.

[From the Dayton (Tenn.) Republican, July 19.]

MONDAY, nineteen county prisoners were taken to near Spring City and put to work on filling in the approaches to the new bridge in course of construction over Piney River.

The prisoners are under the supervision of J. A. Howard, deputy sheriff. Suitable quarters have been provided for them near the place of operation. It will take about twenty days to complete the work on the bridge and after that the prisoners will be worked on the county roads, probably first near Graysville.

Among these prisoners are eight Adventists, who are serving out fines and costs that will keep them at work between sixty and eighty days. There has been some speculation as to whether the officers would attempt to make them work on Saturday, their Sabbath. When asked as to this, Mr. Howard said: "No, we shall respect the Adventists' position and let them observe Saturday as they see fit. They are good people and will not be treated as the balance of the prisoners. They will be given accommodations as good as we can provide apart from the other prisoners, and will only be under nominal restraint."

And so it has come at last. Eight Christian men at work under duress of the law for following the dictates of their conscience as taught them by the Bible. We had hoped that Rhea County would be spared this odium. No, the officers need not be afraid these men will try to escape. They have the Spirit of the Carpenter of Nazareth, and will submit meekly to this maladministration of law and justice. People in whom the sense of justice is dead or never lived, may sneer and call them martyrs, but this does not alter the fact that a very arbitrary and stupid thing has been done in depriving these men of their liberty and making them work at the expense of the county for an honest, conscientious, and harmless exercise of what they consider their religious duty.
