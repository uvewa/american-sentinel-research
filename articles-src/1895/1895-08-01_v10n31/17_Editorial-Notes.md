READ the letter on the preceding page headed, "Another Noble Baptist."

We hope our readers will promptly avail themselves of our special offers which appear on page 247.

J. Q. ALLISON, of Austell, Ga., who, recently, so narrowly escaped the terrible sentence of twelve months in the chain-gang for plowing on Sunday, is again threatened with arrest.

We are informed that the Sunday-closing crusade has reached Plainfield, N. J., the home of our esteemed Seventh-day Baptist contemporary, the Evangel and Sabbath Outlook. If the movement really becomes serious, the Outlook will undoubtedly make matters interesting for the enemy.

SUNDAY, July 21, a Seventh-day Adventist carpenter was arrested in Chicago for working on Sunday. The case was heard on the 26th, at which time a nonsuit was entered, the police captain stating that they were after criminals, not honest workingmen. Chicago is not in either Tennessee, Maryland, or Georgia.

LET no reader of the AMERICAN SENTINEL forget that, during these hot summer days, honest, conscientious men, affectionate husbands, kind fathers, good neighbors, upright citizens, are driven in the chain-gang in Rhea County, Tenn., for no other offense than doing honest labor upon the first day of the week, after having "rested the Sabbath day according to the commandment."

THE enormity of the wrong done to the Tennessee Adventists now in the chain-gang for conscience' sake, is but feebly realized. They have wronged no one, yet they are deprived of liberty, are treated as enemies of society, are herded with criminals, are required to work as slaves, are subjected to conditions prejudicial to health, are compelled to neglect their families, and all this for absolutely no civil offense.

SABBATH, July 20, R. R. Whaley, a Seventh-day Adventist, of Church Hill, Md., was arrested on a justice's warrant, charging him with hoeing in his garden on the previous Sunday, July 14. He was tried on the 24th ult. and found guilty. The case was appealed. This is the third time that Mr. Whaley has been arrested for Sunday work. He is systematically watched by certain of his neighbors, who are determined to drive him from the community or compel him to keep Sunday.

THE New York Sun, of July 21, contained an article, a column and a quarter long, giving an account of the trial, conviction and punishment of Seventh-day Adventists in Tennessee, for doing common labor on Sunday. The article, aside from a few unimportant errors of fact, is a faithful presentation of the patient struggles of a few unoffending Christian men, for religious liberty, against the statute-entrenched creed of the majority.

WE know that the friends of the SENTINEL will be rejoiced to learn that our special issue of July 18, is meeting remarkable success. One hundred thousand copies have been printed, and orders are still coming in at the rate of ten thousand a day. We take occasion here to express our hearty appreciation of the loyalty manifested by our friends. Not only are our patrons manifesting a lively interest in this special number, but they have interested themselves in securing regular subscribers, and our list is steadily on the increase.
