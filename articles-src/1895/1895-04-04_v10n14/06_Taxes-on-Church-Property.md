# TAXES ON CHURCH PROPERTY.

[The following is reprinted from a galley proof of a forthcoming editorial in the Midland (Mich.) Republican, which was kindly sent us by the editor, T. W. Crissey.]

Those who "argue" in favor of the continued "exemption of church property from taxation" appear to lose sight of one of the essential facts of the case. It is this: That such property is not exempt from taxation and cannot be; the taxes have to be paid, but under the present system all the tax-paying people pay taxes on all the church properties regardless of preference instead of the taxes being collected for each property, as they should be, from those interested in the church to which the property belongs. If taxes were specific and could not be increased, it would be different, but where a certain amount has to be raised by tax and a portion of the property is "exempt" or rather is omitted from the tax roll, it simply means that the proportion of tax that would otherwise be collected from the owners of that property must be spread upon the rest of the property. For instance: If the property of a certain village, being all assessed, is valued at $100,000 and a tax of $3,000 is to be raised, the tax will be just three per cent. of the valuation; and if $10,000 worth of the property is in five churches with average valuation of $2,000 each, the persons interested in the good work of these churches will pay an average of $60 tax on each, amounting to $300 on the five. But if the $10,000 worth of church property is omitted from the rolls leaving but $90,000 valuation, the original tax of $3,000 has to be paid by somebody just the same. Now, dividing the $3,000 tax by the $90,000 valuation, we find the rate of taxation to be three and one-third per cent. Everybody's tax has gone up just one-ninth. The man who before paid $9 tax now pays $10; he who paid $90 now pays $100, etc., the additional dollar or ten dollars being his share of the church tax, which he is compelled to pay, without the satisfaction of knowing that it goes to the church of his choice. And if it happens that the church of his choice has only a poor, cheap building, or none at all, and one which he considers wrong, "heretical" or "apostate," has an expensive church, he has the mortification of knowing that the greater part of the tax he pays goes to support that church.

It is the same in regard to the county or the State tax. The great and needlessly expensive church properties of Detroit, Grand Rapids, Kalamazoo, Jackson, Ann Arbor and many other cities in the wealthier portion of the State, with their great organs, elegant furnishings, kitchens, parlors, etc., are omitted from the tax rolls and every taxpayer of every county in the State has his per cent. of State tax correspondingly increased, even though he may not have the privilege of going inside any kind of a church six times in a whole year. Is it right?

It is not a question of "exemption," for as we have shown the tax must be paid; it is a question of who shall pay it, those who are enjoying the immediate benefits in each case, or everybody, regardless of location, benefits or preference? The sober sense of justice does not approve the present system of so-called "exemption."

But the mere fact of unequal and unjust taxation is not the only nor the worst feature of the system. More dangerous still is the fact that while we claim that Church and State are and must be separate and independent, we enforce a system by which Church and State are united right along the financial nerve line. The Detroit News, while supporting the present system, boldly says: "Exemption from taxation is the American way of realizing the union of Church and State." It then goes on to say: "It is the only way it can be done under the broad charity which favors no section of the great Church, but acknowledges them all." It should have added: And compels everybody to pay regardless of his conscience.

The constitution of this State says (Art. 4, sec. 39): "The legislature shall pass no law to prevent any person from worshiping Almighty God according to the dictates of his own conscience, or to compel any person to attend, erect or support any place of religious worship, or to pay tithes, taxes, or other rates for the support of any minister of the gospel or teacher of religion." But the tax law of Michigan compels every taxpayer, not merely to "support any place of religious worship," but to help support every place of religious worship, and every place of alleged religious worship. While the Constitution says that he shall be free to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience, the law says in effect that he shall help pay the expenses of providing for other people's worshiping according to the dictates of their consciences and their love of elegant ease. Parsonages, often elegant and costly structures, the use of which is usually part of the pay, or support, of the minister, are also omitted from the tax roll, and every taxpayer is therefore compelled to help pay tax on every such building in the State, in direct violation of the constitutional provision above quoted that no person shall be compelled to "pay tithes, taxes, or other rates, for the support of any minister of the gospel or teacher of religion."

But there is a greater danger which has not yet fully developed itself, but of which the lessons of history give warning. The Supreme Court of the United States has already solemnly declared that this is "a Christian nation." It is not improbable, it is almost certain, that the time will come if the present system is continued, when certain bodies, or churches, which it will be claimed do not teach the true Christian doctrine, shall be excluded from the benefits of the "exemption" clause, on the plea that they are not true, or Christian, churches, and are doing harm rather than good.

And when once the system of paring and exclusion is begun, the result is not uncertain. The camel's nose will be followed by the whole body, until the law and the courts are called upon to decide which is "the church," and the "broad charity" which "acknowledges them all" will be narrowed down to the acknowledgment of but one, and history will repeat itself in the union of "the church" and the State. The spirit of ecclesiasticism is the same in all ages and only waits an opportunity.

True, the accomplishment of such an end may not be as easy in a republic as it was under the arbitrary enactments of a Constantine. But his edicts were doubtless influenced by what appeared to be the majority, and the majority even in a republic can be as tyrannical as a monarch. Yet, it is because of the possibility of avoidance of a disastrous fate, that the wrong steps already taken should be retraced before it is too late. The camel's nose should be driven out before he gets his neck and his feet inside the tent. The section of the tax law which provides for the omission of any church property from the tax rolls should, we believe, be repealed, and then there can be no opportunity for unequal dealing in that respect.
