# A TENNESSEAN'S VIEW OF SUNDAY LAWS, LOGICALLY AND TERSELY EXPRESSED.

In your issue of the 8th ult., some one undertakes to review my article on the Capps' case, which you did me the honor to copy from the AMERICAN SENTINEL, published in New York City.

Your correspondent seems to be greatly concerned lest to adopt correct principles on this Sunday question would lead to no Sunday law, and that were a great public calamity he seems to think. Now, that is just what is wrong with Sunday advocates. All correct principle, the rights of conscience and the plainest stipulations of the fundamental law of our political system, must go by the board, but the traditions of men, though derived directly and unmistakably from a Catholic source, as is the case with this Sunday idea, whether it is regarded as a civil or ecclesiastic institution, must stand as sacred and inviolable. And all this too in the very face of a pretended regard for sacred things, as is evidenced in the reference to a chapter of Paul's writings.

Suppose there were no Sunday law, would disaster necessarily follow? To say it would is a positive confession that there is absolutely no vitality nor merit in Sunday holiness, which is the underlying idea of all Sunday laws. That such is the idea with Sunday advocates is disclosed by your correspondent even in his brief dissertation, in such expressions as "the violation of the Sunday law is a violation of the law, both of God and man," and "desecrating the Lord's day," etc. Now if there were all this sanctity belonging to Sunday would it not be entirely secure in the affections and esteem of the people without a coercive law of civil enactment to make it so? When will the religious world learn that every appeal to civil power to sustain religious institutions or ideas as such is a direct confession of their weakness and want of merit in the divine conception? Oh! the deviltry and accursedness that have befallen mankind as the result of this dereliction on the part of religious teachers and leaders. The very fact that Sunday advocates will not allow Sunday to stand on its own merits as other religious institutions is proof positive that they would as readily make civil laws to sustain the others if it were a safe policy to thus all at once uncover their designs in the development of a union of Church and State that is almost openly being carried on in the religious world.

"Friend" is rather more candid than the balance of them in his treatment of the Sunday question, in that he virtually conceded that all the evil growing out of a violation of the Sunday law results from its being a violation of the law of God. If Sunday work is punishable by civil law because it is a violation of the law of God, why not make covetousness, adultery and all the evils the Master says "proceed from the heart of man," in its carnal state, also punishable by the same authority? They are all certainly violations of the law of God. It cannot be said they are offenses that cannot be detected. The same authority that instituted the Sunday law and all of like character easily discovered, through the Inquisition, the means to detect the most secret thoughts of men.

It may be safely assured that no such evil could result from the repeal of the Sunday law as that inflicted in its enforcement. Men would not have to suffer and languish in jail in this boasted land of religious liberty as did poor Capps and scores of others. The law of "natural affection" would not be violated shamelessly as it was in the Maryland case where the son was set upon his father as a spy upon an ordinary criminal, to detect him in Sunday work, when the work being done by the father was so quiet and orderly it could not be detected otherwise. Nor would the religious world be taught to look to the civil power to sustain the religious institutions, and thus trained and hardened for that season of persecution on a much larger scale, and all along the lines of religious bigotry and fanaticism now ripening for this country. Can "Friend" point to a single evil that may result from the repeal of his favorite law that will approximate a comparison to any one of these?

But all the milk in the coconut is let out in "Friend's" reference to whiskey selling on Sunday. All the trouble lies in this one dread apprehension. Now, has it never occurred to him that the opponents of the whiskey traffic could not put themselves in a more inconsistent and therefore compromising attitude than to emphasize as they do the selling of whiskey on Sunday, while it is being sold on other days. This emphasis carries with it all the force of a confession that it is all right to sell it on other days, and only wrong to sell it on Sunday because of the character of the day. But so it is with religious fanaticism, it is constantly involving itself in just such tangles as this.

And no less unfortunate is "Friend" in his reference to the thirteenth of Romans. If it meant the abject submission to civil authority in matters of religion and conscience that he insists upon, then the overturning the Episcopal Church in nearly all the original States of America as the religion established by the "powers that be" was a great wrong. Strange that the religious world won't learn that this divine law applies to civil government only in civil matters, and not in religious.

While no dare is intended, Martin is not so far off but a two or three days' personal tilt on this subject in all its bearing, civil and ecclesiastical, might be had. For the present this is enough.—Wm. P. Tolley, in Martin Mail, Rucker, Tenn., March 8.
