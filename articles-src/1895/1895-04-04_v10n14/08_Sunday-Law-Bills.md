# SUNDAY-LAW BILLS.

There are not less than half a dozen proposals pending at Albany for the reformation of our Sunday Blue Laws. Every one of them, without an exception, errs radically. They all recognize the right and duty of the State to prescribe and enforce the observance of Sabbaths, or, as our statutes put it, "holy time."

Right there lies the fundamental wrong involved in all our Sunday laws. A purely secular State has no business and no right to prescribe any form of religious observance. It has properly nothing to do with religion except to protect every citizen equally in his right to worship God or any gods he pleases in any way and at any time that may suit him, so long as he violates no law and does not interfere with the equal liberty of his fellow citizens.

The most radical of the pending bills is that of Mr. Adler. It provides that in cities of 500,000 inhabitants or more, any man may carry on his ordinary business on Sunday if he files with the police authorities an affidavit pledging him to keep some other day as a Sabbath.

This would be just as much a Blue Law as any enactment ever passed anywhere concerning Sunday. It rests absolutely upon the assumption that the State has a right to require the citizen to observe a Sabbath. If it has any such right it has a right also to select the particular day to be observed.

The Sunday laws ought to be repealed, except as they make the first day of the week a holiday in the interest of rest and recreation and give opportunity for worship to those who are so inclined. The State ought to go out of the business of prescribing religious obligations for anybody.—The World, March 20.
