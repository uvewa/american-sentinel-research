UNDER date of February 2, the Christian Statesman published an address by Rev. J. J. M'Carrell (which it promises will soon be published with other addresses in pamphlet form), entitled, "Can Sunday Laws Be Enforced?" in which occurs the following:

The roaring lion of anti-Sabbatism has been going about over our commonwealth, and seems crouching for a final leap. He deserves to be watched, for he is dangerous. He must be bound in chains and reserved for destruction.

Let it be understood that the teaching and practice of Seventh-day Adventists touching the Sunday Sabbath are regarded by these Sunday-law crusaders as the "roaring lion of anti-Sabbatism."

Mr. M'Carrell gives the following as one means by which this lion is to be bound in chains and destroyed: "We have been judicially proclaimed a Christian nation. This is a decision of momentous importance in favor of Sunday laws." Verily this decision is being and will be used as a chain to bind and destroy American liberty; but "whom the Son makes free is free indeed," and no chain can bind or destroy this freedom.
