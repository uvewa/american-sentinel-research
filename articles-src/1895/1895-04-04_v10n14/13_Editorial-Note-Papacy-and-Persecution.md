"PAPACY and Persecution, or Did the Roman Catholic Church Ever Persecute?" This question is the title of No. 30 of the Religious Liberty Library, just issued. It has not been many years since the asking of such a question would have been like asking, Did the sun rise yesterday? But now things have changed. The Roman Catholic Church of to-day denies that the church ever persecuted, and a compromising Protestantism, blinded by the glamour of a false charity, is disposed to believe it. This tract of sixteen pages, proves beyond the possibility of a doubt, from Roman Catholic works themselves, that the church has persecuted at the instigation and with the cooperation and official approval of popes and councils. As Romanism is to-day posing as the author and conservator of religious freedom, now is the time to circulate this most opportune publication. Price 2 cents. Address the International Religious Liberty Association, Battle Creek, Mich.; or 43 Bond St., New York.
