# ANOTHER EXTRA.

THE SENTINEL of April 11 will be of special interest. The number will be devoted to an account of the imprisonment of Seventh-day Adventists at Dayton, Tenn., and the closing of their academy at Graysville. It will contain the defense of Elder Colcord, president of the academy, and an article explaining why Seventh-day Adventists choose to suffer imprisonment rather than accept liberty at the cost of obeying Sunday laws. This number will also contain a brief history of the persecutions which these people have suffered during the last few years. It will be illustrated with a picture of the jail where these persecuted men are now imprisoned, and a court-room scene from their trials, also a photo reproduction of a touching autograph sentiment penned by one of the convicted men in his little daughter's autograph album before going to jail.

Besides these, the extra will contain other features of interest that we have not space to announce.

Our extra of January 17 reached a circulation of 135,000, but it is expected that this number will have a circulation of half a million. It has been prepared with the advice and cooperation of the International Religious Liberty Association and the International Tract Society. Let every friend of truth and religious liberty make an exceptional effort to circulate this number. The times demand it. The whole country, from ocean to ocean, must be awakened to a realization that the liberties of all the people are imperiled by the wrongs being perpetrated on an inoffensive people in this the "land of the free," in the closing years of the nineteenth century.

Any quantity furnished at the usual price, one dollar per hundred; eight dollars per thousand.
