# RELEASE THEM.

This is the Sentiment in Regard to the Adventists.

The following petition is being circulated and freely signed by our citizens:

"To the County Court of Rhea County:

"We, the undersigned, citizens and taxpayers of Rhea County, respectfully petition your honorable body to release from the county jail and the further serving of their sentence, the following parties, known as Seventh-day Adventists: G. W. Colcord, I. C. Colcord, Wm. Burchard, Dwight Plumb, W. J. Kerr, Henry Burchard, E. S. Abbott and M. C. Sturdevant. We make this request for the following reasons:

"1st. The majesty of the law under which these Adventists were sentenced has been vindicated.

"2nd. Any further detention of these persons would be a useless and wanton expense on the county and your petitioners, and a hardship upon a large body of our best citizens.

"3rd. The prisoners named in this petition have in every respect, except the technical charge on which they have been confined, been law-abiding citizens of Rhea County, and bear unimpeachable characters for honesty of purpose and purity of lives. One of them is a minister of the gospel; another is a public educator; all of them are men of good moral character, sober, industrious, and are the innocent victims of a law designed to punish criminals and evil-doers. Our position is that it is the province of the law to punish criminals, not to manufacture them.

"In this connection we respectfully set forth our protest that in our opinion these Sabbatarian prosecutions should cease. It is detrimental to the best interests of the county that good citizens should be taken from their business, arrested, fined and imprisoned for exercising the sacred right to worship the God of creation according to the dictates of conscience. Not only this, but it is piling up useless costs against the taxpayers of Rhea County. Let us so conduct our county affairs as to show to the world that within our borders respect is had for the sacred, material and moral rights of each individual."—Dayton (Tenn.) Republican, March 23.
