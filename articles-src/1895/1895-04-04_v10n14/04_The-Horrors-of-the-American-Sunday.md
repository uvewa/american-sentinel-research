# "THE HORRORS OF THE AMERICAN SUNDAY."

The City Press, of London, Eng., for Feb. 14th, reports a discussion in "The Court of Common Council," upon the opening of "The Art Loan Exhibition," on Sundays. The proposition to open prevailed by a vote of 94 to 68. In the course of the discussion references were made to the "American Sunday" which will interest our readers. They show that what some people in America so much prize is not so highly prized by our English neighbors. This is what they said:

Mr. Deputy Ashby opposed the motion as a matter of conscience, and expressed an earnest hope that neither the Continental nor the American Sunday would be introduced into England. (Hear, hear.)

Mr. Lile expressed a hope that the horrors of the American Sunday would never be imported into England. (Applause.) Yet he saw in the present agitation a step in that direction—(hear, hear)—and a step that meant the opening of theaters, music halls, and the rest. As to what went on among the working classes on Sunday he ventured to say that there was more Sabbath-breaking among those living in the West end of London than among the humble denizens of the East-end. (Applause.)

Evidently the reputation of the "American Sunday" can be considerably improved before it reaches a high standard in London. As a matter of fact, however, England has no ground for comparison which is unfavorable to the United States. Neither can boast of anything more than a "traditional basis," and a "lost sacredness" for Sunday.—The Evangel and Sabbath Outlook, March 28.
