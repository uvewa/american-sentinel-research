THE AMERICAN SENTINEL, we are sure, is doing more for State secularization in America, than any other journal published. We read it with much interest each week. It is a Seventh-day Adventist paper and a sort of a Christian journal, but with this important difference, that it has such faith in the religion it advocates that it believes it can stand alone without crutches provided at the expense of the State. Every Freethinker who can afford to subscribe for it should do so.—Free Thought Magazine for March.
