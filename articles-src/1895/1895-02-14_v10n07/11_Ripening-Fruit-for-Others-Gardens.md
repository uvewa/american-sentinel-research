CARDINAL VAUGHAN, of the English Roman Catholic Church, boldly confesses that the ordinary way by which Rome gains converts to her communion is, that when certain classes of the English Churchmen are drawn into the ritualistic net, the fruit ripens so that energy enough on the part of the Romanists to shake the tree will give them possession of that which seems ready to drop into their hands.

The same spirit can be seen in the Roman Church here, and the same hope. In this country, however, it expects to gain much, as a reaction from the irreverence and laxity of discipline and doctrine which it claims are increasing in the Protestant churches with rapidity. — The Christian Advocate, Jan. 31, 1895.
