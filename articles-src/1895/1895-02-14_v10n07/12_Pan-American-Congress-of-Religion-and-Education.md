It is announced that "a pan-American congress of religion and education will be held during the coming summer in the United States to which people of all beliefs—Catholic, Protestant and Hebrew—in every country of North and South America, will be invited. The congress will last one week, and have two general sessions each day and ten sectional meetings each afternoon. Many of the highest dignitaries of Church and State, and wealthiest philanthropists of North America, have promised co-operation in the promotion of the congress.

"Rev. Samuel G. Smith, D. D., pastor of the People's Church, St. Paul, Minn., is the president, and Mr. S. Sherin has been elected secretary and general promoter of the congress. The fixing of the time and place of meeting has been referred to a special committee composed of the president, secretary, and Rev. Arthur Edwards, D. D., Chicago; Rev. H. W. Bennett, D. D., Akron, Ohio, and Rev. David J. Burrill, D. D., New York City.

"Among those who have promised co-operation are Archbishop Ireland and many prominent Catholics; Rev. Bishop Mahlon N. Gilbert, D. D. (Episcopal), of Minnesota; Rev. Bishop J. H. Vincent, D. D., of Kansas; Rev. Bishop J. H. Hurst of Washington, D. C.; Rev. Bishop C. H. Fowler, D. D., and President W. R. Harper, University of Chicago."
