A DISPATCH from Wilmington, Del., under date of February 5, says:

Very Rev. Friar Sylvester Jeorg, of the Catholic Church of the Sacred Heart, had a controversy with some of the Wilmington clergy about riding bicycles, and he wrote to Rome for a decision. Cardinal Isidorus sent him a decision rendered last September by the Holy See. A bishop in Hungary, forbidding one of his priests to ride a bicycle, a controversy resulted and the bishop appealed to Rome. The Holy See gave this decision:

"We embrace your action and your decision in the above matter, because the decision will save priests from being injured and prohibit them from setting a bad example and keep them from being joked by fellow priests."

The letter, it is stated, has caused a sensation in Wilmington, as nearly every priest there rides a bicycle.
