BALTIMORE, Jan. 30.—Bishop J. A. Latare of the Reformed Episcopal Church said in speaking of the pope's recent encyclical:

"It is a very bright and interesting paper, and many of the points it makes are good and timely. I like the conservative ground it takes in regard to labor unions, and commend most heartily its clear and strong deliverance on the subject of divorce.

"But in reading it there were two things which struck me unpleasantly. The first was its exhibition of statecraft, of worldly wisdom, of adroitness in the way it appeals to the American people while addressing the Catholics in America. The other and more serious aspect of the paper as it struck me was the imperium in imperio idea which pervades it. It will not tend to allay the fears of those who are watching with an anxious eye, the civil polity of the Church of Rome in this country. Its taking ground distinctly in favor of the union of Church and State, in defiance of the fundamental principles of our Government, and in disregard of the happy results achieved in this land by their separation; its intimation of the object of Archbishop Satolli's mission to consolidate the Church of Rome in this country, and its covert plea for the establishment by the papal power of a legation to this nation; its revealing the fact that the origin and plan and purpose of the university at Washington, were all carefully matured in Rome, and its urgent plea that promising young men who seem destined to hold places of power and influence in the Church in the future be sent from this country to Rome to complete their educational training; its stress upon the importance of the Church's parochial schools for Catholic children, and its earnest counsels to Catholic laboring men to unite in societies and associations only with Catholics and under the eye of the priest, are all matters which suggest food for serious thought to those who value our liberties in this Protestant land."—The Sun, Jan. 31.
