## OCR Corrections Made

### Page 1
- Line 33: "Assistant Ritualism" appears to be an OCR error; context suggests this should be the article title, not a subtitle. Retained as-is since it appears in the original scan.
- Line 47: "Exc. 20:12, 20" - appears to be "Exo." or "Ex." (Exodus), corrected to standard biblical citation format in context.

### Page 2
- Line 79: "Hottextot" - obvious OCR error for "Hottentot", corrected.

### Page 3
- Line 113: "'mild" - appears to be OCR error for "'mid" (midst), corrected.
- Line 164: "Recorder" - appears without article designation; context suggests this is a newspaper name, retained as-is.

### Page 6
- Line 344: Author signature "H. F. PHELPS" - initials HFP not found in known authors list, retained as new author.

### Page 7
- Line 504: "26th" - context suggests "cloth" binding, but OCR shows "26th", retained as uncertain.

### Page 8
- Line 531: "WILLSNOT" - obvious OCR error for "will not", corrected to "without".
