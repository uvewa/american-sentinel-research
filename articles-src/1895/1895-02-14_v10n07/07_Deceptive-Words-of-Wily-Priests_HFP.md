In the month of September, 1893, in the Catholic congress at Chicago, Mgr. Satolli, in addressing the Catholics of America, said: "Go forward! In one hand bearing the book of Christian truth—the Bible—and in the other, the Constitution of the United States."

In the year 1895 (Jan. 13), in the city of St. Paul, Minn., Archbishop Ireland gave an address in the cathedral, in answer to the agnostic, Ingersoll, on the subject, "The Bible: What is It, and What Has It Done?" In his opening remarks he said:

The Bible! My soul goes out to it in love, gratitude, reverence, worship. It is, indeed, the Bible-book of books. The voice of the great Master of the universe speaks to me through its pages; its light, illumining the religious and moral world, radiates from his own divine face; the sweetness which it distills is the tenderness of his own fatherhood. Written in it are my hopes of time and eternity. It is God's message to me telling of my Master and of my relations to him, marking my road to bliss, sustaining me on earth in trial and suffering, until the goal beyond heaven's portals is reached. They who insult the Bible insult what is in me and dearest to me; they insult my aspirations and my hopes; they insult my God, and I were a traitor to myself and to him were I not ready to defend it, even to the sacrifice of my life.

It is not the Constitution of the United States as our fathers framed it, nor the principles which were dear to them, that Mr. Satolli counsels the Catholics of America to carry forward; but it is the Constitution as now subverted in its very meaning, through the interpretation of the Supreme Court of the nation declaring that "this is a Christian nation," and by arguments that if they proved anything prove that this is a Catholic nation;—it is the Constitution thus interpreted that Roman Catholics are commanded to bear to the country. This is the Constitution that he had in mind: the Constitution of the United States misinterpreted; subverted and overthrown and made to testify to a falsehood. This is the Constitution which he would have the Catholics of America uphold; a Constitution absorbed and swallowed up by that most un-American hierarchy which Satolli represents.

And neither Mr. Satolli nor Archbishop Ireland means that the Bible as the Word of God to the individual man, is the Bible he would defend and carry forward; but the Bible as interpreted by the Catholic Church.

But there are many so-called Protestants of to-day who will read the words of these prelates of the Roman Church, and take them as evidence that Rome is advancing, becoming liberalized. Yes, she is advancing—to her prey. Advancing to take the spoil. And many will read this address of Mr. Ireland and think him to be the most liberal of all Catholics. Some people seem to forget that Rome has a peculiar faculty of saying one thing and meaning another; or saying a thing that may have a double meaning; or saying a thing and meaning much more. It is in view of this latter class that we must read the address at St. Paul; for while it ostensibly holds up the Bible and Christianity and Christian civilization, it must be read with the history of Rome ever before us. It must be remembered that "Rome never changes," and that her past record is indorsed at the present time. Says Archbishop Riordan:—

The church of to-day does not deny the dogmas of the Middle Ages. She is infallible. In the teaching of truth she has never made a mistake. Her belief now is the same as her belief a thousand years ago. She never held in one century what she had to disown in the next. Protestants naturally deny this. They think that the church has been corrupted, and has taught corrupt doctrines, which she has been forced to disown. Catholics repel the accusation.

Let it therefore be known to all that Rome has ever exalted tradition above the Word of God—the Bible. She has condemned the Bible to be burned, and burned it. Pope Pius VII warned the people to "have nothing to do with Bible societies, or the Bibles they circulate." Pope Leo XII., in 1824, and Pope Pius VIII., in 1829, and Pope Gregory, in 1832 and in 1844, all issued bulls against Bible societies, condemning the circulation of the Bible in the vulgar tongue. From the bull of Pius VII., I quote as follows: "Moreover, we confirm and renew the decrees recited above, delivered in former times by apostolic authority, against the publication, distribution, reading and possession of the books of the Old and New Testaments translated into the vulgar tongue." And this quotation is indorsed and quoted by Gregory XVI., in his bull of 1844, and it is from this bull that it is quoted in this article.

Now does Satolli or Ireland repudiate these bulls of the papal church? They would not be good Catholics if they should. Would they give the Bible to the common people, to study and to prize as they ought? Again, they would not be good Catholics if they did that. Then how should their words be understood? The Bible must first be interpreted by that church before it can go to the people, as is proved by words from the address of Mr. Ireland himself. In closing his remarks he said:—

Away with this unchristian world. [And everything is unchristian and heretical that is outside the Catholic Church.] Give me my Bible, and my Jesus; give me my holy church in which Jesus lives, teaching me his divine truths and nurturing my soul with his divine graces; give me my Christian faith and my Christian hope; give me my Christian heaven beyond the grave. Yes; give me Jesus, his church and his Bible.

With the history of Rome before us, we do not have to read between the lines to understand this utterance. It is not the Bible in the vulgar tongue that the Archbishop would defend from the attacks of agnostics,—defend it that the people might have it to enjoy; but it is the Bible strained through the councils and decrees of the Catholic Church, which is like straining milk through a coal sack. It means the Bible misrepresented, distorted, and subverted by the fathers, bishops, and decrees of the church. The Bible, like the Constitution of the United States, is lost in the dust and mire of Roman Catholic perversion.

Now let it be understood that it is not with Messrs. Satolli and Ireland that I have to do; but with the principles they advocate,—with the system they represent. I do not antagonize men, but false doctrines and conclusions drawn from wrong premises.

H. F. PHELPS.
