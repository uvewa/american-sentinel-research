A CERTAIN Protestant bishop characterizes the proposal to tax church property as "atheistic." If it is, then those who are opposed to support of the Church by the State must be atheistic. Exemption from taxation is a price paid by the State to the Church, and those who defend it do so on the ground that the Church does a service to the State by improving society, increasing the number of honest, law-abiding citizens, and decreasing the number of criminals and paupers. They acknowledge the compensation from the State and justify the taking of it as a quid pro quo. To us it is logically indefensible, where we have a free Church in a free State. The Church ought to ask no such special favor. Its aim is to make men better and to do all the good it can. This is in pursuance of the conscientious conviction that duty to God and man requires this measure of service, and that it ought to be rendered whether the State assists, opposes, or takes a neutral ground. We are satisfied in this country that it is for the good of the Church as well as of the State that the two should be separate, each occupying its own peculiar sphere, and that the Church being a voluntary organization, instituted for none of the purposes for which the State is organized, should pay its own way. It does not pay its own way if the State releases it from the obligations which all other property holders must assume. Hundreds of thousands of dollars are virtually paid by the State annually to the Church, in the form of unassessed taxes. Is this right? Is this fair to taxpayers not personally interested in churches? Does it not compel them to pay something every year that they would not have to pay if so much church property were not exempted? It is simply a relic of the State Church system, and it is no more atheistic to oppose it than it would be to oppose annual appropriations from the public treasury for the direct support of the ministry. The Baptists are largely in favor of doing away with this unequal and partial discrimination, and they are not atheists. It is not a question of religious belief or unbelief, but of entire separation of Church and State, and strict justice to all taxpayers. — The (N. Y.) Independent, Jan. 31.
