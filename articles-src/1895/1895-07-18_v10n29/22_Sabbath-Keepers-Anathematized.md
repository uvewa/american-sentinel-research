## SABBATH-KEEPERS ANATHEMATIZED.

Not long since, Father Enright, a Catholic priest, preached a sermon at Harlan, Iowa, which was reported in the Harlan American. The following is an extract from the report, and will help to explain why Seventh-day Adventists suffer imprisonment rather than keep Sunday. Under date of June 20, William Simpson, of Darrell, Ont., wrote Cardinal Gibbons, at Baltimore, asking if Father Enright correctly represented the Catholic Church on this question. Under date of June 23, the cardinal's secretary replied: "I beg to say that Father Enright is certainly correct in his assertions." Here are Father Enright's assertions:

"What right have the Protestant churches to observe that day? None whatever. You say it is to obey the commandment, 'Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy.' But Sunday is not the Sabbath, according to the Bible and the record of time. Every one knows that Sunday is the first day of the week, while Saturday is the seventh day and the Sabbath, the day consecrated as a day of rest. It is so recognized in all civilized nations. I have repeatedly offered $1,000 to any one who will furnish any proof from the Bible that Sunday is the day we are bound to keep, and no one has called for the money. If any person in this town will show me any scripture for it, I will, to-morrow evening, publicly acknowledge it and thank him for it. It was the Holy Catholic Church that changed the day of rest from Saturday to Sunday, the first day of the week. And it not only compelled all to keep Sunday, but at the Council of Laodicea, A. D. 364, anathematized¹ those who kept the Sabbath, and urged all persons to labor on the seventh day under penalty of anathema.

"Which church does the whole civilized world obey? Protestants call us every horrible name they can think of,—'antichrist,' the 'scarlet-colored beast,' 'Babylon,' etc., and at the same time profess great reverence for the Bible, and yet, by their solemn act of keeping Sunday they acknowledge the power of the Catholic Church. The Bible says remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy, and that the seventh day is the Sabbath, but the Catholic Church says, 'NO, keep the first day of the week;' and the whole world bows in obedience."

Eight honest, conscientious Seventh-day Adventists of Rhea County, Tenn., have been condemned to serve terms of from seventy-five to ninety days in the county jail at Dayton, Tenn., for the offense of doing common labor on Sunday—labor which disturbed no other person's private or public devotion. It has also been decided to work these honest men in the chain-gang, and by the time this reaches our readers this will doubtless be accomplished. For an account of the trial and condemnation of these men, see page 229.

We here submit for the benefit of all who think it their duty to force their views on others by the power of legislative acts, a noble sentiment from the pen of John Wesley, the founder of Methodism:

"Condemn no man for not thinking as you think. Let every one enjoy the full and free liberty of thinking for himself. Let every man use his own judgment, since every man must give an account of himself to God. Abhor every approach, in any kind or degree, to the spirit of persecution. If you cannot reason or persuade a man into the truth, never attempt to force a man into it. If love will not compel him to come, leave him to God, the Judge of all."
