## MORE RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION.

[From the New Orleans Times-Democrat, July 5.]

The Times-Democrat has had occasion several times recently to comment on religious persecution in several States of the South, especially Tennessee, Mississippi and Georgia. It has generally been the supposition that civilized countries had given over fining and jailing people for their religious belief and for action corresponding to that belief. But the supposition, in the light of the cases which we have already mentioned and the one which we are now about to cite, will have to be modified, or we shall be driven to make the painful admission that we are not so far advanced in civilization as we have taken ourselves, and as we often want ourselves, to be.

Everybody knows that a religious sect known as the "Seventh-day Adventists," who keep the seventh day of the week as the day of rest and religious observance, and who having worshiped on the seventh day perform their usual vocations on Sunday, is scattered pretty widely over the Union, having little colonies interspersed in many of the States. It is also well enough known that the "Seventh-day Adventists" are upright, industrious, law-abiding and God-fearing people, the genuineness and strictness of whose religious observances and the general rectitude of whose lives compare very favorably with those of any other sect in this broad land. These men prefer to obey what they honestly believe to be the voice of God than to obey human injunction to the contrary. The Almighty in days of old gave this commandment to his chosen people: "Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work; but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work." And this commandment was included in what was known as the "Decalogue" or "Moral Law"—a body of divine commands which is still inculcated by the various Christian sects. The Christian sects obey the whole moral law, just as it was received by Moses from Jehovah on Mount Sinai, with the one exception of the command in question. After the resurrection of Christ on the first day of the week, they changed the Christian Sabbath from the seventh day on which Jehovah fixed it, to the first day of the week, to be commemorative of Christ's resurrection. But the change was made, as far as we have heard, without divine authority; and those, therefore, Jews or Christians, who are strict constructionists of the law and are from strong religious convictions punctilious about such matters, and who keep the Sabbath on the seventh day as it was originally ordained, have at least as ample justification for their seventh-day observance as the great body of Christians have for their first-day observance.

On the one side is the express command of Jehovah to keep the seventh day holy; and opposed to it is the injunction of secular legislators to keep the first day holy. That is the difficulty in which the Seventh-day Adventists find themselves, and as we said they obey the voice of God rather than the voice of man.

And in this age of boasted civilization, they are punished for acting up to their religious convictions! They are fined and imprisoned for conforming to a command of Jehovah, which a State law seeks to nullify.

Tennessee should revive the thumb-screw and the boot, the stake and the fagot as well, and revert altogether to the inquisitional methods of mediaeval times. Failing that, she should lose no time in repealing monstrous laws which the very judges of her courts blush for the shame of having to enforce.
