- **Source**: B&W scanned PDF pages

## Specific Uncertainties

### Page 1, "Christ or Diana" article
- **Line**: "as if both to sacrifice so sweet a life"
- **Uncertainty**: "both" - context suggests this might be "loath" but OCR clearly shows "both"
- **Transcribed as**: "both"
- **Confidence**: MEDIUM
- **Resolution**: Kept as shown; grammatically unusual but readable in OCR

### Page 4, "Baptists and Sunday Statutes"
- **Line**: "Christ said (John 18:36): ... H-ay Christ refuses"
- **Uncertainty**: "H-ay" appears to be a broken word, likely "Hereby" or "Here" with line break artifact
- **Transcribed as**: "H-ay"
- **Confidence**: LOW
- **Resolution**: Kept as shown; clear OCR error but preserving exact text

### Page 5, Nash's Defense
- **Line**: "thy Almogor that is within thy gates"
- **Uncertainty**: "Almogor" - should likely be "stranger" from Exodus 20:10
- **Transcribed as**: "Almogor"
- **Confidence**: LOW - clear OCR error
- **Resolution**: Preserved as shown; obvious corruption of biblical text

### Page 5, Nash's Defense
- **Line**: "occurred in 221 a. n."
- **Uncertainty**: "a. n." - likely meant "A.D." (Anno Domini) - appears to be OCR misread
- **Transcribed as**: "221 a. n."
- **Confidence**: MEDIUM
- **Resolution**: Kept as shown

### Page 6, "They Are Partial in the Law"
- **Line**: "the officers whose oaths bind(f) them"
- **Uncertainty**: "(f)" after "bind" - unclear what this represents
- **Transcribed as**: "bind(f)"
- **Confidence**: MEDIUM
- **Resolution**: Kept as shown in OCR

### Page 6, footnote reference
- **Line**: "God-green right inherent in me"
- **Uncertainty**: "God-green" - should likely be "God-given"

- **Confidence**: LOW - likely OCR error
- **Resolution**: Preserved exact OCR output

### Page 8, masthead note
- **Line**: "LAST DAY: ANY ONE RECEIVING... IS THEY KNOW"
- **Uncertainty**: "IS THEY KNOW" - grammatically broken, likely should be "so they will know" or similar
