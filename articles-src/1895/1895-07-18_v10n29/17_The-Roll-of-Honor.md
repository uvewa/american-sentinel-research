## THE ROLL OF HONOR.

### The Press Protests Against Persecution.

The secular press of the country, irrespective of locality or political creed, is coming to a realization of the crimes perpetrated upon inoffensive Seventh-day Adventists in several States, and is speaking bravely for the oppressed. Without doubt not a tenth part of those that have condemned these modern persecutions has come to our notice, but through the kindness of their editors or some other friends of religious liberty, the following papers have reached us with editorial denunciations of these antichristian, un-American acts of intolerance. We hope the friends of religious liberty will continue to send us marked copies of these or other periodicals which discuss the subject, and we promise to add their names to this list if opposed to these persecutions, or to the list that follows this one, if they indorse the persecution:—
