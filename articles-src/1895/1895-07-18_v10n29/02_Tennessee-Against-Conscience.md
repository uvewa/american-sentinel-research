## Tennessee Against Conscience.

Eight men are now in jail at Dayton, Tenn., for refusing to cast the single grain of incense on the altar of what they believe to be a false worship.¹ Sunday, by many good people, is held to be the sabbath. They have a right so to think, and to conform their lives accordingly. But many who hold this belief demand more than this. They demand that their neighbors shall be made to at least act as if they too believed that Sunday is the sabbath. To this end they appeal to the government to enact statutes which shall force their dissenting neighbors to recognize that Sunday is the sabbath.

Some of these dissenters, like the eight men now in jail, not only believe that Saturday, the seventh day, is the only Sabbath of the Bible, but they believe that the Sunday-sabbath is an institution of the papacy, the "mark of the beast," the observance of which by one who is cognizant of this fact is to invite upon him the "unmingled wrath of God." With them life and death are at stake. That they are terribly in earnest no one can doubt. The kind-hearted judge, in passing sentence upon them, declared: "It must be patent, even to the most casual observer, that they are good citizens, who are thoroughly conscientious in the course they have taken."

And so now, instead of having pagan Rome against conscience, as presented in our illustration, we have the "Christian" commonwealth of Tennessee against conscience.
