## RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION UNDER THE STARS AND STRIPES.

Nine Honest Men In Jail. Crime—Working on Sunday. Penalty—Nearly $40 (Fine and Costs), or Ninety Days in Jail.

DAYTON, TENN., is now the scene of a travesty on justice worthy the Dark Ages. Nine honest, industrious men,—all Seventh-day Adventists, save one, and he the son of a Seventh-day Adventist lady, a widow, were tried July 1 and 2, convicted, and in default of payment of fine and costs amounting to nearly $40, were imprisoned in the county jail for terms ranging from seventy-five to ninety days.

These Seventh-day Adventists, after resting on the Sabbath as commanded of God, went about their usual avocations on Sunday. They disturbed no one's private or public worship. They were not charged with disturbing any one; the sole gravamen of their offense was that they violated the statute-entrenched sabbath of their neighbors, which violation by the courts of Tennessee has been declared a "nuisance"! an indictable offense, punishable with any amount below $75, in the discretion of the judge, and any sum above that amount in the discretion of the jury.

The defendants, following the instruction of Christ (Luke 12:11, 12), spoke in their own defense. They maintained that the civil law had a right to take cognizance only of acts which infringed the equal rights of others; and that as the keeping of a Sabbath had reference solely to God and the recognition of his claims upon them, to enforce its observance was clearly outside the sphere of human government. The defendants insisted that under the Bill of Rights of the State they could not be legally required to observe any day, and that they had a constitutional right not only to keep the seventh day but to work on the first day of the week, so long as in so doing they did not trench upon the equal rights of their neighbors.

The SENTINEL could not secure a stenographic report of their defense, and hence telegraphed the imprisoned men for a statement of their reasons for violating the Sunday statute. They replied as follows:—

County Jail, Dayton, Tenn.,
July 10, 1895.

AMERICAN SENTINEL,
New York City, N. Y.

According to your request, we write to you to give you a few short reasons why we refuse to obey the Sunday law, and go to prison instead.

The law of God says: "The seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work." Ex. 20:10. The law of the State says the first day is the sabbath, in it thou shalt not do any work; and since we regard the law of God above the law of the State, it only remains for us to decide what we are to do, and which law we will obey. We therefore follow the law of God.

The law of God requires us to regard the first six days of the week as working days, as verily as to regard the seventh day as holy. See Exe. 46:1; Ex. 20:9. That is, the first six days of the week must be regarded as working days, and God has always regarded them as such. But the State says that one of these is holy, and commands us to refrain from labor on that day in honor to the law of the State, and that too right in direct contradiction to the law of God, and hence we cannot obey it.

We look upon the Sunday-sabbath as the sign of the papacy,¹ that power that "exalteth himself above all that is called God" (2 Thess. 2:4), a sign set up by that power in opposition to the Sabbath which is a sign of God's creative power. In complying with the demand that we keep Sunday we would therefore violate the first commandment which says: "Thou shalt have no other gods before me."

We want to be good citizens, and will do all in our power to obey the laws of the State as long as those laws do not require us to trample on the law of God; but when we are required by the State to do things that are a violation of the law of God, we can only say: "We ought to obey God rather than men," and suffer the consequences. God gave a law to govern man, and told him to keep that law; but afterward man made a law directly opposed to the one the Lord made, and has put us in prison because we cannot conscientiously obey it. They say they will release us if we will pay a certain fine that they saw fit to impose on us, but we cannot pay the fine, for in so doing, we would recognize the right of man to inflict punishment on his fellow-man for his faith, and this we cannot do for we are Protestants. So they have put us in the jail.

We are of good courage, and the Lord is with us. We praise him for his kindness to us, and can say from experience that it is good to serve the Lord.

Yours very sincerely and fraternally,

¹Q. How prove you that the church hath power to command feasts and holy days?
A. By the very act of changing the Sabbath into Sunday, which Protestants allow of; and therefore they finally contradict themselves, by keeping Sunday strictly, and breaking most other feasts commanded by the same church.
Q. How prove you that?
A. Because by keeping Sunday, they acknowledge the same church and the same feasts and to command them under sin.—"An Abridgement of the Christian Doctrine," by Rev. Henry Tubercelle: Imprimatur, the Right Rev. Benedict, Bishop of Boston; Excelsior Catholic Publishing House, 5 Barclay St., New York, 1899, p. 38.
