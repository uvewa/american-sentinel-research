## ALEXANDER CAMPBELL AGAINST SUNDAY STATUTES.

SINCE the days of Roger Williams, there has not arisen in the popular denominations of America any other man who has so consistently and faithfully opposed the legal enforcement of Sunday observance upon the people, as did Alexander Campbell, the founder of the Christian or Disciple Church. As early as 1820 there arose in Western Pennsylvania what were called "Moral Societies," whose principal object was the enforcement of Sunday observance by means of legal pains and penalties. Mr. Campbell condemned the work of the societies, and a newspaper discussion followed, which continued in the Washington (Pa.) Reporter, from April 17, 1820, until February 22, 1822. The following is a sample of the irresistible logic of Mr. Campbell's arguments:—

There is no precept or command in the New Testament to compel by civil law, any man who is not a Christian to pay any regard to the Lord's day, any more than any other day.

Therefore, to compel a man who is not a Christian to pay any regard to the Lord's day, more than any other day, is without authority of the Christian religion.

The gospel commands no duty which can be performed without faith in the Son of God. "Whatsoever is not of faith is sin."

But to compel men destitute of faith to observe any Christian institution, such as the Lord's day, is commanding duty to be perfumed without faith in God.

Therefore, to command unbelievers, or natural men, to observe in any sense the Lord's day, is anti-evangelical or contrary to the gospel.¹

Speaking of his motive in opposing these compulsory Sunday observance societies, he said:—

"I wrote from principle; I had no object in view but one; viz., the suppression of an anti-rational, anti-scriptural, and anti-constitutional confederation, that I conscientiously believe to be dangerous to the community and inimical to civil and religious liberty. And while I am able to wield a pen, I will oppose everything of the kind, from the same principles, that comes within the immediate sphere of my observation."²
