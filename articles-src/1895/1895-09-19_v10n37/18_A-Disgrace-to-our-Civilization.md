A Disgrace to our Civilization.

[Milwaukee Daily News, July 26.]

Eight Seventh-day Adventists of Rhea County, Tennessee, have been sentenced to serve from seventy-five to ninety days in the county jail for the offense of doing labor on Sunday.

These men are very conscientious citizens. A Seventh-day Adventist is almost without exception an honest, reliable man. Seventh-day Adventists as a rule live closer to the spiritual and moral demands of their religion than do the membership of three-fourths of the sects of the Christian belief.

The intolerance that is manifested toward them in Tennessee . . . smacks of the Middle Ages. . .

The Seventh-day Adventists are just as devout, to say the least, as the membership of any Christian sect that the sun shines on. They generally observe with more severity than most sects the strict teachings of their creed. They carry such teachings into their business relations. They make a cloak of their religion for social and business advantages less than does the membership of three-fourths of the sects that uphold the Christian religion.

It goes without saying then that a church membership of which such things can be said with truth, is simply experiencing the hardships of many of the martyrs of ancient times, when they are thrown into prison because they observe some other day than that generally observed by other Christian religious bodies as the sabbath day.

It is a disgrace to nineteenth century civilization that such conditions exist. It belies the claim that this country is as yet the home of the free. It has yet to establish that freedom which permits a man to worship his God as he chooses so long as he does not infringe upon the moral right of society as established by convention and common sense.
