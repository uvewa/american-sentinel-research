## PERSECUTION DENOUNCED.

### ANNA H. MC ADOW.

There have lately fallen into my hands several copies of the SENTINEL wherein is recorded the arrests, trials and imprisonment of those who, according to the teaching of divine writ, conscientiously hold sacred the seventh day of the week and also conscientiously follow the command, "Six days shalt thou labor." That they thus do, proves them to be honest and industrious, and no more peaceable, temperate and law-abiding citizens can be found, and yet they are maliciously persecuted and robbed of their natural, God-given rights.

I never belonged to any church but the Methodists, but for years have lived in the mountains away from the conveniences of any church. Last winter, I spent several mouths in Denver and to be fair and unprejudiced, spent much time in visiting the different denominations and studying their doctrines. I tried to slight none; and among others the Adventists and Salvationists, although of widely different style and doctrine, came in for a liberal share of hearing. I was present at two meetings where Captain Blanche Cox of the Salvationists had charge and gave an address, and was truly interested in her earnest appeals for strong Christians, and I bought a sheet of "songs and choruses," upon which is her picture and which now lies before me. To-day I was disgusted with the knowledge of and yet pleased with the comment of the Colorado Weekly Sun of July 3rd on the imprisonment for thirty days of said lady at Colorado Springs for holding open air meetings—charged with disturbing the peace and given the extreme penalty for the "offense." It is headed "Unworthy of Colorado," and goes on to state that the day of religious persecution is supposed to be gone by in civilized countries and that Captain Cox is known to be directing a wonderful force for the helping of fallen and discouraged men and women, and concludes by saying: "Captain Cox's imprisonment is an act that is a disgrace to Colorado Springs and the whole State. Her sentence is an insult to the cause of Christianity and a piece of persecution that men and women of all classes will bitterly resent. In the sense of right and justice, her release is demanded, while Coloradoans will blush to know that the shameful fact of the thirty days' imprisonment has been telegraphed abroad."

Now these acts of persecution and imprisonment should set thinking people to studying the whys and wherefores of such unchristian proceedings, as well as the question, Whither are we drifting? I say unchristian, for it is not the spirit of Christ. The meek and lowly Redeemer of the world, bade the avenger to put up his sword, and then lovingly healed the wound of his persecutor, and, even amid the agonies of the cross, cried, "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do." If we be followers of Christ then must we be partakers of his character and example.

He is represented as the light of the world. If he be not our light then are we in darkness. When we fail to follow this true light, then are we not Christians, no matter how strong the delusion or how great the pretensions. None such can be children of God, for "I and my Father are one." It takes but little reason to reach these conclusions. They are facts that are self-evident. If not of Christ we are of Satan. We cannot serve two masters, and the Bible is full of predictions of what shall be in the latter days. This feeling of intolerance never was of Christ. It is not love, but envy, jealousy and hate. It is born of Satan and is the voice of the dragon. Think of Christ as a persecutor! He says, When I come I "will draw all men unto me." How? by fines, imprisonment, the chain-gang, torture and death? We know his character. "How often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a bon gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not!" He wept over Jerusalem. "Come unto me all ye that are weary and heavy laden and I will give you rest." Where do we find Christ cruel or arbitrary? He says Come; he pleads, but never extorts. He is "the true light that lighteth every man that cometh into the world,"—but how few accept that light? "The light shineth in darkness but the darkness comprehends it not." "Blessed are ye when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake; rejoice, and be exceeding glad; for great is your reward in heaven; for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you."

*Meeker, Col.*
