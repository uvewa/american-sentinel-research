HOW A NASHVILLE PAPER REGARDS RELIGIOUS INTOLERANCE.

[The Cottage Pulpit, Nashville, Tenn., September.]

ENFORCING religious dogma by law is no new thing under the sun, but as old almost as the sky over our heads.

Practically, it was Cain's method of carrying his point in the dispute with his brother Abel in the first field of religious conflict, that this green earth of ours ever furnished to man. We read in the fourth chapter of Genesis: "And Cain talked with Abel his brother; and it came to pass when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him."

In its milder form of manifestation, as we have it operating here in America, the spirit of intolerance or religious persecution ignores the bludgeon, which was probably Cain's instrument of enforcing his side of the question in dispute upon the acceptance of Abel. The bludgeon, and rack, and stake, and fire, and sword, are, we repeat, ignored by us of America, as yet, and the milder forms of the law of "might makes right" only are resorted to by the strong party, to convince the weak party that they are in error, no matter how much their consciences, and the Bible as it reads to them, may protest that they are in the right and their adversaries, the great majority aforesaid, in error.

The milder form of the spirit of religious persecution in this country is now content with the "Blue Laws," which have been fished up out of the statute books of the individual States, some of them; though how long these same Blue Laws will satiate their appetite for the food on which the spirit that is in them grows and fattens, no one can say. In some localities murmurs of dissatisfaction are beginning to be heard, and demands for heavier fines upon the sabbath (Sunday) breaking Christians are being talked about.

The spirit of persecution does not go backward. If allowed to stand its motion is forward. In the very nature of things, when power is used to coerce the refractory into obedience, the only limit to the exercise of such coercive power once begun in any particular direction is the limit, the extent, or reserve of the force unemployed, until exhausted. It follows, therefore, that to look ahead at the effort now being made to "save the Sunday," or first day of the week, in this country, not by force of logic on its side as against the few who are contending for the restoration, and themselves religiously observe, the Sabbath of the fourth commandment, not by furnishing a line of valid proof of its being the day God blessed in the beginning and commanded to be observed as the rest day of his appointment; but, in utter disregard of all such considerations, and because, forsooth, it is the day designated in the Blue-Law codes of the States as the day upon which manual labor must cease, and rest therefrom be observed, because the civil power, backed by the ecclesiastical power, says so!—this being in a nutshell the status of the question to which things are settling down, the issue is about to be forced upon us as one between the State and its Sunday law on the one part, and the two or three sects of seventh-day Christians on the other part, with the whole mass of the first-day Christians, Protestant as well as Catholic, backing the State in the unequal contest!

One of two things, it is plain to be seen, must be the outcome of this novel state of things. Either the State and its backing will have to yield the field and relegate the Blue Laws to their grave again, granting to those who are now being persecuted and imprisoned under them, immunity from persecution and liberty to worship God according to the dictates of their own conscience; or in other words, religious liberty as guaranteed to them in the Federal Constitution, and perfect equality before the law in any State in which they choose to make their domicile for themselves and the religion they profess; this, or else the passage and enforcement of more rigorous laws for the punishment of those seventh-day Christians who by the very name they carry stand pledged to antagonize, and to the death if need be, that "wild pagan holiday," the Sunday, or Constantinian and Catholic rest day, now being generally honored by the first-day Protestants with the title of "American Sabbath." Which shall it be?

No graver question, we venture to say, has ever been presented for the consideration of our people, the slavery question itself hardly forming an exception. For that these Christians are in earnest, and immovably so, and have obeyed the command of their Lord and ours in sitting down first and counting the cost of the house they intend to build and comparing the estimate with their resources, and are well satisfied that they have wherewith, and amply so, to finish what they begin, no one who has observed them closely during the four or five years past, can have a reasonable doubt, we think. Therefore, for the country to go forward on the line of persecuting the seventh-day Christians under the Blue Laws, and at the dictation of the Catholics and their Sunday-worshipping allies of the Protestant faith, is simply to enter upon the work of their extermination. Is the country ready for this?

To narrow the question, and bring the issue home to our neighbors, our kindred and immediate people, suffer and consider this question, with which we dismiss the subject for the present: Is the State of Tennessee ready to enter upon the bloody work of exterminating the Seventh-day Adventists, and all others who honor and observe the Sabbath of the fourth commandment, in doing which they necessarily oppose a rival day of rest, to show respect to which they do but rightly esteem would be both cowardly and deceitful? Has the State of Tennessee entered upon this work of exterminating them, and is she prepared to go to the length of her power in the execution of her hellish purpose, to the making for herself a name and reputation only second to that which the Inquisition has given to Spain? If not ready for this, the council of wisdom and common sense alike suggest, that the State retrace its steps, undo its foolish work of lending its judicial machinery to religious bigots for the devilish business of persecuting their weaker brethren whom they have failed to meet in argument on the Sabbath question, and are now bent upon driving out of the State, or killing them outright; put aside the clerical garment as not pertaining to her civic sphere, and leave the giant few and the pygmy many to fight their battle out between themselves on this and every other religious issue that is between them, without further aid and comfort from the State through any of its departments, to either side in the conflict.

It is surprising what narrow strips of ground some men are able to stand upon for doing things that they want to do, or for not doing things that they do not want to do.

Suppose the seven or eight Seventh-day Adventists, who at last accounts were quietly working along with other criminals on the public roads in Rhea County, near Graysville, in this State, were to do as other prisoners, with not a tithe of their cause for it, do sometimes, refuse to work any longer—what would the authorities having charge of them say? Rather, what would they do? and how many stripes would the people of the old Volunteer State stand off and see inflicted on their bare backs to make them work out their iniquitous fines for labor done by them on the first day of the week?

In the great work of the few faithful servants of Christ in the last days, the days whose peculiar color and character is faithfully depicted by the pen of inspiration in two words, "perilous times," it were to have been expected that, under the guiding hand of the great God, the recovery of "times and laws" from the prophetic beast or antichristian power mentioned by Daniel, now that the twelve hundred and sixty years during which they were to be given into his hand, are presumed to be ended, would be a leading thought and purpose with them. And while such would be the case with them, it were to have been expected that on the side of "the beast and his army," strong opposition to any interference with his long centuries of almost uninterrupted possession of his usurped dominion and change of the law of God would be manifested. An explanation is found in these facts, both of the zealous spirit of the Sabbatarians as those are called who have come out of Babylon and keep the Sabbath day holy according to the divine command, and the bitterness of their enemies who are stirred up against them.
