## ARE CHRISTIANS AT SEA

Regarding the Day Which They Observe as the Sabbath?

[Patriotic American, Detroit, Mich., August 10.]

THERE is no time like the present, when every well-informed and patriotic Protestant is up in arms against papal intolerance, to turn the light of investigation upon a certain section of our Protestant friends in order that they may see where they are at.

The AMERICAN SENTINEL, of New York, under date July 18, says:—

Eight honest, conscientious Seventh-day Adventists, of Rhea County, Tenn., have been condemned to serve terms of from seventy-five to ninety days in the county jail at Dayton, Tenn., for the offense of doing common labor on Sunday—labor which disturbed no other person's private or public devotion. It has also been decided to work these honest men in the chain-gang, and by the time this reaches our readers this will doubtless be accomplished.

Not only do we condemn this mediæval injustice, but we are not sure that these public un-American Protestant inquisitors are not—unwillingly and unwittingly perhaps—the catspaws of the papal priests and are as much out of theological plum as they claim their victims are. A pamphlet, published by the International Religious Association, entitled, "Sunday," is before us, and upon the title-page we find the following quotations:—

You may read the Bible from Genesis to Revelation, and you will not find a single line authorizing the sanctification of Sunday.—James Cardinal Gibbons, "The Faith of Our Fathers," p. 111.

Had she [the Roman Catholic Church] not such power, she could not have done that in which all modern religionists agree with her—she could not have substituted the observance of Sunday, the first day of the week, for the observance of Saturday, the seventh day, a change for which there is no scriptural authority.—Rev. Stephen Keenan, endorsed by John Cardinal McCauley, "A Doctrinal Catechism," New York, 1875, p. 174.

The New York Tribune, of Oct. 10, 1894, in a very able and exhaustive article upon the subject of the Christian Sabbath, cites authorities and advances arguments which prove beyond the shadow of a doubt that the first day of the week is purely a pagan holiday, as its name implies, hashed over by the papal church to take the place of the true Sabbath. This modern inquisition, that sends honest and religious men to work in chain-gangs with convicts because they dare to follow the dictates of their conscience, possesses the same spirit of cruelty and persecution which burned innocent men, women and children at the stake, under the bloody reign of Dominic and Loyola, in the Middle Ages. We have heard much about projects for freeing "down-trodden" Ireland; it is strange that we have not yet arrived at that point of advancement where we can free honesty and intelligence from the curse of bigotry and narrow-mindedness.
