Manatee, Fla., Sept. 3rd, 1895.

EDITOR AMERICAN SENTINEL: It would be interesting to know the opinions of those people in Tennessee who have secured the imprisonment of Seventh-day Adventists, upon the subject of the murdering of missionaries and Christians in China and by Turks. No doubt these Tennesseeans are indignant over such atrocities. How much more reprehensible is their conduct, with their environments, than that of the half savage heathens! It is astonishing to contemplate the bigotry existing all over our country, and that too among people who have never imagined themselves open to such a charge in the remotest degree.

W. E. DRISCOLL.
