Persecuted for Their Faith.

[Detroit Free Press, Aug. 18.]

The "unco guid" people of Tennessee have not read history to very good purpose if they do not know that they are taking the best possible means to strengthen the cause of the Seventh-day Adventists in that State in persecuting them for adherence to their faith. In obedience to what they honestly believe to be the divine command these people rest on the seventh day of the week and claim the right to labor on the first. Those who believe in resting on the first day of the week have persecuted and prosecuted them for working on that day and caused them to be sent to jail and to the chain-gang. This will probably discourage them for a time—such of them at least as have actually been arrested, convicted and punished; but it will be very remarkable if it tends in the slightest degree to weaken their belief in the holiness of the seventh day of the week or in their right to labor on the first. Religious beliefs are not driven out of earnest people in that way; and there can be no doubt that the Tennessee Adventists are an earnest people.

That the prosecutors in the case are backed by the law of the State is probably true; but a law which permits such proceedings is wicked and unjust and ought to be repealed.
