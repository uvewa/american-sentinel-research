"ZEALOUS IN DETAILS."

BY PROF. R. B. TAGGART, A. M.

UNDER the heading, "The Christian Sabbath," the Advance, of Harriman, Tenn., has the following paragraphs:—

We have been giving considerable space lately to the consideration of the Sunday question. There are few public matters of more moment. The Christian sabbath is the bulwark of American liberty, and the key of our country's prosperity and stability.

It is being assailed from front and rear by those who are opposed to Christianity and by those who are overzealous in details, and to whom a more appears greater than a beam, and it is high time the solid, conservative Christianity of the nation spoke out very plainly and vigorously on these matters.

The Adventists pose as model people, as Christians, and when they assault the bulwark of their own liberty and become marauders in the camp of their protectors, it is not strange that they are taken very sharply to task by church and civil authorities that are alive to the situation.

For a time the Dayton Adventists got some notoriety and sympathy (just what they were planning for) because of their alleged persecutions. But to one who closely observes the trend of affairs, there is an awakening of the conservative, thinking, substantial people, to the exposure and unstinted condemnation of the Adventists' presumptions, and they will be classed where they belong, as traitors to the cause of liberty—civil and religious—which they would have people believe they are invoking.

The fact is such people are the very quintessence of intolerance, and if they could have their way all would have to walk in their narrow groove or go to the rack. They are not subjects of sympathy even in their trials which they have invited for a purpose.

We do not now purpose to characterize or discuss the said extract, but merely to select out of it a phrase which here stands as the subject of our present writing.

"Over-zealous in details and to whom a more appears greater than a beam." Such is the description of a class of people, some of whom are now suffering for the violation of what they feel to be an unjust and unwise statute.

Nothing can be deemed small which involves the authority or holiness of God. The whole truth of Christianity has often been staked upon what has seemed to the majority to be a small, even an infinitesimal point of the divine law. Hence we have had martyrs in the world; for the observance of points such as these, and in opposition to Jewish traditions, Jesus our Lord was necessitated to lay down his life. In spirit and letter he fulfilled every jot and tittle of the law. Every part of this holy law he accounted deser than his life. He deemed no part of it small, for it expressed the will of the Father which he came to fulfil.

The character of God and human redemption were both concerned in its vindication at his hands. He both magnified it and made it honorable; not to one part, nor as a whole simply, but in every particle, and in the spirit of the whole. Here, then, every true child of God finds the type of his obedience. Paul was a leader, not a type. Said he, "Be ye followers of me, as I am of Christ." Jesus was ever zealous in details and found no motes in the law. To his mind everything was a beam.

In Psalm 19, Jesus expresses his high estimate of the divine law. He there calls it perfect, sure, right, pure, clean, true, more precious than gold, sweeter than honey. It converts the soul, makes wise the simple. By it the secret faults of the soul are discerned. Psalm 119 glorifies the entire law in all its parts. Here it chines as in a kaleidescope in every conceivable variety of form and hue. All is beauty and nothing trivial. Jesus wore this, as did Joseph his coat of many colors. His acts were its promptings. In Psalm 40, he even says, "Yea, thy law is within my heart."

So, too, all the Bible characters resembling Jesus reveal this same holy sensitiveness to the claims of God's preceptive revelations. They were faithful in the least. To stumble in one particular of this law is to be guilty of all. James 2:10. We must not aim merely to keep the law in its entirety, but to realize the whole in its details; otherwise our several duties would remain vague and intangible. Duty becomes vivid under the specifications of its minuter parts. By its gradual actings sin brings a man to moral ruin. In the hands of Christ the law must recover him to God and holiness. By repentance he must attain a righteous character. And what is repentance, unless it be the straight turning about of the soul, the reversal of all its former actings, the renewal and confirmation of every holy prompting formerly unheeded? For every act of violated law the sinner must pay in Christ the penalty of obedience. Soon the curse turns to a blessing, obedience becomes his delight. And it is in the little duties of everyday life that he begins to recover himself until he stands panopled in entire righteousness.

Just at this point our so-called Christian civilization breaks down completely. All the reforms set on foot but daub the consciences of men with untempered mortar. They cry, "Peace, peace, when there is no peace." The men of this generation regard Sabbath-keeping, when it insists upon the literal seventh day of the commandment, as too trifling to be thought of with seriousness. Mere worldly business may insist upon exactness, but not religion! But as the judgments of God come to be visited upon the people for violated law, they may awake to some consciousness of their actual condition.

Let all true Sabbath-keepers endure the taunts of their misguided detractors, live in the clear light of God's approval, and by word and deed commend to the men of to-day the truth as it is in Jesus. The Bible, the law and gospel of Christ, must be transferred to the every-day life of his followers, in order that they may become effective instruments of salvation. Sabbath-keepers have become a spectacle; they live in the eye of the world, and their every-day life is scanned with a studied carefulness. Let them, therefore, live in all good conscience both toward God and man, touching every point of the divine law.

To keep Sabbath accurately is well; but to keep every command of God with spiritual precision is still better. The Sabbath is not well observed when other precepts are deliberately neglected. A true Christian morality is regardful of every requirement. In word the solemn promise of Israel was exact, but they failed in the performance and the covenant was broken: "All that the Lord hath commanded we will do." The reward comes to completed duty: "Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life."
