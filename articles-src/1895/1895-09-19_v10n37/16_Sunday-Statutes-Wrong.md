### Sunday Statutes Wrong.

[Die Rundschau, Chicago, July 10.]

Our readers are well aware of the position of the Rundschau with respect to Sunday laws generally, and of its opinion on the persecution of Adventists. It is our unwavering (persuasion) conviction that in both cases the State far overrides its limits and commits things that bring down shame and ignominy upon our free country. It surprises us that so intelligently edited a paper as the St. Louis Anzeiger des Westen, does not unreservedly concede this, but at most demands "to exempt from the law of Sunday observance such whose religious conscience compels them to observe another day."

The Adventists, by their Sunday labor, do nought destructive to the public weal. Even their enemies have not been able to adduce one single case of their having disturbed other people by their Sunday work, injured them in their natural rights and disturbed their Sunday rest. Consequently, it is unjust for the State to prosecute them as criminals and to bring laws in operation against them manifestly in contradiction with the letter as well as the spirit of the American fundamental law, the Constitution.

The State has no right to enact laws whereby the natural rights of its citizens are impaired, and if it has enacted such laws, then it becomes the duty of the people to emphatically and decidedly urge their repeal. The State, with its legislation, is solely to provide that none of its constituents commit anything whereby the equal rights of others would be impaired, and to solely urge each and every one of its citizens to contribute his share unto the maintenance of the community. Its functions extend no farther, and all legislation going beyond these limits, is of evil and is running counter to the fundamental principle of American jurisprudence. Even for this reason we deem the laws enacted for the protection of Sunday wrong in principle, they meddle with matters not concerning the State in the least. Let the State protect those who wish to rest on Sunday or attend public worship, and punish such as have the effrontery to therein disturb their fellow-citizens; but let the State keep its nose out of the private affairs of the people—on Sunday just as well as on every other day of the week. This, nothing more and nothing else, the American people ought to demand of its servants, the legislators and executive officials. Exemption laws, such as the Ans. d. W. demands, will not suffice, but only make the evil worse.
