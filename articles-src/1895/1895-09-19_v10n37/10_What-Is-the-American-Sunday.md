## WHAT IS THE AMERICAN SUNDAY?

[New York World, Sept. 7.]

The Convention of Republican Clubs declared in favor of "the American Sunday." But it failed to define what the American Sunday is. Everybody is in favor of a day of rest and of a day for worship for those who want it. But just what is the "American Sunday"?

Is it the Sunday of Boston or of New Orleans, of Philadelphia or of Milwaukee, of Brooklyn or of Chicago, of Portland or of San Francisco, of New York or of Podunk?

The observance of Sunday differs as much in these places as it does in our own and in European cities. In most American cities in the summer the people who go on excursions or go fishing or ride wheels or seek some form of recreation and pleasure, are ten times as numerous as those who attend church. Which method of observing the day is distinctively American?

In some of our cities the theaters and music halls are open on the first day of the week. In most of them the summer gardens flourish. In nearly all of them beer is either openly or quietly sold without molestation. A majority of them are probably under Republican rule. Where does the "American Sunday" come in?

Passing from custom to law, the definition is even more elusive. The "American Sunday" in this city begins at 12 P. M. for the saloon-keeper, at 10 A. M. for the meat, bread, milk and ice venders, at 1 P. M. for the barber, and not at all for the seller of confectionery, cigars and newspapers! It does not interfere with street-car traffic or the letting of pleasure carriages. It permits the selling and drinking of liquors at all hours in clubs and hotels. It even enables a man to get a bottle of beer or wine at a restaurant if he orders it with his dinner. Under the rule of Roosevelt it does not interfere with the thousands of soda fountains. It sanctions official band concerts in the parks. It permits the letting of pleasure boats on the city's park lakes.

The term "American Sunday" is thus seen to be a very elastic one.
