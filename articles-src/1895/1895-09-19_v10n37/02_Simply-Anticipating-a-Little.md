## SIMPLY ANTICIPATING A LITTLE.

REFERRING to the impression that has somehow gone abroad that old "Uncle" Gillett, of Graysville, was one of the Adventists in the Rhea County chain-gang, the Dayton Republican, of August 30, says:

"This is anticipating things a little. Mr. Gillett is still enjoying his liberty, although but for the postponement of his trial he would doubtless now be working in the Rhea County chain-gang by the side of eight of his neighbors. He will be tried at the November term of court, and then we shall see whether the law will demand its pound of flesh.

"You see, it is this way: Down here in Tennessee we respect the law. We are law-abiding citizens, gentlemen. In our eyes the law is a sacred instrument. If a lot of men were able to get together and pass a law burning heretics we would obey it. Yes, sir, although it would be painful to our feelings we would obey it, because it would be our duty as good citizens. All law, no matter how wicked and unjust its tendency, must be obeyed because it is the law, and to do otherwise would bring it into contempt. We are sure we are right, because the ablest jurists and preachers in the land hold this view; this is also a maxim handed down to us by the old Spanish inquisitors, and it has the sanction of age and custom, besides being contrary to common sense.

"We know Gillett and we like him. He is a man of blameless life, and told us not long since that this is the first time that he has been in a court of justice. Gillett was formerly a Freethinker. It is only since he has gotten to be a Christian and an Adventist that the law has taken hold of him. Yes, this Christian instrument made by Christian people and enforced by Christian courts, is vindicating its majesty by compelling the people to work at the expense of the State for placing a different interpretation upon the Scripture than what it does.

"It is a pity that when Martin Luther slung that ink bottle at the devil he did not brain his satanic majesty on the spot."
