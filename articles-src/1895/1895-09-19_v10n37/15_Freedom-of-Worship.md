### Freedom of Worship.

[Morning Advertiser, New York, July 28.]

Those religious zealots who have instigated the arrest of a Seventh-day Adventist near Baltimore for working on Sunday do the cause of Christianity grave harm by their absurd bigotry and fanaticism. It is not pretended that this person disturbed anybody or interfered with the liberty of anybody. It is admitted that he is an industrious, upright and peaceable citizen. His sole offense is that he quietly pursues his secular avocations on Sunday. He believes that Saturday is the day which the Bible commands should be kept as the Sabbath, and he carries this belief into practice by consistently spending nearly the whole of every Saturday in worship and prayer. If such a man is to be adjudged a criminal, then freedom of conscience and worship in this Republic is the veriest sham.
