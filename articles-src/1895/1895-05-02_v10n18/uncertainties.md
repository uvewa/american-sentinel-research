# Uncertainties Log - Volume 10, Number 18 (May 2, 1895)

## General OCR Quality
The OCR quality for this issue was generally good. Most text was clear and readable at 300 DPI.

## Specific Uncertainties

### Page 1, Article "A Problem for the Tennessee Legislature"
- **Line reference:** "egis of her protection"
- **Transcribed as:** "egis"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM
- **Reason:** Appears to be OCR error for "aegis" (archaic spelling) or possibly "aegis" modernized. Kept as appears in OCR.

### Page 2, Masthead Area
- **Line reference:** "ADJUSTANT EDITOR"
- **Transcribed as:** "ADJUSTANT EDITOR"
- **Confidence:** LOW
- **Reason:** This appears to be an OCR error for "ASSISTANT EDITOR" - the masthead lists three editors (Alonzo T. Jones, Calvin P. Bollman, Leon A. Smith) with "EDITORS" as heading, then "ADJUSTANT EDITOR" below. However, I preserved exactly as it appears in the OCR since the instruction is to preserve text exactly unless OBVIOUS errors.

### Page 3, Article "Rome Has Spoken"
- **Line reference:** "Roma lovuta est, causa finita est"
- **Transcribed as:** "Roma lovuta est, causa finita est"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM
- **Reason:** This appears to be an OCR error for the Latin phrase "Roma locuta est, causa finita est" (Rome has spoken, the case is closed). The 'c' in "locuta" was likely misread as 'v'. However, preserved as appears since uncertain.

### Page 5, Article by William P. Tolley
- **Line reference:** "Bark Ages"
- **Transcribed as:** "Bark Ages"
- **Confidence:** HIGH (obvious error)
- **Reason:** Should be "Dark Ages" - clear OCR error where 'D' was read as 'B'. Context makes this obvious (discussing Inquisition persecution).
- **Correction made:** Changed to "Dark Ages" in final text as this is an OBVIOUS OCR error.

### Page 6, Article "The State and Morality"
- **Line reference:** "Prosume Thy holts to throw"
- **Transcribed as:** "Prosume Thy holts to throw"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM
- **Reason:** This appears to be a poem quotation (attributed to Pope) with probable OCR errors. "Prosume" likely should be "Presume" and "holts" likely should be "bolts". However, preserved as appears since not absolutely certain of original.

### Page 7, Article "Better Late than Never"
- **Line reference:** "mindest leaders"
- **Transcribed as:** "mindest"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM
- **Reason:** Unclear what this word should be - possibly "midst" or another word. Preserved as appears.

### Page 8, Editorial Notes
- **Line reference:** "Ginsgow Mail"
- **Transcribed as:** "Ginsgow Mail"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM
- **Reason:** Likely should be "Glasgow Mail" but preserved as appears in OCR.
