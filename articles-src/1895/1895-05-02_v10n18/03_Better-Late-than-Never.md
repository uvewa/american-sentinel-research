# BETTER LATE THAN NEVER.

The Western Watchman (Roman Catholic) gives space for the following interesting communication:—

**What Brought On the Reformation.**

Editor Western Watchman: Recently your paper contained a favorable notice of the Italian historian, Cesare Cantùr, as the greatest modern Catholic writer of history. It was but a just tribute to the truthfulness and great learning of the erudite Italian.

Yet he uses language which many of our less accurate writers would not only reject, but reprove and condemn. For instance, when narrating the causes which led to the Protestant Reformation, he does not hesitate to say that "the sale of bulls of indulgences became one of the chief resources of the Roman Curia." "Le spaccio delle bolle d'indulgenze divenne una delle pingui entrate della Romana Curia."—Tom XVI., parte 1st, c. 15, p. 23.

He agrees with Alaug in the statement that there was this scandalous sale of indulgences, which awakened the zeal of many good churchmen, who were not timid in condemning the abuse.

Speaking of the Dominican Tetzel, he narrates: "Authorized by the elector of Rayence to collect the price of the bulls in Germany, he fulfilled this office scandalously, traversing Saxony with boxes full of them, sealed and stamped. Wherever he arrived he raised a cross in the public square and vended his wares (spacciar la sua merce), and cried out, 'Buy, buy, for at the sound of each piece of money which falls into my box a soul escapes from purgatory.'"—Boi.

If this were printed in a Protestant history we might not give it credence, yet here it is in the words of the first Catholic historian of the age.

In like manner he speaks of the causes which led to the success of the Lutheran heresy in Sweden. He ascribes to the "usual scandalous improprieties" of the prothonotary apostolic, Angelo Arcimboldo, who was sent to gather the tax for the indulgences in that country, much of the evil which resulted.

To this must be added the political mistakes of the hierarchy of Sweden. As Cantùr observes: "When the tyranny of Christian II. wore out the patience of the nation, so that he was banished, Eric Troll, Archbishop of Upsal, clothed himself with the authority of religion to crush the national party, and, in the name of Leo X., condemned the rebels as heretics, and pursued Gratavon Vasa to death. From this arose hatred of the religion of Rome, and the latter turned it to his own purposes in his hatred of the Danes."—Tom XVI., part 2, c. 28, Ed. Turin, 1845.

Much in the same way he explains how the English nation was drawn away from the unity of faith. In these three great Northern nations, worldly motives and financial, as well as patriotic, reasons began the religious disturbances. On both sides interests not all holy drew the mindest leaders into harsh and un Christian ways, which leave their evil consequences to the present day. Historians like Cantùr teach wisdom to their readers by pointing out, honestly, the errors of the past.

The Western Watchman, commenting editorially on this communication, says:—

We print a notice of Cesare Cantùr, who died recently in the odor of sanctity and crowned with the laurels of a splendid historical achievement. He was a special friend of the present pope. The particulars of the preaching of the indulgences in the days of Martin Luther are shocking; but they are true. We always regarded those villainous monks as the real authors of the Reformation, and chief among them in blasphemous effrontery that arch hypocrite, Tetzel.

This honest acknowledgment of patent facts of history is late, but better late than never.
