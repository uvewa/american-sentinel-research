# "CLERGY DO PROTEST."

"And Use Harsh Words Against the Desecration of the Sabbath. Demand Its Observance."

These are a part of the headlines of a report of the recent mass meeting held in this city, as reported in the St. Paul Globe of the morning of April 16. The meeting was held at the People's Church, and the report says it was "largely attended. Vigorous speeches were made by several clergymen, and a permanent organization resolved upon." "Rev. J. W. Conway, of the First Baptist Church, invoked the divine blessing, and stated that there was a general feeling among all denominations that the American Sabbath was not adequately observed in St. Paul." Lutherans, Methodists, Episcopalians, Baptists and Catholics were represented on the platform as being in favor of the reform. Several speeches were made in favor of the better observance of "Sunday," "the Sabbath," and "the American Sabbath," all meaning, of course, the first day of the week commonly called Sunday. It seems quite evident that these so-called reformers chafe under the reproachful name of "Blue Laws," and "puritanical," so frequently used by their opposers; for Bishop Gilbert (Methodist Episcopal), in his speech, made the remark that "It is constantly asserted that we who work for the observance of the Sabbath are striving to bring back the Blue Laws and restore the unhappy days of the old time puritans. This is a manifest impossibility. Nor are we trying to deprive the working man of his right, to abridge his liberty, or to force religion upon him, willing or unwilling." No doubt these men are honest in what they say; but the logic of their course is to bring about the very thing which they deny. But while the bishop admits, indirectly at least, the rights of men, Dr. S. G. Smith, of the People's Church, denies this principle. In his speech he said: "People object against a Sunday law that will interfere with natural rights. There are no natural rights. Natural rights mean savagery."

Evidently, the reason for his doing this is because it is the only way out of the dilemma that Sunday laws do invade the inalienable rights of all men. But the following words found in his reported speech are not so far from the truth: "Never have the forces of secularism been so solidly arrayed against religion, morality and the Bible. Religion has become a tradition and a memory." He also gave one good point in regard to legislation in the following words: "Until the people of our city churches unite in a better observance of the Sabbath, I have little faith in laws and legislatures." Let all reformation begin with the people, and with the heart and not in the head, and there will never be any need of "law and legislatures" in the interests of reform.

The Catholic Church was represented by Rev. John Gmeiner, who spoke in the place of Archbishop Ireland, who could not be present. In doing so he called attention to the attitude of that church by reference to the Council of Baltimore, and stated that "in 1884, the bishops and archbishops of this entire country urged both clergy and laity to recognize and aid no movement calculated to weaken respect for the traditional American Sabbath, but on the contrary, to encourage such traditional observance to the utmost."

And so it is that Protestants, professedly so, and Catholics are uniting to elevate the anti-Christian Sabbath, and in doing this we see the evidence that they have found common ground upon which to stand in oppressing those who will be true to "the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus."
