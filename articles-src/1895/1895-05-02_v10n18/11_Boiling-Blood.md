# BOILING BLOOD.

WALTER ELLIOTT, the Paulist priest, has this to say in the Catholic World for April, concerning the private interpretation of the Scripture:—

It makes one's blood boil to think of honest people being fooled with such a preposterous delusion as that the private interpretation of the Bible is the divine rule of faith.

This "delusion" seems to have had this same effect on Roman Catholics in the past; with this difference that they were not content with the boiling of their own blood, but persistently practiced the pious papal plan of boiling the blood of such men as Huss and Jerome, who believed and taught the "preposterous delusion." But since burning and boiling have gone out of fashion, Roman Catholic countries have adopted banishment instead, as will be seen from the following, which appeared in the Inter-Ocean, of April 19:—

Spain Refuses to Permit Missionaries in the Caroline Islands.

WASHINGTON, D. C., April 18.—In the correspondence between the United States and Spain last year is the history of the negotiations which, after years, resulted in the payment of the sum of $17,500, as indemnity for the expulsion from the Caroline Islands by Spain of the American missionaries. It appears also that, immediately upon receiving the indemnity, United States Minister Taylor, under instructions from the State Department, began to press the demand that the missionaries be allowed to return to the Caroline Islands. He represented that the governor of the islands was willing to permit this upon the assent of the Spanish government, but the latter, after denying that that official had any authority to convey any such assurance, announced on September 18 last, that the condition in the Carolines has undergone no change as would warrant the return of the Methodists and therefore refused permission for their return.

From this we are to learn that the Roman Catholics of Spain and the Caroline Islands are afflicted with the same hot-blood trouble which afflicts Priest Elliott, and being in a position to give vent in a practical way to their heated blood, they banish the Methodist missionaries who reject and teach others to reject the Roman Catholic interpretation of the Bible. Spain and the Caroline Islands present fruitful fields for missionary work to those Roman Catholic priests and editors who claim for the Catholic Church the authorship of civil and religious liberty.
