# A PETITION

For the Relief of the Persecuted Under the Sunday Law.

(Concluded.)

[Under the above head ex-Senator Wm. P. Tolley, of Tennessee, has petitioned for the repeal of the Tennessee Sunday law. The following are selected paragraphs from the able document.]

It is easy enough for the man who believes it morally wrong to work on Sunday to "rest" on that day. It is quite as easy for him to insist on his neighbor "resting" at the same time, and even for him to compel his neighbor to "rest" by the enforcement of this law, all on account of his religious belief on the subject. But how is it with the other two religious classes described in this paper? Seventh-day observers are required by their consciences to refrain from work on the seventh day of the week, commonly called Saturday, and to work on the other six. But this law compels them to also cease from work on the first day of the week, thus robbing them of one-sixth of their time. And yet there is no exemption lodged anywhere in our civil code from their full share with the others in all the burdens of government, the payment of taxes, military duty, working the public highways, etc. The man who believes in neither day as a Sabbath or holy day is equally oppressed with the seventh-day believer, under this law. He is robbed of one-seventh of his time, or compelled to refrain from work out of deference to a religious institution in which he does not believe. It is as much a matter of conscience with him as with those who believe in that institution. Can there be any legal justice in this discrimination as between sects or classes? Is the Sundatorian so much better citizen than those of the other two classes as that he must be thus favored by the law? It may be safely said for the latter they have no superiors in the State for peace and order and promptitude in discharging all the obligations of citizenship.

The law of absurdities is that one absurdity necessarily leads to another. The absurdity of assuming that the adult citizen is not capable of deciding when he is tired and how much rest he requires, and that the State must determine this strictly private and individual matter for him, could but lead to the equal absurdity of assuming that one man's rest depends upon others resting at the same time, and that therefore there must be a uniform day of rest for all fixed by law. That one man's rest necessarily depends upon others resting at the same time he does presupposes a sort of Siamese-twin connection between them, an inter-communication between their muscular and nervous systems, everybody knows does not exist. No reason less absurd than this can be assigned for any sort of dependence of one man's rest upon another's, physical rest purely being the thing under consideration. It is absolutely inconceivable how a man's rest can at any time depend upon another resting at the same time. If this assumption is true of the first day of the week, then it must be equally true, if not more so, of rest at night. The latter is evidently the time fixed by nature for rest to man and beast. There is nothing in all nature suggesting any day in the seven as a day of rest. It were far more reasonable for the State to prescribe that all its citizens should take so many hours of rest every night, all resting the same number of hours at the same time, than to prescribe any one of the seven days as a rest period for all. The reductio ad absurdum of all this is that the State's right of control would not stop short of regulating the most delicate family affairs between husband and wife looking to the number and healthfulness of members of succeeding generations.

The apprehension of some that the merchant or tradesman or other person who believes in Sunday holiness would be put at a disadvantage in the competition of his particular line of business if others were not required by law to close their places of business on the day his conscience requires him to so close, in no wise militates against the repeal of the law. It is not the business of the State to regulate competition between business competitors. Nor can it interpose to save any man from the consequences in such competition of his religious opinions. It can only put all men on the same footing before the law and give them an equal chance in the race of life. This equality for the believer in Sunday holiness would not necessarily be disturbed by the absence of a law compelling others to close on his day. It would only leave the matter of conscience free and untrammeled by law as the Constitution certainly intended it should be. This closing on Sunday would be altogether voluntary and out of deference to his conscience, while the closing by the others is involuntary and under legal compulsion. Besides, the factitious advantage that now enables him to compel his neighbor against his will to close on Sunday, certainly could be relied on to stand him in good stead in the competition between them. If there is only a reasonable degree of sincerity and fidelity in all the pretense of Sunday holiness displayed on all hands, from which it seems a large majority of the people believe in it, he can safely rely upon that circumstance to give him his due share of public favor and patronage. Having closed his business on the day the public seem to hold in high favor, his competitors refusing to do so, he would certainly merit their preference, and thus he would be left by the repeal of the law to stand on the only ground which he has any right to ask the State to assure to him, his merits alone.

But the proper conclusion to the whole matter in its civil or secular view is that no civil law or civil institution should be allowed to contravene the religious liberties or freedom of conscience of a single citizen. To deny such rights to an exceptional one, if such a case could be, is but to assure their denial to others, and the final destruction of religious liberty to all. Surely our civilization has attained a higher development than that there should be any necessary conflict between its institutions and the enjoyment of full religious liberty by every citizen. If it has not we have not so much to boast of in that particular after all, certainly nothing to boast of over the pagan civilization of Greece and Rome. If it has not, then our fathers were mistaken in their conception of it when they gave us the full measure of religious liberty set forth in the clause of our Constitution quoted early in this paper.

To deny religious liberty full and untrammeled in this matter, as it is in most others, is a confession on the part of the believers in Sunday holiness that there is no religious vitality in it, no Bible authority for it. Otherwise they would be willing for it to stand upon its merits as all other religious controversy must stand. They would not require a civil law to sustain it, and that under a plea so manifestly intellectually dishonest as the plea that the Sunday law is only designed to sustain a civil institution. Repeal the law and leave the question of which day is the Sabbath, or whether any is, to the realm of ecclesiastical disputation where it certainly belongs, and not to that of civil legislation or adjudication.

The responsibility of adopting the civil plea for the Sunday law must have been shared alike by the compilers of our code and the judiciary. It must have been the effort of the latter to defend the law on the civil plea that led the former to divest it of the terms and phrases that make its religious character palpable when they came to insert it in our code. In the code the title is left out, in which the object of the law is stated to be, "to prevent the profanation of the Lord's day, commonly called the Sabbath," for which the word Sunday is substituted in the body of the act as it appears in the code.

The courts have shown the same partisan spirit and determination to sustain the law on false premises in another particular. The law makes Sunday work an offense triable only before justices of the peace, the penalty being a three-dollar fine. Now, to the laymen like your petitioner it is a matter of interest, since this is the only statute against work on Sunday, to know how it is that offenders under this law are now tried under indictments of the grand juries, fined in the discretion of the courts, and even imprisoned for such periods as judicial mercy alone may suggest? The answer from the history of these persecutions that have blackened our court records more than our legislative journals, is, that it has all been brought about by judicial legerdemain resembling legislation more than a judicial act. The courts have extended the law so as to make a repetition of the offense indictable, on the ground that the act done more than once becomes a nuisance, a disturbance of somebody's rights. How the act done but once is not a disturbance of someone's rights and the same act repeated becomes a disturbance and an indictable offense, none but a mind trained to judicial legerdemain can discern.

The act done is made an offense, in the law, because done on the "Sabbath," but not an indictable offense. It could not have been made an offense of the lowest grade on any other ground, because the acts proscribed are "the common avocations of life." Again, the non-professional mind is puzzled to know how "the common avocations of life" when exercised on any other day than Sunday are entirely innocent and even commendable, and yet on Sunday are such nuisances or disturbances as to become indictable offenses. Every judicial rendering on the subject has to go back on the idea on which the act is based, the religious idea. And in doing so they all run rough-shod over the sound doctrine of Chief Justice Nicholson's opinion, "that the carrying on of one's business openly and publicly on Sunday was not and could not constitute a nuisance simply because it was done on Sunday" (Case of Lowry vs. State, 7 Bax. 95). He furthermore said in the same opinion: "The legal definition of a nuisance is 'that which incommodes or annoys—something which produces inconvenience or damage.' It cannot be said that a barber-shop is something which incommodes or annoys, or which produces inconvenience or damage to others. To hold that it becomes a nuisance when carried on on Sunday, is a perversion of the term 'nuisance.' All that can be said of it is that when prosecuted on Sunday it is a violation, and subject to be proceeded against as provided by the statute, but not subject to indictment as a nuisance."

Had the plain common sense of this rendering continued to prevail there had been no King case in Obion County, nor Capps case in Weakley County, and divers similar cases in Henry and other West Tennessee counties; nor the late deplorable cases in Rhea County in East Tennessee. In all these cases much of the cruel and fell spirit that characterized religious persecution in the Bark Ages, when the Inquisition assumed the keeping of men's consciences the world over, was displayed. Much misery and suffering were inflicted. It has already been noticed in this paper that King was cruelly pursued to death. Space will not allow a detail of the hardships endured in the other cases, only a little less severe than in King's case. Men languished in jail, worked in the chain-gang on the streets, and suffered almost every degree and character of punishment and indignity practiced in former ages when religious bigotry ran riot, except burning at the stake, gibbeting, etc. The closing and ruin of a splendid school at Graysville, and the consequent depreciation of the value of property in that town—amounting to thousands of dollars perhaps—as the result of the late Rhea County persecutions, to say nothing of the imprisonment of some eight citizens whose only offense was that they held to and practiced religious beliefs differing from those of their neighbors, is a familiar story to this assembly because of its recent occurrence.

The fatal departure from sound principles was taken in the Parker case, already referred to, and led to all this. Your petitioner is in no wise identified with the religious order from whose ranks all these hapless victims have been taken, is not in sympathy with them in any of the tenets that distinguish them from other denominations, nor is he before you as their apologist or defender. He has a common interest with others in desiring the repeal of this law, who may fall under the ban of proscription for opinions which may not conform to the standard of the civil law, and thus incur the judicial wrath promulgated against Seventh-day Adventists on one occasion when they were told from the bench that "they must educate their consciences to conform to the standard of the law." He has a common interest with all lovers of the fair name of the State in desiring to retrieve her fame from such shame as has been enacted in these cases. He would stay this war upon the freedom of conscience, upon religious opinions, ere difference of opinion in other and all instances are made the occasion of arraignment for the crime of heresy. We are almost to the verge of that condition of things now. The religious animus of the opinion in the Parker case started us on the downward road thitherward. The especial interest in hounding on these prosecutions of religious zealots, the intellectual dishonesty of the plea of the civil purpose of the law, are sufficient warnings that it ought to be repealed. Be not misled at the pretense that these cases are prosecuted as offenses against the civil law. There never was a case of religious persecution that was not defended on that pretext.

Repeal the law is the prayer of your humble petitioner.

WM. P. TOLLEY.
