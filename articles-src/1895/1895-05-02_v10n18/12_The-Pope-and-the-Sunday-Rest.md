# THE POPE AND THE SUNDAY REST.

The pope, in a letter to M. Keller, President of the Sunday Rest Society, says: "The association tends to restore to God an honor due to him by a cessation of labor which he himself has strictly prescribed from the beginning of the old law. . . . Contempt for the Lord's holy day causes the greatest evils to men and nations." Sunday closing has for years been steadily on the increase in the best quarters of Paris.—Pittsburg Catholic, April 18, 1895.
