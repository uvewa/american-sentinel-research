We commend Governor Turney on his action in pardoning the Seventh-day Adventists who have been serving sentences in the Rhea County jail for Sabbath breaking, and recommend his example to our County Court should further occasion arise.—Dayton (Tenn.,) Republican, April 19.

GOVERNOR TURNEY did a good act the other day when he pardoned the five Seventh-day Adventists, including the Principal of the closed academy and his first assistant, who were imprisoned at Dayton jail for doing what they believe to be right.—Southern Enterprise, Deer Lodge, Tenn., April 18.
