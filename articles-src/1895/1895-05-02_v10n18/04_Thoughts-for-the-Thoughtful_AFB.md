# THOUGHTS FOR THE THOUGHTFUL

JUDGE PARKS, in charging the jury in the case of the trial of Seventh-day Adventists in Tennessee, said:—

The carrying on of ordinary business or any kind of secular labor on Sunday, if so conducted as to attract public attention, is indictable under the laws of the State. It is not necessary to show that any person was disturbed by such an act; it is sufficient if the act was done in such a public manner as to be open to the observation of the public. [Italics mine.]

Writers on jurisprudence assign two reasons for the origin of civil law. Jeremy Bentham and Mr. Austin sought to establish as the basis of law, "The greatest good of the greatest number." Sir Henry Maine concludes that "Law is the result of the needs of the community in which it originated." Allowing either of these reasons to be the true basis of law, the question arises, How could a law bring the greatest good to the greatest number (or any number for that matter) the violation of which brings no harm to either the person or property of anybody,—no, not so much as to even disturb a single member of society? Or what need could there be for a law that if violated by every member of the community in which it originated, not a single individual in all that community would be injured in the least? But on the other hand, if the officers of the State enforce the law, the persons violating it would be subjected to pains and penalties, though not having injured a single individual in the State,—no, not having even disturbed anyone. Is not such a law unjust in the extreme? But such is the nature of every civil Sunday law ever made. If every individual in the community should follow his honest calling on Sunday, whatever that might be, not a soul would be injured by it any more than if done on any other day of the week.

There can be no call for a civil law that, when violated, does not make the person violating it a criminal. Any law forbidding honest toil for a livelihood is an imposition upon the rights of the people.

Suppose the State should pass a law forbidding anyone to make garden on Wednesday, there is not a religious person of any sect or denomination in the world who would not condemn it as unjust and an infringement upon his rights. No person could be made to believe that making garden on Wednesday is a crime against the State, and why not? Because making garden can in no possible way be construed to be a criminal act, no matter if it be open to the observation of the whole community. That would not change the nature of the act; the fact of being seen in the act of planting seeds does not make it a crime to plant seeds. Think of a judge of the court pronouncing sentence upon a man for no other reason than that some persons saw him making garden. Every honest man would be disgusted with such procedure. Then it is plain that a law forbidding honest labor can not be based on the act itself and therefore must be based upon something besides the mere performance of the act. If there is any crime in the act of making garden, husking corn, digging potatoes, or any other laudable work it must be in the time when it is done, or the place where it is done. What possible contingency could arise that would make husking corn in one's own field a crime if done five minutes before twelve o'clock Sunday night and no crime if done five minutes later? Would anyone consider husking corn a crime if done five minutes before twelve o'clock on Wednesday night and no crime if done five minutes later? Or would any person consider husking one's corn a crime if done five minutes before twelve on any other night but Sunday night?—No. Then the criminality of the act must depend on the time when it is done, and that time must be Sunday time.

This is further shown by the fact that two men may perform similar acts at the same moment of time, and one is denounced as a criminal, is arrested, fined, and imprisoned, while the other is considered in the eyes of the same law as an honest, law-abiding citizen. Says one, I cannot see how it is possible for the same law to adjudge one man a criminal for doing certain acts and another man innocent though doing similar acts at the same time. It is unreasonable that such a law should exist. But to show that these statements are true, I will suppose that State Sunday laws are constitutional. Then suppose there are two brothers, A and B. A lives in New York and B lives in California. A in New York goes out in his field to husk corn at half past twelve o'clock Saturday night. B is doing the same work at the same moment of time. A is arrested, tried, and condemned before the lower court. He appeals his case to the Supreme Court of the United States. That body decides that the work is unlawful, and A is sentenced to imprisonment or to work in the chain-gang until the fine is paid. B, who was doing the same work at the same time, is arrested, tried, and the case is also taken to the Supreme Court. That body decides that the work is lawful, and that B is an innocent, law-abiding citizen. On what grounds could these conflicting decisions be rendered concerning similar acts performed at the same moment of time? All can readily see that it could not be the act itself; but the crime (if such it is) must depend upon the time at the place where it is committed. But what is there about the time or the place that would constitute the same act a crime in one place and not in another? O, you see, it is Sunday in New York three hours before it is Sunday in San Francisco, so that an act performed at half past twelve on what is called Saturday night constitutes the person who does the act, a criminal, while the man in San Francisco who is performing the same work at the same time is a law-abiding citizen. And why so?—Because Sunday does not reach him till three hours later, so that while his brother A in New York is a criminal, B is a just man, although he is doing the same work at the same time. But let B continue his work three hours longer till Sunday comes along and catches him at his work, and lo, all of a sudden he becomes as dangerous a criminal as his brother in New York.

But what is there about the "civil Sunday" that so suddenly transforms a commendable act into a crime and sends an honest toiler to prison or to the chain-gang? There must be something wonderful about the "civil Sunday" that gives it the power to so suddenly change a peaceful, quiet, honest citizen into a "jail bird." That something is an anti-Christian, persecuting religion. By no other process of reasoning than that he who works on Sunday is a heretical enemy of the State-established religion, can it be made to appear that honest Sunday toil is criminal. And yet some tell us that Sunday laws have nothing to do with religion!
