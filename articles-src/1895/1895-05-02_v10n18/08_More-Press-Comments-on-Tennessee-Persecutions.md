# MORE PRESS COMMENTS ON TENNESSEE PERSECUTIONS.

"TENNESSEE seems to be endeavoring to give us a scene of intolerance worthy of the sixteenth century, or earlier."—Hope Valley (R. I.) Advertiser, April 18.

"It is apparently a trivial matter, and may be passed over by the world at large as an effort of 'cranks' to override State law, but the principle at stake is a serious one and may well command the earnest attention of all lovers of religious liberty."—Martha's Vineyard Herald, March 28.

"We expect that the AMERICAN SENTINEL—an ably edited paper in all respects—will realize its fondest dreams, and that it will have orders for another half a million copies of its sprightly paper, after the first edition will be exhausted, and thus rebuke the witch-burners of that benighted State, Tennessee."—Public Opinion, San Francisco, Cal.

"Honest work conscientiously performed is as much an offering to God as church attendance and loud prayers. It all depends upon the spirit in which it is done. As long as the Adventists observe one day of the week as Sabbath and work as the Bible commands the other six days, they should be esteemed as Christian, law-abiding people, and be secure from molestation."—The Jewish Spectator, April 5.

"TENNESSEE appears to be a pretty good State to keep away from, especially if one has an idea that he is living in a free country and has the right of thinking as he chooses upon religious matters. A number of Seventh-day Adventists, in Rhea County, have been locked up in jail for a month or so because they insisted that they had a right to worship Saturday and work Sunday. The prisoners argued ably from the Bible that they had the right to their belief but the court decided against them and they went to jail."—Daily State Gazette, Trenton, N. J., April 15.

"In view of the fact that these people keep and observe one day of the week as the Sabbath day; that the Sunday of other sects is to the Adventists what Monday is to other denominations, and the 'common avocations' are legitimate and not obnoxious, it is our opinion that the Constitution of the United States will have to be changed and a new Declaration of Independence made, before the constitution of the State of Tennessee, or any other commonwealth, can be so warped as to persecute the ministers and professors of this sect. They worship according to the dictates of their conscience."—The New Haven (Ind.) News, April 18.

"It does not appear that these simple, honest and God-fearing people in any way interfered with others who desired to observe the first day. Honestly believing that Saturday is the Sabbath commanded by the Bible they were but acting in conformity with their religious convictions, and nothing but malice and bigotry could have inspired the prosecution, which is in reality a persecution. With such a thing as the convict lease system in force in the State of Tennessee, with negroes being shot by mobs in half dozen lots, or burnt alive, it does seem as if there were some violation of the laws of God and man more in need of punishment than the technical offenses of the Adventists.

If the guarantee of religious liberty in the Constitution means anything at all, it is intended to cover just such cases as the one under consideration. It is not claimed that these people interfered in any way with the rights of others, or in the remotest degree infringed upon the freedom of worship to which other denominations are entitled."—Chicago Israelite, March 30.

"The Sunday-law fanatics of Tennessee are carrying things with a very high hand. Recently in that State twelve or fourteen Seventh-day Adventists were indicted for working on Sunday, convicted and thrown into prison. A school with which they were connected was thereby broken up and the families of some of them were left dependent upon public charity for support. The spirit of religious intolerance is abroad in the land. There is probably not a religious community in the United States where it does not crop out from time to time. We only hope these bigoted fanatics will carry the thing so far that the people will rise up and sweep every vestige of Sunday-law legislation from the statute books in every State in the Union. Religious people quite too generally are not satisfied to be protected in their right to worship according to the dictates of their own conscience, but they want to compel everybody else to worship as they do or not at all. Down with such Christians and down with such religion!"—Silver Creek (Neb.) Times, April 12.

"The State has nothing whatever to do with a Sabbath in the religious sense of the word—neither with the Jewish nor with the Anglo-American, nor with the Christian, of which the third [fourth] commandment treats. It has no jurisdiction in religious questions; consequently its duty consists in sparing the consciences and in the non-enactment of laws that encroach upon the freedom of conscience. And wherever such laws exist they ought to be repealed, and we find no fault with the Adventists in the least if they do all in their power unto the attainment of this end and implore the coöperation of all who pray God to preserve unimpaired to this country its liberty. Our position on Sunday legislation is that of Judge Parks. And we believe this to be the correct position, whereby one may keep a good conscience. Every State law is unjust, that will compel a person to act contrary to or in violation of his conscience in matters that do not come under the purview of government and upon which it may not legislate without making itself guilty of usurpation and tyranny."—(Translated by Rev. Oscar Goetz, from Die Rundschau, Chicago, April 10.)

"How can the people of Tennessee, or of any other State in this Union, founded on the idea of absolute equality of all men before the law, tolerate the retention on the statute books, of intolerant legislation which prescribes a State religion, and punishes those who do not conform to it.

Quibble as any one may, the glaring fact remains that such legislation as this involves nothing less and nothing else than religious persecution. Whether a victim is burned at the stake, or is thrust into prison for refusal to pay fine and costs, the principle is the same; the outcome is alike in both cases: persecution for conscience' sake.

And how absurd this persecution seems on the part of those who persist in the maintenance of the first day of the week as the day of rest, when it is realized that the Bible ordains the seventh day as the Sabbath, while nowhere in either the Old or the New Testament is the Sabbath thus divinely ordained, either abrogated or any provision made for the substitution of Sunday.

Such legislation is utterly repugnant to our American institutions. As a mass, the American people are religious. But they are not dominated by an offensive impulse to impose their religious convictions upon others. They are generous minded enough to recognize the sweet reasonableness of honest difference of opinion. They are certainly not willing to have our institutions endangered by the formal establishment of a State religion."—The Hebrew World, New York, April 12.

"It is incredible that, in the closing years of the nineteenth century with all its boasted enlightenment and progress, there should remain on the statute books of any State a law whereby its citizens may be persecuted on account of matters belonging to the realm of conscience, with which no government has of right anything whatever to do.

The AMERICAN SENTINEL, of April 11, published in New York, gives the particulars of the arrest and imprisonment at Dayton, Tenn., of eight Seventh-day Adventists, because they insist on observing the last day of the week, instead of the first, as a day devoted to rest and worship.

These men are among the very best citizens of the community in which they live. They are not the enemies of law and order. They are as far from being anarchists as it is possible for men to be. On all points not touching their peculiar religious belief and their conscientious adherence to the observation of the Sabbath on a different day from that kept by most people, they are a law-abiding and exemplary people. They merely disobey laws in a matter of conscience which ought never to be enacted or enforced in this country. They refuse to pay fines, as did the Friends in New England and elsewhere two centuries ago, and they are, therefore, kept in jail.

It need hardly be said that petty persecution of this character is contrary to the Declaration of Independence and to the Constitution of the United States. It appears also to be contrary to the organic law of Tennessee, which declares that 'no human authority can, in any case whatever, control or interfere with the rights of conscience.'—The Daily Herald, Morristown, Pa., April 17.
