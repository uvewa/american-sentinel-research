# "ROME HAS SPOKEN."

[The following editorial kindly translated from *Die Rundschau* (Chicago) of February 20, and sent us for publication, by Rev. Oscar Goelz, of Gretna, La., displays unusual courage and perception.]

IN the seventeenth chapter of his widely circulated book, "The Faith of Our Fathers," (44th edition, Baltimore, 1893), the head of the Roman Catholic Church in the United States—Cardinal Archbishop James Gibbons—on pages 288, 289, writes the following words:

Thank God, we live in a country where liberty of conscience is respected, and where the civil Constitution holds over us the egis of her protection, without intermeddling with ecclesiastical affairs. From my heart, I say: America, with all thy faults, I love thee still. And perhaps at this moment there is no nation on the face of the earth where the Church is less transseled, and where she has more liberty to carry out her sublime destiny, than in these United States.

I do not wish to see the day when the Church will invoke or receive any government aid to build our churches, or to pay the salary of our clergy; for, the government may then begin to dictate to us what doctrines we ought to preach. And in proportion as State patronage would increase, the sympathy and aid of the faithful would diminish.

With these words, the highest dignitary of the church of Rome here in this country does not only declare the existing religious liberty of this country to be the most desirable condition under which his ecclesiastical community could best fulfill its pretended object, but also expresses the wish that in the relation of the State to the Church there may never occur such a change, whereby the former would be made the patron and protege of the latter. In other words, Cardinal Gibbons professes the American, and let us add, the Protestant principle of the complete separation of Church and State.

We need not now investigate whether this utterance of his may be accepted as it reads or whether in the shrine of his heart he has made provision by all sorts of reservations, clauses, and saving clauses, in order, when necessity demands, to change it into its very opposite. At any rate, it is a fact that we have very often heard similar utterances out of the mouths of Romish prelates and prominent laymen, especially so in late years. The lips of American Catholics have been overflowing with praise for our country and its golden liberty, and time and again they assure us that they desire nothing more for themselves than all enjoy,—liberty of conscience and equality before the law, and in no way intend undermining the principle of separation of Church and State. These assurances on their part have often been accepted as somewhat suspicious, and therefore they have repeated them with so much more zeal and have palmed themselves and their church off as the true representatives of ecclesiastical and civil liberty.

And now their lord and master, the pope at Rome, cometh and doth draw a thick line through all of these nice assurances and assertions of theirs. Since the pope published his latest encyclical, as a Roman Catholic paper itself must confess, it is favorite dogma of patent American Catholic 'liberalism,' that is, the pretended 'insurpassability of our relation [that is, complete separation] of State and Church'" has totally exploded. Henceforth no papist can make us believe that their so-called church approves the utterances of Cardinal Gibbons and other papal leaders. *Roma lovuta est, causa finita est*: Rome has spoken, and that settles the question.

Two weeks ago, we commented on that portion of the papal encyclical most important to our country, and deem it our duty to again call our readers' attention to it.

'Tis true we knew long ago what the pope's intentions were toward America. Rome never changes, and consequently it could be no secret to any true Protestant, that just as the popedom in general, so too its present incumbent hated the true liberty of our country and abhorred the separation of Church and State legally established in the same. Whosoever was capable of reading papal encyclicals, that is, understood their true character, could perceive this among others even from the encyclical of November 1, 1885, in which the pope prescribes unto his subjects just with respect to the United States too that—

All Catholics must make themselves felt as active elements in daily political life in the countries where they live. They must penetrate, wherever possible, in the administration of civil affairs. All Catholics should do all in their power to cause the constitutions of States and legislation to be modeled in the principles of the true church.

Although all this is so plain in itself, and plainly shows what the pope wishes to make of these United States, namely, vassals of the papal chair; still there was thus far lacking a clear, unequivocal, authentic declaration of the purposes and words of the present pope, that could neither be misinterpreted nor explained away. We have now an interpretation of this nature in the latest encyclical, and as hateful as it is in itself, still one can only thank the pope for his having now put an end to all uncertainty and doubt concerning his real, true attitude toward our Republic.

Leo XIII. declares clearly and emphatically that the separation of State and Church under the existing peculiar circumstances obtaining, may indeed have been favorable toward the increase and prosperity of the Romish Church, in so far as there had been no impediments put in the way of the natural fertility of the church. But then the pope proceeds thus—we give his own words in the original and in literal translation:

Sed quamquam haec vera sunt, tamen error tollendus, ne quis hinc sequi existimet, petendum ab America exemplum optimi Ecclesiae status; aut universelicere vel expedire, rei civilis reique sacras distractas esse dissociatasque, more americanus, rationes.

Yet, though all this is true, it would be very erroneous to draw the conclusion that in America is to be sought the type of the most desirable status of the Church; or that it would be universally lawful or expedient for State and Church to be, as in America, dissevered and divorced.

And then Leo declares: the church "would bring forth more abundant fruits if, in addition to liberty, she enjoyed the favor of the laws and the patronage of the public authority."

This all lacketh not perspicuity. It says just the very contrary to what Cardinal Gibbons has propounded as the right position on this question, to what Ireland, Wash. Hesing, and many other papal orators and writers have palmed off as Catholic doctrine and practice, have been trying to make the American people believe. Excuse the harsh expression but it is in harmony with the facts. These men have either made these "liberal" utterances on their part in opposition to their better convictions, knowing themselves to be saying an untruth, or they have made them in good faith, not knowing themselves what their chief, since hoary times has taught and wished and done. In either case they have been strewing sand into the eyes of their fellow-citizens of a different faith. For their pope and his "church" does not approve of the separation of Church and State; he does not consider this status the ideal; he does not wish nor does he want it to remain so. His ideal is not the liberty of the church in the State, but the control of the church over the State. He does not demand equal privileges for his sect, but exclusive privileges. What he means by "the constitutions of States and legislation" are "to be modeled in the principles of the true church," whereof he spoke in the year 1885, is according to his present declaration of the year 1895 nothing else but this: The American Catholics should do all in their power to cause such a union of Church and State in these United States, whereby the Romish Church would enjoy "the favor of the laws and the patronage of the public authority." The Roman hierarchy in this country is consequently to endeavor by all means at her disposal to make of these United States a Catholic country, in which the authorities and the nation are to love in humble obeisance before the pope and acknowledge him as the visible vicar of Christ on earth.

And therefore the latest papal encyclical deserves general and serious consideration. So far the passage adduced and commented on by us has been almost generally overlooked by the daily press, or, at the very best, done away with by a few sarcastic remarks. Still other papers, even outspoken anti-Catholic ones, make no mention whatever of it, or try to silence it altogether. But they do not consider that here we have a papal utterance before us, that may become of vast consequence to our country. Wee be to our nation should the seed strewn by the pope fall on fruitful soil and bring forth fruit! Then the liberty we now enjoy would be totally and forever destroyed.

It is therefore in our opinion high time for all who truly have at heart the welfare of their country to seriously consider the Romish question and examine and weigh it in all of its parts. We ourselves intend prying into this important matter yet more deeply.
