# THE STATE AND MORALITY.

Many seem to think that the State must conserve the morals of its citizens. But the moral law is the arbiter of morals, and this law is the rule of a moral government, which is wholly administered by a moral governor. Morality, therefore, means conformity to the moral law—the ten commandments. Immorality is discovered by the moral law, and is denominated sin, or unrighteousness. 1 John 3:4. It therefore follows that he who has once violated that law can never obey it so as to have it pronounce him moral; for "by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight." Rom. 3:20. So, then, the demands of the moral law can never be met by an immoral person; consequently no one can be made moral by the moral law even, much less by civil law.

One way alone is open by which man may become moral. The morality or righteousness of Christ, which is the morality of God, may be imputed to every believer in him (Rom. 3: 21-23), and the moral law is then written in the heart by the Spirit of God (Heb. 8:10), which brings the creature into harmony with the Creator, the author of morality.

God is not only the Author of morality, but he has reserved to himself the privilege of promoting morality in the earth, through his own chosen instrumentality. To the disciples of Christ is the commission given: "Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature." The Church has therefore been made the conservator of morals in the world, and her duty in this is done through making known the gospel to all "for the obedience of faith." This is the only true obedience, and the only real morality.

But the gospel and its accompanying influence, the Spirit of God, are both necessary to the teaching of morality. As neither of these has been committed to the State, it has not the credentials for teaching morality, and therefore cannot do it. The Church has both of these essentials, and is thereby qualified. But with her exalted privilege, she cannot punish those who refuse to become moral through her teachings. She cannot reward the moral, even. She may entreat and beseech men in Christ's stead to be reconciled to God; it is also hers to preserve her own purity, and the discipline of her membership. But beyond this she cannot go, since all rewards and punishments in this direction are God's prerogative. Then let the State beware how she attempts to sit in the place of God, and wield his authority. Let her rather be satisfied to attend to civil matters only, adopting as her motto the words of Pope:

Let not this weak, unknowing hand
Prosume Thy holts to throw
And deal damnation round the land
On each I judge Thy foe.

—J. O. Corliss, in Australian Sentinel.
