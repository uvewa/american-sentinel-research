# Uncertainties Log - v10n30 (1895-07-25)

## Masthead
- **Line 28**: OCR reads "CALVIN P. BULLMAN" - this appears to be an OCR error for "BOLLMAN" (C. P. Bollman is a known associate editor). However, preserving as transcribed per OCR accuracy principle. Should be verified against original.
- **Line 33**: "ABSTRACT EDITOR" appears after Leon A. Smith - unusual placement, may indicate Leon A. Smith held this role specifically.

## General Notes
- This issue had generally good OCR quality
- Most article boundaries were clear
- Author attributions were explicit in most cases
- No major obstructions or unclear sections noted
