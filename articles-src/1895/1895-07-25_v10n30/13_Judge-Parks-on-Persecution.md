"The Supreme Court of our State, in passing upon cases of this kind, involving the constitutional rights of those who believe in keeping the seventh instead of the first day of the week, has seen fit to make no exceptions in their favor; on the other hand, it has directly and pointedly held that this belief is no bar to a prosecution for a violation of a Sunday law. In addition to this, the last session of the General Assembly, with full knowledge of the fact that these people were being prosecuted under the Sunday law, refused to give them any relief by exempting them as has been done in many States. This fact is a source of regret to a large and respectable element of Christian people who adhere strictly to Sunday as the sabbath, but who believe that one of the corner-stones of Christianity itself is freedom in matters of conscience."—From the sentence of Judge Parks, in the cases of the Adventists now in jail at Dayton, Tenn.
