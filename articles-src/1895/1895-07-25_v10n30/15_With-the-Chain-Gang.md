### WITH THE CHAIN-GANG.

The following communications, the first from N. B. England, whose defense is printed in this issue, and the other from W. S. Burchard, one of the convicted men, will interest our readers:—

"Graysville, Tenn., July 16, 1895.

"EDITORS AMERICAN SENTINEL—Dear Sirs: Rhea County, Tenn., continues to make itself notorious by persecuting Seventh-day Adventists. It has not worked its prisoners on the roads for years. I am informed that it tried it once and found that it did not pay and abandoned it. But since eight Seventh-day Adventists were convicted last court for the awful crime of keeping the seventh day as the Sabbath according to the Bible (I suppose that must be the offense, as hundreds of others work every Sunday in this county and are not molested), it seems they could not endure to see them lying around in jail. So they established a temporary workhouse and put them in the chain-gang to work. The authorities started work them to Spring City, eighteen miles north of Dayton, the county seat, this morning. I have not yet learned whether or not they put the ball and chain on them, but I hardly think they will. I am glad to mention that quite a number of the good citizens of Dayton and surrounding country are opposed to the whole proceeding, but it seems they could not prevent it. How long will the citizens of Tennessee carry on this diabolical business? How long?

"N. B. ENGLAND."

"Rhea County Workhouse,

"Spring City, Tenn., July 16, 1895.

"A. F. BALLINGER, 43 Bond St., New York.

"Dear Brother: We were moved from Dayton jail to this place to-day in two heavy wagons—eighteen prisoners. We left Dayton at 8.45 A. M., and arrived here about 3 o'clock,—deputy sheriff James Howard and John Brown guarding with a double-barreled shot-gun and pistols, though they were not afraid of us. They handcuffed only four of the prisoners. I think they will be kind to us. My fine and costs are $20.15 or about fifty and a half days.

"They put us to filling straw beds and making tables, etc. We had cabbage, onions, and bread and sugar for supper, but will have better, perhaps, in a few days. They aim to put us to work about a bridge in the morning. They brought balls and chains with them, but they will not put them on us, though we will work with those that will be chained.

"We are as happy as anybody in the world, and have nothing to fear, for the Lord is our God. 'When a man's ways please the Lord, he will make even his enemies to be at peace with him.' In haste.

"Your brother in Christ,

"W. S. BURCHARD,

"Spring City, Tenn.

"Care of Workhouse.

"P. S.—I have just found out the amount of cost and fine that each of us has to work out. This does not include the State and county tax, which is $10 in each case, and remains a debt against us:—

"W. S. Burchard, $20.15.

"J. M. Hall, $21.20.

"W. J. Kerr, $20.90.

"H. C. Leach, $19.80.

"Monroe A. Morgan, $20.20.

"C. H. Moyers, $17.30.

"Byrd Terry, $19.70.

"D. C. Plumb, $24.80.

"Allen Cathey (1st case), $19.70.

"(2nd case), $21.95.

"We are in a two-story house. We have our room downstairs; they have old wagon tires fastened in the windows upstairs to keep the wild prisoners in.

"Spring City is about fifty-five miles north of Chattanooga and two hundred and seventy-nine miles south of Cincinnati on the C. N. O. & T. P. Railway, near the foot of Walden's Ridge, a chain of the Cumberland Mountains.

"Perhaps you can get some information from this scribbling, so I will close for this evening.
