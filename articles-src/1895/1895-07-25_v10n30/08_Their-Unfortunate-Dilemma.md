## THEIR UNFORTUNATE DILEMMA.

[From the Toronto World.]

If those who believe the fourth commandment is binding upon the people of to-day are capable of exercising their reasoning faculties, we ask them to follow us. This commandment enjoins us to keep holy the Sabbath day.

A Seventh-day Adventist, named Robert Watt, living near Chatham, believes in the commandment, and to the best of his ability he lives up to it. He keeps the Sabbath, or the seventh day, holy, but does not feel called upon to observe Sunday in the same way. May 5 last was a Sunday, and Farmer Watt thought he was committing no sin to haul fence rails on that day. A neighbor, who also believes in the sanctity of the fourth commandment, according to his interpretation of it, secretly laid an information against Mr. Watt, in consequence of which the latter was arrested and brought before a magistrate. The case was tried and judgment reserved. But this case is not as bad as that of a Mr. J. Q. Allison, of Douglasville, Ga., who was tried for working on Sunday to support his family, and who was sentenced in lieu of the payment of a fine of $22, to one year in the chain-gang along with thieves and other common criminals. He was released by the sheriff while on his way to Atlanta to be sold to a contractor for one year, as some unknown friend had paid the fine. This occurred this year.

Our friends, Principal Caven, Rev. D. J. Macdonnell and the other sabbatarian enthusiasts, belong to a class of people who—

1. Fine and imprison you if you obey the fourth commandment according to the letter and the spirit.

2. Fine and imprison you if you don't obey the fourth commandment according to their spurious interpretation of it.

Our friends are in a dilemma, no doubt, but a way out of it seems to have been suggested by a reverend gentleman who lives in Hamilton. This is Rev. Mr. Shearer; he belongs to the Presbyterian faith. In a sermon preached in that city last Sunday, the reverend divine announced the doctrine that Sunday should begin about noon on Saturday. He deprecated the holding of amusements or going to excursions on Saturday afternoon, as this kind of excitement unfitted the individual for the proper observance of the Lord's day. Rev. Mr. Shearer is on the right track. If he goes one step further and turns the whole of Saturday into a Sabbath he will relieve his friends from their unfortunate dilemma. He will at least make them a little more consistent.
