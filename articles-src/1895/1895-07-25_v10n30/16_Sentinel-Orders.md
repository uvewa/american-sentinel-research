"THE orders for the SENTINEL of July 18 (No. 29) have come so rapidly that we have been slightly delayed in filling orders promptly, although one, and a part of the time two, great Middle Presses have printed the paper at the rate of fifteen hundred an hour. After a week's run we are now in a position to furnish papers promptly. This issue will not be out of date for some time, but the sooner circulated the better. One dollar per hundred; eight dollars per thousand.
