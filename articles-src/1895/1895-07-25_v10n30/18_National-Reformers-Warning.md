NATIONAL REFORMERS and many other professed Protestants are laboring to amend the National Constitution so that it shall expressly recognize Jesus Christ as the Sovereign of this nation. To all such we recommend the careful reading of the editorial from the Western Watchman, on page 235.

Be it remembered that these National Reformers have petitioned Roman Catholics to aid them in overthrowing the "atheistical" Constitution of the United States, and in building one that should recognize Jesus Christ as the Sovereign Order of the United States. When the Roman Catholics have gotten the same control in this country that they now have in South America, these National Reformers will have no one to blame but themselves if the Roman Catholics attempt to compel them to bow down to a breed-god sovereign as they are now doing with Protestants in Ecuador.
