## ARE SUNDAY LAWS CONSTITUTIONAL?

[From the New York World, July 15.]

SECTION 3, article 1, of the constitution of the State of New York says:—

The free exercise and enjoyment of religious profession and worship, without discrimination or preference, shall forever be allowed in this State to all mankind.

Is there, then, any constitutional authority for our oppressive Sunday laws? Is there not "discrimination and preference" when the legislature enjoins upon all the people the observance of a day as a "sabbath" or "holy time," when only a part of the people believe such observance to be morally or religiously obligatory? Would not those who support the Sunday laws think their religious liberty encroached upon if the legislature were to pass a law compelling them to observe the Mohammedan sabbath, Friday, as "holy time"?

Would not every good and proper purpose of the Sunday laws be accomplished by a simple enactment making Sunday a legal holiday? The shops voluntarily close and men voluntarily rest from their toil on the other legal holidays.

Is not everything else in the Sunday laws directly violative of the constitutional provision above quoted, and also of the underlying and binding principles on which the constitution rests?

Why should not these laws be set aside by the courts or repealed by the legislature? Why should not enlightened and orderly citizens be free men in fact?
