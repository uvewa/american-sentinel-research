The prosecution of the Adventists is for the avowed purpose of crushing the rising denomination. But since the persecution began in 1885, although it has steadily increased, the denomination has more than trebled its numbers—a growth unequaled by any other church in the United States; thus illustrating the truth of Macaulay's words that the church "is in far greater danger of being corrupted by the alliance of power than crushed by its opposition."
