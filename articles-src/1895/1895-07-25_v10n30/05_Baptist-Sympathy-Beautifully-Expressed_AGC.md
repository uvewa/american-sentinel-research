BAPTIST SYMPATHY BEAUTIFULLY EXPRESSED.

IN our issue of July 4, the SENTINEL reviewed an editorial from the Canadian Baptist, which attempted to justify the prosecution of seventh-day observers in Tennessee for doing inoffensive labor on their own premises on Sunday. We were sorry to find so prominent a Baptist paper on the side of the persecutor, but endeavored to deal with this erring Baptist paper as tenderly as possible. We wondered at the time if the Canadian Baptist voiced the sentiment of Baptists of Canada on this point. The pastor of the Baptist church at Ceresco, Mich., has written us on this subject, and we publish a quotation from his letter that will touch the hearts of the persecuted men and all who sympathize with them:

Ceresco, Calhoun County, Mich.
July 12, 1895.

EDITOR AMERICAN SENTINEL—Dear Sir:

The Canadian Baptist does not authoritatively voice the sentiments of the Baptist denomination, nor does the editorial you so "tenderly probe" fairly represent the Baptists of Canada on the question of freedom of conscience. There are scores of Baptists, today, in the Dominion who would endure as much and as freely for religious freedom as did Roger Williams, John Bunyan, or any other godly hero who ever endured hardness in behalf of this glorious principle.

Baptists have no use for the word, "tolerate" except in its primal definition as derived from tol, the root word of tolla, to lift up—not the persecutor's sword, but rather some precious burden of duty or principle, or sorrow, or pain, as a banner is lifted up, nay, as the cross is lifted up, to be borne manfully, heroically, and in patience as if for Christ's glory, and humanity's betterment. Said the bruised and bleeding Scottish mother to her boy who was being tortured in her presence, in hope of satisfying her brave spirit when the persecutors' cruel thumbscrews had failed: "Johnnie! my puir laddie, can ye thole it?" "Aye, mither," said the dying boy, "I can thole it brawly, for Christ is wi me." Even so, praise the Lord, when godly Adventists to-day are called upon to suffer for conscience sake, they are enabled to thole brawly the prison pen, the chain-gang and financial plunder at the hands of brutal oppressors and legalized highwaymen, because "Christ is wi" them.

A touching illustration of human sympathy with sorrow and distress may be found in Cooper's "Pioneers." Old Leatherstocking is condemned to the "stocks" and to subsequent imprisonment for an unconscious violation of new-made and little-known game laws. His free spirit ill brooks the thought of such restraint and rebels against it as an act of injustice to an inoffensive and law-abiding old man. His soul recoils with abhorrence from the shame of the public stocks, but he is greatly relieved and comforted when a jolly old sailor sits down beside him on the bench and thrusting his hands and feet through a vacant portion of the stocks, caused himself to be looked in with the shame-stricken old hunter in friendliest sympathy, vowing that if he could not alleviate his distress he would share in his cruel punishment.

Baptists have deepest fellowship with, and extend most loving sympathy to, their Adventist brethren in their brave fight against injustice and oppression, and like the aforesaid "ancient mariner" would most gladly sit with them on the judgment bench "with their feet fast in the stocks." Hence Baptists maintain that no religious body (or bodies), by reason of numerical preponderance or of State backing or support, has the right to interfere in the slightest degree with the conscientious beliefs of any well-ordered person or persons. They teach that toleration implies unwarranted assumption of power and authority over the minds and consciences of men—a wide realm over which, under God, freemen themselves individually, are appointed to reign and rule as kings and priests. They agree heartily with Roger Williams when he avows most emphatically, that "the doctrine of persecution for cause of conscience is most evidently and lamentably contrary to the doctrine of Jesus Christ," and believe with you that they who, to-day, arouse from the dust of well-merited oblivion, obsolete, arbitrary and unjust laws to cruelly harass and punish godly men for conscience' sake are sadly lacking in the beneficent spirit of that loving and compassionate Redeemer whom we all profess to love, and whose gospel of peace and goodwill we should example in word and in deed.

May God comfort and bless all who are in bonds for conscience' sake, and give them the victory.

Fraternally yours,
A. G. CAMERON.
Pastor Baptist Church.
