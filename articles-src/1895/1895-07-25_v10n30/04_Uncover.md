"UNCOVER!"

[From the Western Watchman, St. Louis, July 11.]

It seems we were a little hasty last week in endorsing the petition of the preachers to the pope. We understood from the published extract from that document that the chief gravamen of the gentlemen was the difficulty they experienced in getting married in three of the South American republics.

But a full copy of the petition is now before us, and we learn that the dominies have another grievance. It seems that some of them on the occasion of the late Corpus Christi celebration in Ecuador were on the streets when the procession passed by, and refusing to uncover to the host, their hats were removed from their heads by the populace.

This involves a principle which we shall never surrender. In Catholic countries Jesus Christ is recognized by law as a sovereign. Not so in Protestant countries. Being a sovereign and present in the host he receives everywhere the marks of respect due to majesty. When the mass is celebrated in the armies of Catholic States, arms are presented at the elevation, as on the occasion of the passage of majesty. When the host is borne in the procession, kings and emperors uncover to the majesty of the "King of kings and Lord of lords." We may excuse preachers for their ignorance of theology, for their herecy in refusing to believe the plain words of Scripture regarding the real presence; but we do not excuse them for ignorance of the laws of the country they propose to indoctrinate with their errors. If they go to countries where Jesus Christ is recognized as a sovereign they will have to pay him the respect due to his sovereign majesty. If they are so ignorant that they do not know Jesus Christ under the veils of the sacrament, they will have to bear the consequences of their ignorance.

With the exception of a few thousand preachers in Germany and a few more among the low church and evangelical preachers of England and the United States, the entire body of the Christian ministers of the world recognize Christ bodily and personally present in the eucharist. There are at least five hundred millions of nominal Christians in the world to-day. Of these over four hundred millions believe in the real presence. The others have been brought up without proper theological training, and have taken upon themselves to propagate and perpetuate the ravings of a drink-crazed ago of German anarchism. They may consider themselves lucky while the world continues to regard their religious vagaries as harmless; but when they take it upon themselves to obtrude their irreligious impertinence upon people of correct and intelligent views, they will generally find that the laws of politeness apply even to religious intercourse. When these preachers leave the land that produced them and mingle with people who were brought up in the faith they will have to conform, at least in outward demeanor, to their changed religious environment. If they go to Rome they will have to do as Rome does. If they go to Ecuador they will have to do what Ecuador does. And the pope will not be able to help them out. The disciple is not above his Master. The honor and respect the Ecuadorians pay to the sovereign majesty of Jesus Christ is the outward expression of the faith that is in them, and far from checking it, the pope would be the first of all men to encourage and reward it.

Then good preachers should remember that the Ecuadorians did not send for them, and would not interpose any obstacle to their return to the country that pays them for their impertinence. They came as the self-elected champions of a Protestantism that was first leveled against Christian toleration, and they must not be surprised if they find their cause already tried in the balance and found wanting by the very people they would insult with their "gospel."

No, we cannot indorse the petition of the preachers to be allowed to view Corpus Christi processions in Catholic countries with their hats on. There is a limit to toleration when the demand is made to be permitted to affront the Majesty of heaven in the house of his friends.
