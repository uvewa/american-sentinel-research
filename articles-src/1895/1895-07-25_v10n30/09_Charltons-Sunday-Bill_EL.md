# CHARLTON'S SUNDAY BILL.

# An Open Letter.

Hon. John Charlton*—Dear Sir: You will pardon me for addressing you in so public a manner; but as you have been zealously engaged for some time past in endeavoring to secure a law for the stringent observance of Sunday, a law which, if enacted, will affect the most sacred of all human rights, viz., the right of private judgment in religious matters, we shall take the liberty to address you in this public way.

First, we would like to ask,—with due respect,—Are you, as a representative of the people, respecting the rights of the people whom you represent, when you exercise, in your official capacity, a power which has not been delegated to you by the people? And is it possible for the people to delegate to their representative in Parliament, or to anybody else, the right to say in what manner they shall worship, or whether they shall worship in any manner at all? And further, when the people are compelled to keep Sunday, are they not compelled to conform to an act of religious worship! And is not conformity to this act of religious worship the sole object of your Sunday bill?

You will doubtless claim that the object of the bill is to secure to the laboring man the right to rest and worship on Sunday, and to go to church if he wants to do so. But cannot that object be attained without compelling him to rest when he don't want to do so? But that is not the worst of it; in order that the laboring man may rest, you propose to enact that everybody else MUST rest! It is the religious rest of the DAY that your bill will protect, not the civil RIGHTS of the laboring man nor of any other man!

But every laboring man in the Dominion of Canada already has the right to rest on the Lord's day, and go to church if he wants to do so. If he does not exercise the right, he has no one to blame but himself. There is no law in Canada requiring any man to labor on the Lord's day except it be the law of greed; but when you undertake to regulate the law of selfish greed so that it will be in harmony with the principles of Christian charity, you have undertaken a work which belongs to the church, and which can be effectually accomplished only by the use of spiritual weapons in the hands of a converted church. But the church is the very one who is foremost in its clamore for a Sunday law. It is not from the working man that the appeal comes for such a law. It comes from the preachers. It is work that the laboring man are clamoring for, not rest. The great majority of them would be thankful indeed if they could be sure of six days' work every week in the year.

It may be said that he would lose his job if he should exercise his right to rest on the Lord's day. But that is simply to say that he is not a Christian, for no Christian would labor on the Lord's day. He would lose his life in addition to the loss of his job rather than do it. Neither would a Christian appeal to the government for a law to regulate the conduct, if not the conscience, of his employer, so as to bring it into harmony with his own religious convictions. But here we find you, a member of Parliament, Protestant in religion and Liberal in politics, endeavoring to enact a law for the regulation of conscience and religious belief! Be astonished, O Earth!

Yet you will claim that legislation for securing Sunday rest does not rest on the right of government to regulate conscience and belief. Upon what does it rest, pray tell? If not on the right of government, it must be upon the USURPATION by the government of the individual's rights; for legislation to secure Sunday rest certainly does regulate conscience and belief. If it does not, we would be pleased to have you tell what would. These laboring men would like to rest, and, perhaps, go to church on Sunday, but they dare not do it because their employer's conscience is not regulated in harmony with theirs, and so a law is demanded to regulate his conscience according to their ideas. What is a law but a regulation? And what does it regulate if not the conduct of these men so that it appears to be what your conscience thinks it ought to be?

The employer who has no conscientious scruples about keeping open his place of business on the Lord's day, but who keeps it closed because he fears the law, certainly does have his conscience regulated by law. He has no respect for the divine requirement, but only for the human; and were it not for the human requirement he would continue at his business on the Lord's day. He keeps the day because he fears man, not because he fears God. Thus it is plain, not only that his conscience is regulated by law, but that he is forced to exalt the human above the divine. No man's worship goes higher than the source of the law which he obeys. If he is constrained by love to obey the law of God, his worship will be divine, rendered to the Supreme Being when he observes the Lord's day; but when he is compelled by force to obey the laws of man in regard to the observance of the Lord's day, his worship will be simply human, rendered to a human being.

You will doubtless claim that compulsory Lord's day observance is not religious worship; but if it is not an act of outward conformity to religious worship, we would be pleased to have you tell just what it really is. What in reason do you want him to rest for on Sunday if not to appear to reverence the day? He does not want to rest; if he did, he would rest whether there were a law requiring him to do so or not. But when he does rest against his will he is no better for it, and you are no better for it; then why compel him to rest? What has been gained by his enforced idleness?—Simply this,—he has been forced to conform to your idea of religious sanctity. The only possible evil that can result from one's laboring on the Lord's day, is the irreligious influence which is exerted over the community where it is performed; and therefore the only object which can be secured by compulsory Lord's day observance is the suppression of irreligious influences. It is religious legislation, and nothing short of it.

But again, you claim that the government should treat Sunday rest as a civil right, founded primarily upon divine requirement. But that is just what the government does not do. If it only would do that,—if the government would leave the individual free to exercise his civil right, either to work or to worship on Sunday, it would indeed treat the rest day as a civil right, and it never will treat it as such until then. A civil right, or any other kind of right, is freedom of choice between doing and not doing; and where such freedom of choice does not exist, from the nature of the case there can exist no RIGHT. So that when the government requires Sunday rest of the individual, instead of securing to him the civil RIGHT to rest, it really deprives him of that RIGHT. He rests on Sunday because he does not dare to do otherwise, and not because he has the civil RIGHT to do so.

As to the divine requirement to observe Sunday, we are utterly ignorant. Divine requirements are seen in nature and in Revelation. But there is nothing in nature, so far as we have been able to observe, to indicate that one should take Sunday rest, or Monday rest, or any other day rest. Nature does seem to indicate that the higher forms of animal life should take night rest, but it does not indicate in any uniform way the amount of day rest which should be taken. Over-exertion or other abnormal conditions may require occasional day rest; but there is no definite, fixed rule by which this can be determined. The exercise of a little good, common sense, or possibly, a physician's prescription, is all that is necessary under such circumstances. Nature does not indicate in any way that a definite portion of time should be set apart for day rest. The birds make their nests and take their flight without distinction of days. The bees gather their honey and swarm from their hives on Sundays the same as on other days of the week. The flowers bloom, the fruits grow, the stars follow their courses, seven days in the week. Nature is silent as to a divine requirement for Sabbath observance. And therefore, to find a divine requirement for a regularly recurring day of rest, we must look outside of nature.

We go to Revelation, and the only divine requirement for a day of rest to be found there is the fourth commandment of the Decalogue; but that requires the observance of the SEVENTH DAY, not the first day of the week,—not Sunday. If there is anything in the Bible showing that the divine requirement to observe the SEVENTH DAY has been changed to one requiring the observance of the first day of the week, we would be very much pleased to see it. If you really do know of any divine requirement for the observance of Sunday, do tell us where to find it. You could confer no greater favor upon the preachers. They have been looking for it ever since Sunday-keeping originated; but they have never yet succeeded in finding it, and that is why the preachers of to-day are so anxious to secure through you a human requirement for its observance.

* Hon. John Charlton, a member of the Dominion Parliament, is the Canadian champion of compulsory Sunday observance, and is, at the instigation of his religious constituents, laboring to secure a Sunday law from the present Parliament.

Either there is a divine requirement for the observance of Sunday or there is not. If there is, you can tell where to find it; but if there is not, and you are finally successful in securing the passage of your bill for the observance of the first day of the week, an institution for which there is no divine requirement, neither in nature nor in Revelation, we ask, in all seriousness, Are you not, by that act, exalting yourself above God? You admit that there is a divine requirement for the observance of a day, but it is the SEVENTH DAY and not the first day of the week which is divinely required to be observed. And if this divine requirement to observe the SEVENTH DAY has never been repealed, it certainly cannot honestly be cited as a divine requirement for the observance of another day.

We ask again, Where is the divine requirement for the observance of Sunday? We make bold to say there is no such requirement! And therefore the question which we have put is a seriously pertinent one, viz., Are you not by trying to secure such a law, exalting yourself above God? And in a two-fold manner; for your effort is to secure a human law for the observance of Sunday, the first day of the week, in opposition to the LAW OF GOD which requires the observance of Saturday, the SEVENTH DAY. Secondly, even though there were a divine requirement for the observance of Sunday, its divine character is entirely lost sight of through fear of the human. It is servile bondage to the State when it should be voluntary service to God. Sabbath-keeping is a religious practice and wholly such. It is a duty to be rendered to God alone and not to Caesar. "He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord; and he that regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard it." The Lord will have volunteers only in his service, never conscripts.

The Jew and others who observe the seventh day as the Sabbath, and with a divine requirement to sustain them, too, are forced to act as if they believe that Sunday is the sabbath when they know that there is no divine requirement for its observance. They are forced either to suffer the pains and penalties of civil law for disregarding a religious form of worship, and that, too, entirely of human origin, or to dishonor God by treating both days as if they were sacred when they know that God has blessed and sanctified but one day, and that the SEVENTH. The atheist, the infidel, and the non-professor are forced to dishonor God by appearing to reverence that form of worship when they have no reverence nor respect for it whatever. The government does legislate to enforce a belief by enacting such a law. Is it not because of your belief in the divine requirement that you seek to enforce the observance of the day? But whether the other man believes in it or not, you propose to make him act as if he does! You certainly do propose that he shall conform his conduct to your belief. "There was a time when toleration was cra ed as a boon; then it was demanded as a right, but now it is spurned as an INSULT!" What, then, shall be said of intolerance?

Of course, every man has the natural right, call it civil right if you like, to rest and worship on the Lord's day; but that does not imply that he has the (un)civil right to compel every other man or any other man either to rest or to worship on that day. He can exercise his right to rest and worship on the Lord's day whether any other man in the world does or not. If the government treats the day as a civil institution merely, as you claim, civil people will not be annoyed nor disturbed by civil employment conducted in a civil manner on that day. Neither will a Christian be disturbed by anything of that kind.

But there is no more reason for being disturbed by such things on the Lord's day than there is on the evening of a prayer-meeting. Is not Sunday treated as a civil day by the government? And is not common labor civil? It certainly is during six days of the week. Then why is it not civil on the seventh? It is civil. How in reason can you make it appear that civil employment on a civil day is uncivil? There is no more reason why a religious meeting should profess to be disturbed by quiet, civil labor on the (civil?) Lord's day than there is for the sittings of Parliament or of the courts of justice to be disturbed by the same thing on other days of the week. When religious people allow themselves to be disturbed by civil things which do not disturb civil people, it looks as if there was something radically wrong with their religion, or else that these good religious people are practicing a deception by trying to secure a law under an assumed title. A Sunday law is a RELIGIOUS law, not a civil law: and if the preachers do not know it, they ought to. The whole scope of Sunday laws is summed up in one word, religious restraint. Your bill is a measure calculated solely to impose religious restraint upon the people. It is a measure calculated to regulate the conduct of all so that they shall act as if they were in harmony with your religious belief.

Has the government the right to enact such a law?—Yes! It has the same right to enact a Sunday law that I have to knock you down and rob you when there is no stronger power to restrain me; and I shall have to answer to God alone for the evil. So of the government; it has the right (the power, the freedom of choice), to commit itself to the wickedness of enacting a Sunday law, and there is no earthly power to hinder it; but there is a just God to whom the promoters of the evil act, AS INDIVIDUALS, must give account; and I pray you be warned in time. "It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God."

Yes, the government has that kind of a right to enact a Sunday law, and we shall not attempt to resist it, because we are exhorted to be subject to the powers that be and not to resist them; but when once the evil thing is done, as it surely will be done, and we are called upon to obey a human law in opposition to the law of God, to observe a counterfeit sabbath instead of the Sabbath of the Lord, to forfeit the right to work on Sunday, that which God himself not only did but commanded us to do, we can but answer in the language of the apostles: "We ought to obey God rather than men," and suffer the consequences, leaving the higher powers to be dealt with by the highest power, even the power of God.

Yours for the right,

EUGENE LELAND.
