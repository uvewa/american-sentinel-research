A LETTER FROM ONE OF THE PRISONERS.

The following letter written to the Review and Herald, Battle Creek, Mich., by one of the Dayton prisoners will interest our readers:—

"Dayton, Tenn., Rhea County Jail,
"March 24, 1895.

"Perhaps you would like to hear some of the circumstances in regard to my being indicted for Sunday work. I live four and one-half miles north of Graysville, in what is called the 'Cove'; it is a little valley between two mountains, three miles from the village.

"On Sept. 9, 1894, Charles Dungan and Mr. Rudd went to meeting about one mile from their home, and during the services they went off across a ridge through the woods, and found me pulling fodder (that is stripping the blades off the standing corn) out of sight of the public road or any public place. They made an agreement that Mr. Rudd would go before the grand jury and prosecute me, and have Mr. Dungan marked as witness, dividing the witness fee. The law does not allow the prosecutor any pay for prosecuting, but the witness is allowed $1 a day. Mr. Dungan received his pay and would not share it with Mr. Rudd. This made Mr. Rudd angry, and he told a brother about it. Since I have been in jail, Mr. Rudd has visited me, and asked if I wanted a bond, and said if I did, he would procure it for me. I explained to him that I was serving out my time and we could not pay our fines, it being contrary to our consciences. He said that my family should not suffer for it, and it made me think of Ps. 76:10 and Rom. 8:28.

"The other case against me was for digging in a well in Graysville, more than forty feet deep. Between me and the most public road was a two-story house, and on the west side a pile of stone nearly as high as a man's head; on the north side were a barn and a thick patch of corn: the other side was hidden by the house, fence, high weeds, etc.

"The man (Wright Raines) who had me indicted for working at the well neither saw nor heard me at work.

"Our courage in the Lord is good.

"Your brother in Christ,

"WM. S. BURCHARD."
