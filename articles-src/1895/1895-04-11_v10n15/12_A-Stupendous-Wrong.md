A Stupendous Wrong.

[Editorial from the Dayton Republican, March 25.]

Do the good citizens of Dayton and Rhea County fully realize the enormous wrong being perpetrated upon the sacred rights of individual citizenship as guaranteed by our blood-bought Constitution, in the imprisonment in the county jail of eight of the Christian citizens of this county, because, forsooth, they have worshiped God according to the dictates of conscience?

Can they quietly and complacently look on while this startling nineteenth century paradox is being enacted?

Will God approve of this oppression of a branch of his devoted followers? and will he not rebuke in the day of judgment the persecution these people are undergoing for opinion's sake at the hands of others of his professed followers? and will he not further hold to a strict accountability the passive indifference of others of his followers who quietly allow this great wrong to be perpetrated?

Christians all, Presbyterians, Methodists, Catholics, Baptists, Episcopalians and every denomination that worships in the name of the Lord of Hosts, and whose hearts have imbibed the humanity and love illustrated in the life of Christ, put yourselves in these men's places. They have been taken from their families, deprived of liberty, the stigma of felon placed upon them, their business broken up, and a portion of their property virtually confiscated by the State, and for what? For worshiping the God of their fathers!

Shades of Washington and Jefferson, look down upon us and restore our faith in, and love for, the Declaration of Independence!

Are we insensate blocks of wood, that we shall quietly allow this persecution to proceed? The very walls of the jail cry out in thunderous tones of eloquent indignation against this offense.

Do we need a new Declaration of Independence, in order to quicken our sense of liberty and justice?

In the broad light of the closing nineteenth century, with all the facts of the past ages serving as warnings, are Christians to still suffer a martyrdom for the faith that is in them? Have Luther and Wesley and Whitfield and Rogers lived in vain, that we have not yet learned the lesson that the truth shall make men free?
