## CATHOLICS AND THE BIBLE.

On March 3, Cardinal Gibbons preached a sermon in the cathedral at Baltimore, advising his audience to read the Bible. The Catholic press of the country hastened to publish the sermon, and to remark that it would have the effect, "to convince non-Catholics that they have been misinformed by the Protestant tradition concerning the attitude of the church toward the Word of God."

No wide awake Protestant will be deceived by the apparent change of attitude toward the Bible. But if there are any of our readers who believe that the Catholic Church is any more friendly to the Bible now than when she burned it, let them read the following from the Cardinal's official organ, the Catholic Mirror, which appeared in the issue preceding the publication of the sermon (February 23):

The Bible is a volume very difficult to be understood by anybody; hardly six lines can be properly comprehended without a commentary.

And now comes the April number of the American Ecclesiastical Review, which is printed under the phrase, *Cum Approbatione Superiorum* (with approbation of superiors), and says:—

It is the Catholic position that the Bible, although a part, the principal part, of the remote rule of faith, is not the sole and exclusive rule, is not the proximate rule, and is not placed directly by God in the hands of individuals to learn from it by their private reading the truths of the Christian religion.

Protestants, don't be deceived. It is impossible for the papacy to experience a favorable change of heart and still remain the papacy.
