A NEW YORK club man is said to be authority for the statement that Cornelius Vanderbilt has an idea that the anarchists and unemployed will one day rise up against the wealthy, and one of the first points of attack will be the Vanderbilt mansion. The Vanderbilt house appears to its owner, the club man said, as the place where, like the Tuileries in the time of the commune, the mob will rush to at one great gate on Fifty-seventh Street, and out the other one on Fifty-eighth, using the wide halls as they did those of the French palace and applying the torch as they crowd through the building.

Mr. Vanderbilt's idea is probably not very wide of the truth. Certain it is that a time of trouble is coming to the immensely wealthy. This is clearly foreshadowed by Holy Writ: "Go to now, ye rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon you. Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are moth-eaten. Your gold and silver is cankered; and the rust of them shall be a witness against you, and shall eat your flesh as it were fire. Ye have heaped treasure together for the last days." James 5:1-3.

The Revised Version renders the text, "in the last days," which makes it all the more significant; for never in the history of the world has there been such a heaping together of riches as during the last thirty years.

A LONDON paper states that Russia is taking steps for a more strict enforcement of Sunday observance in that empire.

THE Sunday Observance League of Chicago will make another attempt this year to prohibit Sunday baseball. It is said that the League proposes to turn its attention also to Sunday newspapers.

MR. CHARLTON, the Sunday champion of the Dominion of Canada, has introduced in Parliament another bill "to promote the observance of the Lord's day." We have not seen a copy of this measure.

THE Catholic Review remarks that "the invitation of the pope to the non-Catholics of England to come into the divinely-guarded unity of the faith, may be heeded by a number of chosen souls now and by a multitude drawn by it to consider the grounds of their religious belief later on."

THE confiscation bill has been defeated in the Tennessee Legislature. Had this bill passed it would have enabled the enemies of Seventh-day Adventists to have absolutely stripped them of their property. Its defeat shows that the law-makers of that State are not without some humane impulses.

THE illustrated numbers of the AMERICAN SENTINEL, describing the persecution in Tennessee, have attracted widespread attention, and many papers have devoted considerable space to a statement of the facts and to editorial condemnation of these Tennessee persecutions. We have received but two secular papers which defend the intolerance.

IN commenting upon the estimate made by the Sun's Rome correspondent that Signor Crispi's adherents in the new Italian Chamber of Deputies will, notwithstanding the desperate efforts put forth, number only three hundred out of a total of five hundred and eight, the Catholic Review says:—

Crispi must be in straits if he has to resort to unscrupulous means to corral a majority of the comparatively few Italians who take part in the elections. His need of desperate measures is a fresh proof that the monarchy is doomed. The engine used by the lodges to overthrow the temporal power of the papacy, shall itself be overthrown.

This shows the undying hostility of the papacy to the Italian Government. Rome will ruin where she cannot rule; and it is just as true that she ruins where she rules.

THE World, of the 30th ult., had this item of news:—

PARK RIDGE, N. J., April 29.—Henry Lauschall and his fifteen-year-old son Paul, who live at the Hotel Lavette, No. 164 Wooster Street, New York, were arrested at Woodcliff yesterday morning by Constable S. J. Van Wagonen, on the charge of fishing on Sunday in the Paschack Brook. The constable ordered them to stop fishing under threat of arrest. They gave no attention to the order, and were taken before Justice W. B. Smith, of Park Ridge. They pleaded guilty to the charge, and were fined $20 each. Landlord Louis Lavette, of New York, paid the fines, and says that he will carry the case to the higher courts.

This is simply another illustration of the tyranny of Sunday laws. What possible reason could there be for forbidding fishing on Sunday more than on other days except the supposed sacred character of the day? and what business has the State to meddle with any such question?

A CATHOLIC paper has this significant item relative to "Father" Elliott's propaganda for the "conversion" of Protestants:—

The missions to non-Catholic Americans that Father Elliott has been preaching in Michigan and Ohio, are making an impression not only on the audiences he seeks, but also on those of the faith. The young men readers of the Catholic Columbine having been asked in what way could $50,000 be best expended for the public good, one of them answers: "I would give the $50,000 to the Paulist Fathers for the extension of their missions to non-Catholics." A happy choice, truly, for that sum could not be spent on a better cause!

It is certain that the Catholics of this country are manifesting a wonderful activity in the work of proselyting from the ranks of other churches. They discern the drift in their direction and are simply out with their grab-hooks to secure that which is floating their way.

THE fact that every year adds immensely to the volume of civil and criminal law thought to be necessary to regulate the conduct of the people, should admonish us that we live in an age when self-government is rapidly becoming a lost art.

True freedom consists not in liberty to follow one's own inclinations in all things, but in a practical recognition by both government and people of the principles of eternal justice. Freedom does not mean license, for that only is liberty which recognizes and respects the rights of others equally with our own.

There is a sound basis for the words of Cowper:—

He is a freeman, whom the truth makes free,
And all are slaves beside. There's not a chain,
That hellish foes, confederate for his harm,
Can wind around him, but he casts it off
With as much ease as Samson his green withes.

This is not saying that men may not deny to their fellows the free exercise of their God-given rights,—the history of the world too clearly proves that,—but it is saying that while despotic power may invade human rights, "Justice still confirms them." In the words of Elder Colcord before a Tennessee court: "There is a time coming when there will be a change, and God and not man will be the Judge—and in that court questions will be decided not by the statute books of Tennessee, but by the law of God."

Rights may be trampled upon now, but there is a time coming when wrongs shall be righted and the truth vindicated, when "the prisoner and serf shall go free," when "truth crushed to earth shall rise again." It is better in the long run to be right than to be popular.

AN Old Testament exemplification of Christ's words, "Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's," is found in the record of the experience of the three Hebrew worthies who were cast into the "fiery furnace." They disobeyed the king's command to "fall down and worship the golden image" because it required them to render to Nebuchadnezzar and his golden image that which was due alone to God; but they obeyed the king's command to "come forth, and come hither," because it was their duty to render obedience to the king in matters not conflicting with their duty to God; and the Lord, who approved their disobedience by miraculously preserving them alive, brought the miracle to a close at the command of the king, that the faithful men might obey the consistent command.

"WHEN Catholics are in power," says a prominent Catholic paper, "they always respect the rights of conscience possessed by the minority. For instance, when they had control of Manitoba, they granted to the Protestants the kind of schools desired by the latter. So, to-day, in the Province of Quebec, where they are in a majority, they are liberal and considerate. There is no school question there. They do not insist upon a nominally 'unsectarian' system of education that in practice will be made essentially Catholic. They ask nothing for themselves that they do not yield to their neighbors. They are the real lovers of religious liberty."

It is true that to-day the attitude of the Catholics in the Province of Quebec is more in accordance with the principles of religious liberty than is the attitude of so-called Protestants in Manitoba. But Rome must be judged not by what she does in such a country as Canada, where she is constantly on the defensive, but by her record in Spain, in the Caroline Islands, in Italy and the various South American countries where her priests are the ruling power. It is too late in the history of the world for Rome to successfully pose as the champion of liberty.
