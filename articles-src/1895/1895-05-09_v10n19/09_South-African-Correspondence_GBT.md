The following piece of telegraphic news has just appeared in the secular press:—

For selling a shirt on Sunday a Pretorian was fined seven pounds and ten shillings by the Landdrost.

Pretoria is the capital of the South African Republic, or Transvaal, and some idea of the savage character of the Sunday law there may be gained by the above dispatch. No law of God was violated; no person's liberties were interfered with; none were molested in their worship of the Deity; there was no disturbance, no riot. The transaction was properly civil. A man is in need of that necessary habiliment,—a shirt,—and goes, as people do every day in the week, to a man who has shirts for sale, and buys one. For this the merchant is summoned before "his honor," and a fine of over thirty-six dollars is imposed.

But why was the shopkeeper fined? Oh, for selling a shirt! But is it a crime to sell a shirt? Are there not thousands of them sold daily without a thought of it being wrong? Why this difference? What makes the transaction wrong on this occasion?—Because the sale took place on Sunday, a supposedly holy day. This shows that the day, and not the deed, constitutes the sin; and the penalty imposed by the Landdrost was only the enforcement of a law made to exalt the "venorable day of the sun." But what kind of justice is that which makes a man a criminal for doing one day in the week that which is perfectly right and proper the other six days?

But if these self-constituted custodians of other people's morals are going to wreak vengeance on iniquity wherever they imagine it exists, what about the individual who bought the garment? We have not heard that he has been seized. Why is this? Is it because it is right to buy a shirt on Sunday but wrong to sell one?

Then again, was this a work of necessity? Most all Sunday laws make an exception for works of necessity, though it has never been explained just what is a necessity. Perhaps that is why the purchaser of the shirt was not arrested. It is certainly necessary to wear a shirt on Sunday to hear the parson preach; and if the person did not have one, and must attend church, or go somewhere else where a shirt must be worn, it was, of course, necessary to buy one. But if it was necessary for him to buy one it was equally necessary for somebody to sell him one. So if one was exempt because of necessity, the other must be also.

The conscience of the shopkeeper no doubt justified him in selling shirts. He doubtless believed that he had a right to earn an honest living seven days in the week. If he sinned, it was against God, and God alone. Then how can man estimate the magnitude of his guilt? The judicial bench on this occasion reckoned that he had sinned thirty-six dollars and thirty cents worth, when the fact is, he had not sinned in the least, so far as selling a shirt on Sunday is concerned, for there is no divine law which forbids it, and "where no law is, there is no transgression." Rom. 4:15.

In the Sunday law the Dutch Republic has a statute in support of a religious institution, which demands from a man one seventh of his time, or ten years of the allotted three score years and ten, to be devoted to recognizing this church institution. God left a man free to choose whether or not he would keep the Sabbath, but the Transvaal government, and every other government which has a Sunday law, exalts itself above God by forcing Sabbath observance upon the people. This is the papacy. This is the inevitable outgrowth of a union of the Church with the State. The Church having lost the power of God, is seizing the secular arm for support. For shame, O professed church of the Mighty God!

In the days of Ezra, when the people were rebuilding Jerusalem which had lain in ruins for over seventy years, they were opposed by enemies numerous and great. They needed help to accomplish the work. But no appeal was made to an arm of flesh. Troublous as were the times, Ezra said: "I was ashamed to require of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen to keep us against the enemy in the way: because we had spoken unto the king, saying, The hand of our God is upon all them for good that seek him." Ezra 8:22. Ezra and his people petitioned the King of heaven, and not a king of earth.

Now the professed people of God, though claiming that God is with them, and making great boasts of holiness, unblushingly seek for the power of the policeman's baton to enforce their ecclesiastical dogmas, and help them in their work. But all whose hearts are "prepared" as was the heart of Ezra, will be ashamed of all such work.
