### Persecution of the Adventists.

Immigration to Tennessee Stopped in the North in Many Localities On Account of It.

[The following letter, copied from the Dayton Republican, presents a new phase of the persecution of Seventh-day Adventists in Tennessee. The Sentinel, as all its readers know, is strictly non-partisan, devoting its columns to religious truth, especially the great, cardinal, Christian truth of religious liberty; and some of our warmest friends and co-laborers, even in Tennessee, are found in both of the great political parties. It is true that tens of thousands of SENTINELS are distributed by our friends in every State of the Union, in which we point out the cruel injustice done an inoffensive people through the enforcement of Sunday laws, and it is more than likely that this agitation will affect the material interests of the section in which these persecutions occur; but the Sentinel dissolves all intent or desire to make the question a sectional, political or commercial problem. The principles involved are as broad as the world, and infinitely more important than party politics or commerce. The principles involve not only the cherished principle of religious liberty, but the eternal life of both the persecuted parties and those directly or indirectly responsible for their persecution. It is from this point that the Sentinel has treated and will treat the matter.]

Atlanta, Ga., April 18, 1895.

### Editor Dayton Republican:

I have read your editorial of March 23, with reference to the outrage committed on citizens of your county because of their religious belief. But I want to put the affair in a different light.

The South has a heavy load of opprobrium to carry now, and why seek to make things worse? Has it ever occurred to you what effect this religious persecution in Tennessee will have on immigration? If not, I can tell you.

I have just returned from a nine months' visit to Ohio, where I found, scattered everywhere among the farmers, copies of the AMERICAN SENTINEL and other papers, giving full account of the imprisonment of the Adventists in Rhea County, Tenn. In one settlement a number of farmers had made up their minds to move to Tennessee, and had formed a club for that purpose. I was aiding the matter all I could, as you can find out by writing to John E. Helms, of the Gazette, Morristown, Tenn., to which paper I wrote a letter, urging real estate men to send advertising matter about Tennessee to me for general distribution.

But this religious persecution knocked the whole thing in the head. The majority of these intending immigrants were Republicans, and they feared to move South. Said one of them to me:—

I am not going where there is no religious or political freedom. If the Tennessee authorities persecute and imprison men and women for their religious belief, they would find some pretext to harass and persecute me, because I am a Republican, and the rest who would go there. No, Sir, I am not going to such a State. And look how they have about counted out the Republican Governor in Tennessee. I tell you, we are not going to such a place. I see that they also imprison Adventists in Georgia, and I guess it is the same way all over the South. We are now thinking of Oklahoma or southern California, and have given up all idea of going to Tennessee or any of the Southern States.

Thousands of people at the North want to come South, but they are afraid of religious or political persecution. Many of the old prejudices against the South had worn away, and there was a feeling of confidence in east Tennessee, with its big Republican majority, but the recent persecution of Christians in Rhea County and the counting out of H. Clay Evans, has retarded immigration—set it back for years,—and unless the intolerant laws there are repealed, and a free and honest ballot maintained, the State will lose millions in immigration.

As a Southerner who loves the South and wants to see it grow in population and in wealth, I am sorry to see such a state of things. There are thousands of Adventists and Seventh-day Baptists in the Northern and Western States, who observe the seventh day, but not the first day of the week; but not one of these people has ever been arrested or in any way molested because of their religious belief. To do such a thing is a crime against freedom, a violation of the Constitution, and an outrage on the rights of man. It is a monstrous act of injustice, for which Tennessee must surely suffer in loss of immigration, as I have already pointed out.

I am not an Adventist. I have nothing in common with these people except a desire for liberty of thought. But I have lived among these people, mingled with them, and know, that if there are any conscientious, honest, truly religious and really worthy people and patriotic citizens, they will be found among the Adventists.

And, to see other so-called Christians persecuting them, and informing on them, and backing up the authorities who send the Adventists to jail simply because they do not believe as the other Christians believe, is simply a horrible and contemptible mockery on religion. The Christian who would imprison another Christian because of a difference in belief, is not a Christian, but a devil incarnate. Why, if this thing keeps up we may look for a no/stablishment of the Inquisition, with all its bloody horrors!

All laws conflicting with perfect religious freedom, not only in Tennessee, but in all the Southern States, should be repealed, and laws enacted granting persons the right to worship and work as their consciences dictated. We want perfect mental, religious and political liberty. Our forefathers fought for these things. But, if good people are to be imprisoned because of their religious belief, then our forefathers fought in vain, and liberty is a mockery and a lie.

JOHN HAMILTON DAVIS.
