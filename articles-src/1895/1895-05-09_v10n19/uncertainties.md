# Uncertainties Log - Volume 10, Number 19 (1895-05-09)

## General OCR Quality
The OCR quality for this issue was generally good, with readable text throughout. The following uncertainties were noted:

## Page 1, Column 1
- **Line 33:** "ANDIOTZ" appears to be a decorative element or OCR error. Context suggests this may be a typographical ornament or section divider, not meaningful text. Left as transcribed.

## Page 1, Column 2
- **Line 53:** "popas" - appears in original OCR. Context suggests this should be "popes" but transcribed as appears in scan to preserve accuracy.

## Page 3, Column 3
- **Line 189:** "no/stablishment" - appears to be "re-establishment" but OCR read as "no/stablishment". Transcribed as it appears, though likely an OCR error for "re-establishment of the Inquisition".

## Page 7, Advertisement Section
- **Lines 408-466:** The Bible specimen table appears heavily corrupted by OCR, with garbled text mixing chapter references, verse numbers, and fragmentary words. This appears to be a sample page layout showing Bible formatting. Preserved as OCR rendered it, though clearly corrupted.

## Page 7, Advertisement Section
- **Lines 481-487:** Table of contents for "Steps to Christ" shows some OCR errors:
  - "BINGER'S" likely should be "SINNER'S"
  - "REPESTANCE" likely should be "REPENTANCE"
  - "COOPERATION" appears correct
  - "FATH" likely should be "FAITH"
  - "DISCIPLINARY" likely should be "DISCIPLESHIP"
  - "GROWING OF INTO CHRIST" likely should be "GROWING UP INTO CHRIST"
  - "DUCET" likely should be "DOUBT"
  - "REDUCING" likely should be "REJOICING"

These were preserved as transcribed since they appear in advertisement text, not article content.

## Overall Assessment
Most article content was clear and readable. Main uncertainties were in decorative elements, proper names, and advertisement layout text. All substantive article content appears accurately transcribed.
