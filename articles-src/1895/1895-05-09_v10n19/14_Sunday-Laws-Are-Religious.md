The efforts which certain advocates of Sunday legislation make to create a distinction between the civil Sabbath and the religious Sabbath are as futile as they are sometimes amusing. It is generally confessed that the civil law has no province in directing religious faith or practice. The terms usually employed, and the "exceptions" usually made, as well as the past history of Sunday legislation, forbid any such distinction. As for example: "Secular works" are forbidden. That term has no meaning in this connection except as contrasted with "heavenly" or "spiritual" work. "Works of necessity and mercy" have no meaning in such a connection except that they are permitted on religious grounds. The fact that preachers, priests, organists, etc., are permitted to do their regular work on Sunday, while other forms of business and labor are prohibited, shows that the distinction is made on religious grounds. The term "Lord's day," which is usually used in such laws as explanatory, has no meaning except that the day is sacred for religious reasons.

The same principle is true in the matter of "disturbance." There is a general law against disturbing public worship at any time. But the average Sunday law forbids secular work "to the disturbance of others" in the enjoyment of their religious rights. If the general laws are sufficient to prevent the disturbance of religious worship on the part of Seventh-day Baptists, Quakers, and others, on other days than Sunday, there can be no ground for specific legislation touching Sunday, except that it is a day more sacred than others. A Wednesday evening prayer-meeting is as religious as a Sunday evening prayer-meeting. These facts apply throughout the whole field of Sunday legislation.

Much is said concerning the evils of Sunday newspapers, and the objections imply that "irreligious" and "secular" reading should be prohibited on Sunday. A falsehood published in a newspaper, or an impure paragraph, or objectionable literature of any kind, is no more false or impure on Sunday than on Monday. These instances might be multiplied until the end of the chapter.

The religious character of these laws is crowded to the front when their advocates claim that they are necessary to protect the church services from intrusion on that day by keeping men from public worship. It is asked that Congress suppress the post-office service and the Sunday newspaper, lest these suppress the attendance at church. He would have great hardihood who should say that such action would not be based on religious grounds. The whole conception of church service and public attendance thereon rests on religious considerations.

Perhaps the most popular plea with these religious, yet non-religious advocates, is that the law shall guarantee a day of rest in each week for working men. On the other hand the advocates of Sunday laws are loud in their claim that the Lord will take care of those who observe Sunday from religious principles, even though they lose a given business position. To be consistent, the advocates of Sunday laws should be fully satisfied if the employer were compelled to give each laborer one day out of the week whether it be Sunday or Friday. On the contrary they carry their religious demands so far as to forbid Jews and Sabbath-keeping Christians from laboring on Sunday, although they have fulfilled every demand of law, human or divine, by resting on the Sabbath. The hypocrisy of such claims is a shame to Christianity and common honesty. It is also true that labor in general is so well organized and acts with such unanimity along common lines that it takes its leisure whenever it will, regulates the length of its day's work, and all without special interference by the civil law at any particular time. If the claim of the "civil Sunday" reformers were true, that the civil Sunday is only a legal holiday, there would be equal reason for making it a grave misdemeanor to labor on the Fourth of July or on Washington's Birthday, for these are as truly legal holidays as is Sunday. Nevertheless he who chooses to work on either of those days may do so without interference on the part of the law, because these are not religious holidays.

The same inconsistency appears when men press questions of hygiene, etc., as the ground for enforcing Sunday laws. It is well known that thousands of men and women work at night, and to excess, and under unhealthful circumstances, with general results far more detrimental to the common interests of humanity, and to the good of the individual, than those which come from working seven days in the week. But these Sunday reformers do not propose to enter the domain of hygiene and general welfare at any time except Sunday, which shows that the genius of these laws and the real purpose of their advocates is to enforce a religious dogma and to accomplish religious ends through Sunday legislation.

It is impossible to say how long this sort of indirect and hypocritical claims will continue. One thing is apparent: Sunday desecration increases steadily in spite of all these claims and efforts. A notable case in point is the rapid increase of disregard for Sunday in and around Pittsburg, Pa., where the headquarters of the religio-civil reformers has been for many years. The public knows that the intent of Sunday legislation and the purposes which gave it birth center in religion. And since they know that the civil law, under that great charter of Christianity, the New Testament, and under our National Constitution, has no right to interfere in religious matters,

they disregard the laws, smile at the false claims of their advocates and go on doing as they please. At the same time the complication of the prohibition of the liquor traffic on Sunday with that of other forms of business puts a club into the hands of the saloons, which they are not slow nor unsuccessful in using to foster and protect their nefarious business. Sunday reformers seem to be blind to this fact.—*Evangel and Sabbath Outlook*.
