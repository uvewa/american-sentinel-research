National Reformism and its coadjutant Sabbbath reformism, when carried to their legitimate conclusion, furnish an example of selfishness and unfairness, that, were they not clothed in a religious garb, would invite abhorrence where now they receive the meed of approval. The movement, though professedly in the interests of Christianity and humanity, is diametrically opposed to both, as I will endeavor to show.

On a certain occasion when Christ journeyed toward Jerusalem, the citizens of a village in Samaria refused to receive him as a guest. Two of his disciples implored him to call down fire from heaven upon the villagers as a punishment for their inhospitality. "But he turned, and rebuked them, and said, Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of. For the Son of man is not come to destroy men's lives, but to save them." Luke 9:55, 56.

It may be clearly seen from the foregoing quotation that Jesus meekly submitted to an affront, and rebuked his disciples for not doing so. The spirit that actuated them was the spirit of the devil, while he was moved by the Spirit of God. The whole tenor of Christ's teaching is one of persuasion, and not of coercion.

Said he to the Pharisees, "I judge no man." John 8:15. And again, "If any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world." John 12:47.

The work committed to the gospel minister is not one to be advanced by carnal force or resistance, but by persuasion and submission, even to the extent of suffering if need be; and the minister who leaves his God-given commission to inspire a political crusade in the supposed interests of religion, is actuated, not by the Spirit of Christ, but by the same spirit that prompted the disciples in calling for vengeance upon a village of Samaria.

That National Reform is unfair and selfish, is exhibited in many ways, chiefly in the persistent demand for more stringent Sunday laws by which ordinary labor or traffic may be curtailed, and recreation forbidden by prohibiting the running of Sunday excursion trains and boats, whereby the members of their churches, and others, having spent six days in grimy, dusty shops, or in hard labor over the wash or ironing board, are denied the pleasure of a cheap ride into the country on Sunday, where the scenery and the air are so recuperative of worn strength of body and mind, and are shut up in the city where relaxation from toil and pestilential associations cause crime to flourish as in a hottest; while, perhaps, the ministers and shepherds of the flocks are away at some lakeside spending days or weeks at a time with their families, surrounded with restful comforts, waited upon by domestics, and receiving reverent attention from many. If these same ministers would deny themselves such pleasures for at least half the time, and send, at their own expense, some of the poor widows and orphans of their flocks to the lakeside, they would still have the advantage of not being compelled to labor in grimy shops, and might receive some credit for sincerity and Christlike benevolence.

Jesus said, "The Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister." Mark 10:45. "It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and the servant as his lord." Matt. 10:25. "As He is, so are we in this world." 1 John 4:17.

It is true that Protestant National Reform has of late lost some of its lustre, because the greater effulgence of Roman Catholicism from whence it borrowed its light, has arisen upon our country to control its political and religious element; and Roman Catholicism is National Reformism in principle, simon-pure.

It is too late to reform the religio-political body, but not too late for those who will be warned to escape the thralldom.
