The heading of this article is a much-used and favorite expression of the Sunday-law advocates in referring to seventh-day observers who suffer imprisonment and the chain-gang, rather than compromise their principles by keeping Sunday or paying fines to escape the penalty of an unjust law.

These imprisoned Adventists have had no disposition to pose before the people as martyrs as they have been falsely charged by those who make high professions of Christianity. The charge is one that impugns the motives of the people in question, which is rebuked by the Redeemer of mankind in Matt. 7:1: "Judge not, that ye be not judged." It has not been without a severe struggle, that these men have chosen imprisonment rather than compromise principle and remain with their families, for they "are men of like passions" as we are; but after seeking God in earnest prayer, and like Jacob of old when they had obtained the assurance that they had prevailed with God, they were willing to go to prison, or death, for being loyal to the law of their God which says: "Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labor and do all thy work: but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God," etc.

One who would accuse Seventh-day Adventists of courting persecution for disregarding civil laws when they conflict with God's law, would have been on the side of the heathen king Nebuchadnezzar and the vast multitude of his subjects who fell prostrate in worship before the golden image, and would have cried out in contempt with a sneer to the three Hebrews who refused to obey the heathen king, as "courters of persecution." Notwithstanding the second trial the king gave them, they "courted (?) persecution" to the extent of being cast in the fiery furnace. God delivered them from the furnace, as he will, sooner or later, all who choose persecution rather than prove disloyal to him.

Daniel, who could have escaped the lions' den by bowing down to laws of the wicked king Darius, would also have been accused of "courting persecution" by those who would parry the reason why Seventh-day Adventists disobey the iniquitous Sunday laws of to-day. One of the most marked examples of "courting persecution" was displayed during the entire ministry of Christ, and it was for Sabbath keeping too.

As Jesus persisted in healing on the Sabbath days, when he knew that the Pharisees of his time sought to persecute him (John 5:16; Mark 3:6), his course must have appeared as absurd and obstinate to those Pharisees, as does the course of Seventh-day Adventists to the modern ones. Were He upon earth today, and going contrary to the customs and wicked laws, he would be stigmatized, as his true followers have always been, as "courting persecution."

The apostles refused to obey laws that would prohibit their preaching the pure principles of the gospel, and it caused them to be persecuted. They, like all the foregoing examples, would, if living to-day, be stamped as "courting persecution," as those are who emulate their example, by those who have long since forgotten the example and words of Jesus, whom they profess to love, when he said, as recorded in John 12:47: "If any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world."

The fifty millions of martyrs who were persecuted and slaughtered during the Dark Ages, and the noble souls who were persecuted and banished under the old Blue Laws of colonial times, would all be placed on the list as "courters of persecution," were some of the religionists of to-day to interpret their motives.

The words that the apostle was inspired to write, as found in Acts 14:22, should be remembered by all: "We must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God." Also in 2 Tim. 3:12: "Yes, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution." May God grant that his people may endure to the end, and then the promise is that they shall be saved.
