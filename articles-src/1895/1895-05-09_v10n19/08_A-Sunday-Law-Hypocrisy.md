A BILL is pending at Albany to regulate barbers. It forbids barbers outside the great cities to shave any customers at all on Sunday. As to barbers in the great cities, it permits them to shave until 1 o'clock P. M., but not after that hour.

Nothing could better illustrate the absurdity of our Sunday laws than this. Nobody will pretend that there is anything inherently wrong in the shaving of a man. The only possible excuse for forbidding it on Sunday is that Sunday is "holy time," as our statutes

phrase it, and that it is the business of the secular law to compel men to observe "holy time."

But are we to understand then that while the whole of Sunday is "holy time" in the country towns, only that part of Sunday which comes after 1 o'clock P. M. is "holy time" in New York? If it is an offense against morality for a barber to shave a man during Sunday afternoon is it not equally so for him to shave a man during Sunday forenoon? And if it is immoral for a barber in Binghampton to shave customers on Sunday morning is it not equally immoral for a New York barber to do the same thing?

And finally, if it is the duty of the law to compel religious observances what possible right can the legislature have to excuse men in one part of the State for neglect of an obligation which it enforces against citizens in other parts of the State?

How long is this hypocrisy of Sunday laws to remain upon our statute books?
