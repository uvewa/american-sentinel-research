The Sentinel is gratified with the approving words for the faithfulness of the persecuted Seventh-day Adventists, which are found in our Hebrew exchanges. One of the most courageous and consistent of these, and one which utilizes every opportunity to speak for the persecuted and for the principles of religious liberty at stake in the struggle, is The Jewish Spectator, of Memphis and New Orleans.

The following, from an editorial in its issue of April 12, will illustrate the spirit of the Spectator toward the persecuted seventh-day observers:—

"Perhaps some of our readers may think that we attach too much importance to the persecution, trials and sufferings of the Seventh-day Adventists. Let Israelites remember, however, that those people stand loyally and courageously for the same principle which is dear and near to the hearts of our own people; they stand for religious liberty and freedom of the conscience, and though the present generation of Israelites in Europe and in the United States do not universally and scrupulously maintain the sanctity of the seventh day, still they will certainly manifest a great interest toward the members of this most remarkable sect of modern Christendom. For Christians they are to the very core of Christian belief, and it is, perhaps, one of those inscrutable interpolations of divine Providence, that a Christian sect should stand up for the authority and strict application of the fourth commandment as it is promulgated in the Decalogue."
