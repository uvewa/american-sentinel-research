People who remember the prodigious pother which Portugal made, two or three years ago, when England tried to bounce her out of some territorial advantage in Africa, will be surprised to know that the population of Portugal, including Madeira and the Azores, is only 5,049,720, of whom 2,619,390 are females, and that four-fifths of the population are unable to read

or write. In Lisbon, where most of the fuss referred to was made, there is a population of 612,000, of whom 394,338 are unable to read or write. It is not surprising that, although the census was taken five years ago, the government has only just made up its mind to publish these figures, which it would be hard to beat in any country of the world claiming to be civilized.
