BIGOTRY and fanaticism are running riot in some parts of Tennessee. In Rhea County the Seventh-day Adventists, a quiet and very devont people, are being systematically prosecuted (or, more properly, persecuted) for not observing Sunday as Sabbath, they believing that Saturday (the seventh day) is the day that they are commanded to keep holy. Quite a number of these people are now serving out sentences in jail for doing ordinary work on Sunday, though they religiously observe Saturday. Tennessee may some day become far enough advanced in civilization to adopt the law of Illinois, which expressly says that "This section" (in reference to Sunday observance) "shall not be construed . . . to prevent the due exercise of the rights of conscience by whomever thinks proper to keep any other day as a Sabbath."—The Cuba (Ill.) Journal, April 19.

Town Talk exchange table is in receipt of the AMERICAN SENTINEL, published at New York, in the interest of the Seventh-day Adventists, and especially against religious intolerance. The SENTINEL, we should judge, is a splendid American citizen, and some of its utterances are based on the soundest judgment. It tritely says, for example:—

He who fails to protest against the persecution of his neighbor, thereby virtually forfeits the right to protest when he is himself persecuted.

The first page of the SENTINEL is confined to an illustration of the county jail at Dayton, Rhea County, Tenn., together with an article regarding the imprisonment therein of five Seventh-day Adventists on the charge of violating the Sabbath. The SENTINEL says the article "is not to create sympathy for them. They do not need it. If their faith is not worth suffering for, it is not worth professing."

If the Adventists find it impossible to put up with the bigotry of Tennessee, and some other of the sleepy old towns, they are cordially invited to pull up stakes and come to Bay City. So far as known the Seventh-day Adventists make the best of citizens. The poor houses and jails—except the Rhea County jail—would have little to do, if they depended on this sect. They are a good and enterprising people and a credit to any well-regulated community.—Morrison's Town Talk, Bay City, Mich., April 20.

We have received a copy of the AMERICAN SENTINEL containing a cut of the county jail at Dayton, Rhea County, Tenn., in which is confined ten of the best citizens of that county because they are Seventh-day Adventists.

These people have not committed a crime, but they were tried and convicted because they believed that under the Constitution of the United States they had a right to worship God as they saw fit; but it seems that in Tennessee not only is the Constitution of the State, but of the United States defied. The Seventh-day Adventists keep Saturday instead of Sunday. They have the evidence of Holy Writ on their side, for the Bible states plainly that "God created the world in six days and on the seventh he rested from his labors." In many places in the Bible the statement is made that the seventh day is the Lord's day—or day of rest. The Jews keep Saturday for the Sabbath. It is outrageous that in the nineteenth century good Christian citizens should be persecuted for religion's sake. It is the plain duty of every denomination to protest in thunder tones against persecution for religion's sake. If Seventh-day Adventists can be persecuted and cast into jail—Jews, Protestants, Catholics—no denomination is safe. It is strange that a supreme court could be found to uphold such a sentence. The matter should be taken to the Supreme Court of the United States and a lesson taught the courts of Tennessee.—South Chicago Daily Calumet, April 15.

CONGRESS shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.—United States Constitution.

If it is wrong for Congress to make an above described law, it is wrong for the State to make one.

We read quite frequently of the imprisonment of just and honest men for not observing Sunday as Sabbath. The Seventh-day Adventists believe in keeping the seventh day, Saturday, as the Sabbath. They have considerable Bible for their position, and, if anything is authority on the subject, it certainly is that Book.

In this "free" United States, where one of the greatest of the "blessings of liberty" handed down to us by our forefathers is the liberty of conscience, we now see men condemned and imprisoned for conscience' sake. Shame!

It is contrary to the Constitution and to the gospel. The Adventists have as much authority, under the Constitution, to try to compel other people to observe their day, as any State has to persecute(?)—yes, persecute the Adventists.

The law which compels the observance of Sunday as the Sabbath is contrary to the Constitution of the United States, and should be repealed.

We think the Reform press should give the laws prominence.—The Enterprise, Greenfield, Mo., April 18.

We boast of our civilization, our liberality and all that sort of thing. We suppose that is all right.

The Indian, the African savage and other low down tribes are given to self-laudation, too; but here comes the AMERICAN SENTINEL, containing an account of the imprisonment of eight persons, in jail, for the crime of believing the seventh day of the week is the Sabbath instead of the first day. The crime was not so much in the mere belief as in acting out that belief. So long as a man will profess one belief and act out another, if that other chances to be in accordance with popular opinion or superstition, that is, so long as he will openly manifest that he is a hypocrite, he is secure from arrest and imprisonment; but whenever he becomes honest enough and manly enough to show his faith by his works and live out his

highest convictions of right, if somebody who happens to have more religion, or superstition than righteousness sees fit to take exceptions to it he is hustled off to jail. And this is civilization! Bah!

Our country has never yet entered the vestibule of civilization. We are a set of bigots, as hypocritical as we are conceited. Whenever a man gets an idea in advance of us, and beyond our stultified comprehensives, we denounce him as a crank, insane, a dangerous man or woman and so forth, and if there is any technicality in law by which we can institute legal proceedings, we proceed to confiscate his property and deprive him of his liberty.—The Liberator, Norton, Kansas, April 19.

Five Seventh-day Adventists are in jail at Dayton, Rhea County, Tenn., under conviction of violating the State law which forbids secular labor on Sunday, three others having served shorter terms and been discharged. They were assessed nominal fines, which were immediately remitted by the judge, he expressing his regret that he could not also remit the costs. They went to jail for non-payment of costs, deeming that to pay would be an admission of the justice of the penalty. Their position was that their religious convictions compelled them to obey the law of God as they perceive it, and disobey the law of man when it is in conflict therewith; but they value government and will not resist it, and will uncomplainingly endure penalties put upon them, but cannot accept an unjust penalty which they may peaceably resist. Therefore they refuse to pay a fine, but quietly endure the imprisonment.

A letter from one of these men to his daughter has been discovered by a representative of the AMERICAN SENTINEL, in his home, a miner's cabin in the mountains of Rhea County, and is reproduced in fac-simile in that paper, which is published in New York "for the defense of the liberty of conscience." The letter, intended only for the eye of the child, is reprinted here to illustrate the spirit of the men now suffering martyrdom for conscience' sake in Tennessee:—

HATTIE: This is the 6th day of March in the year 1895 A. D., and in the Cove in Rhea County, Tenn., in the so-called free America, and I go to Dayton today expecting to go to jail for the crime(!) of believing the Bible. I was found guilty by the court in one case and have one more to come up to day. Yet these things and worse have happened in all ages to God's people—why not to us? 2 Tim. 3:12. I want you to be a good girl and live for God and his truth; that is the only thing we can live for in this world, that is worth living for. Read and meditate on Heb. 11:32–40, and you can see what awaits us only a little way in the future. But, Luke 12:32.

Your father,
W. S. BURCHARD.

The first scripture cited reads: "All that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution." The last is, "Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom." The citation in Hebrews is Paul's catalogue of examples of the faith of heroes and martyrs—"And others were tortured, not accepting deliverance"—"(Of whom the world was not worthy)."—"God having provided some better things for us, that they without us should not be made perfect."

The Dayton Republican says:—

We are not, or should not be, living in an age of religious persecution. Yet eight of our best citizens are being kept in the county jail, because as Seventh-day Adventists they conscientiously violated a bad law, that says they must observe the first day of the week as the Sabbath instead of the seventh. A good community has been disorganized; a splendid school, that has been diffusing the rays of knowl edge among the people, has been broken up. The remedy is to change the law; and do it as quickly as possible.

The response is a bill in the Tennessee Legislature to make all personal property liable for fines and costs in misdemeanor cases, which would strip those hunted victims of all their personal property and drive them from their homes.

We do not wonder that the editor of the Dayton Republican exclaims in a later issue: "Shades of Washington and Jefferson, look down upon us and restore our faith in, and love for, the Declaration of Independence!" Probably these things could occur in no Northern State, but they do occur in several of the Southern States, and we are not without responsibility here. It was only Cain who protested, "Am I my brother's keeper?" The "Christians all—Presbyterians, Methodists, Catholics, Baptists, Episcopalians, and every denomination that worships in the name of the Lord of Hosts"—to whom the Dayton Republican appeals, owe it to the principles they profess, to exert their influence for the correction of abuses like these, in any part of this land. If we have outgrown the insanity at Salem, the intolerance that drove Roger Williams from his home, and the persecution of the peaceful followers of George Fox, let us help our brethren of the South to outgrow the fanatic zeal which imprisons men like the Tennessee miner Burchard in Dayton jail for believing Saturday to be the divinely-appointed Sabbath.—Ypsilanti (Mich.) Commercial, April 19.
