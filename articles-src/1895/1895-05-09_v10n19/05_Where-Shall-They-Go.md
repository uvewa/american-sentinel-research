The Sentinel has received but two papers, indorsing the recent Tennessee persecutions. One of these is the Pulaski (Tenn.) Citizen, which speaks thus:—

Almost every week we receive literature consisting of circulars and marked articles in papers published by a sect known as Seventh-day Adventists. The burden of these articles is an attack upon our Sunday laws. While we are as much opposed to religious and class legislation as any one, we are strictly in favor of Sunday laws for the good of society in general, and if these fanatics want to work on Sunday they should move to some country where the people do not object.

The Citizen may not realize it, but its closing advice to Seventh-day Adventists is but a notice to them to "get off the earth." There is no country in the world where there are not found people who object to the practice of any religion save their own. Then again, these Seventh-day Adventists are needed on the earth as long as there is any hope of converting the editor of the Citizen or others who are likeminded, to the great Christian principle, "Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them."
