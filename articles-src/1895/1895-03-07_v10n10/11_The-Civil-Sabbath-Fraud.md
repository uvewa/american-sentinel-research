# THE "CIVIL SABBATH" FRAUD.

ADULTERY, theft, and murder are crimes on all days and in all places. Labor, business, and recreation are neither crimes nor misdemeanors, but rather necessities and fundamental virtues. Sunday laws declare that these virtues become civil crimes and misdemeanors if performed on Sunday, and the religious leaders declare them to be sins. And yet these same religious leaders who ought to be honest and consistent declare that Sunday laws are only "civil" affairs with no religious basis as to their enforcement!—The Evangel and Sabbath Outlook, Feb. 28.
