# SUNDAY LAWS IN KENTUCKY.

Until within a few weeks the Sunday law of Kentucky has been regarded as a dead letter, but recent developments have demonstrated that there is a possibility that the "Blue Laws" may be revived.

A young theological student of the Baptist school was holding meetings in the suburbs of Louisville, and was "disturbed in his worship" on Sunday; and to test the validity of the law, swore out a warrant against a grocer, who also had a saloon in connection with his store.

Judge Thompson, of the city court, fined the grocer and saloon-keeper on two charges, viz., "being found at his calling on the Sabbath day," and "keeping open bar on the Sabbath day."

This decision was a complete surprise to the whole city, as Sunday is "open day," and it was not expected that Judge Thompson would take any further notice of the case than to dismiss it.

The local "Parkhursts" in the persons of the ministers, were not slow to see that here was an opportunity that it would not do to pass by unnoticed, and immediately began to take action in reference to it.

The decision of the judge was almost the sole topic of conversation on the streets, and it became incumbent upon the mayor and chief of police to see that the law which had been revived, was carried out. Accordingly, the matter was laid before the "Board of Safety," and they decided upon a general enforcement of Sunday observance. The police were instructed not to make any arrests, but to "watch," and take the names of all who kept "open house."

Monday morning showed 2,500 cases ready to have the police act upon, but as this was rather a large batch, it was decided to swear out warrants against representatives of saloons, groceries, bakeries, etc., and in this way test the law.

The policy outlined by the ministers was manifested in their utterances, and I append two of them: "As long as we can get such righteous decisions as the one handed down by Judge Thompson, things are not altogether bad." "Judge Thompson is a fine type of a Christian on the bench. All that is necessary now, in order that the law shall be enforced, is that public sentiment shall be developed to sustain the judge."

Accordingly, a mass meeting was called by the "Kentucky Sabbath Association," and in the call an attempt was made to quiet the fears of those who oppose the enforcement of religious dogmas by civil law by means of the time-worn "civil Sabbath" argument, as follows: "This meeting is called by an association that operates from a purely civil standpoint, striving to maintain the weekly day of rest as a purely civil institution, which is a necessity for man and beast." About three hundred were in attendance and the majority of these were ministers and theological students. The following resolutions were presented and adopted unanimously:—

Resolved, That it is the sense of this meeting that the laws of the State are to be obeyed, and all good citizens have a grave responsibility to see that they are obeyed.

Resolved, That all citizens should be protected in their legal right to one day of rest in seven, and that all efforts to deprive them of this should be resisted.

Resolved, That we call upon our officials to see that the Sunday laws are kindly [I] not firmly enforced, and that we will heartily support them in doing their duty.

Resolved, That since nobody is compelled to live in this State, those persons who do not like our laws should either gracefully submit to them, or else more elsewhere, where they can find laws to suit their tastes.

The ministers present who spoke upon the question were all Baptists but one, and I could not but contrast the difference between their utterances and those of the sturdy Baptist defenders of religious liberty in days gone by.

Prof. H. F. Kerfoot, of the Baptist Theological Seminary, in the course of his remarks, said: "I don't know who the Parkhurst of Louisville is; but, O God, for a Parkhurst!"

It was plainly manifest that the principles taught by the man of Galilee were unknown, and Caesar was to be appealed to and made to do what the Church demanded.

The idea that men should educate their consciences by the laws of the State was applauded; and the statement "if men don't propose to do as the law says, we have the liberty to force them," was heartily accepted.

Determination was shown in all who advocated the measure, and one could plainly see that the time was rapidly hastening on when the grand principles advocated by the founders if our Government would be completely trampled upon, and those who dared to stand firm for principle and the advocacy of truth would be termed anarchists and disturbers of good government.
