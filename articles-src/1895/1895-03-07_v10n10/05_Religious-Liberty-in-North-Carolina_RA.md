# RELIGIOUS LIBERTY IN NORTH CAROLINA.

In Vol. 2 of the code of North Carolina, p. 679, Declaration of Rights, Sec. 1, we find it declared,—and this declares the truth,—that "All men are created equal" and "are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights;" including "the enjoyments of the fruits of their own labors." Sec. 26, p. 685, declares that "All men have a natural and unalienable right to worship God according to the dictates of their own consciences, and no human authority should, in any case whatever, control or interfere with the rights of conscience."

This, then, leaves to each person the right to follow his own conscience in his relation to his Creator, and allows the civil government the right to regulate only man's relation to his fellow-men. It is not toleration merely, but asserting as *unalienable* the *rights* of men's consciences, not only to worship, but also at the same time their *right to enjoy* the fruits of their labor,—not of five-sixths only, but of all their own labor. In other words, it declares that *all men* have an *unalienable right* to work *all* of the time their own consciences permit them.

Now there are in North Carolina, as well as in most other States, evangelical Christians, as well as Jews, whose consciences lead them to keep as holy the seventh day of the week, Saturday, and hence to work the other six, including Sunday, the first day. In harmony with the said Declaration of Rights of North Carolina, and in harmony with the Scriptures, no human authority has any right to interfere. But Sec. 3782 of the code (Vol. 2, p. 573) does interfere and forbid every men exercising that right under a penalty of one dollar for each offense. Thus conscientious, law-abiding citizens are left the choice of losing one-sixth of the fruits of their labor, or be considered criminals in the eyes of this law. Are men enjoying the "enjoyments" of the Constitution while being branded as criminals by the statutes of the State?

Now the sentiment among the best people in North Carolina is strong in favor of "equal rights to all men, and special favors to none;" yet there stands this law forbidding equal rights to all and granting special favors to some. There it has stood since 1641, an unrepealed part of the Church and State system of colonial days, and can be used to bring unjust pressure to bear against one class of citizens, to force them to conform to the consciences of another class. It can be used as a tool for religious persecution, as similar laws have been used before, and are now being used in Tennessee, Maryland, Massachusetts, and other of the States of this country and in other countries. How long shall it stand thus a menace to liberty? Let the good people of North Carolina answer.

ROLLA ÁLVARO.
