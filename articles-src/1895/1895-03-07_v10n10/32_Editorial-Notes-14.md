# Editorial Notes

"PAPACY and Prophecy or the 'Sovereign Pontiff' and the Church of Rome," is the title of No. 29 of the Religious Liberty Library. This number is a reprint of a lecture delivered in Geneva in 1843 by Dr. Gaussen, the celebrated Swiss theologian. By fourteen distinct counts this document shows that the papacy is the blasphemous power represented by the little horn of Dan. 7. Dr. Gaussen very aptly remarks that this application of Daniel's prophecy is a doctrine which "has been lightly esteemed only in times of lax theology and infidelity." These are "times" of lax theology and infidelity and therefore this doctrine is lightly held by the Romanizing descendants of the faithful of Reformation "times." Hence now is the time to read and circulate this tract. In it is wielded the only weapon, the "Word of God," that is, or ever has been, available against the papacy.
