# Spiritualists Start a Sunday-School.

The Spiritualists of Detroit are so firmly convinced that what they believe rises to the solemnity of a religion that they have started a Sunday-school to teach their children its principles. It is the outcome of numerous consultations by the Spiritualist Ladies' Aid Society, which meets in Cowie's block every Wednesday afternoon. The ladies there assembling conceived the idea that if the religion of Spiritualism was good for themselves, it was good for their children, too, and so they set to work to raise sufficient funds to inaugurate the undertaking.

In this school the children are taught that Spiritualism is the knowledge of the psychical or spiritual nature of man; that spirit is the moving force of the universe; that there is a perfectly natural way of communicating with friends in the spirit world, who willingly and joyfully respond to calls for advice or assistance; that Spiritualism is founded on the laws of nature, and that while the methods of communication vary, still they are all the result of unknown but natural laws; that to live a pure life in this world insures greater happiness in the next, because the disembodied spirit is enabled to immediately ascend to a high plane; that the very worst thing that can happen to a person is to die ignorant and debased, because such an one is "earthbound," and is liable to roam the world for an unknown period before being able to get rid of his ignorant and debased condition; and that the truthfulness, love, sobriety, charity, kindness, compassion, and all the other virtues, attract pure and high-minded spirits, who surround them, help them over their trials and difficulties, and at last, when the end comes, are the first to give a welcoming hand and greet them when they have "passed out."—Detroit News Tribune.
