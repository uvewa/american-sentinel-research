# PROPOSED SUNDAY LEGISLATION IN MINNESOTA.

Another Sunday bill has been introduced in the legislature of this State; this time by Senator Theden, and reads as follows:—

### A BILL

For an Act to Prohibit Public Shows or Exhibitions on the Sabbath Day, and Defining and Fixing the Penalty Thereof.

SECTION 1. Whoever, on the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday, participates in or exhibits to the public, with or without charge for admission, in any building, room, ground, garden, or other place in this State, any theatrical or dramatic performance of any kind or description, or any equestrian or circus performance of jugglers, acrobats, rope-dancing, sparring exhibitions, variety shows or negro minstrelay, living statuary, ballooning or any baseball playing, or other games of similar kind or kinds, shall be guilty of misdemeanor, and be punished by a fine in a sum not exceeding one hundred dollars nor less than fifty dollars, or by confinement in a county jail for a period not less than twenty days nor exceeding sixty days.

Why such a bill? Evidently, the people ought to go to church, but they will not; so in order that they may be persuaded to go, remove all temptation. But when it is found that they will not then go to church, secure a law compelling them to go! This is but the logical result of the first step. But how may the State know anything about the Sabbath day? And how can the State tell whether the Sabbath day does really fall on "the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday"? Well, the church of Rome says that it does; and from the days of Constantine she has made use of the power of the State to convince everybody else that it does. But by this act she turned the truth of God into a lie. Now, the Protestant world has accepted this dogma of the church of Rome, and with her, says that the first day is the Sabbath, and by every possible means is trying to secure legislation, declaring this to be the truth. But by so doing, she too turns the truth of God into a lie; for God says: "The seventh day is the Sabbath." H. F. PHELPS.
