# BASEL CONTINUES TO PERSECUTE FOR CONSCIENCE SAKE.

DURING a portion of the months of October and November of last fall, the authorities of the city of Basel, Switzerland, imprisoned Henry P. Holser, pastor of the Seventh-day Adventist Church and manager of the publishing house of the denomination in that city. The imprisonment was because of work done in the denominational publishing house on Sunday.

The law used to secure this imprisonment was the factory law, the intention of which is to secure a rest of one day in the week to the employés in manufacturing establishments. The law is declared by its interpreters to have no religious significance, but to be intended solely for the good of the laboring class; yet it was here used in an attempt to deprive a company of inoffensive working people of the results of labor for one day in the week. Those who invoked the law knew well that these people could not work on the seventh day and they deliberately used it when they knew that by so doing they were attempting to restrict them to five days' labor per week. Although such a course is deliberate self-stultification, it is persistently continued.

Mr. Holser served a term of twenty-one days in the Basel prison. There is a fine of two hundred francs still standing against him, which he will not pay, as to do so would be a virtual acknowledgment of the justice of the penalty. This must yet be served out in prison, which means forty days more. He is now in Battle Creek, Mich., attending the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists. He goes there as representative of the Central European Conference of the denomination.

It is expected that he will return in the spring, as this was his intention. When he left Basel for the United States he placed no one in charge of the business of the publishing house, but simply arranged the work to be done, and told the employés that the house was always open to its laborers six days in the week. In consequence of the action of the authorities the presses had already been stopped entirely, and all the press work hired to job presses in the city. This consists of three papers, and religious tracts and books which the house is continually issuing. All the work done in the house is therefore of the most quiet nature,—such as typesetting,—and it would not be possible to know that labor was being done there at any time except by watching to see the workers quietly come and go morning and evening, or by actual inquiry.

On January 23, the following letter was received from the police department:—

The Department of the Interior, Canton Basel.
To the Imprimerie Polyglotte, Basel.

The federal factory inspector informs us that you work regularly on Sunday.

As you well know work on Sunday is forbidden by article 14 of the factory law. Now that you have already suffered the legal penalty for violation of this before-mentioned law, we are prompted to warn you against further repetition, for according to the second paragraph of article 1 of the factory laws, besides appropriate fine, imprisonment also for three months may be affixed.

Therefore we shall direct the police department to give special attention as to the observance of the Sunday rest in your business.

Respectfully,
Chief of the Department of the Interior,
PHILIFFI.

The following Sunday the house was carefully watched by a policeman in citizen's clothes, and the workers who left in the evening were questioned as to whether they had been at work, and their names taken. The information asked was given in every instance without hesitation.

During the week the police called at the office and held a conversation with the bookkeeper, Mr. Henri Revilly. According to the terms of the factory law the manager alone is made responsible for the infringement of the Sunday law by factory labor. There is no one in charge of the Imprimerie Polyglotte, and no person other than the absent manager has any authority more than another, or is responsible for anything more than his or her individual work. The book-keeper, Mr. Revilly, stands precisely on the same footing as the other employés, yet the police have told him that he will be held responsible, individually. He has been summoned to appear on Friday, February 16, before the Basel police court, to answer to a charge upon which the authorities have threatened him with three months' possible imprisonment. He has addressed the following letter, involving mainly the civil and personal application of this case, to the Department of the Interior, and to the representative in the National Assembly from his Canton of Vaud:—

MORSIEUR PHILIFFI, Chief of the Department of the Interior, Basel.

The Imprimerie Polyglotte has received your letter of January 23. Unfortunately your advice cannot be followed for the two following reasons: 1. The director of the establishment, Mr. Holser, is at this moment in the United States, where he represents the Adventist8 of Central Europe at an assembly of the General Conference of the denomination. The undersigned occupies the position of book-keeper and clerk, and consequently has no direction of the affairs of the house. He works by the hour as well as the other employés, and has nothing to say in questions of this kind. Mr. Holser said to the workers repeatedly: "The house is open to you every Sunday. You can come to work or you can rest." Accordingly, then, even if I wished, I could not hinder the workers from laboring on Sunday. 2. You know that the operatives are Seventh-day Adventists; they rest on the Sabbath, consecrating that day to God. There are none of independent income among us. Each one must work his ten hours daily, if he is to honorably make both ends meet. It is consequently impossible for us employes to rest two days; besides this, our work is of such a character that it cannot be done outside of the establishment.

These are some of the reasons because of which we work notwithstanding the penalties endured. In this there is no sectarian pride or blind resistance. As a result of our last difficulty we have transferred our printing work, and now hire it done elsewhere. We naturally have had to dismiss our pressman, a father of a family, and subject to military duty, who has to struggle for his living under great difficulties, doing job work with a small pedal press. No noisy work is done by us either on Sunday or during the week. In consequence we expected to have been at last left in peace, and probably would have been except for the factory inspector.

We, workers of the Imprimerie Polyglotte, believe firmly that the Executive Council of the Canton of Basel, can permit us to earn our living peacefully if it wishes. The proper-minded people do not ask that we should be oppressed in the name of an intentionally philanthropic law. Mr. Cornaz, judge of the federal court, said in a sitting of that court: "In principle the Adventists are right and the police of Basel [he should have said the executive council of Basel] should have known how to have shut one eye in the matter." These are the words of a guardian of the law, and also of many others, who have no special sympathy for our religious views.

In consideration of these facts the undersigned feels impelled to make known to you what may be the results of the enforcement of these measures against us. They are simple, but serious.

1. If the court does not accept my statements, and persists in considering me the responsible representative of Mr. Holser, I will receive the penalty of several weeks' or even three months' imprisonment, and this might bring serious results upon my young wife, who is in a critical state of health.

2. A dozen poor and respectable families will find themselves, so to speak, upon the street. For if Sunday observers find it so difficult to obtain employment, how can you expect observers of the Sabbath to find work among those who do not sympathize with them?

I am sure that my Saviour and Lord will not permit these things to go any farther than is necessary; he will preserve us from need, nevertheless the responsibility will rest with those in authority who could have spared us these trials. I hope, however, that it will not go so far for a more technical transgression of an unconstitutional clause in the federal factory law.

"Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me." Matt. 25:40.

Mr. Revilly will plead his own case before the court. W. H. McKEE.
Basel, Feb. 12.
