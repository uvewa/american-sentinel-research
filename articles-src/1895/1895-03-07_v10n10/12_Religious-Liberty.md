# RELIGIOUS LIBERTY.

In Springdale, Ark., two Seventh-day Baptist [Adventist—Ed.] elders were recently arrested and convicted, the one for painting his meeting-house on Sunday, the other for doing some carpenter work on the house of a poor widow as an act of charity. These men were imprisoned and treated like common felons; while at the same time the Sabbath was broken in numberless ways on the railroads and on pleasure excursions of various kinds. Again, in Tennessee some Adventists were put into the chain-gang because they worked on Sunday just as conscientiously as some of their neighbors worked on Saturday. Such outrages would be a little more endurable if Sunday were faithfully observed in the districts in which these persons were punished; as it is, the principle seems to be this: If a man's religion tells him that he ought to observe Saturday instead of Sunday, then he must be punished for working on Sunday; but if he has no religion, or if he calls himself a Christian and violates his faith, then he may do as he pleases. The Seventh-day Adventists and Hebrews have the same claim on the protection of our laws in the exercise of their liberty as any other class in the community; and Christians ought to be quite as careful to claim that protection for them as for themselves. Let these abuses be ventilated. The sooner we understand whether this is actually a free country, the better it will be for all concerned.—The Outlook, New York, Feb. 23.
