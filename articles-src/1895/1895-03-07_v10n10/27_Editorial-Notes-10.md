# Editorial Notes

FOR the encouragement of those who are sending the SENTINEL to their friends, we print the following from a card just received at this office:—

MY DEAR SENTINEL:—

By some unknown agency, I have received several copies of the SENTINEL, and affirm that, of all the little papers that I ever read, the SENTINEL contains the weightiest words, the soundest reasoning, and the most convincing logic. God bless your efforts to check the inroads of popeism.
