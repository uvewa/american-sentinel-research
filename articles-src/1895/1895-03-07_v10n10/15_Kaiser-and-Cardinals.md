# Kaiser and Cardinals.

The Emperor William has conferred upon Cardinal Kopp and Cardinal Krementz the order of the Red Eagle, one of the highest distinctions of the empire. All sorts of theories are at work to account for the motives actuating the Kaiser in bestowing such conspicuous marks of honor on the two German cardinals. How far Prince Hohenlohe, the present chancellor, who has a brother in the Sacred College, has influenced his imperial master is not known, but it is certain that the step is extremely diplomatic.

The emperor probably thinks that the recent instability of public affairs in France has somewhat cooled the ardor of the pontiff towards the republic. In fact, it is reported that the pope is beginning to show a tendency in favor of the Triple Alliance. To shower distinction on members of the Sacred College, therefore, is probably a political move to draw still more the favorable attention of the pope towards Germany. The Kaiser, too, is evidently anxious to remove whatever bad impressions may be left by the Kulturkampf, for Cardinal Krementz was most active in his antagonism to Bismarck's anti-religious policy.—The Western Watchman [Catholic], Feb. 21.
