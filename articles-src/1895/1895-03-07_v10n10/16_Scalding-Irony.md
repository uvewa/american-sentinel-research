# Scalding Irony.

I am positive that the barber who, last Sunday, shaved a man named Green, in order that the latter might be in proper trim to attend church, and who subsequently was fined $4 and costs for so doing, will view his sentence in the proper light as a chastening of the spirit. The law under which he was fined is certainly a great credit to this community, and an evidence of its progressive and liberal spirit. It ought to be made plain to barbers and other worldly creatures that they are bound to respect the Sabbath according to the dictates of other people's consciences, and a fine of $4 and costs, as all will admit, constitutes a spiritual argument of the utmost force.—Sunday Star, Wilmington, Del.
