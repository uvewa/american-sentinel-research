# CHURCH AND STATE IN ENGLAND.

One of the measures the liberal government proposes passing in the coming session is a bill to disestablish the church in Wales, and this is naturally exciting a good deal of discussion in political and religious circles; but it is to be deplored that so few of those who are calling for disestablishment are doing so from right principles. It is not because it is impossible for the church to be united to a worldly power and still be the Church of Christ; not because it is subverting the teaching of Him who said: "Ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world;" but because that under the existing establishment my church is not having an equal share of State help. It would do some of those pious people good who are longing for State aid, if they would consider a few statements made by Lord Rosebery, the Prime Minister, in a recent speech. He said: "If a State is in reality Christian, it certainly does not need the outward symbol of an establishment to prove it; and if a State is not Christian, an establishment is merely a hypocrisy and a sham." And after referring to the Irish Church being more vigorous and prosperous now than when established, he continued: "But, gentlemen, to my mind to contend that these material supplies, or the privilege of seats in the House of Lords are necessary to the life and vigor of a church, is to make a fatal confusion between the essence and incident of a church. The essence of a church is spiritual; the inspiration, the tradition, the gracious message, the divine mission, the faith that guides us through the mystery of life to the mystery of death,—all were produced in poverty, in the cot of the carpenter. They flourished under persecution. Nothing can be so remote from their essence or spirit, as wealth or dignity in this world."

It seems strange that a man who has been condemned by the religious teachers for his horse-racing propensities, should know more about the principles of Christianity than the so-called doctor of divinity.

In the January number of the Contemporary Review, there is a long article in defense of the establishment, by Canon Knox Little, one of the leading lights of the church party. He has a great deal to say about the past history of the church, "from the earliest dawn of history." He says: "The Church of England established the State of England, and not the State the church. . . . The church converted, civilized and helped to organize the nation." This is the old claim of the papacy echoing from one of her daughters, that the State owes its existence and prosperity to the Church, and consequently, should be her servant.

The following, from the same article, shows this still further: "The church has always been divine; her divine principles have never varied; her degree and manner of connection with the civil power, these have varied; still, in England, that connection always has been."

Now, if it be granted that a church is divine, and that she is incorporated with a human government, it must also be granted that, as divine wisdom and judgment are superior to human, she has a right to predominate; and like any other government, in order to maintain its existence, must use all the power she has to enforce obedience to her laws. Therefore the sword, prison and pillory, that have been used against dissenters in the past, were only a natural outcome of a union between civil government and religion; and just as her never-varying "divine principles" have been manifested in this way in the past, to be true to those principles, she must do the same again when opportunity permits.

Did Christ, the only manifestation of divinity in humanity (John 1:18), teach such principles? When some of his followers asked for fire to consume those who did not receive them, did he say, Yes, they should be burned as an example to frighten others? No; "he turned and rebuked them." Luke 9:55. He also said: "If any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not." "My kingdom is not of this world."

So it is evident that before a church can become united to a government of the world she must turn from following Christ. Then the god of the world will rule in her, and this is clearly seen in the history of every Church and State connection in the past. That a State Church is different from the Church of Christ is also seen from the following, from the same article: "She, the church, has always had close relations with the State, and holds, in consequence, a position of considerable temporal dignity." "My kingdom is not of this world," said Christ,—"In the world ye shall have tribulation." Speaking of the last days, Paul said: "All that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution."

From this we must conclude that a church which the world exalts to a position of temporal dignity, cannot be the Church of Christ. The "prince of this world" offered a position of great temporal dignity to Christ on the mountain, on condition that he would worship him, but Christ turned from the temptation; and none of his followers can accept a position that will detract their allegiance from him.

Canon Knox Little characterizes disestablishing the church in Wales, apart from the church in England, as "peddling and meddling with so grave a question in a kind of 'local option' spirit," and gives the following significant example of a better way of doing:—

Long ago the American Republic showed the world how well they understood this in the matter of State existence on a large scale when they refused to permit the southern States to quit their union, and one may well hope and believe that England will show themselves equally sagacious and just-minded in the matter of their church.

What an illustration! Because the American Government, by means of bullets and bayonets prevented the States of the South from throwing off their allegiance to a political union, therefore the Church of England should employ bayonets and bullets to prevent the people of Wales from throwing off their allegiance to the Church of England! And what is this but a repetition of the spirit and practice of the papacy, illustrated in her murderous marches against the Waldeness, Albigenses and Huguenots?

And now, a word about the home of the SENTINEL. "The American Republic" is setting an example to the world at present in making and enforcing religious laws, and punishing dissenters, the inevitable evil of which cannot be estimated. And just as the great Republic, founded by Washington, Jefferson and others in the truly divine principle of individual liberty, has influenced the world against that relic of mediaeval darkness, ecclesiastical tyranny, so now that the Republic has proved false to these great principles, her influence will lead other nations that are influenced by her example back to that tyranny.

Well may the AMERICAN SENTINEL sound aloud the alarm, and well may we on this side of the Atlantic hope and pray for its success.
