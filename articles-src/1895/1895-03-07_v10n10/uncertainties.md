# Uncertainties Log - Volume 10, Number 10 (March 7, 1895)

## General OCR Quality
- Source: B&W scanned PDF, 300 DPI
- Overall quality: Good to very good
- OCR performed by: Claude Opus 4.6 (multimodal agent)

## Specific Uncertainties

### Page 1, Line 145
- **Transcribed as:** "goebel of the kingdom"
- **Confidence:** LOW
- **Reason:** This appears to be an OCR error for "gospel of the kingdom" - the context is about missionary work spreading the gospel. The letter shapes in B&W scan were unclear, but "goebel" makes no sense in context.

### Page 3, Line 161
- **Transcribed as:** "put on Nke a dress coat"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM
- **Reason:** "Nke" is clearly an OCR error for "like" - the 'l' and 'i' were misread as 'N' in the scan. Corrected to preserve sense.

### Page 4, Line 199
- **Transcribed as:** "provch. saying"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM
- **Reason:** Likely should be "proverb saying" or "proverbial saying" - the period suggests an abbreviation, but "provch" is unusual. Left as transcribed from scan.

### Page 5, Line 297
- **Transcribed as:** "Adventist8"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM
- **Reason:** Clear OCR error for "Adventists" - the final 's' was misread as '8'. Context confirms this.

### Page 6, Line 367
- **Transcribed as:** "kindly [I] not firmly enforced"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM
- **Reason:** Resolution text appears corrupted. The bracketed [I] seems to be a stray character or OCR artifact. Context suggests this should read "kindly and firmly enforced" or possibly "kindly but firmly enforced." Left as found with notation.

### Page 8, Line 512
- **Transcribed as:** "img-0.jpeg"
- **Confidence:** HIGH
- **Reason:** Image/illustration present in original; not transcribed as per instructions for graphics.

## Notes
- Several author initials required verification: HFP (H. F. Phelps), JWC (J. W. Collie), RA (Rolla Álvaro), JM (John McAvoy)
- All Scripture references preserved exactly as printed
- Archaic spellings preserved: "to-day", "restries" (possibly "vestries"), etc.
- Hyphenated words at line breaks joined where contextually appropriate
