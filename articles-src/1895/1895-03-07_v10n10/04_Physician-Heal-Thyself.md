# "PHYSICIAN, HEAL THYSELF."

This proverb ["Physician, heal thyself"] came to my mind the other day, while thinking of the surprising activity recently displayed in the political field by clergymen. A veritable political fever seems to have seized the church of our country. Ministers seem to have thrown aside their word and look of peace, and to have donned a fighting mien and a biting tongue. The spirit of the Puritans of old seems to reign once more, that spirit that sent the ministry forth with prayer book in one hand and with sword in the other, to invoke God to conquer their enemies, and to do a little conquering for themselves.

I myself have caught the contagion, or rather have been caught by it. I have been elected a member of the Committee of Ninety-five, in which the ministerial element strongly prevails. I accepted the honor, only on the condition that I be permitted to serve as a layman, and not as a clergyman, only with the understanding that I have been chosen by reason of my supposed fitness as a citizen, and not because I am supposed to possess certain influence as a clergyman. As a citizen, I owe sacred obligations to my country and my city, and am ready to discharge them whenever called upon. As a clergyman I know neither national lines nor political parties. As a Rabbi my country is as wide as the earth, and my fellow-citizens are all of human kind. This Committee of Ninety-five, which, if I am correctly informed, has sprung into existence largely through the influence of the church, and which is composed of a goodly number of clergymen—has set for itself the ambitious task of cleansing this goodly city of all political corruption, and of selecting and electing the proper men to legislate for us. It seems a noble mission, and yet I dread it, and I said so, and I dread it not so much for fear of failure as for fear of success. More than the corrupt politician do I fear the priest, pastor or rabbi in politics. The pass between the clergyman and the fanatic is a very narrow one, and is easily and speedily crossed, and, given the alternative between the tyranny of fanatics and the rule of the corrupted politicians, I would not hesitate to prefer the latter. One might shield himself against corruption; against fanaticism there is little protection. The Puritan in search of liberty of conscience inspired the thinking world with admiration; the Puritan, in possession of what he sought and for what he fought, debased his boon into a fanaticism that filled the hearts of men with horror.

Since Parkhurst has been on the lips of the people, his fame seems to have become the yearning of preachers. Since Parkhurst, once denounced by his brethren, has scored a brilliant victory, preachers all over the country, all forgetful of their one-time consternation, have developed a craze of becoming local Parkhursts. The Germans have a saying—

"Es ist kein Pfafflein noch so klein,
Es möchte gern ein Päpstlein sein,"

which, in these days, we might well render as

There is no preacher yet so wee
Who not a Parkhurst'd like to be.

It is Wellington, I believe, who is reported to have said, after a very bloody victory: "Another such victory, and we are lost!" Another such political triumph as that which the church recently gained in New York would, I believe, saddle upon us, in time, a greater tyranny than the one which the conqueror conquered.

Americans and laymen, beware of the church militant in the sphere of politics, and yet more of the church triumphant in the sphere of government. Its powerful organization and influence make conquest comparatively easy; the same weapons make victory mightily oppressive. Add to the present numerical strength of the church yet the power of political victory, and how long before we shall have a reenactment of the tyrannies and outrages and cruelties of the dominating church of former times! How long before it will set its foot upon the neck of the crouching State, as it, at one time, did at Canosa! How long before it will either seize the reigns of government into its own hands, or name the rulers and enact the laws for them to enforce! How long before the mighty citadel of our liberties, erected by the genius of Jefferson and his confreres, that has hitherto kept Church and State apart, will be stormed and razed to the ground, and the old flag of religious liberty torn down, and a new one raised, inscribed with the words: "Our religion, the religion of all; our church, the church of all; our law, the law of all!" Has it not already, without that immensity of power which I fear, attacked the outposts and destroyed the breastworks of that citadel? Does it not now, though not yet in the zenith of its power, trample upon constitutionally-granted rights of minorities? .

Has not the politician good grounds for saying to the preacher: "Physician, heal thyself," preacher, go and cure the plague-spots and leprosies, the falsities and hypocrisies of the church, before you attempt to administer your nostrums to our politics? To be sure, our politics are corrupt, but are not the men who corrupt them, for the most part, members of the church, and the voters who are led and corrupted, or who fail to discharge their duties as loyal citizens, are they not sheep of your flock? Have you cured them? Have you made your blind to see, and your crooked to walk straight, and your deaf to hear, and your ignorant to know? To be sure many of our politicians are stricken with a moral blindness that unfits them for a proper regard for the eighth commandment, but does not that disease rage as violently in your pews as in our offices? Do you not count among your deacons, stock-gamblers, or other gamblers, whose rich contributions stand for so much ruin of once happy homes? Do you not count among your front pewowners cut-throat landlords who, for miserable accommodations, extort usurious rentals from the starvation wages of their tenants? Do you not count among your most prominent members the creators and supporters of the sweatshops, the modern taskmasters, who drive and work their laboring men as if they were so many beasts of burden? Do you not make your deepest bow, and smile your sweetest smile to the men who live in palatial mansions, and drive dashing teams, who regale themselves in $5 or $10 opera seats, and indulge their appetites with the costliest viands the market affords, and quench their thirsts with the most expensive beverages the vineries produce, who deck their precious persons with the choicest silks and satins, furs and woolens, and say their prayers from golden-claeped and velvet-bound prayer books, while those who have helped to provide these luxuries and fineries at the cost of their hearts' blood, starve and waste away in the miserable hovels of the filthy slums? Does it not happen that you deliver your most eloquent eulogies and most falsome obituaries over those whose only virtue was wealth and a liberal bestowal of it to the church or to charity, and whose crimes ought, to your knowledge, to have landed them in some penitentiary, and but for their hypocritical piety and showy liberality, might have done so? And you, with so much sickness of your own to cure, now come to us to be our physician. Verily we say to you in the words of the Israelites of old: "Physician, heal thyself;" and in the words of the Nazarene Rabbi: "Judge not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned." "Can the blind lead the blind? shall they not both fall into the ditch? . . . Why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but perceived not the beam that is in thine own eye?" . . .

It is the church that is sick. It is the church that needs healing first. To it, brother preacher, devote all your skill and all your zeal. It will take all the time you have, and will leave you none to spare for the cure of political corruption. Attend faithfully to your own patients and you will find that by the time you have them restored to vigorous health the other patients will also have been restored without any attendance on your part. It is the sickness of the pew-holder that creates the disease of the office-holder. It is the hypocrisy in the church that infects the politics of our land. The Chinese have a provch. saying: "Let every man sweep the snow from before his own doors, and not busy himself about the frost on his neighbor's tiles," which, for better remembrance, I shall paraphrase into: Before your own door sweep, and, as far as corrupt politics are concerned, your tongues you'll keep.—Rabbi Joseph Krauskoff, in the Jewish Criterion, Feb. 8.
