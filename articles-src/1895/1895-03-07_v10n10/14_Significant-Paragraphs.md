LYONS, N. Y., Feb. 18.—Church people throughout Wayne County are shaking in their boots in anticipation of an indictment being found against them for conducting lotteries and gift enterprises such as come under the ban of the anti-lottery law. In charging the grand jury at the opening of the February term of the Wayne Circuit Court and Court of Oyer and Terminer this morning, Judge Adams, of Canandaigua, especially instructed that body to find indictments against all promoters and participants in such irregularities.—The Sun, Feb. 18.
