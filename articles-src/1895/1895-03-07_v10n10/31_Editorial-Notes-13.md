# Editorial Notes

THE Roman Catholic paper, the Western Watchman, thus defends the pope's shrewd method of addressing the American people under pretense of addressing the Roman Catholic bishops of America:—

Bishop Paret, of Maryland, is highly indignant because Leo XIII, in his late letter, addresses himself to the American people. He thinks he should confine his counsel to Catholics. The pope is the spiritual head of the Church; and the Church claims the spiritual allegiance of all those who are baptized.

So the pope claims the spiritual allegiance of even the editors of the AMERICAN SENTINEL and addressed his late encyclical to them. Well, we have received it, and have made several comments on it. The pope will find some of them on the first and second pages of this paper.
