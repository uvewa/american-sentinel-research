# THE PAPACY AND FREE SPEECH.

THE Roman Catholic Church in the United States is just now posing before the country as the author and conservator of religious liberty and the only power that can control the riotous element of the country.

That both of these assertions are false in fact, has just been newly demonstrated in Savannah, Ga., where a mob of three thousand Roman Catholics attempted to kill ex-Priest Slattery and wife, who lectured there on the night of February 28, against Catholicism.

The following abridged description of the riot is from the Sun, which Roman Catholics will not accuse of misrepresentation:—

SAVANNAH, Feb. 26.—For five hours to-night the city was in charge of a mob and on the verge of a religious riot. The entire white military force of the city, except the artillery, was on duty.

There are ten infantry companies in the militia and the Georgia Hussars, the latter being dismounted. The actions of a mob estimated at 4,000, the greater part being Catholics, caused their summons to duty.

For three days it had been apparent that trouble was brewing, because the city was placarded with notices that ex-Priest Slattery and his wife, described as an ex-nun, would lecture here to-night on Catholicism.

Members of the Ancient Order of Hibernians at once took steps to prevent their appearance here. Petitions were circulated asking Mayor Myers to refuse to permit Slattery to appear.

"I cannot stop this man from lecturing," said the mayor, who is a Hebrew, "but I can prevent disorder and I will do so. If the police have not sufficient force to do so, the military will be appealed to. Riot will not be tolerated."

The lecturer had hardly begun before brick-bats and cobblestones began to rain in through the windows. The police had closed all the heavy inside shutters, and this saved the audience from injury, only two or three persons being injured by flying glass.

Before nine o'clock the mob had grown to probably between 3,000 and 4,000 persons. Window after window in the Masonic Temple was smashed. Crise of "Kill him," "Down with Slattery," "Death to the renegade," were heard. Chief McDermott summoned the mayor.

The mob hissed at the police and hooted at their orders to disperse. The military alarm, eleven taps on all fire bells in the city, was sent in. When it sounded the mob derided.

"Bring on your military," some of the leaders shouted. "They can't save Slattery."

The account continuing relates that Vicar-General Cafferty was appealed to to stop the rioting, and that his efforts failed, after which by the use of the entire police and white military force of the city, Mr. Slattery was protected from the murderous mob.

Later, repeated attempts were made both to burn and blow up the Masonic Temple where the lecture was held, and all this by the people of the church that claim to be the author and preserver of both religious liberty and public order.
