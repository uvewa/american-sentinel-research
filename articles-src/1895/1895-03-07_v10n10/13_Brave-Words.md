# BRAVE WORDS.

The Independent, of Le Roy, Minn., introduces a vigorous condemnation of the recent prosecution of Seventh-day Adventists of Maryland and Tennessee with the following pertinent paragraph:—

It would seem that the old Connecticut Blue Laws regarding Sunday, are again coming into use in many localities.

People who keep the Sabbath taught by the Bible are being persecuted by so-called Christians, although these same professors of piety will all unconsciously walk by one of their own number or a non-professor at work on Sunday, and say never a word. They will allow people to hunt, fish, play ball, and everything that has a tendency to disturb others, without a word of protest, but let a man keep the Sabbath and attempt any manner of necessary labor on Sunday, and the people who profess to believe and recommend the Bible immediately begin to persecute the man who lives according to the teachings of that Bible.

After narrating the recent persecutions in Maryland and Tennessee, with which our readers are familiar, the Independent comments as follows:—

The Constitution of these United States guarantees to every citizen religious freedom, yet where is there a State that has not on its statute books laws prohibiting the exercise of all religious freedom, except it suits the notion of the ecclesiastical lobbyists who control the enactment of laws prescribing the limitations of all religious rights and privileges.

Closing, the Independent truthfully characterizes these persecutions as "a disgrace to our country and a stigma upon any Christian people."
