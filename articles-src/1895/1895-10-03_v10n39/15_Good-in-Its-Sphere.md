# GOOD IN ITS SPHERE.

[Daily Standard, Leavenworth, Kansas.]

Speaking of the Christian Endeavor movement, the New York Sun, edited by that far-seeing old philosopher, Charles A. Dana, says: "It is evident that a desire, if not a settled purpose, to make the organization a distinct political power has taken possession of many of its prominent members. We regret to see this, and are heartily sorry. As a strictly moral enterprise its influence would be wholesome and beneficial; as a political power it will stir up bitter religious strife and prove a curse to the country. Sectarian combinations to effect political objects are dangerous."
