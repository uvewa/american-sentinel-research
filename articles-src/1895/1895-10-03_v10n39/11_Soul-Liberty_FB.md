# SOUL LIBERTY.

BY FANNIE BOLTON.

"Who art thou that judgest another man's servant? To his own master he standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall be holden up: for God is able to make him stand." Rom. 14:4.

God hath not made the stars of an equal magnitude,
Nor shaped the flowers alike that grace the summer wood.
In infinity of fashion, and in diversity
His matchless grace and loveliness of character we see.
We hear no flower of nature declaring pettishly
Unto another flower, "You must bloom, O flower, like me,"
Or catch a murmur echoed from the stars in heaven's height,
Because some world is fashioned to reflect another's light.
God uses great and small for some noble ministry,
According to the power of their given ability.
And shall men not learn a lesson who with finite wit declare
That the nations must be fashioned by a set religious square?
That each soul must think in ruts that fulfill a certain plan,
And shape up to a standard that was made by finite man.
Does this not place the human and the finite on the throne,
That God in infinite wisdom and in love should rule alone?
The infinite God has given the certain liberty
That is limited alone by a kind civility,
To think as it shall please them, and he has not given to others
The right to fetter thought or oppress their human brothers.
Hands off: then men ambitious to prescribe my very creed;
For God alone can feed my soul with truth of heaven I need.
Let Him alone have sway and control of all my heart
To regulate my conduct and my worship by fine art
Beyond your poor conception; for it is only He
Who can shape the delicate soul-flower for his vast eternity,
And the human touch permitted, would count me such a cost
That the blood of Christ for me be vain, and heaven itself be lost.
