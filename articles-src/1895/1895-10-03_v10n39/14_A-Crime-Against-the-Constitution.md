# "A CRIME AGAINST THE CONSTITUTION."

[Santa Paula (Cal.) Chronicle, Aug. 9.]

The imprisonment of eight men in Tennessee, recently, because they saw fit to work on Sunday, is a crime against the Constitution of the United States. The imprisoned men observe the seventh day of the week as their Sabbath, as they have a perfect right to do under the Constitution. Religious legislation—and all Sunday laws come under this head—is infamous and will never be sustained by enlightened public opinion.
