# RUSSIA.

[Ivan, in New York Observer, June 13.]

It is satisfactory to hear that the Protestant movement known as Stundism, which began in the south of Russia more than thirty years ago, and which is now passing through a time of great stress and trouble, is making considerable progress in Eastern Russia and in Siberia. The dispersal of Stundist families during the persecutions of recent years, and their settlement in regions remote from their old homes is unquestionably the origin of the movement in Siberia. I hear, moreover, that on the Pacific coast of Siberia there are several flourishing communities of Baptists and Stundists full of missionary zeal. One of their leaders, Yakub Dilyakoff, is not unknown in America; indeed, I believe his son is in one of your theological training schools, preparing, let us hope, to devote his talents to the good of his countrymen who are sitting in darkness and shadow. Your readers may like to be reminded that America has played no inconsiderable part in the Stundist movement. It was in America that Karl Bonnekemper, its founder, was educated and inspired to start the great revival.

The other day I heard a curious tale that struck me as most pathetic and as the description of an incident that could only happen in Russia. An old peasant in a village in the province of Kief, together with some of his companions, were under the impression that the local commissary of police had done them an injustice. They met together and the old man was delegated to go to St. Petersburg to present a petition to the czar for the restoration of certain rights which they alleged had been taken from them. They had no money to pay their delegate's travelling expenses, so the delegate, accompanied by his son, walked. It was early in winter when they set out on that walk of a thousand and more miles, and as they travelled ever northwards the hardships they encountered were terrible. Arrived in St. Petersburg, they were sent from one public office to another. Nobody would accept the petition, and thoroughly disheartened, they left St. Petersburg with their petition. The son died in a village in the middle of a pine forest half-way back to Kief. It was a walk for the old man of close on three thousand miles. He was absent from home over four months.
