# EDITORIAL NOTES.

As any one receiving the American Sentinel, without having ordered it may know that it is sent to him by some friend. Therefore, those who have not ordered the Sentinel, need have no fears that they will be asked to pay for it.

One of the ceremonies observed by Jews in the celebration of Yom Kippur, or the Great Day of Atonement (Lev. 23:27-32), is the sacrifice of a live chicken by each household.

The head of the house, it is said, swings a live chicken over the head of each member of his family, after which the fowl is killed by the rabbi and eaten by the family.

New York has an ordinance against the sale of live fowls, and it has been the custom of the police to raid the Jewish quarter every year at the Atonement season and arrest all dealers found with live chickens in their shops.

This year the Jews got an injunction restraining the health authorities from making the customary arrests, but for some reason it proved to be invalid, and the authorities manifested a special zeal in making the raid. About fifty arrests were made on the 27th ult.

The Jews declare the raid an outrage; and so it was. No sanitary code or other code that interfered similarly with a Roman Catholic festival or with the rites of popular Protestantism could survive a week in New York; and neither should this senseless regulation. It may be wise to restrict to some extent the sale of live fowls in a large city, but to apply such a rule so strictly as to prevent the Jews from observing a time-honored, though it must be confessed a very foolish religious custom, is an exhibition of despotism more worthy of Russia than it is of an American city.

Robert T. Nash, of Amory, Miss., who was arrested and tried last May for working in his garden on Sunday, has been indicted by the grand jury for work said to have been done on the 12th day of May.

Mr. Nash was arrested on the 16th of September, about 2 o'clock in the afternoon. The officer who made the arrest was riding a mule, and was at first disposed to require his prisoner to walk fifteen miles to Aberdeen, the county seat. Mr. Nash told him that he was very tired, having already walked a long distance, that his feet were sore, and that he had been up the previous night with a sick child, that he was not able to walk so great a distance. The officer finally consented to allow him to go to the county seat by rail. There the officer met him and escorted him to jail, where he was locked up. The next day he was taken to the court-room and required to plead to an indictment which charged him with working on Sunday, the 12th day of May, in the field hoeing corn. He refused to plead, saying that he could not remember what he did on the 12th day of May. The judge decided that this was equivalent to a plea of not guilty, and it was so entered. Mr. Nash said he was not ready for trial, and would like to have the case postponed. This request was denied, but upon calling the State's witnesses it was found that they were not present, and as it was the last day of the term, the case was necessarily postponed until the next term of court, which comes next spring. Mr. Nash was enabled to secure bondsmen the next day, and is again at liberty.

September 25, there was a demonstration in this city in favor of "liberal Sunday laws." The phrase, "liberal Sunday laws," means laws that will prohibit honest labor and permit the sale of beer; laws that will close barber shops and open saloons.

About fifteen thousand men are said to have taken part in the parade on this occasion. President Roosevelt of the Police Board reviewed the parade, and Rev. A. H. Grant of Newburg made a speech, and said some good things. He is reported in the daily papers to have declared that the State has no right to say how a man shall spend his Sunday so long as he does not interfere with the liberties of others. "Just so long as the Church," added Mr. Grant, "in its effort to win man, leans upon the arm of the State, it will deservedly fail of its object and be despised. But just as soon as it recognizes its own strength as a great source of supply to the natural and universal spiritual needs and wants of men, breaks off its unholy alliance with the State, and relies wholly upon God, just as soon will it become at once efficient and powerful. Men will flock to it as soon as it can be easily said, 'Come unto me, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday or Sunday, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will rest your weary heads and weary hands.'

"The Church can adjust itself to modern civilization, and in so doing it need not, must not, lower its ideals one iota; but it must reduce its demands, and make up for this reduction by such intelligent advance in methods and such embodiment of the Spirit of Jesus as shall draw men to its ideals, and so to itself."

This is sound doctrine, but it had small place in a demonstration in the interests of "liberal Sunday laws." Why any Sunday law at all? Men have no right to interfere with the rights of others upon any day; then why any special law providing that they shall not do so on Sunday?

The fact is that the expression "liberal Sunday laws" is a misnomer. Any law that prevents any man from doing on any day any act that he might properly do at any other time, is illiberal toward that man, and is just as bad in principle though not in degree as a "law" which curtails the freedom of a thousand men. And that is just the reason why we should have no more law for Sunday than for the fourth of July, Christmas or Thanksgiving. When the State has declared Sunday to be dies non it has reached the limit of its rightful authority and enacted the only really liberal Sunday law.

The trouble is that too many men in that "liberal Sunday law" parade had forfeited their right to protest on principle against Sunday "laws" by themselves selfishly favoring at some time or other legislation that would require somebody else to close business on that day.

Probably most of our readers will remember that in November, 1893, Eld. W. A. McCutchen, an Adventist minister, and Prof. E. C. Keck, an Adventist teacher, were arrested in Gainesville, Ga., for working in the back part of the Adventist church building on Sunday. The city of Gainesville, having no ordinance against Sunday work, these men were fined $50 each, by the mayor, with the alternative of ninety days in the chain-gang for "disturbing the peace," though it was shown that the only possible disturbance that there was to anybody, was the mental annoyance of knowing that the work was being done. One witness testified that he was disturbed, though in another part of the city, when he was told that they were working.

The case was appealed from the Police Court to the Superior Court, and it was the general opinion of lawyers that when it came up on appeal, the Superior Court would reverse the decision of the mayor; but that functionary happened to be foreman of the next grand jury, and secured indictments against McCutchen and Keck for violation of the State Sunday statute.

The cases were tried together in the Superior Court, April 22, 1894. The jury failed to agree and both cases went over to another term, when the prosecuting attorney entered a nolle and they were dismissed.

In the meantime no decision was rendered on the appeal from the mayor, and it was supposed by the defendants that the prosecution had abandoned the case. About this time the judge before whom the State case was tried was superseded by a newly elected judge, who had formerly been a Baptist minister. The retiring judge is said to have expressed the opinion that the mayor had no jurisdiction; but the new judge recently decided that the fine was properly imposed by the mayor and that it must be paid, or the defendants must either forfeit their bonds or go into the chain-gang. But Messrs. McCutchen and Keck have elected to do neither, and have appealed to the Supreme Court, where the cases are now pending.
