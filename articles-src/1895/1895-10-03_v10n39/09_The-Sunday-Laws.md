# THE SUNDAY "LAWS."

[The World, New York, Sept. 25.]

WHAT are the Sunday laws? What do they prohibit?

The first of them (section 263 of the Penal Code) forbids "all labor on Sunday except works of necessity or charity." It therefore forbids the blacking of boots, the cooking of hot dinners where cold victuals would suffice, the driving of street-cars or the running of elevated trains, the use of cabs for the transfer of passengers and baggage, the trimming of a rose-bush, the driving of carriages, the running of elevators in office buildings, the sweeping of floors, and apparently the making of beds or the washing of dishes in houses where there are enough dishes for three meals. In brief, it forbids all work not absolutely necessary.

Section 265 prohibits "all shooting, hunting, fishing, playing, horse-racing, gaming or other public sports, exercises or shows." Under this provision the hard-worked men who take a day off on Sunday and recreate themselves by quietly fishing are all lawbreakers. So is the man who plays a game of billiards, and the one who sits down to a game of chess with his wife, or who "plays" any sort of thing with his children. This is precisely the construction that was given to the statute when it was enacted, and repeated in a late decision, and no other is possible to those who "favor the maintenance of the Sunday laws" as they stand. The man who rides a bicycle or a horse on Sunday or drives in a buggy is equally a lawbreaker. He is engaged in a "public exercise."

Section 266 prohibits "all trades, manufactures, agricultural or mechanical employments" on Sunday, except when they are works of necessity or charity. This would put a stop to the publication of Monday morning newspapers, and would stop every steam engine and every dynamo in the State. It would forbid a farmer to bud a tree or curry a horse or pluck fruit or gather nuts or to drive for pleasure.

Section 267 forbids "all manner of public selling or offering for sale of any property upon Sunday," except articles of food before 10 o'clock in the morning, meals in restaurants or served from restaurants, newspapers, fruit, confectionery, prepared tobacco, drugs, medicines and surgical appliances. This forbids the sale of soda or mineral waters, hairbrushes, cravats or soap. It makes a lawbreaker of the iceman or milkman who sends in ice or milk to a family where sickness prevails if the hour of 10 A. M. be passed. The traveller whose trunk is delayed is forbidden to buy a toothbrush or a clean collar in which to go to the hotel breakfast. The delicatessen man may not send to a customer a plate of salad for Sunday evening tea. And anybody who sells any of these things or offers them for sale on Sunday forfeits his entire stock in addition to suffering fine and imprisonment. See Section 270.

According to Section 275 and the judicial construction put upon the word "gaming" by recent court decisions, you become a double offender if you play a game at chess or billiards or checkers or dominoes within two miles of a church when a meeting is being held, on Sunday or any other day in the week.

Section 277 forbids all dramatic or operatic performances, all dancing or wrestling, all trials of strength, all juggling and everything else of the kind. You may play on the piano when your guests visit you on Sunday evening, provided your piano does not make a noise—see Section 265—but you must not let your friends dance to the music, and you must not entertain them with any imitations of actors or any tricks of legerdemain, for these things are forbidden in a private parlor as well as in a public hall.

It is not the Sunday Excise Law alone that it is proposed to maintain, but all "the Sunday laws" such as those catalogued above. They are laws enacted at a time when the State was held to be the nursery government of all the people, and when it assumed authority to prescribe "holy time" and religious observances, upon the intolerant models of Puritanism. It is not merely proposed to prevent the poor man from getting his pitcher of beer for his Sunday dinner: they propose to regulate the conduct of all of us, even invading the sanctity of our homes by way of compelling us to observe Sunday as if it were the Mosaic Sabbath and we were seventeenth-century Puritans.
