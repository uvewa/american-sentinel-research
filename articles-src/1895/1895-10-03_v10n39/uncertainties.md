### Page 1, Line 11
- **OCR read:** "Vol. 10. No. 89."
- **Corrected to:** "Vol. 10. No. 39."

### Page 2, Line 95
- **OCR read:** "cohorters"
- **Corrected to:** "colporters"
- **Confidence:** HIGH
- **Reason:** Context clearly indicates "colporters" (Bible distributors), common OCR error

- **Confidence:** HIGH
- **Reason:** Common word, obvious OCR error

### Page 6, Line 515

- **Reason:** Unusual place name, could be "Tonganoxie" but left as OCR read

### Page 7, Line 738

- **Confidence:** MEDIUM
- **Reason:** Could be "Roane County" but left as OCR read without confirmation

### Page 8, Line 963

## Notes
- The masthead showed "LEON A. SMITH" as third editor, not "A. F. Ballenger" as indicated in the instructions
- Most proper names and place names in "The Roll of Honor" section were left as OCR read due to inability to verify against original
- Several newspaper names may have minor spelling variations from actual publications
