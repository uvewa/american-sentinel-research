# TO TEST THE SHEATS "LAW."

[The Sun, Sept. 23.]

The American Missionary Association of Congregational Churches has obtained an opinion from one of the most eminent constitutional lawyers in Massachusetts that the so-called "Sheats law" passed by the Florida Legislature last winter, will not stand in the United States courts. This law provides for a fine of not less than $150 nor more than $500, or imprisonment for not less than three months, for conducting any school wherein white persons and negroes might be instructed or boarded together within the same building, or taught in the same class, at the same time, by the same teacher.

The Orange Park School, against which the law was especially aimed, will open on Tuesday, October 1. If the law is enforced the teachers will be arrested. The Rev. T. S. Perry of Limerick, Maine, who was pastor of the church and school last year, will return there this year. Prof. B. D. Rowles, of Fulton, N. Y., last year's principal, will also return. Miss Caroline Wandell, of Phoenix, N. Y., Miss Edith Robinson, of Battle Creek, Mich., Miss Helen S. Loveland, of Newark Valley, N. Y., Mrs. Julia E. Titus, of Moravia, N. Y., Mr. Otis S. Dickinson, of Granville, Mass., and Miss Margaret A. Ball, of Orange Park, Fla., will return.
