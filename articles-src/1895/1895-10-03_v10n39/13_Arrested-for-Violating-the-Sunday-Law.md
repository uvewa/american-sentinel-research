# ARRESTED FOR VIOLATING THE SUNDAY "LAW."

[Mail and Express, Sept. 23.]

JULIUS WOELFLE, of No. 313 East Eighty-fifth street, was arraigned before Magistrate Kotlich, at the Harlem Court, this morning, on a charge of violating the Sunday law in repairing a bicycle yesterday afternoon.

The magistrate discharged the prisoner on the ground that the repairing of the bicycle was a work of necessity, in order to enable the rider of the wheel to proceed on his journey.
