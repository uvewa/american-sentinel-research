# VIOLATION OF THE CONSTITUTION ALLEGED.

[New York Sun, Sept. 23.]

ALBANY, Sept. 22.—The State Department of Public Instruction has been called upon to construe section 4 of Article IX. of the amended Constitution, known as the educational article, which reads as follows.—

Neither the State nor any subdivision thereof shall use its property or credit, or any public money, or authorize or permit either to be used, directly or indirectly, in aid or maintenance, other than for examination or inspection, of any school or institution of learning wholly or in part under the control or direction of any religious denomination, or in which any denominational tenet or doctrine is taught.

The matter comes up on the appeal of Fayette B. Durant, Thomas G. Ross, James C. Covert, and Abraham Hilton to Superintendent Skinner from a decision of the West Troy Board of Education. The Board has been notified to file its answer within ten days. The appeal papers recite the fact that under chapter 881 of the laws of 1895, four commissioners of education were elected in West Troy, and that under the act they appointed four others. It is generally understood that the purpose of the act was to create a board having four Protestants and four Catholics on it, or, at least, four Republicans and four Democrats. This board accepted an offer made by the Very Rev. T. M. A. Burke, Bishop of the Roman Catholic diocese of Albany, and Rev. James A. Curtain, Pastor of St. Bridget's Church of West Troy, to lease for $1 a month the parochial school building of St. Bridget's Church.

The Catholic authorities also agreed to pay the salaries of a fireman and a janitor. Then a resolution was adopted by the board appointing fifteen teachers, eight of whom were for this school. All eight were Catholics, and six were sisters belonging to the Roman Catholic Convent of St. Joseph of West Troy. The six sisters were examined in a separate room, because of a rule of their sect forbidding them to appear in mixed gatherings. All received commissioners' certificates entitling them to teach in the public schools. The appellants say they do not believe that these sisters were properly examined or passed the examination. It is further alleged that as the sisters are forbidden by their rules to attend teachers' institutes, which is required of all public school teachers, they are not qualified to teach; that the rent charged is not sufficient for the care of the rooms even; that the school is wholly or partly under the control or direction of a religious, sectarian denomination, and that denominational doctrines or tenets are taught therein, and that many parents will not send their children to the school while it is under such control. They ask the superintendent to annul the action of the West Troy Board of Education in leasing the school as well as the contracts with the six teachers, and to provide a suitable building and employ duly qualified teachers irrespective of any religious denomination.

The issue of this case will be watched with much interest all over the State, as it is the first appeal of the kind made under the revised constitution.
