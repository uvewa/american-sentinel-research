# LITERARY NOTICES.

The "Rights of the People," or "Civil Government and Religion," is the latest number of the *Religious Liberty Library* issued. It is an illustrated pamphlet of 378 pages, by Alonzo T. Jones.

The "Rights of the People," is the well-known pamphlet, "Civil Government and Religion," revised and greatly enlarged. This is in the opinion of many the best thing that Mr. Jones has ever written; and it ought not only to be read, but studied by every lover of liberty, either civil or religious.

It will be especially valuable for those who expect to study the Sabbath-school lessons in the "International Sabbath-school Quarterly," for the fourth quarter of the current year. Numerous references are made in these lessons to this pamphlet, and everyone who expects to master the lessons will need the pamphlet.

This book treats of live issues which are now before the people, and everyone should read it, whether interested in religion or not, because it discusses principles that are vital in a government "of the people, by the people, and for the people." Price, 40 cents. Usual discount given to dealers. Address the publishers, Pacific Press, 43 Bond Street, New York.

## THE "ARENA" FOR OCTOBER.

This number of the *Arena* contains much interesting matter; but perhaps that which will most interest the readers of this paper is, "Cruel Persecution of Christians by Christians in Tennessee." This comes under "Current Notes on Vital Problems," by the editor. Mr. Flower is an exceedingly able writer, and his sympathies have been fully enlisted in behalf of those who are suffering religious persecution. These facts are a sufficient guarantee that anything he says upon the subject will be of surpassing interest. The price of the *Arena* is 50 cents, and may be ordered direct from the publishers, Boston, Mass.

"The Duty to Obey Civil Rulers," is the title of the April issue of the *Religious Liberty Library*. The subject is considered from the standpoint of the Christian, and the limitations imposed by man's duty to his Creator are pointed out, as set forth by the declarations of Scripture. The bearing of expediency, and of the doctrine of natural rights, upon the question, are also considered. The propositions laid down are clear, logical, scriptural, and in harmony with the principles maintained by eminent and well-known men of our own times. As the question of obedience to civil rulers is becoming more and more a practical one for every person, by reason of movements set on foot which, under the sanction of "law," invade the realm of conscience, a clear understanding of the limits within which duty commands obedience to civil rulers, is a matter of prime importance to each individual; hence all should feel an interest to read this publication. Sixteen pages, price, 2 cents. Address the International Tract Society, Battle Creek, Mich.

"KEEP the Commandments," is the title of a sixty-four page pamphlet, published by Charles E. Buell, Plainfield, N. J. The author makes a strong and able plea for the observance of all of God's ten precepts, with especial reference to that one which is, in the name of religion, so generally disregarded. The claims of the seventh-day Sabbath are presented from the Scriptures, in contrast with those sought from tradition and custom for "the venerable day of the sun." The arguments are drawn from a wide range of Scripture texts, and are forcibly presented. Address the author.
