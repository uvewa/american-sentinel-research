BY C. L. BOYD, NASHVILLE, TENN.

For years in the past the AMERICAN SENTINEL has been faithfully crying aloud to our municipal, State, and national legislators, and to the people at large. It has stood as a bold sentinel, guarding the religious liberty of the whole people. It has also acted as an educator, teaching the principles of liberty in the broadest, deepest, and highest sense of the sacred term.

Among those who indorse the righteous principles of liberty therein taught, I am proud to mention some at least of our Tennessee legislators, as the following from the Nashville American, of May 14, plainly shows:—

Mr. Waddell, of Marion, called up the bill excluding persons who observe another day as the Sabbath from the penalties of the law against violation of the Sabbath.

Mr. Stratton moved to lay the bill on the table, and the eyes and nose were demanded. Ayes 36, noes 39.

Mr. Heiskell spoke in favor of the bill. The Seventh-day Adventists were conscientious, God-fearing people and should be allowed to worship when they saw fit.

Mr. Slatter said freedom of conscience was the substratum of the liberties of this country. He argued that if any one church had the power it would stop all the others. Might did not make right. He hoped freedom would be granted the Seventh-day Adventists.

Mr. Akin was for maintaining the Christian Sabbath. If the Seventh-day Adventists could not observe the laws of Tennessee they were not bound to live here. The perpetuity of our country was dependent on the maintenance of the Christian Sabbath. Constitutional government and liberty depended on the maintenance of the Sabbath.

Mr. Smith said the question was what was right. Was one day holier than another. The Midsausgedane said Friday was; the Jew said Saturday; the Christian, Sunday. Each had a different day and quoted Divine authority. He challenged any Christian to cite ecclesiastical edict that transferred the Sabbath from Saturday to Sunday. Christians were to-day upholding a pagan in worshiping on Sunday. Street cars were run and railroad trains, and yet they punished men for working on their secluded farms. He wanted equal rights for all.

But notwithstanding the fact that the bill was ably championed, it was defeated the next morning, by a vote of 57 to 24.

The facts presented by Mr. Smith show plainly that our Sunday laws are the baneful, though logical, fruit of the compromise made between professed Christians and the pagan, sun-worshiping Constantine, fit representative of the Roman Church from that time onward.

This compromise has been honored full-long. The time has fully come when the command of God should be heard and heeded by every man: "Choose ye this day whom ye will serve."

All good people should thank God and take courage, in view of the fact that our statesmen, legislators, editors, and popular ministers everywhere are agitating and discussing this important question. The public mind is being enlightened, and men are daily and intelligently deciding whom they will serve.

While some are slow to learn, they are nevertheless learning the priceless principles of liberty, which were held so dear by our forefathers. But alas, others fearing "that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at naught, but also that the" idol "of the great" god baal "should be despised, and" his "magnificence should be destroyed, whom all" Rome "and the world worshipeth," are intrenching themselves behind State laws, and are loudly calling for a national despotism. Having secured an "image" to the papacy, they now demand that this image be exalted "above all that is called God," and that it be worshiped by obedience to unconstitutional and unchristian laws.
