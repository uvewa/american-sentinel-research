THE Boston Republic (Roman Catholic) is willing to give credit where credit is due. Of the tendency to adopt Romish ceremonial, it says: "If it does not ultimately bring about the reunion of all Christians in one true faith, it will yet have some good effect. Formerly it was a severe task to get prospective converts to understand and accept the ceremonies of the church. The Protestant sects, in adopting them and using them in their churches, are doing a great deal of educational work which formerly came upon the shoulders of the Catholic priests. Protestants, in thus becoming acquainted with Catholic ceremonies, render themselves easy converts to the faith." Romanizing Protestants ought to paste this in their hats.
