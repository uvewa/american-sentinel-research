THE Christian Work says:—

The college student who abhors compulsory attendance at chapel would probably reject compulsory salvation.

He ought to reject it, for compulsory salvation is unchristian. Christ says, "Whosoever will," let him come. It is the compulsory-salvation error that gave rise to papal persecutions. This is not to condemn the regulation of a denominational school requiring attendance at chapel services at the opening of the daily session; but it only condemns the Christian Work's unfortunate attempt at its defense.
