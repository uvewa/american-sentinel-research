THE bill referred to in these columns last week, introduced into the Tennessee legislature exempting from the penalty of the Sunday law, observers of the seventh day, was defeated in the House on the 14th inst., by a vote of 57 to 24. The facts are given on another page by C. L. Boyd, of Nashville. The Adventists asked bread and received a stone; they asked equality and are refused even toleration; they asked liberty but bonds and imprisonment await them.
