THE Boston Pilot (Roman Catholic) in its issue of May 18, says:—

If it [the AMERICAN SENTINEL] will persuade itself and some of its anti-Catholic neighbors not to lie about them [Roman Catholics], that will suffice.

The AMERICAN SENTINEL lays no claim to infallibility, but it does desire to tell the truth; and if the Pilot will point out wherein the AMERICAN SENTINEL has lied about Roman Catholics, the SENTINEL will sustain its utterances or print an apology. Will the Pilot do as much with its charge that we have lied about Roman Catholics?
