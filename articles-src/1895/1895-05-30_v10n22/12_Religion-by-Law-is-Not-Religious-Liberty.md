[From the Washington Chronicle.]

The tendency is more aggressively manifest than at any period of this country's history toward a practical establishment of a "State" or governmental "religion." Any law that touches, directly or remotely, the subject of any system of religion or religious belief, or requiring any kind or degree of religious observance or practice, is to that extent enforcing a "State" religion, and a union and coöperation of Church and State. The most general application of a law-religion is the laws upon observance of Sunday as a "holy" day. Only biblical Christians regard Sunday as a holy day, and certain distinct sects of Christians absolutely reject Sunday and believe in Saturday as the Sabbath or holy day of the Bible. The Hebrew religionists, believing in the Old but not the Christian Testament, reject Sunday and observe Saturday as the "Lord's day."

But, despite this diversity of opinion, belief and faith, among Christians themselves, and though we regard this a land of absolute divorce and separation of Church and State, of religion and government, yet statutory and municipal laws and rules everywhere abound enforcing a specific religion, a particular interpretation of the Bible, that adopted as part of the religious systems of Roman Catholicism and most of the Protestant sects—the Sunday "Sabbath" religion.

Severe penalties are inflicted in many or most parts of the country for ignoring that law-religion and adopting any other course of life than that required by Sunday laws. At this moment a number of moral and reputable citizens of Tennessee are imprisoned and suffering untold indignities, persecuted by "religious despotism"—the enforcement of the odious and despotic Sunday law of Tennessee. These victims of religious despotism are members of that most reputable sect of Christians known as Seventh-day Adventists. They keep Saturday as the "Lord's day," regarding it as the day mentioned as the holy day in the Bible.
