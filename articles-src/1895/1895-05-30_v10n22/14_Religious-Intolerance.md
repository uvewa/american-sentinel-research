[From the Coast Advocate, Half Moon Bay, Cal., April 24.]

The dispatches announce that the governor of Tennessee has pardoned the eight men who were serving sentences in the jail of Rhea County for violating the Sunday law of that State. The pardon was granted on recommendation of the judge in whose court the men were convicted, and who had previously remitted the fines, leaving only the costs of the trial charged against the prisoners, which could not be remitted. It is also reported that a number of other citizens of Rhea County have been arrested for violating the Sunday law, in that they attend to their usual duties on the first day of the week, after having rested on the seventh day, as they believe the Lord commanded them.

This Rhea County affair seems to be literally persecution, as in many other parts of Tennessee as well as in that county, ordinary avocations are followed by people who profess no religion, without the law being enforced against them. At any rate, the punishment of citizens of any State in the Union for the non-observance of a religious law, or of a law commanding obedience to a religious doctrine, is contrary to the spirit of our Government and repugnant to our ideas of justice and equality. The State has just as much right to command its citizens to join a particular church as to religiously observe a particular day as holy. To admit the State's right to do either, is to admit its right of control over individual conscience.

California has already admitted the entering wedge of obnoxious religious laws by the passage in the last legislature of the barbers' Sunday closing law, which compels every barber to close his shop at noon on Sunday. Such a law is so clearly unconstitutional, in that it is the grossest kind of class legislation, that all the lawyers in the State are wondering how the governor could have signed it after a duped legislature had passed the bill. If barbers must close at noon on Sunday, why not everybody? Why should they be particularly favored, or otherwise? Let us stop stages and trains and buggy riding and fishing and picnics, in fact everything but going to church and Sunday school, and arrest every man, woman and child who does not attend church at least once on Sunday without a valid excuse.

That is the logical conclusion of the movement. And then, to complete the scheme, there should be an annual tax to support the church. Either that, or keep Church and State apart, as the builders and defenders of our Constitution decided we should, and let each person worship God as seemeth best.
