THE Sunday newspaper has another enemy. One of the monthly magazines of this city complains that the Sunday papers have invaded its domain, and that instead of buying the magazines people now buy and read the Sunday papers. We may now expect to see the publishers of literary magazines join the crusade against the Sunday paper, in the interests, of course, of "good morals" and "a day of rest for overworked printers and newsboys."
