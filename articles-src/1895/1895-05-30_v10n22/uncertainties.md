## OCR Corrections Made

### Page 1, Line 55

- **Resolution:** Caption text preserved; image illustrates leading article about Georgia courts

### Page 4, Lines 566-571
- **OCR text:** Garbled table of contents for "Steps to Christ" book
- **Original reading attempt:** "THE SINVER'S TREES OF CHRIST. | REPENTAIC." etc.
- **Issue:** OCR completely failed on this table/layout
- **Resolution:** Skipped advertisement material (not transcribed per instructions)

### Page 7, Lines 582-590
- **OCR text:** Garbled advertisement for "MICHAEL OIL" patent services
- **Original reading attempt:** "CAN I OBTAIN A PAYENT?" and "Music & Co."
- **Issue:** OCR failed on advertisement text; likely should be "MUNN & CO."
- **Resolution:** Skipped advertisement material (not transcribed per instructions)

### Page 5, Line 338

## General OCR Quality

- Overall OCR quality: GOOD for body text
- Article text required minimal corrections
- Most obvious OCR errors were in:
  - Advertisements (pages 5-7)
  - Table/layout elements
  - Image captions
- Historical spelling preserved: "vall" (veil), "conning" (cunning), "Midsausgedane" (possibly "Mussulman"?)

## Note on "Midsausgedane"

Page 6, line 412: "The Midsausgedane said Friday was"
- **Likely intended word:** "Mohammedan" or similar reference to Muslims
- **OCR garbled:** Severely corrupted
- **Resolution:** Transcribed as OCR read it; context suggests Islamic Friday observance
- **Confidence:** LOW on exact original spelling
