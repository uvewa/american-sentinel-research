[From Die Rundschau (Chicago), May 1.]

The Wisconsin Sunday law is not as harmless as was recently maintained by the Germania. We at least did not find "that with the utmost care it sought only the civil Sunday rest." On the contrary, nothing distinguishes it from the Sunday laws of other States. Even the superscription "Violation of the Sabbath," is suspicious and makes it a religious law.

But its several actions too are of a similar nature. It prohibits and punishes "any manner of labor, business, or work, except only works of necessity and charity," also the presence of any person "at any dancing or public diversion, show, or entertainment," and the participation "in any sport, game, or play, on the first day of the week." One need not have any great powers of perception in order to see that thereby Sunday is made a holy day by the State of Wisconsin, on which day things the State allows of on other days are criminal, and the permission to perform on Sunday "only works of necessity and charity" makes this yet more potent. 'Tis the so-called Anglo-American Sabbath idea entertained and fostered by almost all 'Protestant' sects of this country, that finds its expression also in the Sunday law of Wisconsin.

But when the Germania says, "Our Wisconsin law explicitly defines that any person observing any other day of the week as the Sabbath may perform his daily occupation and work to his heart's content on Sunday," then this sentence yet more clearly proves her to be in error with this her opinion.

The section of the law under discussion literally reads as follows: "Any person who conscientiously believes that the seventh, or any other day of the week, ought to be observed as the Sabbath, and who actually refrains from secular business and labor on that day, may perform secular labor and business on the first day of the week, unless he shall willfully disturb thereby some other person, or some religious assembly on said day." This exemption clause plainly shows what ought to be one's opinion of the entire Sunday law. A law granting exceptions in order not to conflict with the inalienable rights of man and the conscientious convictions of certain people must necessarily be wrong and unjust. Besides this clause evidently grants only toleration and not freedom of conscience. It puts certain people, together with their religious convictions, in an exemption-position over against the State—in a position they enjoy not by nature and by right, but which is granted them first by an act of grace on the part of the State.

But according to the fundamental principle of American jurisprudence, the citizens of this Republic enjoy from the very beginning complete religious liberty, which they can demand as their right solemnly granted them in the "Declaration of Rights," and which may not first be granted them by a legislature as a special privilege.

And, finally, the State of Wisconsin by this exemption clause claims jurisdiction over the consciences and the belief of its citizens, in that it grants only such the benefit of this exemption as "conscientiously believe" they ought to observe another day than the first "as the Sabbath." Thereby at the same time silently admitting the Sunday law to have been enacted in the favor of those "conscientiously believing" that Sunday ought to be observed as the Sabbath, and that, therefore, considerations of a religious nature prompted and enforced the same. Sunday laws, together with their exemption clauses, have, evidently indeed, this object, to effect the observance of a church ordinance and to coerce the consciences.

In fine, the Germania can make as little of a showing with the Sunday law of Wisconsin, as, for example, the Rundschau, could with that of Illinois.
