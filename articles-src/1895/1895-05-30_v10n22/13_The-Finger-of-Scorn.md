[From the Red Wing (Minn.) Argus, May 9.]

The Progress, published at Minneapolis, Minn., comes out with a ringing editorial under the caption of "Modern Religious Persecution." It first speaks of the act of the governor of Tennessee in granting pardon to the imprisoned Adventists, and adds: "The act of the governor in exercising the pardoning power in this case is upheld by the best sense of the commonwealth of Tennessee and will be approved by the lovers of justice and liberty everywhere." In giving an account of these persecutions for the last ten years, the Progress goes on to say that "fifty-three have been convicted and thirty have suffered imprisonment."

Then follows a statement which should be placed in the hat of every friend of enforced rest. It is as follows: "The observance of the first day of the week instead of the seventh as a day of rest was a change made by the Christian church since the death of Christ, and was purely a church regulation. The observance of either rests with the conscience of the individual, and the laws of a free country are supposed to protect every individual in the free exercise of his own conscience, provided he does not interfere with the rights of others."

And here the Progress raises the questions: "Is the United States of America a free country? Are men to be deprived of freedom of conscience that interferes with no other's rights? Press and public are pointing and should continue to point the finger of scorn at the States which retain laws which make religious persecution possible."

The Evening Press, of Ogden, Utah, has some editorial comments concerning Sunday laws. The friends of these laws say that they do not "attempt to interfere with the rights of individuals to worship on Saturday and keep it as the Sabbath if they choose." "Aye," says the Press, "there's the rub. These Sunday laws do not seek especially to prevent persons from worshiping on Saturday and keeping it as the Sabbath if they choose, but they do say that those who believe that it is a religious duty to worship on the seventh day shall not pursue their ordinary and necessary avocations on the first day. Such laws, we firmly believe, are subversive of human liberty. They have been passed and enforced in deference to the religious opinions of a minority, not a majority of the people. They seek and do deprive others who have different religious convictions, or no convictions at all, from enjoying themselves on a particular day, even though it involve no open desecration or interference with the rights of those who consider the first day of the week the Sabbath. The States which maintain these unjust, restrictive and oppressive laws are not specially noted for the morality, sobriety, and intelligence of their people. Tennessee is a good example of this fact—a State where more than 100,000 of its citizens can neither read nor write."

"We contend that the advocates of Sunday observance have no right to ask the State to require of others conformity with their religious faith or doctrine, and that it is not the province of the State to enforce by law obedience to the rules of any religion. When it goes beyond this and seeks by law to interfere with personal rights and to restrict the liberty of the citizen to enjoy himself in any manner he sees fit, provided such enjoyment does not interfere with the rights of others to do the same, in our opinion, the State does something which is repugnant to the American Declaration of Independence and contrary to the spirit of the National Constitution itself."
