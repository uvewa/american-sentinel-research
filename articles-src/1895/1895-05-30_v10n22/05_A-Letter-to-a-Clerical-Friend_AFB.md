DEAR BROTHER:—

As promised I will now write you again, addressing myself to the scripture you quoted in closing your kind letter to me. The text reads: "Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin." Rom. 3:20.

You did not quote the last clause, but evidently did not purposely omit it. However, I am at a loss to know why you quoted this text in connection with a consideration of the question, Ought the Sabbath of the fourth commandment to be observed? Surely you do not believe that because men are not justified by the deeds of the law, but by faith, therefore faith makes void the law; for to draw this conclusion from the text would not only be contrary to the manifest trend of the argument of the chapter, but contrary to its plainly expressed conclusion as stated in the last verse, which reads: "Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law." Rom. 3:31.

The fact that we are saved by faith in Christ instead of by the deeds of the law, does indeed "establish" the law instead of abrogating it. For it teaches that the law is so "perfect," "spiritual," "holy," "just and good," that after we had violated it, and could not by future good works, even if it were in our power to perform them, atone for past violations, the Son of God came to earth to die to save us from the penalty of transgression and to make it possible for us, through faith in him, to so connect with his infinite power as to have him work in us both to will and to do of his own good pleasure.

In order to explain the thought further and at the same time give you the position of Seventh-day Adventists on the question, I will quote from a sermon delivered at their last General Conference, and published on page 232 of the Conference Bulletin:—

There was something that the law could not do, and that God, sending his own Son, did. But why was it that the law could not do what it desired, and what was required?—It was weak through the flesh. The trouble was in the flesh. It was this that caused the law to fail of its purpose concerning man. Then God sent Christ to do what the law could not do. And the law having failed of its purpose, because of the flesh, and not because of any lack in itself, God must send him to help the flesh, and not to help the law. If the law had been in itself too weak to do what it was intended to do, then the thing for him to have done would have been to remedy the law; but the trouble was with the flesh, and therefore he must remedy the flesh.

It is true that the argument nowadays, springing up from that enmity that is against God, and is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be, is that the law could not do what was intended, and God sent his Son to weaken the law, so that the flesh could answer the demands of the law. But if I am weak and you are strong, and I need help, it does not help me any to make you as weak as I am: I am as weak and helpless as before. There is no help at all in all that. But when I am weak and you are strong, and you can bring to me your strength, that helps me. So the law was strong enough; but its purpose could not be accomplished because of the weakness of the flesh. Therefore God, to supply the need, must bring strength to weak flesh. He sent Christ to supply the need; and therefore Christ must so arrange it that strength may be brought to our flesh itself which we have to-day, that the purpose of the law may be met in our flesh. So it is written: "God sending his own Son in the likewise of sinful flesh," in order "that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh but after the Spirit."

I will not enlarge upon this thought further, for I cannot believe that you would seriously argue that because we are not saved by the deeds of the law but by faith, therefore we are at liberty to violate the law.

In closing, you say: "When the Lord shows me I am wrong then I will turn, and not before." In this conclusion, you are correct if you are willing, as I believe you are, that the Lord shall show you his will in his appointed way, that is, through his Word. It is through his Word he shows us the truth, and to ask that he work a miracle to show that he desires us to obey that Word, is asking too much. When the lawyer came to the Lord with the question, "Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?" the Lord answered, "What is written in the law? how readest thou?" Luke 10:25, 26.

Again, when the rich man in the parable asked that a miracle be wrought to convince his unbelieving friends, the answer is returned, "They have Moses and the prophets, let them hear them." And when the plea was made, "But if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent," the former reply is emphasized by the words, "If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead." Luke 16:29-31.

Again, in 2 Tim. 3:16, 17, the Scriptures are affirmed to contain sufficient "instruction in righteousness: that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works."

Now to apply this to the question of Sabbath-keeping: We are repeatedly told in Scripture that Sabbath-keeping is a good work (Isa. 58:13, 14), but we are nowhere told that Sunday observance is a good work. Its observance cannot, then, be necessary "that the man of God may be perfect."

In closing let me say, settle this question by the Word of God, and let not majorities, social relations, or any human considerations effect that decision.

Yours fraternally,

A. F. BALLENGER.
