[From the San Juan Times, Farmington, N. M., April 19.]

The prosecutions of the Seventh-day Adventists of Graysville, Tenn., for violating the Sunday law, are causing a deal of comment and hostile criticism. It appears that the prosecutions are the result of the determined persecutions of their enemies; but it has not been denied that the Adventists are a quiet, law-abiding people, and were laboring for the good of their fellow-men. None of the work was of a nature to disturb the quiet or peace of the neighborhood.

This sect had an academy at Graysville, where young persons were being fitted for lives of usefulness. The school prospered, and one hundred pupils were enrolled.

Judge Parks at the trial, stated that his sympathies were with the defendants, but that the law was plain, and his duty was to enforce it. The judge said: "If I were to express my private feelings, there is nothing I regard with more concern than the encroachments of legislative enactment upon the rights of the individual in matters of conscience." Now, the argument of the Adventists is that they are obeying the law of God in working six days and resting on the seventh. The commandment as to keeping holy the Sabbath day is repeated in our churches frequently, and the seventh day referred to as the day of rest. Our laws generally hold with the Christian idea of recognizing Sunday as the Sabbath. Here we have a law-abiding set of people who hold that the seventh day is the Sabbath. Now, as a matter of individual right, can they be forced to recognize another day also? It is to be remembered that this is a question of conscience, not of mere personal liberty. The result is strange.

Here is a question of belief, and statute cannot settle it because it is held to be a matter of Divine command. Are not these prosecutions merely persecutions? No one contends that any man can enforce a right to become a nuisance on the Sunday, but with reference to certain duties and work, how far should statutes prevail?

Again, what is Sunday? Sunday is the first day of the week, the day fixed upon by the Christians for rest and religion. The Sabbath, the day appointed by God as a day of rest, was undoubtedly originally the seventh day, not the first, and so here appears an anomaly. The resurrection of Christ on the first day led to the institution of Sunday as Sabbath by the Christians. Here, then, is a matter of belief and conscience, and the argument arises, how far should a legislature go in interfering with the religious tenets of a people, when it is contrary to the very rights of that people, and the policy of the nation, to assert control in matters relative to religion?
