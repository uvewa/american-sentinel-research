[From Evangel and Sabbath Outlook, May 2, 1895.]

All honor to Judge Parks who recommended that the men be pardoned whom he was obliged to condemn, under the letter of a bad Sunday law. And all honor to Governor Turney who, on the 9th of April, pardoned five of the Sabbath-keeping Adventists who were still in jail at Dayton, Tenn.

The injustice which has been done to those Sabbath-keepers has aroused a storm of indignation, North and South alike. The Chattanooga Times and other journals in Tennessee, have done nobly in "speaking out" upon the wrong and shame which has been done in these cases. Such words and the act of Governor Turney go far to compensate for the bigotry and injustice of lesser men. And we trust that all things combined will result in a speedy abrogation of the law which has made such injustice possible. The fact that the Sunday laws are not executed, and cannot be enforced against common labor, except in such cases as of the Sabbath-keepers at Graysville, makes the need of repeal all the greater. Throughout the land, the pretended observers of Sunday break the laws at will, especially the larger corporations, and the State and national governments, while those against whom bigotry can array local and temporary prejudice are made to suffer.

There seems no room for doubt that the enforcement of the Sunday laws against respectable labor on Sunday, would hasten their repeal in almost every case. The friends of these laws know, and acknowledge, that their formal continuance is secured only by non-enforcement. This fact alone brands the persecution of Sabbath-keepers as a double shame. Again we say, honor to Governor Turney and Judge Parks.
