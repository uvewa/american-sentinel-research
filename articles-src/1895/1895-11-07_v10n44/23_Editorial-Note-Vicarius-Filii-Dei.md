THE Monitor (Roman Catholic), of San Francisco, ridicules the application of Rev. 13:18 to the papacy, and gives an exhibition of cheap wit by manipulating the name of one of the editors of this paper and then figuring out of it the mystic number 666. But this is too serious a matter for sport. The stubborn fact remains that without manipulation the numerical value of the letters in the chief title of the popes is just 666—the "number six hundred three score and six," of Rev. 13:18. The blasphemous title, "Vicarius Filii Dei," so proudly worn by the pope, is in reality the brand of Cain upon the brow of the papacy.
