## DOES CONSCIENCE REQUIRE IT?

BY F. D. STARR.

In its issue of Sept. 7, the Christian Statesman makes an editorial comment on the prosecution of Seventh-day Baptists and Seventh-day Adventists for violating the Sunday law. It says that the idea that there is any persecution about these arrests and imprisonments is an entire misapprehension of the facts in the case. Concerning labor on the first day of the week, the Statesman says: "No man's conscience requires him to work on that day." Upon this basis it argues that there can be no persecution whatever in a man's being forced by law to refrain from labor on the first day of the week.

The Statesman has undertaken a very grave task in attempting to decide what other men's consciences demand of them to do. It also states that "if anyone chooses to observe every day as a sabbath, the law will not interfere." It is readily admitted by all that some people's consciences require them to observe the seventh day of the week; but most people have consciences that take in other matters than the mere observance of any certain day in the week. Every Scripture requirement becomes to the true disciple of Christ a matter of conscience, and when he reads in 1 Tim. 5:8, "But if any provide not for his own, and especially for those of his own house, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel," he feels in conscience bound to perform his duty. If he should neglect it, his conscience would condemn him, and properly, too.

We infer from the statement of the Statesman that no man's conscience requires him to work on the first day of the week, that no man's conscience requires him to work on any day of the week, and logically that a man's conscience would not be violated if he should not work three days or even seven days in the week. But what sort of a Christian would he be who had such a conscience? Conscience requires a man to provide for himself and for his own family, as well as to observe a certain day of the week.

The same God who gave the commandment to observe the seventh day of the week as the Sabbath gave just as explicit a command for laboring six days, so as to provide for our temporal necessities. With the close times and increasing poverty among the laboring classes, it does not require any argument to show that a man actually needs the entire six days for laboring in which to support his family. If he takes off fifteen or twenty per cent. of his time, as he would have to do in observing an extra day, as a day of enforced idleness, we cannot conceive how his conscience could leave him at ease in the matter. It seems that the Statesman has not well considered this point, for its position that no man's conscience requires him to work six days in the week would certainly indicate an extremely low idea of what a conscientious Christian must be. With a dependent family upon his hands to support, imagine, if you can, his conscience leaving him entirely unmolested on that day that he devotes to idleness, earning nothing whatever, but rather consuming the earnings of the other five days.

It seems remarkable that in an age of Christian enlightenment, any professed follower of the Master, who was ever diligent Himself, and who left ample instruction upon the point of diligence in business and frugal use of every moment of time, could advocate the absurd idea that a man can be a follower of Christ, and his conscience give him no trouble in so grave a matter as wasting quite a considerable portion of time every week, when he needs that very time to support the family dependent upon him. Who can say that this is not a matter of conscience? No wonder the apostle has told us that he that is oblivious to this duty has denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel, no matter what his Christian profession may be.

Man's first duty is to love God and thus keep the first four precepts of the Decalogue, but the command to love and care for fellow-beings is second only to this first command, and conscience requires it.
