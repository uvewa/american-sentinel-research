HAVE CHANGED THEIR MINDS.

The following from the Chicago Tribune, of October 28, illustrates some of the beauties of enforced Sunday rest:

John Williams, No. 245 Sixty-third street, engaged a friend to move his household effects, and at 9 o'clock yesterday morning the work began. When the wagon was partly loaded an Englewood man going to church saw it and made complaint at the police station.

An officer was sent to the house with instructions to the family not to move. When the officer went away the work of loading the wagon continued, and again the police were requested to stop it. The man who owns the wagon said if they would not let him move the family because it was wrong to move on Sunday or do any work, he could not see his way towards unloading the wagon.

The police did not want the street obstructed all night, and the men who wanted to stop the moving did not want to be held responsible for any damage that might fall on the goods if they were left on Sixty-third street until Monday.

That was the status of the case when Police Sergeant Lillie told the man he might move, and at four o'clock in the afternoon, after wrangling all day, the teamster drove off with the goods.

The "law" of Illinois provides that the section prohibiting ordinary labor on Sunday, "shall not be construed to prevent ferrymen from carrying over the water travelers and persons moving their families on the first day of the week." It does not in so many words provide that persons shall be permitted to travel, or that it is lawful for families to move upon that day, but the presumption is that both things may be done, else why permit ferrymen to transport them over the water? It seems that this is the view that is taken of it by the police authorities of Chicago, for they only objected to the loading of the goods. It is simply another illustration of the absurdity of Sunday laws.
