RELIGIOUS LIBERTY—CHURCH AND STATE.

[Chas. Foley, in Patriot Plakaux.]

The word "religion" has such a worldwide meaning, and is used by people to express so great a variety of sentiment and things, that to understand its use in a given instance by any one, it is indispensably necessary to look and enquire outside of the word itself, and to study the person using it, and the circumstances under which used. I doubt whether there is another word in our language in as common use, that requires so much care to get at the meaning of the person using it. When the word religion is used to express a man's highest and noblest conceptions of duty and obligation, then I think we will all agree that all men should carry such religion with them into the shop, the field, into politics, in short, with them wherever they go, and in all they do, whether as private citizens or public servants.

A man's religion, whatever it is, whether exalted or low in conception, is purely an individual matter and can never be otherwise. A State can have no religion, any more than a bank or a railroad can. The maxim of the law books that "a corporation has no soul," is true. A State cannot propagate religion, or oppose its propagation, but it can use its police and military power to propagate and oppose the views and opinions of individuals as to what constitutes religion, its origin, its use and the office it performs in this life, and any life hereafter. A man should not, no man has the right, to carry his religious views into a public office and use political power to advance the ends of his creed or church, or enforce his religious views on others. No one wants the State to assist in the dissemination of religious views with which he is not in harmony, or to oppose his own.

Many Christians claim that Christianity itself is repugnant to all attempts on the part of the State to propagate it, and earnestly oppose the exercise of such power. I have just read a production of Dr. E. T. Hiscox, author, with other works, of the "Baptist Church Directory," a standard work among Baptists. He says:—

The "Baptist position" in respect to the relation of religious and secular affairs, is this: There should be no union of Church and State, but an entire separation between them in all matters pertaining to the administration of religious affairs. They represent two kingdoms, with distinct spheres and diverse functions, which cannot be united without injury to both. The State has no right of authority or of dictation in matters of faith or worship, which are questions of conscience and principle that lie between the individual soul and God. The State is bound to protect its citizens in the free exercise of their religious faith, without harm or hindrance, so long as they do not interfere with the rights of others. Christians should be good citizens, supporting the government which protects them, honoring the rulers and obeying the laws under which they live, so long as such laws are not contrary to the Word of God. The Church should sustain no organic relation to the State, and receive no patronage or support from it, since to do that would imply the right of supervision and dictation by the State. The support of religion belongs to those who profess it, and to allow fellowship and accept patronage from the State never fails to secularize the spirit and to corrupt the purity of the Church. The civil authorities have no right to enforce or demand any form of faith, any manner of worship, nor yet to establish by law or compel the observance of a sabbath, or any religious institution. It has no right to force conformity, or to punish dissent. Baptists today are loyal to their traditions through all the past. What they have demanded, labored for, and suffered to secure, is not toleration, but liberty; liberty in all concerns of conscience and of faith. The enactment of civil laws for the control or the curtailment of religious liberty, or for the infliction of civil penalties for nonconformity and the exercise of religious liberty, is wrong, unjust, contrary to the spirit of the gospel and to the genius of Christianity.

Let it be remembered that history teaches that the religious system that is espoused by any State, is always the system of the strongest and most aggressive religious party in that State, without regard to whether it is right or wrong.
