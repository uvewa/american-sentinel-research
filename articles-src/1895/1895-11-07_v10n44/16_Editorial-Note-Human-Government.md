THE purpose of human government being to preserve human rights, it cannot go beyond that. And that this is the sole purpose for which God ordained civil government among men is evident from the fact that had he ordained it for any other purpose, he would thereby have abdicated the throne of moral sovereignty. Had God permitted men to define and enforce duty toward him, he would by that very act have committed to men not only the custody but the modeling of his law, and moral duty, would then have been whatever government declared it to be; and the varying moral codes adopted by men must in such a case have been not only the rule of human conduct, but the divine rule of the divine judgment.
