In considering our relation to "the powers that be," we must distinguish between the "powers" and the rulers who represent the powers. The "powers" that are "ordained of God" are always right and good; but the rulers are very often decidedly bad. We are always to be subject to the powers, but not to the rulers in the sense of obeying them, when they step outside the limits of the powers. God has not ordained that we should ever be thus subject to that which is evil.
