## Rome Rebukes Protestants.

BY ALLEN MOON.

On Thursday, Oct. 24, the clergy of Baltimore, Maryland, held a meeting for the purpose of discussing their Law and Order crusade, and especially the enforcement of the old Puritan Sunday law, enacted in 1794. The Catholic clergy of the city were invited to attend the meeting. Rev. Father O'Keefe, pastor of St. Francis Catholic church, is reported in the Baltimore American to have replied by letter that "he was not in sympathy with meetings of ministers who undertook to manage civil affairs, as the civil officers were selected for that purpose, and that he believed more good could be accomplished by attending to their spiritual duties." It is a sad comment on the spirit of the times, when the followers of Wesley receive such merited rebuke from a priest of Rome.

It may not come with very good grace from the clergy of a church that has always meddled in civil affairs, for them to reprove the ministers of the Methodist Church for following the example of Rome; but in this country of boasted freedom in religion, as well as freedom from the domination of the Church, it would seem that the Catholic clergy are becoming ashamed to be found in company with ministers who so far forget their sacred calling as to neglect the work of the ministry for the salvation of men, and engage in a crusade for the enforcement of unjust civil enactments.

Every Catholic priest knows from whence the Sunday institution came. He knows that his church, the author of Sunday, is able to secure just the kind of observance in the church that she decrees. And believing that there is no salvation outside the church, he has no confidence in the plan of saving men by a crusade to compel men outside the church to obey one precept of the church, while living in violation of others.

Consistency is on the side of the Catholic priest, who believing in the power of the church to ordain feasts and holy days, devotes his time and energies to convincing men of the divine mission of his church, and leaves the administration of civil affairs to those who are selected for that work.

Would it not be well for Protestant ministers to take this matter home to themselves, and instead of degrading their sacred office by descending to the control of civil legislation, devote every energy to the cause of the Author of our salvation, who said, "Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel," and "Whosoever believeth shall be saved." The Author of the commission under which these men claim to be laboring, wants preaching preachers, instead of law-enforcing preachers. The Lord could have ordained that men should be saved by law if he in his wisdom had seen best.

If these law-enforcing preachers would abandon their crusade and go over to the Catholic Church, they would have congenial company among those who believe in the Sunday institution; and those that do not so believe might have liberty to serve the cause of their Master, the Saviour of men.
