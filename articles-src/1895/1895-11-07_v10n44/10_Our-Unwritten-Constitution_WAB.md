OUR UNWRITTEN CONSTITUTION.

[By Addison Blakely, Ph. D., Lecturer in Political Science and History, University of Chicago.]

The written constitution is a political growth. For centuries of early political history constitutional law was merely a matter of tradition and memory; but repeated struggles for freedom emphasized the value of the pen and ink sketch of what the law was. So we have in history the Magna Charta, the Bill of Rights, the Petition of Right, the Declaration of Independence—all foreshadowing the Federal and State Constitutions of to-day. These fundamental principles of government are what constituted the unwritten constitution of the past, and in accordance with the modern idea of supremacy of fundamental law these old constitutional principles were declared to be of paramount authority.

Magna Charta had scarce been given to the English nation when it was redeclared and the provision added that any decree contrary to the rights therein secured, was void and of no effect. This appears to have been the first great statutory declaration of the nullity of any legal act contrary to fundamental law; it was, however, merely the statutory recognition of an already established constitutional doctrine.

This unwritten constitution was known as the common law,—as distinguished from custom law and statute law,—of the English peoples. It was called common law because it concerned and was common to the whole people. This common law was brought over from England with the colonists and forms the basis of the constitutional rights and liberties of the American people.

"The common law of England," says Judge Cooley, in his "Constitutional Limitations," "consisted of those maxims of freedom, order, enterprise and thrift which had prevailed in the conduct of public affairs, the management of private business, the regulation of the domestic institutions, and the acquisition, control and transfer of property from time immemorial. It was the outgrowth of the habits of thought and action of the people, and was modified gradually and insensibly, from time to time, as those habits became modified, and as civilization advanced, and new inventions introduced new wants and conveniences and new modes of business. Springing from the very nature of the people themselves, and developed in their own experience, it was obviously the body of laws best adapted to their needs, and as they took with them their nature, so also they would take with them these laws wherever they should transfer their domiciles from one country to another.

"To enlogise the common law is no part of our present purpose," continues the jurist. "But, on the whole, the system was the best foundation on which to erect an enduring structure of civil liberty which the world has ever known. It was the peculiar excellence of the common law of England that it recognized the worth, and sought especially to protect the rights and privileges of the individual man. Its maxims were those of a sturdy and independent race, accustomed, in an unusual degree, to freedom of thought and action and to a share in the administration of public affairs; and arbitrary power and uncontrolled authority were not recognized in its principles. Awe surrounded and majesty clothed the king, but the humblest subject might shut the door of his cottage against him, and defend, from intrusion, that privacy which was as sacred as the kingly prerogatives. The system was the opposite of servile; its features implied boldness and independent self-reliance on the part of the people."

American law is full of praise for this great body of law on which our own Constitution is based. "No one who is familiar with the common law of England," declares Justice Miller, of the United States Supreme Court, in his lectures on the Constitution, "can read the Constitution of the United States without observing the great desire of the convention which framed that instrument to make it conform, as far as possible with that law."

And from this ancient source it was that we get the barrier that forever seals with disapproval and illegality any law interfering with religious freedom. The great Justice Mansfield, in stating this principle of law, declared: "Persecution for a sincere, though erroneous conscience, is not to be deduced from reason or the fitness of things [the test of what constitutes the common law]."

Early in the reign of George III., this constitutional principle was asserted in a judicial decision of the House of Lords, as follows: "There is nothing certainly more unreasonable, more inconsistent with the rights of human nature, more contrary to the spirit and precepts of the Christian religion, more iniquitous and unjust, more impolitic, than persecution. It is against natural religion, revealed religion, and sound policy."*

It was already a maxim of the common law five hundred years ago when Europe was deluged with the blood of martyrs. And it is this same constitution now, written and unwritten, that will be the sole protection of the statute-persecuted Christians of Tennessee and elsewhere. When legislatures, public sentiment and officers have no longer any sympathy for the persecuted, the followers of Jesus of Nazareth will have only what protection the Constitution can give. To the Charters of Justice alone can they cling, for all else fails when friends have failed.
