# SOUND POLITICAL PRINCIPLES.

In contrast with the platforms of the various political parties in this State, all of which favor religious legislation, it is worth while to note the following declaration of sound principles made by the committee on address of the Utah Democratic Convention, which assembled at Salt Lake City, Oct. 22, for the purpose of deciding on some plan of action in the matter of the interference of the Mormon Church in the political affairs of the Territory:

We declare the truth to be, that man may worship his Maker as his conscience dictates; that no State or political party has the right to interfere with this great privilege; that man's first allegiance politically is to his country; that no church, ecclesiastical body, or spiritual adviser should encroach upon the political rights of the individual; that in a free country no man or body of men can with safety to the State use the name or the power of any religious sect or society to influence or control the elective franchise; that no citizen, by reason of his association with any church, can be absolved from his duty to the State, either in times of war or times of peace, without the consent of the State; that a trust is imposed upon such citizen in a free country to act politically upon his own judgment and absolutely free from control or dictation, ecclesiastical or otherwise.

We therefore, in solemn manner say that we will not be dictated to, interfered with, or hindered in our political duties by those selected to minister to us the consolations of the gospel.

From this it appears that in a situation where the people of a State or Territory feel called upon to oppose Church interference in political affairs, it is easy for them to see that such interference is altogether wrong, and that every citizen is bound "to act politically upon his own judgment and absolutely free from control or dictation, ecclesiastical or otherwise." But it seems to be quite a different matter where the church that is meddling in politics is one to which they themselves belong, or which they favor, or where the interference is by a combination of the churches capable of wielding vast political power, and having general respect and favor throughout the land.

It is a fact that there is ten times more danger threatening this country from the interference of the various Protestant churches or organizations, in political affairs, than from any action that can be taken by the Mormon Church, simply because the former are ten times more numerous and powerful than the latter, and are but little, if any, behind it in their determination to control politics, within the sphere of their influence, in the interests of church dogmas and institutions.
