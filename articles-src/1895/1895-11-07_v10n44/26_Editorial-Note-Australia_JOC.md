ELDER J. O. CORLISS, well known to many of our readers as a former contributor to the columns of the AMERICAN SENTINEL, sends us a letter from New South Wales, Australia, in which he says:—

We have not yet in this country felt the rigors of persecution as our brethren in the southern States of America have been experiencing it. Two or three arrests have been made here for Sunday work among our brethren, but nothing more has come of these than to make our work a little more prominent. It has served, however, as a reminder to us that the same spirit which goes to such extremes in America, is not dead in this country, and will under certain conditions follow the same course that is being followed there. Already, there is a good deal of quiet work being done by ministers and others to cultivate a Sunday-law sentiment, and little incidents arise here and there to show that this sentiment is being strengthened from week to week. It does not require a very great stretch of the imagination to believe that very soon we shall feel the rod of oppression also in Australia. But I have noticed one thing, that when persecution sets in in any part of the world, the truth prospers more in that place than it ever has before. I expect that the same results will follow the enforcement of Sunday laws in this country.

Elder Corliss certainly does not state the matter any too strongly when he says that "it does not require a very great stretch of the imagination to believe that very soon" they "shall feel the rod of oppression in Australia." The Word of God plainly says that "all the world shall worship the beast;" and it is by keeping Sunday that all the world pays homage to Rome.
