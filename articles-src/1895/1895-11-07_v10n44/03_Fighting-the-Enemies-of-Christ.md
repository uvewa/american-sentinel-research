## FIGHTING THE ENEMIES OF CHRIST.

"The National Citizenship League," says the Union Signal, of Oct. 24, "has issued a call 'To the People of God Everywhere,' setting forth the method and purpose of that organization and summoning the followers of Christ to unite against his enemies. It is signed by a long list of men and women, thinkers and philanthropists, among them Frances E. Willard and Lady Henry Somerset, and appended are letters of indorsement from well-known ministers and educators. The league is non-partisan and non-sectarian, its threefold object being:

1. To reveal Jesus Christ as the Saviour of the nation as well as of the individual.

2. To make Christian principles operative in public affairs.

3. To unite the followers of Christ in consistent, harmonious and aggressive action, not as church members, but as Christian citizens for the following purposes:

(1) To prevent by personal effort the nomination and election of corrupt candidates and the enactment of corrupt laws in city, State and nation.

(2) To secure fidelity on the part of officers intrusted with the execution of the laws.

(3) To exterminate the saloon as the greatest enemy of Christ and humanity.

(4) To preserve the sabbath.

(5) To purify and elevate the elective franchise.

(6) To promote the study of social wrongs and the application of effective remedies.

(7) In general to seek the reign of whatsoever things are true, honest, just, pure, lovely and of good report."

Without questioning the motives of those who have issued this summons to all the followers of Christ, it must still be said that this "call" has a sound not in harmony with the accents of the voice of Christ himself. In the first place, Christ never called his followers to be united against his enemies; for all sinners are the enemies of Christ, yet he himself was never against them, but gave even his life for them.

True, it is political opposition that is here contemplated; but it is no part of the work of Christianity to array the followers of Christ in political parties against his enemies. There is nothing in such antagonism that tends in the direction of love for those enemies or that seeks the salvation of their souls. Its tendency is rather the opposite, as must be evident to every person who takes note of the things said and done by the opposing parties in any political campaign.

It cannot be supposed that the provisions of the gospel itself do not place all Christians in antagonism to all that can properly be antagonized in the pursuance of Christian work. Hence a call to such union at the present time is as superfluous as it is belated.

True Christian antagonism to this world's evil is that antagonism which was manifested in the life of Christ; for he only is a Christian in whom Christ dwells (Gal. 2:20), and Christ is "the same yesterday, and to-day, and forever." He lives in each of his followers now the same life that he lived in the flesh when he walked and taught in Jodea.

If political methods constitute the proper means whereby Christ's followers are to oppose the forces of evil, it is strange indeed that he should not have given his followers a single word of instruction upon this point.

If the ballot,—the instrument chosen by the National Christian Citizenship League for the accomplishment of its aims, is a proper weapon of Christian warfare, St. Paul made a great mistake when he wrote to the Corinthian church, "The weapons of our warfare are not carnal."

The weapons of the Christian's warfare are "mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds; casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ." 2 Cor. 10:4, 5. Why abandon these weapons for one that is immeasurably inferior to them in power,—one which cannot touch the thoughts and imaginations of the heart at all?

Why abandon "the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God" (Eph. 6:17),—that word which "is quick [living] and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing sounder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart" (Ibb. 4:12), in the work of subduing all that is opposed to righteousness, for one of the weapons of ungodliness itself? Is not the sword of the Spirit the most powerful weapon in the universe for this very purpose?

Undoubtedly one great reason for such a fatal error on the part of so many persons of undoubted loyalty of purpose to the cause of Christ, is a failure to discern a great truth of fundamental importance in its relation to the subject of Christian warfare; namely, that the real enemies against whom the Christian wars are not those that he sees around him. In other words, and as the Scripture states it, "We wrestle not against flesh and blood." Eph. 6:12. To make the warfare a battle against flesh and blood, using a carnal weapon, is therefore simply to make sure of utter failures in the real conflict which is being waged with the forces of evil.

The weapon of Christ's warfare was the word of God. "It is written," were his words as he withstood and conquered the great foe that manipulates the evil forces of this world. "We wrestle," says the apostle, "not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places." Eph. 6:12. Then with what weapons shall we fight? Shall we use one which has a place in the armory of the ungodly? Shall we attempt to fight the devil with fire? Or shall we make Christ our example, and employ the weapon that he used?

Every real and permanent reform must touch the heart, the fountain head of the good or evil that is seen in the life. And therefore there can be no reasonable hope of accomplishing any such reform without the instrumentality of that which alone can reach and change the heart,—the word of the living God.

If the time, the effort, and the means now being expended by hundreds of thousands of Christians in the impossible scheme of converting this world and overcoming its confederacy of evil by the use of political weapons, were used to proclaim the "living and powerful" word of God, the result would be immeasurably better for the world, for themselves, and for the cause of Christ.
