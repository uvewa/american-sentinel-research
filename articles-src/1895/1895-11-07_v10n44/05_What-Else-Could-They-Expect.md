# WHAT ELSE COULD THEY EXPECT?

In a sermon in this city on Oct. 27, Rev. F. M. Foster, Reformed Presbyterian, said, as reported in the Sun of the following day:

The political situation in this city is so corrupt that there is absolutely no hope of purifying it by the ballot box. Of the three parties worthy of notice not one of them has sufficient fear of God to stand for the fourth commandment. This witnesses to moral stagnation and death. All the saloon-keeper has to do is to hold on a little longer and he will sweep such anti-Christian, morally nil, forces from the field. It is believed that those who control politics, who make platforms, who name candidates, have already so dishonored the Sabbath, and the God of the Sabbath, as to make it impossible for them to lead to moral victory; and the Republicans are not a whit behind the Democrats in this respect.

Oct. 6, the Lord's day, was spent from before noon to late at night in a great discussion by committees from the Chamber of Commerce, the Good Government, the German-American Reform Union, and the Republican party, trying to get together on a platform and on candidates. A clearer, more unjustifiable, and reprehensible violation of divine law, as embodied in the fourth commandment, will not be seen when the saloons are thrown wide open on that day. If Tammany Hall is a law breaker and should be cast out, such party leaders are law-breakers and deserve the same condemnation.

The God of heaven affirms, "Without me ye can do nothing." If this be true, and it is, these party leaders, having cast off the law of God, cannot expect his blessing to attend their efforts. They can't lead the people to victory. They have shown that their fear of God compares favorably with Fourteenth Street [Tammany Hall]. It is no worse, but it is questionable if it is any better. The God-fearing Christian should refuse to be marshalled under their banner, as they can hope for nothing but defeat.

The platforms adopted by the Fission, the Good Government, and Tammany Hall parties each pledges more liberal excise laws; and furthermore, that those elected shall use their efforts to have the fourth commandment submitted to the desire and will of this metropolic—cast into the den of lions. With such platform it is believed that a Christian cannot stand for election to office; nor can he vote for those who, with "no fear of God before their eyes," are candidates. If he votes, he pledges the man for whom he votes to give a more liberal excise law—to open saloons on the Lord's day. If it was ever doubtful as to what the Christian's duty is, this is not that time.

As Christ warns judges and rulers to fear and serve him, and as our Constitution and Government reject him, all parties calling for the casting off of his law, loyalty to Christ requires of the God-fearing citizen that he refuse to participate in the godless affairs of the godless government until it repent and return to God.

We maintain that loyalty to Christ requires no less than this. If the government will not own that it is under the law of God, and parties put up that law as the price of votes, it is time for the Christian to step aside lest the vengeance of an offended judge engulf him also. If they will not have our God and his law, they cannot have us, for we stand with Christ. No, the Christian cannot vote under present conditions.

What better has Mr. Foster a right to expect? He and all the Sunday preachers have demanded that the government take cognizance of religious questions; and now that such a question has been made the football of contending parties, what right has he or any like him to complain? None whatever.
