According to the Chicago Tribune, of the 28th ult., the Barbers' Mutual Protective Association of that city, is endeavoring to secure the repeal of the ordinance of July 15, closing barber shops on Sunday. The barbers are willing to risk arrest under the State "law," if the city authorities will repeal the ordinance.

A committee first waited upon the mayor, but he informed them that he was powerless to act, as the ordinance made it obligatory upon him to enforce it; he referred them to the Board of Aldermen, to whom they must now look for relief from an oppressive municipal regulation. If we understand the matter correctly, the barbers were the prime movers only a few months since in securing the passage of the ordinance which they now wish repealed.
