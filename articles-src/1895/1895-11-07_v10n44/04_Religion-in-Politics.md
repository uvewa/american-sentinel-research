# RELIGION IN POLITICS.

The various religious organizations which are working to "elevate" politics in our land by consolidating and directing the Christian vote, are nearly always careful to explain in setting forth their purpose and plans, that they seek no union of Church and State. They seem to think, and doubtless with good reason, that without this disclaimer the natural conclusion of their hearers would be that such a union was directly intended.

They do not mean that any person shall vote as a church member, but only as a Christian; hence, they say, no union of Church and State can be the result.

But what constitutes a union of Church and State? As at present commonly understood, and as defined by the societies and leagues for the promotion of "Christian citizenship," it means a union of the State with some one or more church denominations, to the exclusion of others. But if this be the true definition, then there was no union of Church and State in the Dark Ages; for then Rome was the one supreme church, so far as political interests were concerned, and it was all the same whether she instructed her adherents to use their political power and influence as Roman Catholics, or merely as Christians.

The scheme of Christian citizenship which is being elaborated to-day, will present similar conditions. The merely "Christian" vote will be directed by these representatives of the churches as a whole, just as if no divisions in the church had taken place. Thus it will be precisely similar to the state of things that prevailed in Rome's palmy days, before these divisions arose.

But there was in those days a complete union of Church and State, as all Protestants will admit. Probably the reason they can see this so plainly while being unable to see that any such union is in prospect now, is that they look upon Rome's union with the State from the standpoint of opposition to the Church as a whole, which Rome then was; while now, they will themselves be the representatives of the universal "Christian" church, and hence in full harmony with it.

To be sure, there were a few who stood out against Rome even in her best days, standing upon the Word of God and maintaining their allegiance to him; but this fact did not invalidate Rome's claim that she was the universal Christian church any more than the fact that there are now a few who, from the standpoint of God's Word, oppose popular church dogmas and institutions for which State support is sought, invalidates the assumption of the churches to-day to constitute, as a whole, the Christian church.

The truth is, that every attempt to manipulate the "Christian vote" or any other kind of vote so as to secure political support, and through that the sanction of municipal, State or national law to religious dogmas or institutions, is an effort to unite Church and State. And when that purpose is apparent in the work of any religious organization, that organization is really working to unite Church and State, however loudly it may disclaim the fact.
