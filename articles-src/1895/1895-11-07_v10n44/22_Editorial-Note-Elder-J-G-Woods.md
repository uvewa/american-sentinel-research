We have just learned through ex-Senator Wm. P. Tolley, of Rucker, Tenn., of the death, on the 19th ult., of Elder J. G. Woods, of Fayetteville, Tenn. Elder Woods, a Primitive Baptist minister, was a firm friend to the AMERICAN SENTINEL and a fearless advocate of the principles which it advocates. Elder Woods was not known to us personally, but his lifelong friend, Senator Tolley, describes him as "one of the Lord's most faithful followers and a good man in the full sense of the term." He was about seventy-two years of age. Death came suddenly but it had no terrors for such a man.
