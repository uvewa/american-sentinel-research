## DANGER SIGNALS.

[Midland (Mich.) Republican, April 19, 1895.]

A WRITER who has not sufficiently the courage of his convictions to call himself anything else but "M," takes exception to the remarks of the Republican in regard to the danger of putting in the Constitution of the United States a clause naming "Christ as the nation's Sovereign, Lord, and King," and says: "We do not see the 'great world's council' assembled to elect the representative of Christ." This simply proves that "M" does not look into the past, nor open his eyes to the facts of today. It places him in the ranks of those who "having eyes see not." Can he be oblivious to the fact that there is today, on earth, a representative—elected to his office—for whom it is claimed that he should be recognized by all nations as a supreme arbiter? But "M" says:—

Intolerance and persecution in the past had their stronghold, not in belief in Christ or acknowledgment of him, but in the ignorance of the masses. The spread of education renders such bloody scenes as the world has witnessed in the name of religion highly improbable if not quite impossible in this day.

It is because of the value of information and acquaintance with the warnings of history and the signs of the times, and because of the good that an enlightened press may do in sounding these warnings that we have hope. We trust that before the proposition referred to is put to a vote of the States, the intelligence of the people and the "campaign of education" will insure its defeat. Mind that we have not said a word against belief in Christ, nor against trust in God. The proposition does not touch these. These pertain to the individual; but when any man or set of men undertake to rule others in the name of Christ, and invoke the civil law to help them, there will be persecution.

Men are lying in jail today in this "land of the free," simply for obeying the dictates of their own consciences in a matter of religious (Sabbath) observance. They are persecuted in the name and by the authority of the civil law. Referring to these things, no less a person than Dr. Lyman Abbot, in the Outlook, says:—

Let these abuses be ventilated. The sooner we understand whether this is actually a free country, the better it will be for all concerned.

The Examiner and National Baptist, of New York, says:—

In not a few of our States religious liberty is grossly, wickedly, infamously violated through the abuse of what are called the Sunday laws.

The Church Bulletin (Baptist), of Chicago, says:—

Let us be careful how we let in the camel's nose of religious legislation.

The Louisville Courier Journal says:—

People are asking if we are returning to the days of Cotton Mather or the Spanish Inquisition.

But "M" says there is no danger. Let's sleep on while the choir sings. Yet at the very moment a determined and persistent effort is being made to wipe out what constitutional guarantees there are against this dangerous tendency.

The New York World says: "It [the State] has no more right to prescribe the religious observance of sabbaths and holy days, than to order sacraments and ordain creeds." Yet the convention referred to demanded that the "religious observance" mentioned be put in the Constitution, and further demanded the very thing that would lead to the ordaining of creeds,—in fact, demanded that a creed should be put in the Constitution itself!
