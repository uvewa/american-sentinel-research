EUROPE continues to be greatly agitated over the affairs of the Ottoman empire.

Ever since August 11, 1840, at which time the Turkish Sultan surrendered to the great powers of Europe his independence, Turkey has existed as the "sick man of the East." Scores of times it has seemed that the final demise of the Ottoman empire was but a question of days or at most of months.

Not its own vitality but the jealousy of other nations has kept Turkey alive as a political power for more than half a century; but the end has all the while been regarded as inevitable by statesmen everywhere. Sooner or later the Turkish power will be driven from Europe; and it seems as though the Armenian troubles, which have recently startled the world, would certainly be the occasion of the dismemberment of the empire of the Sultan.

That the Turk will be driven from Europe is not only the deliberate judgment of statesmen, but it is a plain prediction of prophecy. Daniel 11:45 says plainly of this power: "He shall plant the tabernacles of his palace between the seas in the glorious holy mountain; yet he shall come to his end, and none shall help him."

Driven from Europe, the Turk will make Jerusalem his capitol, but only temporarily, "he shall come to his end, and none shall help him." But what then? Again, let the Scriptures answer. "At that time shall Michael [Christ] stand up [reign], the great prince which standeth for the children of thy people: and there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time; and at that time thy people shall be delivered, everyone that shall be found written in the book. And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt. And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever." Dan. 12:1-3.

The departure of the Turk from Europe will be one of the last acts in the drama of this world's history.
