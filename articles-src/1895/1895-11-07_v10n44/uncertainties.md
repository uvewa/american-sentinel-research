## OCR Corrections Made

### Page 1
- Line 20: "LEON A. SMITH, | EDITORS." appears to be a table formatting artifact; interpreted as Leon A. Smith being listed as Assistant Editor based on context
- Line 29: "olimbeth" corrected to "climbeth" (clear OCR error in Bunyan quote, page 5)

### Page 2
- Line 114: "Ibb. 4:12" — obvious OCR error for "Heb. 4:12" (Hebrews)

### Page 5
- Line 276: "olimbeth" corrected to "climbeth" (Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress quote)

### Page 7
- Line 491: "SINWER'S" corrected to "SINNER'S"
- Line 492: "REPESTANCE" corrected to "REPENTANCE"
- Line 493: "COMPRESSION" corrected to "CONFESSION"
- Line 493: "CONSIGNATION" corrected to "CONSECRATION"
- Line 495: "DISCIPLINARY" corrected to "DISCIPLESHIP"
- Line 495: "GROWING OF INTO CHRIST" corrected to "GROWING UP INTO CHRIST"

### Page 8
- Line 591: Date header shows "NOVEMBER 7, 1899" but should be "1895" based on volume/issue number and all other context. This appears to be an OCR error; corrected in interpretation.
