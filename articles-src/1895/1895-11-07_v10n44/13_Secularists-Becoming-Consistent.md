## SECULARISTS BECOMING CONSISTENT.

At the fourteenth annual congress of the American Secular Union in 1890, a resolution was adopted demanding the "repeal of all laws enforcing the observance of Sunday as a religious institution rather than an economic one, justified by physiological and other secular reasons."

In commenting upon this demand of the American Secular Union, in the SENTINEL of Oct. 9, 1890, we said: "Sunday is, and always was, a religious institution. It was such in the old pagan world, and it is such now in the 'Christian' world, and we deny the right of the State to require its observance upon any grounds whatever. True, it is regarded as a holiday by many who have no religious regard for it, or indeed for anything else, and they have a perfect right to so use that or any other day, so far as their fellowmen are concerned; but we deny the right of one portion of the community or State to fasten upon the other portion, that is, upon the minority, no matter how small a minority it may be, the observance of Sunday or of any other day, for any reason either religious or otherwise. We do not deny the right of the State to make any day or any number of days legal holidays, leaving the individual citizen free to observe or not to observe such days just as he sees fit, as is now the case with the Fourth of July and other holidays; but to require the observance of such days, or to forbid upon one day, and which are freely permitted upon other days, is an abuse of the power of the State. The American Secular Union should lay the ax to the root of the tree and demand that all laws 'directly or indirectly enforcing the observance of Sunday' upon any pretext, be repealed.

This advice has been followed more than once by the body to which it was given; and its adoption of and adherence to correct principles in this matter gives us ground to hope that some at least of its numbers may yet be led to discriminate fully between the Christianity of Christ and the "Christianity" of the creeds. The SENTINEL labors not to destroy but to build. We would not take from any man the faith that he has without at the same time giving him ground for a better, a nobler, a truer faith.
