# SAVING THE NATION.

One of the aims of the Christian Citizenship League is "to reveal Christ as the Saviour of the nation as well as of the individual."

The terms of that salvation which Christ brought to mankind, stamp such an idea as utterly preposterous. He himself stated them, and said: "Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature; be that believeth and is baptized, shall be saved; but he that believeth not, shall be damned." Mark 16:15, 16.

This shows that the securing of salvation through Christ is wholly an individual matter. No one ever heard of an act of faith that was not individual, or of baptism being administered to anything but individuals.

It shows also that any movement which aims at securing national salvation through Christ, proceeds either in total ignorance or total disregard of the teachings of the Word of God.

The idea is contrary to both revelation and reason. If Christ could save the nation as well as the individual, then he could save sinners in their sins as well as from their sins; since the individual, while not the nation, is an inseparable part of the nation, and failing to secure salvation as an individual, because of his sins, he might secure it as a part of the nation, provided only that the nation secured it!

If there could be such a thing as a Christian nation, in a governmental sense, then that government, if it continued Christian, would be saved through Christ. Hence if this Government be Christian, or can become such, and does not fall from grace, it will be saved in the kingdom of God, and there will be in that kingdom, through all eternity, a "government of the people, by the people, and for the people," founded on the Constitution of the United States!

It needs only this slight elaboration of the idea to show its utter absurdity. How intelligent Christian people can believe in it and work for its realization, is something that passes comprehension.

Salvation through Christ is for individuals only, and any measure which aims at securing that salvation, can be effective only as it applies to individuals. And there will be just that proportion of the nation saved, which is comprised by the aggregate of those individual citizens of it who are truly Christian. But no government now existing upon earth, or that ever has existed since the fall, will be perpetuated in the earth made new.
