## Custom Against Precept.

BY E. J. WAGGONER.

"Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work; but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates: for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day, and hallowed it." Ex. 20:8-11.

Thus reads the fourth commandment. In thousands of churches it is read every Sunday, and all the congregation unite in saying at its close, "Lord . . . incline our hearts to keep this law." And yet it is not kept, because the day which the commandment says must be observed is the seventh day, while people in general keep the first day of the week, a day not mentioned in the commandment, except as included in the "six days" in which work may be done.

It is a fact that the seventh day of the week is the day commonly called Saturday.

It is a fact that the people who heard the words of the law spoken directly to them from Mount Sinai, did observe the seventh day of the week in obedience to that commandment, and to this day still hold that it is the Sabbath, whether they keep it or not.

It is a fact that the Jews in the wilderness, and for centuries thereafter, were under the direct leadership of the Lord himself, the Lord manifesting himself to them, and talking with them and their leaders as he has never done with any other people.

It is also a fact that when they were the most closely connected with the Lord, and his presence among them the most marked, they were the most faithful in their observance of the seventh day.

The fact that the Jews kept the seventh day of the week while the Lord who spoke the fourth commandment was personally conducting them, shows that God meant just what he said, and that the fourth commandment does require the observance of the seventh day of the week, which alone is the true Sabbath of the Lord.

Further, it is a fact that the commandment cannot mean two different things. The words, "The seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God; in it thou shalt not do any work," cannot mean both the seventh day and the first. Neither can they refer to either one of them indifferently. Neither can they mean anything different now from what they did when first spoken and written. If they apply to the first day of the week now, then they must always have meant the same day, and in that case the ancient Jews must have been wrong in their practice, and the Lord must have encouraged them in that wrong.

But such a supposition is impossible. The fact that God specified by daily miracles for forty years, just which day they should observe, shows, as before stated, that the seventh day of the week—Saturday—and that only, is the day which the commandment enjoins.

This being the case, those who hear the commandment read every Sunday should either cease responding, "Lord . . . incline our hearts to keep this law," or else should begin to keep it; for it is certain that the fourth commandment can no more be obeyed by resting on Sunday, than the first commandment can be kept by worshiping Jupiter.

But some one will ask, "Has not the commandment been changed?" We do not find in the Bible any record of a change. If the commandment has been changed, so as to warrant Sunday observance, why is it that the revised law is not read in any of the churches? If people really thought that the commandment had been changed, it would be very strange for them to keep on for years reading the old commandment, which enjoins another day from that which they keep. No; the commandment has not been changed, and nobody really thinks that it has been.

"But surely the day has been changed." Nothing can show the weakness of this position any better than the statements of those who hold to it. Read what the Vicar of Burgh, Lincolnshire, in a tract intended to show the necessity of Sunday observance, says about the matter:

When Christ's life on earth was ended, and he had ascended to heaven, a change was made as to the day which was to be kept holy. . . . Before Christ's coming, the seventh day was kept holy in remembrance of the finished work of creation. After his ascension, the first day was sanctified in remembrance of the completed work of redemption. This change was made by the apostles in obedience to the will of Christ. We are not told of any words of his in which he gave this direction.

Just think of it. It is said that the apostles made the change in obedience to the will of Christ, and yet we nowhere find the words in which he gave the direction, nor even any words of the apostles, in which they intimate that such a direction ever was given! How then do men know that it was given? They do not, and never can know that it was. For no one can know that a thing is so when it is not so; and the fact that there is no record of any such change, is evidence that no such change was ever made. Christ ascended to heaven without saying anything about a change in the day. The apostles all died without ever saying anything about it, or even intimating that Christ ever said a word about it. But some men say that the change was made by the disciples in obedience to the will of the Lord. Let them produce the inspired record before they try to make people believe it.

No; the day remains the same, and will remain unchanged throughout eternity. But the people have changed. The great apostasy began, and the people insensibly drifted away from the standard of Christ and his apostles, under the influence of surrounding paganism. Then the apostasy culminated in the papacy, which thought to change the times and the laws, so that the customs of the people were taken as the standard of right, instead of the Bible. And that is how people now keep Sunday instead of the Sabbath.

But custom cannot make a thing any different from what God has established it "The customs of the people are vain." Jer. 10:3. The traditions of men are the transgression of the commandments of God. This matter of custom against the word of the Lord is strikingly set forth in the following from John Bunyan's famous "dream." Christian was on his journey, when—

He espied two men come tumbling over the wall on the left hand of the narrow way; and they made up apace to him. The name of one was Formalist, and the name of the other was Hypocrite. So, as I said, they drew up to him, who thus entered with them into discourse.

Chris. Gentlemen, whence came you, and whither go you?

Form. and Hyp. We were born in the land of Vain-glory, and we are going for praise to Mount Zion.

Chris. Why came you not in at the gate which standeth at the beginning of the way? Know ye not that it is written, "He that cometh not in by the door, but olimbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber"?

F. and A. They said that to go to the gate for entrance was, by all their countrymen, coupled too far about; and that therefore their usual way was to make a short cut of it, and to climb over the wall as they had done.

Chris. But will it not be counted a trespass against the Lord of the city whither we are bound, thus to violate his revealed will?

F. and H. They told him that as for that he need not trouble his head thereabout; for what they did they had custom for, and could produce, if need were, testimony that could witness it for more than a thousand years.

Chris. "But," said Christian, "will it stand a trial at law?"

F. and H. They told that custom, it being of so long standing as above a thousand years, would doubtless now be admitted as a thing legal by an impartial judge. "And besides," said they, "if we get into the way, what matter is it which way we may get in? If we are in, we are in: thou art but in the way, who, as we perceive, came in at the gate; and we are also in the way, that came tumbling over the wall; wherein now is thy condition better than ours?"

Chris. I walk by the rule of my Master; you walk by the rude working of your own famous You are counted thieves already by the Lord of the way. You came in by yourselves without his directions, and shall go out by yourselves without his mercy.

To those who plead "custom" as a sufficient reason for keeping Sunday instead of the Sabbath, let me ask, "Will it stand a trial at law?"
