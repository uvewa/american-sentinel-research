THE Herald and Presbyter, of October 9, says of Seventh-day Adventists:—

In more than one quiet community they have courted martyrdom, not by observing Saturday as the Sabbath, as they have a right to do, nor by working quietly on Sunday, but by doing this as noisily and ostentatiously as possible and interfering with the peace and quiet to which the community has a right.

A more grossly false statement could scarcely be made. In not one of the scores of cases of the prosecution of Seventh-day Adventists, tried in more than half a dozen different States, has anything of this kind been true.

The writer has personally heard the evidence in more than a score of such cases, and in not one of them has there been one particle of evidence to sustain the charge made by the Herald and Presbyter.

In a letter to Governor Turney, of Tennessee, under date of April 8, 1895, Judge Jas. G. Parks, before whom probably twenty such cases have been tried, said: "There was no aggravation shown in a single case. It is true they did some work on Sunday, but it was done in a quiet way, and without any studied effort on their part to attract public attention. In fact, the proof rather tended to show that they tried to do their work in such a way as not to attract public attention."

It is possible that there have been isolated cases in which Seventh-day Adventists have forgotten the Golden Rule in the matter of Sunday work, but we know of no such case.

In view of all the facts we feel that it is incumbent upon the Herald and Presbyter either to retract its bitter and sweeping charge or else to cite facts and circumstances in support of it.
