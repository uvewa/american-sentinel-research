You take the secular newspapers of our country, and nine out of every ten denounce this religious persecution, or committing Seventh-day Adventists to jail for working on Sunday; but not so with the religious papers; they are almost a unit in defending these persecutors. Why is it so? Have professed Christians lost the love of the Master? Is it not because they have no Scripture to sustain their institutions, and they must be sustained if they have to appeal to the civil law. Are they the willing instruments of Satan to make war on the remnant of the Church? Rev. 12:18.—The Standard, Toronto, S. D., Dec. 27, 1894.
