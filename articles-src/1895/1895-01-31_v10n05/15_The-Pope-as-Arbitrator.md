CAIRO, Jan. 14, 1895.—The native journal Al Mokattam publishes the following: "The sultan recently asked the pope to arbitrate the Armenian question, and his holiness sent to Constantinople a delegate, who proposed that the powers intervene, and intimated it would be necessary to get practical guarantees that the desired governmental reforms be carried out. The pope purposes to make representations to Europe that the troubles in Armenia arose not from religious animosity but from bad government."—New York Herald, Jan. 16, 1895.
