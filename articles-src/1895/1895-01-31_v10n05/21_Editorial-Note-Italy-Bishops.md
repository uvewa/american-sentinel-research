THE following significant paragraph appeared in the Catholic Review of Jan. 26:—

Six more bishops in Italy have been granted the royal exequator that entitles them to receive their official income—the bishops of Carpi, Pozzuoli, Penafro, Lucera, Anglona, and Nusco. The government does not fear religion now; it seeks the strength of the church against revolution. It cannot conquer the turbulence it bred.

This means that the government of Italy has given these bishops the right to tax the people in their districts for the support of the Catholic Church. And the last two sentences explain how the church won the victory, and it is the great international scheme of the papacy to secure universal dominion. First, teach her people that the government that refuses to acknowledge the pope is unstable and must sooner or later end in "turbulence" and "revolution;" and when this teaching bears fruit, then she offers to conquer the turbulence in exchange for political support.
