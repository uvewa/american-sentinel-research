IN a communication just received from A. N. Brown, editor of the Dayton Leader, of Tennessee, and author of the editorial which appears in another column under the title, "Courageous Words," the editor expresses these manly sentiments:—

My position on this question has cost me the support of a few ardent Sabbaturians [compulsory Sunday observance advocates], but in all matters I consult my own conscience and my sense of duty to my fellowmen and my country, and let the results take care of themselves.

These sentiments are so much in contrast with the truckling, time-serving policy that actuates so many to-day, that we print them and call upon the people to say, Amen.
