Our Saviour said to the Scribes and Pharisees, who were once the favored people of God:—

Wherefore, behold, I send unto you prophets, and wise men, and scribes: and some of them ye shall kill and crucify; and some of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues, and persecute them from city to city, that upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel unto the blood of Zacharias, son of Barachias, whom ye slew between the temple and the altar. Verily I say unto you, All these things shall come upon this generation.

Now, I want to show why that generation—the Scribes and Pharisees, who fasted twice a week, paid tithes of all they possessed, even of the mint and anise and all herbs—were guilty of the blood of the innocent souls who suffered martyrdom from righteous Abel down to Zacharias, whom they slew between the temple and the altar.

In Matt. 23:30, we read that they acknowledged themselves to be the children of those who slew the prophets. Don't forget this, for we will have occasion to refer to it again. Let us first learn a lesson from the unbelief of these very people who said, "If we had been in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets." While uttering these words, they had murder in their hearts; and although they appeared very pious outwardly, yet they were full of hypocrisy and of all uncleanness.

Please to read the whole of this chapter, Matt. 23, and note the power of unbelief upon those who are overcome by it, and refuse to walk in the light. "Fill ye up," says Jesus, "the measure of your fathers." You confess that you are the children of those who murdered the prophets. They measured out to the true prophets nothing but hatred, torture, and death; and now it is left for them to fill up that measure. Unbelief had blinded their minds to that extent that they thought they were doing God's will while killing his faithful servants.

Now, let me appeal to those who profess to be Protestants. How did you come by that name? Do you answer, We received it from our forefathers. Yes, so you did. But why were they called Protestants? You answer, Because they protested against the false doctrines and wicked acts of the Roman Catholic Church. Well, did Protestants in those days have any fellowship with the Roman Catholic Church? Oh no, you say, they could not, because they believed Rome to be anti-christ, and because of her spirit of malice, hatred, and murder that she had toward all who protested against her.

Now, I want all to think seriously before answering the following questions.

Has the Roman Catholic Church ever come forward and confessed her errors and her sins committed against the innocent people of God who passed through untold sufferings in past ages? Does she not yet claim infallibility? Does she not say, The Roman Catholic Church never has erred, and never can err? Has not her record for a thousand years been written in the blood of the saints? Does she not still claim she is not bound to keep faith with heretics?

No true Protestant will hesitate to answer all these questions in the affirmative. Now then, if that be so, and if God called Martin Luther and other Reformers to expose the false doctrines and unchristian acts of that apostate church,—I say if God was in the Reformation, what shall we say about the Protestants of our own days who are reaching out to cheap the hand of the Roman Catholic Church, and even going so far as to call her mother, and invite her priests to preach to Protestant theological students! In doing this, do they not just as surely become partakers of her sins, and are they not filling up the golden cup that is in the hand of the woman of Rev. 17:4? And when the apostate daughters heed the call of their mother to come back to her arms, and when this world-wide confederacy is made (see Isa. 8:12; Rev. 16:13), then will not the cup of Rome be full, and will not her sins have reached unto heaven?

Protestants then, in uniting with that power, virtually acknowledge themselves to be the children of those who have killed God's people in the past, because, by approving Rome now, they set the seal of their approval upon all her past history, which she does not repudiate, but defends.

"Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues." Rev. 18:4. And if you know not where to find the true people of God, as a body, turn and read carefully and prayerfully, the description of their character, found in Rev. 12:17, also Rev. 14:12, and go and do thou likewise, that you may finally be among those who will have a right to the tree of life, and enter in through the gates into the city. Rev. 22:14.

W. H. WILD.
