# Uncertainties Log - American Sentinel v10n05 (1895-01-31)

## OCR Corrections Made

### Page 1, Line 19
- **OCR read:** "BORD STREET"
- **Corrected to:** "BOND STREET"
- **Confidence:** HIGH
- **Reason:** Known address of the American Sentinel office; "BOND" is correct

### Page 1, Line 23
- **OCR read:** "A. F. BALLINGER"
- **Corrected to:** "A. F. BALLENGER"
- **Confidence:** HIGH
- **Reason:** Known editor name; consistent with other issues

### Page 2, Line 70
- **OCR read:** "forma"
- **Corrected to:** "forms"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM
- **Reason:** Context suggests "forms" but OCR clearly shows "forma" - may be archaic plural or OCR error

### Page 3, Line 188
- **OCR read:** "Jan. 10, 1895"
- **Note:** This appears to be an error in the original - the date should be "Jan. 19, 1829" based on context (Senate Committee report)
- **Action taken:** Retained as printed in original
- **Confidence:** LOW - likely printer's error in original

### Page 4, Line 230
- **OCR read:** "Sunday" (in phrase "plucking those ears of corn on Sunday")
- **Note:** The biblical account (Mark 2:23-28) refers to the Sabbath (Saturday), not Sunday
- **Action taken:** Retained as printed; this is the Dayton Leader's editorial error, not an OCR issue
- **Confidence:** HIGH that this is what the original printed

### Page 5, Line 251
- **OCR read:** "M., chap. II."
- **Note:** This appears to be a truncated or corrupted citation
- **Action taken:** Retained as OCR'd; context unclear
- **Confidence:** LOW

### Page 7, Line 482-488
- **OCR highly garbled:** Advertisement section
- **Note:** This appears to be a patent/building advertisement with severe OCR corruption
- **Action taken:** Retained as OCR'd since it's an advertisement (not substantive content)
- **Confidence:** LOW - advertisement text is heavily corrupted but not critical to transcribe

## General Notes

- Some hyphenated words at line breaks were joined (e.g., "to-day" consistently appears)
- Archaic spellings preserved: "to-day", "connexion" (though "connexion" did not appear in this issue)
- All obvious OCR errors in substantive text were corrected
- Advertisement sections show significant OCR degradation but were not prioritized for correction
