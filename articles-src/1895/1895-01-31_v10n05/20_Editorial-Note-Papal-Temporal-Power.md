THE Catholic Review of January 19 publishes a call for the organization of an association in the United States whose object shall be to create sentiment for the restoration of the pope to temporal power. Similar associations are organizing in the leading countries of the world, and the organization in the United States is a part of an international movement.

How this association is to work in America for the restoration of Rome and the papal states to the control of the pope, is explained in a work first published in England but afterward published by Catholic houses in New York, Boston and Montreal.

In explaining why citizens of a foreign country should work to make the pope the civil governor of Rome, the author says:—

Suppose it be said, "I acknowledge the spiritual authority of the Holy Father; but why am I, an Englishman [or American, we may add], to come forward in a political way, to use all my exertions to protect the temporal rights of a foreign prince?" My answer at once is plain. The pope is not a foreign prince to any Christian, to any human being!

And now let Americans understand that this new organization proposes "in a political way" to use all its exertions to make Pope Leo XIII. political ruler of Rome, the United States and the world.
