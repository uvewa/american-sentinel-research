The New York Presbytery has passed resolutions commending and applauding the course and methods of Dr. Parkhurst, with the single opposing vote of the Rev. Dr. Mullally. It has thus decided and proclaimed that detective proceedings are within the province and consistent with the function of a Christian minister, in which character and capacity alone the Presbytery can properly regard him.

Of course, the settlement of such a question is the Presbytery's own affair. It is free to decide for itself the range of the duties incumbent on a Presbyterian minister, as such, and it has decided, with the emphasis of almost complete unanimity, that among them is the visiting of houses of ill-fame in the disguise of a detective. As the Westminster Confession restricts it to the consideration of ecclesiastical matters purely, this decision makes such a performance rightfully appertain to the office of a Christian minister; and therefore it establishes a new standard of proper, becoming, and obligatory ministerial conduct.

That such was the sentiment and the intention of the Presbytery in passing resolutions laudatory of Dr. Parkhurst's visits to houses of ill-fame in the disguise of an old reprobate from the West, was indicated by the loud applause with which that serious body received the declaration of the Rev. Dr. Field that "Dr. Parkhurst never fulfilled his duties so well" as when he made such visits under the cover of darkness and that deceitful disguise. The decision was made, too, after the subject had been under special consideration by the members of the Presbytery for a month, and after the objection to it as the establishment of a dangerous precedent, which was presented by Dr. Mullally, had been carefully weighed and fully discussed. It expresses, therefore, the matured judgment of these ministers and elders.

The decision as expressed in the resolutions passed, with the single dissenting voice of Dr. Mullally, is, particularly, that in disguising himself and visiting houses of ill-fame the Rev. Dr. Parkhurst proceeded in strict accordance with the spirit and teaching of "the Gospel of Christ as the supreme remedy for every form of evil, and the Church of Christ as the agency by which the world is to be regenerated and saved." It is that by such methods "the moral teachings of Christ must be applied to every sphere of life," and that consequently "the Church should," by justifying and applauding them, "bear her testimony for righteousness and purity in all human affairs." Parkhurst's example, moreover, is especially commended to "the Christian young men of the city," as tending to arouse them to "a realizing sense of their moral and religious duties as citizens," "binding them together in efforts for the purification of our civil and social life." Incidentally, therefore, the course of the minister in taking along with him in his nocturnal prowlings a pink-faced young man of his church to witness "circuses" got up at his provocation and expense, and to carouse and dance with naked harlots, is held up for youthful admiration as "noble," "faithful," and "heroic." The members of the Presbytery "rejoice" in it, express "gratitude" to Dr. Parkhurst because of it, and contemplate the proceeding with "pride."

It is very desirable that the public should know exactly the moral standard of the Presbyterian Church, so that everybody may be able to determine whether it suits him and whether he wishes his children brought up according to it. The religious belief of the New York Presbytery is not definable in this radical variation from the Westminster Confession, and hence whoever likes its moral standard, now so precisely established, is eligible for admittance to its churches without regard to his doctrinal opinions. The existence of a large number of disreputable houses in town indicates that this Presbyterian moral standard will not fail for support, and many people may be attracted to a church which makes deceit a virtue and moral uncleanness beautiful and spotless purity, so long as they are practiced in a truly religious spirit. All people who think differently and who feel it incumbent on them to live and to teach their children by precept and example to live decently, honorably, and in obedience to principle never compromising with evil under the false pretence that the end justifies the use of vicious means, are of course out of place in a church which formally and officially, by its representative Presbytery, holds up for them as their exemplar a minister who went about in disguise and in company with a young man of his flock, visiting and inciting and paying for exhibitions of naked harlots, "for the purification of our civil and social life."—N.
