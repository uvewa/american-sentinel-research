"THERE is a way that seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death." Prov. 16:25. Many a man has walked in a way that seemed to him right, but he has found or will finally find that the end of that way is destruction. The Apostle Paul was very zealous in the persecution of the Church of God, and that seemed right to him. Satan blinded him with zeal, and made him believe it was right to destroy those who walked contrary to his views. Paul thought he was doing God service, but there came a time in his experience when he found he was walking in the wrong path—the path that leads to everlasting destruction.

When the Jews persecuted the divine Son of God, they thought they were doing right; that way seemed right to them. But Jesus did not do as some zealots are doing to-day, that is, employ governmental force to turn their hearts to God.

When hanging on the cross he prayed to his Father for them in the words: "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do." This is Christ's Spirit, and he has promised to give his Spirit to all who accept him. That Spirit will lead us to acts of benevolence, acts of love,—praying for all those who offend and grieve us by their evil ways.

Now, is it right to persecute those who, to our minds, are walking contrary to the Word of God? If so, did the Jews do right when they put the Son of God to death? Did Paul do right when he persecuted the Church in his day? Or did the Catholic Church do right in persecuting the Church of God in the Dark Ages? Of course there is not a Protestant who will say that any of these did right. The Catholics will say that they did right to persecute "heretics," because it seems right to them. And will Protestants, who are persecuting seventh-day observers to-day, in the face of this, say that they are doing God service by their action? They emphatically declare that the Catholics had no right to persecute Protestants in the past. Have Protestants any more right to persecute others than the Catholics had to persecute them? Satan has blinded them as he did Saul of Tarsus, and as he has every one and every system that persecuted the followers of God.

In the face of this persecution, the Protestant churches are calling for Christian unity. Can there possibly be true Christian unity among all professed Christians, while some are persecuting others? The child of God does not persecute his fellowmen; he follows the Golden Rule, leaving every man free to serve God as he chooses. This is the Spirit of Christ. "Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his."

ALFRED MALLETT.
