H. L. WAYLAND presented (in the Philadelphia Ministers' Union) the following:

Resolved, That we request the Pennsylvania legislature to enact such a law as shall prevent the violation of religious liberty in the person of citizens who, having conscientiously observed Saturday as a day of rest and worship, engage on the first day of the week in quiet labor not interfering with the worship of their fellow-citizens.

The resolution was adopted, after a discussion, in which the mover, Drs. Walker, Chase, Spratt, Rev. Messrs. McDanel, Minney and Vedder took part.—Examiner (Baptist), Jan. 24, 1895.
