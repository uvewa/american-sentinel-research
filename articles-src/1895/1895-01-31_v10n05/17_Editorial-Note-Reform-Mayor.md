THE reform Mayor of New York has declared in favor of repealing or modifying the law closing saloons on Sunday. The New York Legislature has been asked to pass a bill embodying these views. A large majority of the ministers of the city and State are scandalized by this proposition and the cry is, "on to Albany." We shall now be able to test the strength of the Sunday-closing sentiment in New York.
