"Lo, this only have I found, that God hath made man upright; but they have sought out many inventions." Eccl. 7:29. When our first parents came forth from the hand of their Maker, they were in harmony with correct principles and perfect in every particular. They were instructed in the ways of righteousness and informed as to the result of disobedience (Gen. 2:16, 17), then left perfectly free to choose for themselves a course of action.

Instead of free moral agents God might have made them mere machines without accountability, incapable of sinning, in which case progress and development of character would have been an impossibility; or, adopting the methods of the Sunday-law champions, he might have forced them into obedience to his will. But this never has been, and never will be, the divine plan, for the service of love is alone acceptable to God, therefore "the allegiance of his creatures must rest upon a conviction of his justice and benevolence."

When Adam and Eve withdrew their faith from their Creator and placed it in the serpent, they transgressed the divine law and their natures became evil and in perfect harmony with Satan. And as natural law decreed that the herb and tree should bring forth "after his kind," and the cattle and every creeping thing "after his kind," so man, in his fallen condition, could bring forth offspring only "after his kind." "Wherefore as by one man sin entered into the world and death by sin, so death passed upon all men for that all have sinned."

The natural condition of the whole human race is plainly set forth in Rom. 3: 10-19, and fallen men are described by the prophet Isaiah in these words: "But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away." Our works are in Scripture, termed, "works of the flesh," and are enumerated in Gal. 5:19-21, some of which are, adultery, idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, etc., and the text adds, "They which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God." Man is therefore a curse to himself as well as to others when left to himself. Not only is this the natural state of man, but he is also unable to liberate himself from this sad condition; for "the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; and these are contrary the one to the other; so that ye cannot do the things that ye would."

Thus unaided man's case was hopeless, and had not God interfered in man's behalf, Satan and man would have formed an alliance against heaven; "But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us," declares to Satan, "I will put enmity between thee and the woman." This enmity is not natural to us. It is only the result of the Spirit of Christ striving with us. This Spirit works with every soul seeking to draw it back to God; and every good trait manifested and every good act performed even by men who leave God out of their reckoning, are due wholly to its influence. No other agency can change our nature. Jesus says: "Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God." Again, "Without me ye can do nothing."

Our every effort to reform without Christ will be futile. This is why he is called "Saviour." We may observe with rigorous exactness every form and ceremony, and outwardly comply with every religious dogma as did the Jews, with hearts of stone, and omit "the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith." Our work is to seek the Lord by faith, "For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God."

The foregoing truths are taught throughout the Bible so plainly that "wayfaring men, though fools," need not err therein. Yet to-day large numbers, led by so-called "reverend" gentlemen and "doctors of divinity" who are themselves sons of the fallen Adam; who are themselves sinners; whose own salvation depends wholly upon the grace of God through faith in Christ; who, while professing reverence for the Word which says: "The servant of the Lord must not drive; but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient, in mechness instructing those that oppose themselves" (2 Tim. 2:34, 25), are binding themselves into the bundles referred to in Matt. 13: 30, forming confederacies under such titles as "The National Reform Association," "The American Sabbath Union," "The Pennsylvania Sabbath Association," etc., for the sole purpose of forcing an outward mock observance of religious dogmas by those who have no faith in them. But the disease being one of the heart, their external applications, fines and imprisonment, cannot reach it. These remedies, like the nauseous nostrums of the quack, are administered only to the symptoms, and the disease is aggravated.

The whole movement is comprehended and condemned in Isa. 8:9-13, "Say ye not, A confederacy, to all them to whom this people shall say, A confederacy; neither fear ye their fear, nor be afraid. Sanctify the Lord of hosts himself; and let him be your fear, and let him be your dread."

Surely the condition brought to view in Isa. 60: 2, "Darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the people," is now developed. And so dense is this darkness that these deluded creatures are attempting to force the observance of the first day of the week—the papal Sabbath—upon the people, when the Bible plainly says, "The seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God."

The Lord's command to his servants at this time is, "Cry aloud, spare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and shew my people their transgressions, and the house of Jacob their sins." Isa. 58:1. And this is the solemn and important work in which the SENTINEL is now engaged.
