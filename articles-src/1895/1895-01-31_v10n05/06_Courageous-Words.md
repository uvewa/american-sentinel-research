UNDER the heading, "That Grand Jury," the Dayton Leader, of Dayton, Tenn., speaks thus of the indictment of Seventh-day Adventists by the Grand Jury of Rhea County:—

A more or less esteemed critic asserts that it is because of its sympathy for the Seventh-day Adventists that the Leader protests against the indictment mania with which the November grand jury was afflicted. Our more or less esteemed critic is partially correct, but he does not go far enough.

The Leader has the utmost sympathy for any men who are persecuted by the courts because of their religion, or to gratify private spite. The Seventh-day Adventists are as sincere in their religious faith as those who differ from them are in their creeds; they are industrious, useful citizens who enjoy the esteem and friendship of their neighbors of other doctrines, and there is no other class of people in Tennessee who evince a more law-abiding spirit in precept and practice outside of this Sunday non-observance feature of their religion. In this free country, where religious liberty is a fundamental principle of our Government, it is too late in the day to commence persecuting people because of their religious faith.

But that pure and immaculate Sunday champion, Wright Bains, and the grand jury who gratified his private-spite, allege that the indictments against the Seventh-day Adventists were found because of their violation of the Sunday law, and not on account of their religion. It is unfortunate that the facts do not sustain this view of the subject. If the grand jury was actuated with only zealous regard for the violated Sabbath law, why did they go all the way to Graysville, five miles away, to find about twenty indictments against Seventh-day Adventists, when they could have found over five hundred men right here in Dayton who labor every Sunday as hard as they do any other day in the week. These five hundred employees of the Dayton Coal and Iron Co., who are not Seventh-day Adventists, were not molested because of their Sunday lawlessness, while the Adventists down at Graysville must answer to a score of indictments for Sabbath-breaking. And the grand jury cannot excuse itself on the plea that its man, Wright Bains, did not act as guardian angel of the Dayton Sabbath, because every man on the grand jury knew that the company's men work every Sunday, and the jury could have summoned witnesses to testify on that point. It would have been an easy matter to secure proof to find a cord of indictments against Mr. Jamme and his employes. Now, why did the grand jury evince such partiality? There can be but one answer. The Seventh-day Adventists were persecuted—or, indicted, if you please—simply because of their religion; and it furnishes the most disgraceful exhibition of grand jury partiality and religious intolerance ever displayed in Rhea County.

Why, the Leader will bet Henry Clay Evans' chances of being governor of Tennessee against the halo of glory that glows around the Sabbath-defending head of Wright Bains, that every last mother's son of those thirteen grand jurymen violate the Sunday observance law, either in spirit or letter, fifty-two times in the year, at least. This blue law business can be carried too far. The Leader believes that when the Saviour roasted the Wright Rainees of ancient Palestine and proclaimed that "the Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath," he knew what he was talking about. But, if our November grand jury had lived in Juba at that time, doubtless they would have indicted the Saviour and his disciples for plucking those ears of corn on Sunday,¹ just to gratify the malice of some Pharisalic Wright Bains.

But, aside from the Seventh-day Adventists who were made the victims of grand jury religious intolerance, the Leader has the utmost sympathy for the large number of others who were indicted on the most frivolous protests to gratify personal malice. In these hard times it is both cruel and inhuman to put poor people to unnecessary expense in defending themselves from malicious and uncalled-for private spite inferences, found on the most flimsy grounds, and it is nothing short of an infamous outrage to make our county and our courts parties to such monstrous injustice.

Here is another evidence of what the SENTINEL has repeatedly stated, i.e., that the persecution of seventh-day observers in Tennessee is condemned by many influential citizens of the State.
