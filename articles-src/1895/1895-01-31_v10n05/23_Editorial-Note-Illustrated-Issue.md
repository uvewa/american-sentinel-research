OUR illustrated issue of January 17th, is approaching the one hundred thousand mark, and the end is not yet. As a sample of the support we are receiving from nearly every state in the Union, we quote from a letter sent out by the Secretary of the Illinois Tract Society, to local societies in Illinois:—

You can do effective work with this paper for a month or more to come; but do not wait. Order at once a good supply and work the country and towns for and near with the paper. Let us take hold in such a way, that for once, the publishers will be completely bewildered to fill our orders. Let us show them that our ideas of circulation are larger than their ideas of publication. Shall it be 25,000 copies for Illinois?

It is hardly necessary to say that the SENTINEL appreciates the loyal and faithful support it is receiving. However, we have taken warning from the zeal of our friends and will promise to furnish all the SENTINELS of January 17 that they will order, but let them order at once.
