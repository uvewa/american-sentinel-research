A YOUNG ARMENIAN IN DISGRACE THROUGH A SCRIPTURAL PASSAGE.

WASHINGTON, Dec. 20.—The Rev. Z. T. Sweeney, of Columbus, Ind., who was Consul-General to the Ottoman Empire during President Harrison's administration, came here to-day bearing a petition representing 300,000 Christian women and the Christian Women's Board of Missions, praying the Sultan for the release of Sahag Mahdissian, an Armenian life exile at Moorzouk, in the Oasis of Fezzan, in the Desert of the Sahara. Mr. Sweeney presented the petition yesterday to the Secretary of State.

Seven years ago Mr. Sweeney translated a passage from the Scriptures about the Kingdom of Christ for Sahag. The Turkish officials concluded it meant the overthrow of the Ottoman Empire. The young man was convicted of conspiracy and sentenced to life exile in Africa.—Morning Advertiser, Dec. 20, 1894.
