# Uncertainties Log - v10n02 (1895-01-10)

## OCR Corrections Made

### Page 1, Line 19
- **Transcribed as:** "No. 43 BOND STREET"
- **OCR had:** "No. 43 BORD STREET"
- **Confidence:** HIGH
- **Reason:** Standard address format; "BORD" is not a word; BOND STREET is the correct address as seen in other issues

### Page 5, Line 277
- **Transcribed as:** "Monsignor Satolli"
- **OCR had:** Consistent throughout
- **Confidence:** HIGH
- **Reason:** Known historical figure, papal delegate to United States

### Page 7, Line 501
- **Transcribed as:** "PRISON LIGHT, 40 Green Street, Bratt' Surro, Vt."
- **OCR had:** "Bratt' Surro"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM
- **Reason:** Likely "Brattleboro, Vt." but OCR shows truncated/garbled text - preserved as shown in OCR

### Page 7, Line 509
- **Transcribed as:** "Reperceance" [appears to be table formatting error]
- **OCR had:** "Reperceance"
- **Confidence:** LOW
- **Reason:** Should likely be "Repentance" but preserved OCR rendering due to unclear table structure

### General Note
- Author initials were preserved exactly as they appeared
- No author initials were detected at the end of most editorial articles, correctly categorized as "editorial"
- Article by E. E. Franke had explicit signature at end
- Article by S. B. Whitney had explicit signature
- Article by G. B. Thompson had explicit location and signature
- Alexander Campbell reprint clearly identified as historical reprint from 1821

## No Second Pass Required
All text was clearly legible in the OCR output. No obscured or uncertain readings requiring additional review.
