Rome dreads true Protestants, however few in number. She could not endure the Waldenses, though few and hidden by the rugged Alps. They were a Mordecai in the gate, and refusing to bow to papal dogma they were tortured and burned.

Rome sees in Seventh-day Adventists a Mordecai in the gate. Consistent Protestants are dreaded by the papacy as much now as of old; hence "Father" Elliott, whom the papacy has sent out to gather up the fragments of collapsed Protestantism, has come in contact with this people whom the Catholic Mirror terms the only consistent Protestants, and in writing of his experience with them in Michigan in the August number of the Catholic World, says: "The sect is the most venomous enemy of Catholicity in these parts." "Seventh-day Adventists . . . are making a propaganda of much energy—and not without results." Again he terms them "the narrowest of sects, shown by their literature to be the most bitterly anti-Catholic," and concludes by saying, "I thank God that 'consistent Protestantism' is narrowing down into this concentrated essence of bigotry." Again, writing from Ohio, in the December number of the Catholic World, he says: "These new sectarians are making converts in many places full of deadly hatred of the Catholic Church." "In the question box our only abundant matter was furnished by the Seventh-day Adventists." "I dread their fanaticism."

Thank God that there is a remnant of consistent Protestantism which the papacy dreads. But what a responsibility rests upon this remnant before God and the world!
