In the latest issue of *Le Christianisme*, Pasteur E. Borel-Brun, of the Evangelical Society of France, describes a visit recently paid to Arpajon, a village near Aurillac, Cantal, on the occasion of the festival of the patron saint. According to custom there was at each celebration of the mass a "renage," or sale of prayers, at fifty centimes per pound! An abbe went through the pews of the crowded church, carrying a plate, and as money was placed upon it, he cried, "M———one pound. Mdme———two pounds; money paid." The priest seated in the pulpit repeated the words aloud, and from time to time announced the ever-growing total of the pounds of prayers, and the money paid in purchasing them. Another priest, seated at the foot of the pulpit, duly made a note of the names and the orders. M. Borel-Brun concludes his article:—"In the third century of our era, Arpajon was Roman; afterwards it became pagan. What progress have we made since?"—*The London Christian, Oct. 4, 1894*.
