In the great Arian controversy of the fourth century when the "powers that be" were trying to settle forever what mankind should believe in the realm of things religious, they debated long and fiercely as to whether Christ was of the same substance with his Father or of like substance. And thus it will ever be, so long as the civil powers meddle with religious matters. While the courts of America are being called upon to determine whether or not man has an immortal soul, the judiciary of these regions of the earth are being called upon to decide some perplexing questions as to what is sacred, and what is not.

The most recent of these which has come to our notice occurred in Johannesburg, South African republic. At the last session of the Volksraad, they revised the Sunday law somewhat. Recently, Mr. Ernest Searelle, who, some time ago, created a great stir in Cape Town, by giving what he termed a "sacred concert" on Sunday, did the same in Johannesburg. He was arrested for violating the Sunday law, and arraigned before the Landrost. It appears that the question to be settled was whether or not the concert was sacred or profane, and whether the songs sung were sacred or otherwise. One of the lady singers said that on the evening in question she sang, "There She Goes," and "Phoebe Darling," and an ex-organist of St. Mary's Church was called in to give expert evidence as to whether the songs were sacred or secular. He said that the music might be either sacred or secular. If played slowly it would be sacred, if fast, secular. He then further added to their perplexity by saying that in the fifteenth century French church-goers sung street songs to Gregorian tunes. Though in summing up he thought that "Phoebe Darling" might be considered sacred. When pressed to tell why he would not consider "There She Goes" sacred, he said, "On the face of it it hardly looks like it." Another singer admitted that she had sung "Good Old Zachariah." She held that the words were sacred, but that the music, perhaps, was not. Some songs, she said, which were sung on other days, were omitted entirely on Sundays, and in others, little words that they dare not use on Sundays, were left out. That is to say, they sung the religious part of an irreligious song! After all the evidence was in, the Landrost, Mr. Van der Berg, concluded "that the intention of the Volksraad was to prohibit any music that had nothing to do with religion, and that that which was heard at the Variety Theater on the evening in question came under the category of that which was taboed." His honor then sentenced Mr. Searelle to pay a fine of twenty-five dollars. An appeal has been taken to the high court, which will therefore be called upon to decide whether these songs in question are sacred or profane, or whether they are both, as some testified.

It appears that the Salvation Army will be involved in the matter before it is ended, as the defense claims that some of the songs sung by these warriors have rendered the dividing lips between the sacred and secular obscure, and the army may all at once find out that what they thought were songs of Zion are of the earth earthy, and that they must no more chant them on Sunday night lest they transgress the law by offending the moral sensibilities of the people.

Comment on this judicial proceeding is quite useless. What a farce it must seem to all thinking minds to see those who attended the theater sitting around waiting till the court gets some expert testimony so it can decide as to whether they listened to a sacred or a profane entertainment, and therefore whether or not they are sinners! It is the same controversy as in the fourth century. Now, as then, the spiritual guides having lost the power of godliness, find themselves unable to compete with a theater, ask the civil power to aid them by suppressing opposition. I am decidedly opposed to theaters, but utterly fail to see why a theater is any worse on Sunday night than on Monday night, especially when it is remembered that Sunday is only the "wild solar holiday of all pagan times." Furthermore, I am a regular worshiper within the church, and have many times sat within its sacred walls while a theater was in full blast in the town, but this has never disturbed my devotions in the least. The aim of all such legislation is to exalt Sunday, and fill the churches by so arranging it that there will be no other place to spend the day.
