Ex-Senator Tolley, of Tennessee, who has been a careful reader of the AMERICAN SENTINEL for several years, writes thus complimentary of the paper: "There is not an abler, fairer, or more convincing advocacy of any cause by any organ in the whole country than that displayed by the SENTINEL for the cause it champions."

And now, a word of encouragement to the State branches of the International Tract Society, which are sending the Sentinel to the members of State legislatures. Mr. Tolley, who has labored and is laboring so earnestly and unselfishly for the relief of the persecuted seventh-day observers of his State, first became interested in the SENTINEL while a member of the Tennessee legislature. The paper was sent free to all the members of that body, and Mr. Tolley became interested in it and has been a regular subscriber ever since. It would pay to send the paper to every legislator in the United States, if perchance it would result in the discovery of another such a friend of liberty of conscience, and there certainly must be more of them.
