In a speech to the pontifical household, Dec. 24, as reported by the World, the pope said:

The faith is reviving among the nations, which have come to recognize that civil virtues and laws are not sufficient to restrain the masses. It is of great importance, therefore, that all work together to make religion a force in public as well as in private life. It is the duty of rulers to lend their support to religious creeds.

The one great scheme which the pope is working to bring the governments of the world in submission at his feet is here briefly stated. "The masses cannot be controlled without religion. The Protestant religion commenced in anarchy and ends with anarchy. The only religion which can restrain the masses is the Roman Catholic religion." Therefore, "it is the duty of rulers to lend their support to religious [Roman Catholic] creeds." Rome breeds anarchy in her followers by telling them that the nation which does not recognize the Roman Catholic creed is a heretical nation, unstable, and must sooner or later come to ruin. When this teaching bears fruit in social unrest, riots and Coxeyism, she points to these social disturbances and charges it upon a failure to recognize the papal creed, and offers to calm the troubled waters in exchange for power. The Catholic World of August last, closed its observations on the Coxey movement which were similar to the statement of the pope here quoted, with the significant remark: "What possibilities there are in the old church!" This game of the pope will succeed and that soon, but this very success will preface the everlasting overthrow of this anti-Christian system. See Revelation, chaps. 17, 18, and 19.
