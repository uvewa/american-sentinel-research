The following resolution against a union of Church and State was introduced in the Georgia legislature by Hon. F. M. Hurst, and by his request referred to the Committee on the State of the Republic. Mr. Hurst said, in introducing his resolution: "It is high time that we go on record in no uncertain terms on this question. I firmly believe that this resolution should be adopted, and for that reason I have introduced it. I shall do all in my power to secure its adoption by the House:"

WHEREAS in February, 1893, there was begun an organized movement by a religious combination composed of the evangelical churches of the country to get the Government of the United States committed by direct legislation to a recognition of the Christian religion and a national adoption and enforcement of Sunday as the Christian Sabbath or Lord's day; and,

WHEREAS, They proposed first to accomplish their purpose by an amendment to the National Constitution declaring this to be a Christian nation, and so placing all Christian laws, institutions and usages upon an undeniable legal basis in the fundamental law of the land.

In 1888, May 21st, Senator H. W. Blair introduced a bill to secure to the people the enjoyment of the first day of the week, commonly known as the Lord's day, as a day of rest and to promote its observance as a day of rest and a day of religious worship, and on the 25th day of the same month he introduced a joint resolution to amend the National Constitution so as to establish the principles of the Christian religion as the religion of the nation.

These two pieces of legislation embodied the wishes of this religious combination, and immediately there was a strong effort made all over the country to secure the passage of the measures, especially the bill establishing and enforcing the observance of Sunday.

While it is true that this particular Sunday rest bill did not become a law, the legislation having died with the expiration of the Fiftieth Congress, it is also true that those who demanded, formulated and promoted this legislation, never slackened their efforts, and they have now, 1894, obtained the grand object of their ambition; they have the National Government fully committed to the whole course of religious legislation.

In the Fifty-second Congress, first session, the Sunday law advocates concentrated all their forces and all their energies upon the point of securing the closing of the World's Fair on Sunday by an act of Congress.

They sent to Congress petitions, backed up by threats so overbearing that their threats were denounced on the floors of Congress as an abuse of the right of petition.

Yet so great was the pressure of these religious lobbyists that Congress succumbed and enacted into law the act closing the World's Fair on Sunday and making the appropriation conditioned on this provision, put on and demanded by these religious lobbyists, thus delivering the Government, root and branch, over to these religious fanatics, to be governed and dictated to by them.

And in addition to this legislation, and in advance of it, the Supreme Court of the United States rendered a decision February 29, 1892, in which the court unanimously declared this to be a religious people and a Christian nation, and so accomplished all that was intended to be accomplished in the religious amendments to the Constitution proposed by Senator Blair.

Therefore, Be it resolved by the General Assembly of the State of Georgia, and it is hereby declared to be the sense of this body, that the above cited act of Congress is contrary to the principles upon which our Government was established and contrary to the Constitution of the same, and that it is impolitic, unwise, undemocratic, and has a tendency to the union of Church and State, and is therefore subversive of both our civil and religious liberties, and in our judgment is void and of no effect.

The committee to whom the resolution was referred reported it favorably, but on account of the absence of Mr. Hurst, as the result of sickness, the resolution was not brought up for passage and died with the legislative session of 1894. D. W. Reavis, who, sends us the resolution, and who was present when the committee resolved to recommend that the resolution "do pass," assures us that had it been brought up it would certainly have passed, and that it will be introduced at the next session and pushed to final action.
