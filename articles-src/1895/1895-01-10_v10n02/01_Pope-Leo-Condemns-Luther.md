On the 15th of June, 1520, Pope Leo X. issued a bull condemning Luther and the Reformation.

ONE of the forty-one propositions extracted from the writings of Luther, and condemned by Leo X., reads thus: "To burn heretics is contrary to the will of the Holy Ghost."

EVERY one of the forty-one gospel propositions condemned by Pope Leo X., on the 15th of June, 1520, are condemned by Pope Leo XIII. to-day, Jan. 10, 1895, although three hundred and seventy-five years with their opportunities for enlightenment have passed. Rome never changes.
