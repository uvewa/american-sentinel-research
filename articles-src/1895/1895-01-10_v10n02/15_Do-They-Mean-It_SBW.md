It has come to be very much the fashion to put on an appearance of liberality and to make strong expressions in favor of religious liberty. The Catholic Church, as is generally known, is now posing as the author and conservator of religious freedom, and is using honeyed words to disguise her real animus and intentions, that she may entrap the unwary and unsuspecting, and disarm those who otherwise would be on the alert to expose and oppose her encroachments.

Our inquiry, however, relates to the utterances of those, of whom we have a right, if not a reason, to expect better things. As a sample of these utterances, and one which well illustrates the whole class, is the following from the Kansas City Journal of December 8, in its report of the visit of General Booth to that city. The address of welcome was delivered by the Rev. C. H. Bruce, President of the Ministers' Alliance. Among other things Mr. Bruce said:—

That day is past, and past forever, when it is the right of any man to ask how a thing has been done, instead of asking what has been done. It is the right of every individual to worship after the manner which pleases him, but the day will never come when it will be his right to compel all other men to worship as he does.

Noble words, truthfully uttered; but the pleasure of reading and contemplating them is greatly marred by the intrusion of the query, Does he mean them? I know nothing of the gentleman's attitude upon the question of Sunday laws, but it is well known that the class of men which he represents is largely in favor of the enactment and enforcement of stringent Sunday laws; and that such laws, in their practical operation, are in direct contradiction to the sentiments expressed in the foregoing, and utterly subversive of Mr. Bruce's broadly stated principle, is also well known by many, but especially those who are the victims of this kind of legislation. Hence arises the query which implies a suspicion of the insincerity of the utterances containing these noble and truthful sentiments. It is true that "the day will never come" when it will be the right of any man, or set of men, "to compel" others "to worship as he does;" but the day has already come when men professedly indorsing this principle, and claiming to be governed by the Golden Rule, are assuming and attempting the exercise of the right to compel all others to worship as they do, which worship, too, is contrary to the expressed will of God. And all this in the name of the Christian religion. What could more clearly show the perversity of human nature, or more fully prove the fall of modern Babylon?

S. B. WHITNEY.
