[In 1820 there was organized in West Middletown-Washington Co., Pa., a society, called the West Middletown Moral Society. The principal object of the society was to enforce the Pennsylvania Sunday law of 1784, which is still on the statute books of the State. This Moral Society was organized by the United Presbyterian, the same people who, later in 1863, organized the National Reform Association. Alexander Campbell, the founder of the Christian or Disciple Church, only opposed the society in a series of articles published in the Reporter, of Washington, county seat of Washington County. His articles were signed "Candidus." A United Presbyterian minister, by the name of Wylie, attempted to defend the society, and signed himself "Timothy." The discussion continued from April 17, 1820, the date of Mr. Campbell's first article, to February 22, 1822, during which time almost every phase of the compulsory Sunday law question was treated. As a result the Moral Society perished, not to appear again until 1863 when it was revived by the same denomination under the name, National Reform Association. Every word of Mr. Campbell's invincible logic and withering denunciation is applicable to the association, resuscitated under the name, National Reform Association, and kindred organizations, such as the American Sabbath Union, the Pennsylvania Sabbath Association, etc.]

MR. T.'s fourth argument is substantially the same as his second, but as he makes it numerically one of the mysterious number seven, I will pay due regard to it. I will transcribe it every word. "The magistrate and the legislator," says he, "are bound in their official characters to promote the principles of public virtue, since they are the two sources of the dignity and prosperity of the community. Now these principles have their origin in religion. Therefore it is the duty of the legislator to enact, and of the magistrate to execute, such laws as are necessary to protect the public forms of religion from contempt. He that openly profanes the Sabbath, does treat religion with contempt and is therefore guilty of not only a sin against God, but an offense against the State."

The established church of Rome, or any other established church, at no time claimed the right of extirpating all its enemies upon grounds more dangerous to the community than the principle embraced in the above argument. The principle assumed by Mr. T. is in fact the same as that plead by Romanists and some Protestants, to justify them in burning, beheading, and torturing heretics. This shall be evident in the detail. That I might escape the suspicion of perverting Mr. T.'s argument, I have transcribed the whole of it, and I request the reader to compare my remarks upon it, with the original before him.

In the first instance, then, Mr. T. asserts that the principles of public virtue have their origin in religion. This we all confess. But the difference is, how are they to be deducted therefrom. My opinion has already been given on this subject. Let us now hear Mr. T.'s opinion. It is this: "It is the duty of the legislator to enact, and of the magistrate to execute, such laws as are necessary to protect the public forms of religion from contempt." This will lead to any extreme in persecution; and it necessarily requires an holy inquisition to explain and enforce it. Before the above principle can be acted upon, an inquisitorial tribunal must decree two important items: the one infallibly determining what are the public forms of religion; the other what is "to treat them with contempt." When it shall have infallibly determined these two particulars, two others will necessarily claim its attention. The first, with what penalty shall these laws be enforced,—protecting the public forms of religion from contempt,—whether by fine, imprisonment, torture, or death, etc.? And secondly, who shall be employed to bring the guilty to punishment? These four things are indispensably necessary to carry Mr. T.'s principle of coercion into effect.

What are the public forms of religion? Mr. T. mentions but one; viz., the observance of a Sabbath. But having summoned A B C D E and F to deliberate on this question, they agree on the following as among the public forms of religion, viz., the observance of a Sabbath, baptism, the holy supper, standing in prayer in the congregation, singing aloud in church, fast days, tithes, or the paying of stipends to the clergy, going to meeting every Sabbath, fast day, and preparation, creeds, confessions, and public forms of sound words. To these A was for adding a dozen more, and D five, but when put to vote, only the above items carried. It was found that in order to unanimity a pope was necessary.

To show the correctness of the above remark, and to demonstrate that Timothy has had and yet has the majority on his side, I will add a few questions, and reserve for another number, the further exposure of his fourth argument.

From the Boston Centinel, June, 1821:—

In the late amendments to the constitution of this State it was proposed to repeal that part of the declaration of rights which invested the legislature with authority to enforce an attendance upon the instruction of public worship. This amendment being rejected, the people determined that the old provisions on the subject of public worship and religious freedom are sufficient, that people ought to be compelled to go to church.

This is an excellent way to protect the public forms of religion from contempt! Timothy in the majority and Candidus in the minority in this instance.

From the constitution of Massachusetts, Third Article:—

The people of this commonwealth have a right to invest their legislature with power to authorize and require, and the legislature shall, from time to time, authorize and require, the several towns, parishes, precincts, and other bodies politic or religious societies, to make suitable provision at their own expense for the institution of the public worship of God, and for the support and maintenance of public Protestant teachers, of piety, religion, and morality in all cases where such provision shall not be made voluntarily.

An excellent way to protect public forms of religion from contempt! Timothy in the majority, and Candidus in the minority.

From the "British Encyclopedia":—

It is hardly credible, but it is nevertheless a melancholy fact that an ordinance against blasphemy and heresy was passed in May, 1648, by the influence of the Presbyterian then in Parliament; in which it was decreed that all persons who shall willingly maintain, publish or defend by teaching or writing that the Father is not God, that the Son is not God, that the Holy Ghost is not God; and that these three are not one eternal God; or that Christ is not God equal with the Father; shall upon complaint or proof, by oath, of two witnesses before the justice of the peace, be committed to prison without bail, or main prize, till the next jail delivery; and in case the indictment shall then be found, and the party upon his trial shall not adjure the said error, he shall suffer the pain of death, as in case of felony, without benefit of the clergy.

An excellent way to protect the forms of religion from contempt! Timothy in the majority again, and where is poor Candidus?—Alexander Campbell in Washington (Pa.) Reporter, Oct. 22, 1821.
