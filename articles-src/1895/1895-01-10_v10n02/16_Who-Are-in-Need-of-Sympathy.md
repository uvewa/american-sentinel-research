THE Dassel (Minn.) Anchor has this to say of the persecution of Seventh-day Adventists:—

### Sunday Work.

Our attention has been recently called to the case of Henry P. Holser, once a resident of Minnesota, but now the editor of a German paper in Basel, Switzerland. It seems that Mr. Holser has been imprisoned for performing his editorial duties on Sunday, and this too at a time when, directly in front of his office, soldiers were engaged in drilling and citizens were playing games and enjoying themselves socially in a way much more calculated to disturb the solemnity and peace of the day. This case has attracted considerable attention all over the world, and the action of the Swiss government has been severely condemned by many as inconsistent.

Switzerland is not the only country trying to enforce religious laws, for at the present time two men are serving out sentences in Manitoba prisons for performing labor on Sunday, and even our own United States is guilty of similar attempts.

R. R. Whaley and W. G. Curlett, both of Queen Anne's County, Maryland, are in jail for Sunday work, and one man in Tennessee has just been liberated from an imprisonment for a like offense. The injustice of these imprisonments is seen when the fact is added that every one of the men mentioned observes another day of rest religiously, and by the laws of his country is compelled to keep two days or violate his conscience.

Personally our religious views do not coincide with those of the men who are mentioned, neither do we intend to make a religious article out of this subject, but we do feel like protesting against the enacting of any law that has its foundation in the tenets of any particular denomination and are in favor of the repeal of all laws that are based solely on the sectarian belief of any class or church.

We believe in laws that are for the bettering of humanity, but we object to all such when they owe their birth or life to purely religious teachings.

We have very little sympathy with that class of so-called Christians who would force onto others their own particular way of serving the Lord, whether they draw their authority from the Bible, the Book of Mormon, the Koran, or any of the many other books held in veneration by people in all parts of the earth, and we can consistently condemn these imprisonments even though they do seem to place us in sympathy with those who are known as seventh day people.

Ed. H. P. Holser, the editor first referred to, was at one time president of the Minnesota Conference of Adventists, and he is now in jail in Switzerland for living up to the best light he had. We are sorry for him, but we are more sorry for the deluded bigots who put him there.

The Anchor is right. The persecutor is always the party in most need of sympathy. The persecuted are cheered with the promise, "Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life." But of the persecutor, the Lord says, "But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea." Matt. 18:6.
