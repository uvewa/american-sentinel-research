MARTIN LUTHER is dead. And the churches of the Reformation "keep silence" and "fall back."

IN Germany, the home of Martin Luther, it is to-day a criminal offense, punishable with fine and imprisonment, to preach against Catholicism, or as Luther termed it, "the plague of Babylon." In the United States, it is against the law of "propriety," "good policy," and "good taste," to preach against Romanism. Instead, a Methodist minister in Ohio says, "God bless the Roman Catholic Church of to-day." Another in Iowa holds a union service with a Roman Catholic priest,—the priest doing the preaching, of course. A Catholic priest is requested to tell the students of the Union Theological Seminary how to preach. He is introduced by a Presbyterian minister, who terms Luther's "plague of Babylon" the "great mother church of Christendom," and says that the recent encyclical of Pope Leo XIII., inviting princes and peoples back to the belief that to burn heretics is in harmony with the Holy Ghost, "breathed a spirit like that of the Master."
