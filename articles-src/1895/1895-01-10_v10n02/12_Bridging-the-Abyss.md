An exceedingly interesting item of news comes from our neighbor, Williamsburg, in Iowa County. It is to the effect that Thanksgiving was observed in that place with union religious services held in the Methodist Church, and that the sermon was delivered by Rev. Father White, of the Catholic Church, joining with the Presbyterian and Methodist in holding services. Our correspondent states that Rev. U. B. Smith, of the Methodist Church, and Rev. Father White are the movers in this advance in religious liberalism. Both of these gentlemen are advanced thinkers in their respective denominations, and no action has been taken in that community for many months that has caused so much interest in religious matters as this unique union service.—*Ottumwa (Iowa) Currier*.
