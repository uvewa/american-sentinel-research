Such is the heading in the Detroit Evening News of Jan. 30, 1895, in describing a mass meeting in Bay City, where six Catholic priests, twelve Protestant ministers and one hundred representative citizens sat on the platform at the Christian unity meeting held Jan. 29. There was an audience that filled the opera house in spite of the ten-cent admission fee. Even the gallery was crowded, and no standing-room anywhere. Ex-Congressman Nathan B. Bradley presided. He stated that the purpose of the meeting was to see if there were not a common ground upon which Christians could meet in fellowship.

All united in repeating the Lord's prayer, led by Rev. Thomas McLean (Episcopal), and then Rev. "Father" (Brother) Schrembs was called on, and led in singing "Nearer, my God, to Thee." The scene was said to be "overwhelming," and I do not doubt it.

The speakers were ex-Mayor A. McDonnell, Catholic; Rev. Charles T. Patchell, Congregationalist; Rev. "Father" Rafter, Catholic; Rev. W. H. Clark, Presbyterian; Rev. "Father" Schrembs, Catholic; Rev. T. W. McLean, Episcopalian. All cordially indorsed the movement, which they declared existed solely for the purpose of wiping out intolerance. Among other things Mr. Patchel said:—

Father Rafter is my brother and I greet him as such. He believes in Christ. So do I. He believes Christ purchased heaven. So do I. If Father Rafter wears robes in the pulpit with our Episcopal brother, let him do so. I would feel like a rat in a strange garret if I did and could not speak with ease. He preaches Christ. Why should I say he is wrong?

Yes, indeed, why should he? In fact how can he? And yet is not that the very work for which his church came into existence? Once there were Protestants who protested, but now Mr. Patchell and his fellow-ministers of Bay City have given up, as far as they can, the work for which they were called, and betrayed their position into the hands of the enemy;—enemy, whether they knew it or not; or knowing it, blindly went ahead heedless of the result.

If "Father" Rafter is "brother," as Mr. Patchell says, and they can now join hands and hearts, why was the Reformation necessary? Why not say to the Catholic priests assembled: "Luther made a mistake. He was a well-meaning man, no doubt, but his leaving the church of Rome was all wrong. He could have staid in the church and been better off. We do not want to say that he was a fool, but that he made a mistake." Now mistakes are made by those who are misled, and the individual that does that work of misleading is the devil. Thus we have the Protestant ministers of Bay City and West Bay City practically admitting by their words and acts that the Reformation was led by the devil—just what the Catholics have always claimed.

"Father" Rafter followed. He said:—

Every vestige of human slavery has disappeared from Christian lands. There is no invention useful to man that is not elevating this nineteenth century above that of all its predecessors. But an additional lustre must be shed on it by universal Christian charity and brotherly love. A cord of love has struck hers in Bay City in all Christian hearts that can beat, and the chord is Christian unity.

Then every heart that cannot beat in unison with this chord of Christian unity must be dead. No doubt they will consider it so, and this condition will in their estimation be "intolerant" or "infidel," and their respects are paid to those classes later on. "The movement," continued "Father" Rafter, as I now understand it, is that we should love our neighbor, and that our neighbor is every man no matter what his race, creed or color may be." No Christian can object to this idea, as a theory, but the writer may be pardoned for being so hard-hearted and skeptical as to wonder if this brotherly love is to be manifested to those not of their "race, creed, or color," as it has been in years in the past, and even at this time where they have the power.

Said Rev. "Father" Schrembs:—

The saddest, darkest pages of human history are those that have been written about religious intolerance and persecution. I am sorry to say that history is full of those pages.

Just so; and the church he represents inflicted at least 90 per cent. of the persecution and boasts that "Rome never changes." Such statements, with Protestant?) ministers saying "amen" to them, should have made a shoulder pass through the heart of every man and woman within the sound of the priest's voice.

The priest continues:—

But circumstances and times that have made such religious persecution possible have passed away and I take for granted that there is no man to-day that will raise again and unfurl the bloody banner that has waved too long.

True Protestants cannot take it for granted; for if they did they would be lulled into sleep and perish with those who are hypnotized by such smooth tones. "Father" Schrembs continuing said:—

All this has been paraded in the world in the name of Him who came to the world to give peace and good will to all men. There is the rub. We stand here tonight on one common grand Christian unity. Christianity divided is a mockery. It is the mockery of infidelism; it is the mockery of atheism; it is the mockery of materialism. They scoff and point with disdain. "You pretend," they say, "to be religious men. You pretend to have the kindness of Christ, and you only hate one another with a deep hatred. If that is your character, we want nothing of it."

Let us throw away that intolerance we have so long had and learn to know each other and learn to love each other as Christ did. Then we can move more boldly and make a grand front against infidelity. It is the practice of infidelity to tear down, and it does not build up. Then when the sun, tired of its great labor, shall have set in the great beyond, never to rise again, we shall meet above. Christ reigns through charity.

There you have it. We are to present "a grand front" against infidelity, atheism, materialism, and intolerance.

The reader has already seen that in their estimation any one will be intolerant who is not willing to admit her (the Romish church) claims, and they have succeeded in getting every minister in the Bay Cities, save perhaps one, to stultify himself, and one of those who at the first was not in the movement for some reason or other, is now tumbling over himself to get in "out of the rain," as witnesses the following:—

Rev. John G. Wyss desires a correction of the statement made in a recent article to the effect that he was not identified with the Christian union movement because he could not speak English. He is with the movement, has been from the start, and speaks English so fluently that he was for years pastor of an English congregation.—Detroit News of Feb. 5.

But this is not all. They are to have a series of public meetings at which priest and pastor will speak alternately, but for fear of making trouble each side has appointed a committee of three to whom all papers designed for the public meetings are to be given, "and they have the right to strike out such sentences or paragraphs as may be objectionable to them."

Just think of it. Suppose Luther had submitted his theses to a committee of priests before he read them in public, or gave them out to be read. Suppose Christ had written out his sermons and placed them before a delegation of Scribes and Pharisees before he would speak them in public. Suppose he had asked permission of the Roman governor to tell some of his parables. And yet this is what professed Protestant ministers have done, and are doing, and will do, for now that the Parkhurstian bubble in Saginaw has burst, the ministers of that place are going down to Bay City to see how the "Christian unity" act is done, and it is to be presumed that Saginaw will soon see the attempt to join Christ and Belial. However it is not the joining of Christianity to Satan, for that cannot be done. But it is the union of apostate Protestantism with the papacy against the truth of God; and the fruits of the union will be the persecution of the true people of God.
