## Murdered by a Preacher.

### A Dispute Over Infant Baptism Ends Fatally in Kentucky.

VANCEBURG, KY., Jan. 8.—On Grassy Creek, a few miles southeast of this city last night, the Rev. Lem Penrod got into an argument with John Slate, a lay member, on the subject of the efficacy of infant baptism. The controversy became loud and waxed hot when Rev. Penrod drew his revolver and fired at Slate, the ball passing through his body, inflicting a fatal wound.—Memphis Commercial.

### Roman Orders.

CANNON MACCOLL tells us that in South America there used to be a rule that no one with a strain of native blood down to the fourth generation could be ordained to the Roman priesthood. A bishop did ordain some such young men, and when he found out that they were disqualified he declared that his intention was absent, and that they were still laymen. On appeal Rome took the same view. We cannot therefore be certain that a single bishop or priest of the Roman communion is validly consecrated, since the intention of their consecrators may have been absent.—Church Review.

### Dispute Over an Apparition.

PRAGUE, Jan. 2.—A peasant, living near Braunau, Bohemia, recently declared that he had seen an apparition of the Holy Virgin in the Dorengrund Forest. His story was believed generally outside the town, and hundreds went daily to the spot, where the virgin was said to appear. To-day several thousand persons made the pilgrimage. They were met in the forest by a crowd of scoffers, who ridiculed the peasant's story, and eventually provoked the pilgrims to violence.

A riot followed. Gendarmes sent out from Braunau were unable to restore peace. After several charges they fired into the throng. Although ten men were wounded, the two mobs continued fighting. Several hundred turned on the gendarmes eventually, and drove them from the forest. Troops have been ordered out to disperse the rioters.—Washington Post, Jan. 3.

### Petition to the President of the United States.

SIR: Since the Roman Pontiff has accredited to this Government a representative in the person of Francis Archbishop Satolli, who, from the date of his landing upon our shores, has busied himself in stirring up the adherents of the papacy to mutiny against the laws and customs of this nation, in open and flagrant violation of international comity, preaching the nefarious doctrines of the Ultramontanes in relation to popular education and the union of Church and State, and otherwise evincing contempt for the American system of laws; and since Genet and Sackville-West were summarily required to leave the country for offenses far less odious and in far less degree calculated to embroil the country in civil war;

Now, therefore, your petitioners respectfully ask that the said Satolli be warned forthwith to depart from the territory of the United States, and that his master, the pope, be requested to send no more emissaries of like character or capacity to this country.

And since the Society of Jesus, as a revolutionary order, is also engaged in fostering strife among our people in the interest of the Roman Imposture, we further ask that in your next annual message to Congress you call the attention of that body to this matter, to the end that by appropriate legislation the members of that order may be banished, and the property held by them under charters from the Federal Government sequestered in accordance with the principles laid down by the Supreme Court in the case of the United States against the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, and that the same be devoted in part to the fund for establishing the University of the United States at Washington, and in part to the establishment and support of free schools in the States where it may be situated.—Loyal American.

## Governor Fishback's Reply.

### Reminds the Ministers That Christ Rebuked Over-pure Men.

LITTLE ROCK, ARK., Jan. 9.—The City Pastors' Association recently passed resolutions condemning Governor Fishback's published views in regard to the regulation of the social evils. The governor has addressed a lengthy reply to the ministers, in which he says:—

"Intelligent, sensible people, who are at all observant of passing events, will tell you that the chief obstacles in the way of religious and moral progress have been hypocrisy and folly. A few men who arrogate to themselves leadership in religious and moral reforms are constantly bringing both into contempt either through hypocrisy or blind fanatical unreasonable folly. There were not wanting men of your type who were ready to pass resolutions against the purity of the Saviour himself, because his honest common sense dared to rebuke certain over-pure men who would have stoned to death a fallen woman."—Memphis Commercial.
