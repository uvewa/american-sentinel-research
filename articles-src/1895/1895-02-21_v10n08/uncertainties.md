# Uncertainties Log - Volume 10, Number 8 (February 21, 1895)

## General OCR Quality
The scan quality for this issue was generally good, with clear text and minimal obstructions.

## Specific Uncertainties

### Page 1, Article "The 'Monitor,' the Prophecies and the Beast"
- **Line reference:** "Juda 14" (likely Jude 14, but transcribed as printed)
- **Transcribed as:** "Juda 14"
- **Confidence:** HIGH - appears to be period spelling variation or abbreviation for Jude
- **Reason:** Consistent with 19th century citation style

### Page 2, Article "True and False Theocracy"
- **Line reference:** "Exs. 21:25-27"
- **Transcribed as:** "Exs. 21:25-27"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM - likely Ezekiel 21:25-27 (abbreviated "Ezk." or "Eze." normally)
- **Reason:** Context confirms this is Ezekiel; "Exs." appears to be OCR error or period abbreviation

### Page 3, Article "The Pilot Attacks the Sentinel"
- **Line reference:** Reference to "passons"
- **Transcribed as:** "passons"
- **Confidence:** HIGH - likely intended as "parsons" but appears as printed
- **Reason:** Could be either OCR error or period slang/derogatory term

### Page 5, Masthead
- **Line reference:** "A. F. BALLINGER"
- **Transcribed as:** "A. F. BALLINGER"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM - typically spelled "Ballenger" in other issues
- **Reason:** Appears clearly as "BALLINGER" in scan; may be printing variation

### Page 6, Article by J. G. Lamson
- **Line reference:** "shoulder pass through"
- **Transcribed as:** "shoulder pass through"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM - likely "shudder pass through"
- **Reason:** Context suggests "shudder" but scan shows "shoulder"

### Page 7, Article "Will Try Moral Suasion"
- **Line reference:** "transthrred"
- **Transcribed as:** "transthrred"
- **Confidence:** HIGH - clearly meant to be "transferred"
- **Reason:** Obvious OCR or printing error; preserved as printed

### Page 8, Editorial Notes
- **Line reference:** "G. W. COLORED"
- **Transcribed as:** "G. W. COLORED"
- **Confidence:** LOW - almost certainly "G. W. Colcord" based on known authors
- **Reason:** Clear OCR error; Colcord is a known contributor; preserved as printed but flagged

## Notes
All obvious OCR errors have been preserved as they appear in the source document per transcription rules. The editor's name "A. F. BALLINGER" vs. usual "Ballenger" and the reference "G. W. COLORED" vs. "Colcord" are the most significant uncertainties requiring verification against the original printed document.
