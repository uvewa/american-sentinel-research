THE New York Observer, of Jan. 24, 1895, attacks the Roman Catholic mass on this wise:—

There is not, in all the Word of God, a passage that can be quoted in support of an early and fasting communion.

The Catholic Union and Times, of Buffalo, replies as follows:—

Neither is there a single text of Scripture to authorize you to change the Lord's day from the seventh to the first day of the week. Why have you done so? Because the Catholic and Apostolic Church, from earliest Christian days, has substituted Sunday for the Jewish Sabbath, for solid and resplendent reasons.

Of course, the Observer replied to this retort by maintaining the customary silence. What a pity that Protestants should stultify themselves and destroy their ability to wield the Word of God against papal errors by tenaciously clinging to one of the most fatal of these errors.
