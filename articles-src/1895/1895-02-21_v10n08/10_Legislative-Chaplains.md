THE WACO NEWS is urging the abolition of legislative chaplains, as a useless expenditure of the people's money. The Gazetteer is disposed to agree with the News. If there is any praying done the legislators should do the praying themselves. At any rate it would not be a bad idea to try the recommendation of Jesus for one session; let the law-makers who feel the need of divine guidance in discharging their duties to their constituents, retire to their closets every morning and pray in secret. In this way the public would not be bored and the State would save five dollars a day.—Sunday Gazetteer, Denison, Texas.
