ANY one receiving the AMERICAN SENTINEL without having ordered it may know that it is sent to him by some friend. Therefore, those who have not ordered the SENTINEL need have no fears that they will be asked to pay for it.

EDWARD F. DUNN, who is managing the American branch of the international movement to restore "Papal Independence," is a Florida judge.

WITH the Monitor firing on us from San Francisco, the Pilot steaming toward us from Boston, and the Catholic World engaging us at short range, there appear to be prospects of a general engagement.

OUR illustrated neighbor, Puck, is the only prominent political paper in the country that has cared and dared to speak its mind about the pope's latest encyclical to America. Its double page cartoon of February 13, is interesting. Would that America was as positive in her refusal to come under Leo's mantle as "Miss Columbia" is there represented to be.

PROF. G. W. COLORED, President of the Seventh-day Adventist academy at Graysville, Tenn.; is one of the twenty now under indictment there, charged with violating the Sunday law. The six charges against him are for permitting students to labor on the college premises on Sunday. Since the indictments were found, a strong local sentiment has developed against these prosecutions, led by the editor of the Dayton (Tennessee) Leader, and the result is left in doubt. Meanwhile the accused manifest a meek and quiet, yet courageous spirit.

It will be unfortunate for America and for civilization if they are allowed to have their way in New York. Our schools are essentially civil schools, maintained as the prop of civil government. If they are converted into military institutions then the American system must cease to be republican and become imperial. This would follow with a certainty that is illustrated by the whole course of history. The military spirit cannot become dominant in the mind of any people without supplanting the republican system with the imperial.—The American Magazine of Civics, for February.
