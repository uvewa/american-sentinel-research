THE reason why the pope is so anxious to hitch America to his chariot is clearly stated by O. A. Brownson, in his work, "Conversations on Liberalism and the Church." The author is a convert to Romanism from Protestantism, and so highly is he esteemed among them that steps have been taken to erect a monument to his memory. Mr. Brownson says:—

All heresies and infidelity are disintegrating and destructive, if you will, but really hostile to progress. They interrupt the work of the church, they interpose obstacles to her influence, deny or obscure the principles of progress, and as far as their power extends, so prevent their development and practical application, and not only peril souls, but hinder or retard the progress of civilization. Heretical nations [like the United States] are running the same career the ancient Gentile nations ran, and their influence, aided by the flesh, the world and the devil, extends even to orthodox nations, and neutralizes, to a fearful extent, the power of the church to apply her principles to her own children, so that these nations became almost as unprogressive as heretical nations themselves.—Page 170.

Yes, the religious liberty principles of the Constitution of this heretical nation have neutralized to a fearful extent the "power" of the Roman Catholic Church over her own children, so much so that she has stopped burning them for heresy. There was no United States Constitution to "interpose obstacles to her influence" on Huss and Jerome and the millions of others murdered by her "influence;" hence the earnest solicitude of the pope and the papacy to capture the United States Government and obtain "the favor of the laws and the patronage of public authority."
