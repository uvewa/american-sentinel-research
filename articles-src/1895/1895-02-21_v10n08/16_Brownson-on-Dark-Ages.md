WHAT the papacy will do for all nations and all people when the scheme of the pope is realized, is to be learned from a study of the history of the Dark Ages. There are people who are just foolish enough to believe that the "infallible" church has come to regard her cruel, mediaeval history with becoming abhorrence. All such should read the following, quoted from Brownson's work, which the writer purchased within a week, from the Catholic publishing house of D. & J. Sadlier & Co., 31 Barclay St., New York:—

Christian nations alone are living and progressive nations. And never have Christian nations advanced in all that makes the true glory of civilization so rapidly as they did from the downfall of Rome to the rise of what you [Protestants] call the Reformation.—Page 170.

No real progress of civilization since the epoch of the Reformation.—Page 176.

Always will the period from the sixth to the end of the fifteenth century stand out as the most glorious in the annals of the race.—Page 182.

Comment is unnecessary.
