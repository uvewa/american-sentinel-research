**NEBRASKA** and most other States have laws against manual labor on Sunday. The upholders of these laws usually insist that they are not made in the interest of religion, but in the interest of the physical well-being of the citizen. Recently in Massachusetts a man was fined fifty dollars and costs for selling a half pound of candy on Sunday. The heaviness of the fine is supposed to have been proportioned to the terrible strain to which the man's nervous and muscular system were subjected in selling the candy. Of course there was no religion in it. Oh no! not a bit of it.—*Silver Creek Times* (*Silver Creek, Neb.*).
