THE Christian Statesman of Feb. 9, contains the following editorial paragraph:—

Popery affirms its interpretation of God's law through its so-called infallible head to be binding upon the consciences of all men. It leaves no room for dissent. It compels, so far as it has the power, acceptance of its interpretation. It denies the blessing of Christ to all who do not accept its interpretation as the one and only sound and valid interpretation of the divine law. However sure we may be that our views of truth and duty are scripturally sound, we are following in the foot-steps of Romanism the moment we assume to judge brethren in Christ in any such way as directly affirms or indirectly implies that they have not the same right to interpret and apply God's law for themselves, and to expect his blessing in their honest and sincere endeavors to do his holy will.

The element represented by the Christian Statesman interprets the law of God to mean that the first day of the week and not the seventh day is the Sabbath, and is leaving no stone unturned in the effort to force this interpretation on all men by means of civil law. It denies the right of men "to interpret and apply God's law for themselves" and is therefore, according to its own definition, "following in the footsteps of Romanism."
