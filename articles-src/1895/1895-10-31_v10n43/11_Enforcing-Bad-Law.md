# ENFORCING BAD LAW.

The President of the New York Social Reform Club Says a Bad Law Ought Not to be Enforced.

[New York Sun, Oct. 25.]

EX-ASSEMBLYMAN ERNEST HOWARD CROSBY, who introduced the High License bill in the Assembly several years ago, and is now president of the New York Social Reform Club, said last evening:—

"I do not sympathize with the present excise movement in this city. It seems to me most unfortunate that the question of honest government has got mixed up with it. I differ radically from those who think that the best thing to do with a law which is either bad in itself or ahead of or counter to public opinion is to enforce it. I believe that such laws should become dead letters.

"I fully understand the dilemma in which officials find themselves who have sworn to enforce unwise laws, but there is one simple way in which to resolve the dilemma, and that is to resign the office, or, better still, to decline to take such an oath."
