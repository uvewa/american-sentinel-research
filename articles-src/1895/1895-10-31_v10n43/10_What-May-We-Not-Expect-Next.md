# WHAT MAY WE NOT EXPECT NEXT?

THE Mail and Express, of the 26th inst., had the following in its sporting columns:—

Many interesting club and century runs are scheduled for this afternoon and to-morrow by the local cycling clubs, which should bring out a large attendance of wheelmen. Nearly every popular town within easy riding distance of the metropolis will be visited by one or more clubs, and many exciting brushes on the road may be looked for. Of course, interest principally will be centered in the 100 miles ride of the Century Wheelmen, in which nearly every prominent club for miles around New York have representatives entered, in hopes of capturing the handsome club trophy, which will be awarded to the organization having the largest number of survivors.

"To-morrow" was Sunday, Oct. 27; and the Mail and Express has long been the mouthpiece of the American Sabbath Union. The Mail and Express is also the champion of "law and order," and believes in enforcing "law because it is law," whether right or wrong, and that "the best way to secure the repeal of a bad law is by enforcing it." The Sunday "law" of New York forbids under penalty all "public sports, exercises, pastime, or shows, upon the first day of the week." The "many interesting club and century runs" "scheduled" for "to-morrow [Oct. 27] by the local cycling clubs," and noticed so approvingly by the Mail and Express, were all so many violations both of the "law" of New York and, from the standpoint of the Mail and Express, of the law of God. But does that paper really believe that Sunday is the Sabbath?
