# TAXATION WITHOUT REPRESENTATION.

The Board of Public Schools of Linwood, Nebr., recently decided to discontinue the repeating of the Lord's prayer or any other prayer, or the conducting of any religious exercise, in the schools under their control. The decision, of course, caused no small stir in the religious element of the place, the result of which was a petition containing three hundred and fifty names, praying the Board to reconsider their action.

The petition failed. The spokesman who voiced the sentiments of the majority of the Board, said, when the petition was presented: "I intend voting to-night as I did last Saturday night. I do it from a firm conviction that I am right, and that all who are now opposing me will yet acknowledge their error. There are none in Linwood more firm in their belief of the Bible than I am, nor any more anxious to see their children raised up in its teachings than I. But the church and the home are the places for that, and my children receive it thoroughly at both places. I believe in crushing such troubles as these at the beginning. The majority should not force their views to obtain in the free schools."

By a majority of one, the School Board decided to adhere to their decision.

The religious element of Linwood, headed by the Presbyterian minister, will now agitate for the reestablishment of religious exercises in the schools. At an interview (as reported) the latter said: "This affair did not end, as far as I am concerned, Saturday night. I have already begun hunting up all authorities on the subject. We shall see what 'sectarian' means. I am now very hot on this subject, and will not talk on this subject from the pulpit while I am. But in two weeks I will be cooled down as well as prepared thoroughly. Then, look out."

The position of the Board is the right one. This nation is built upon the repudiation of the principle of "taxation without representation;" and when religion is admitted into the public schools, which all classes are taxed to support, this repudiated principle is reaffirmed; for it is impossible to represent all classes in any arrangement which admits of religious teaching or exercises as a feature of public school work. Such an arrangement makes the school in reality sectarian, for a sect is nothing else than a class or party of people who are distinguished from others by a difference of belief, and as properly designates atheists, Jews, or Mohammedans, as it does Christians; and only that is unsectarian which is common to all sects.

Religious instruction is indeed a prime necessity in the proper education of every child; but it must not be secured at the sacrifice of justice; and moreover, from the very fact that it is a matter of such importance, arises the necessity of safeguarding it more than can be done by committing it to the hands of public school teachers.
