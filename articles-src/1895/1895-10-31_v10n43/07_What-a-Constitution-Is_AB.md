# WHAT A CONSTITUTION IS.

[By Addison Blakely, Ph. D., Lecturer in Political Science and History, University of Chicago.]

A CONSTITUTION, in its broadest sense, is a photograph of a government and its workings. The written constitution is merely the most important characteristics or phases of this photograph set down in writing, in the interests of stability and for the conservation of justice.

The unwritten constitution is those methods of governmental procedure which have grown up or have been acquiesced in by governmental agents, either in the interests of convenience or from force of necessity arising from the demands of the people. Acts of arbitrary power, so common in past times, have had to give way, as enlightenment has advanced, to usages recognizing and protecting the rights of the people. As these usages acquire permanence they become part of the constitution and enter into the life and character of government.

In other words, the constitution is the photograph or description of the governmental institutions making up the machinery of governments. An institution is any mechanism used in the determination of what law is and in its enforcement. This is why the constitution is called the "fundamental law of the land." It is the law governing the ascertainment and enforcement of all other law.

The purpose of the constitution is to have an established and just mode of determining and applying the rights and obligations of each in reference to others. The law is opposed to experiments—to all attempts at creation. It is necessarily conservative. It regards with jealous care the principles and maxims that have cost so much labor and blood. Every letter in our fundamental law has cost a life. Little wonder then that the law is conservative. It may be so to a fault; but better so than to be tossed to and fro by every gust of wind yclept reform. The law must be stable; it must be permanent. Else it were of little value.

These features of justice, stability, and age are what give to the great English constitution its importance and sacredness. The English people, in their several homes,—in Britain, in America, in Australia,—regard their fundamental law with reverence and awe. And rightly so. For well nigh a score of centuries this constitution has given to the English people the freest government and the most personal liberty of any constitution on earth.

A constitution, then, is merely the legal limitations, written and unwritten, governing the machinery of the body politic. Government itself, wherever crime is, is an absolute necessity. But a power so great, so universal, so irresistible as a governmental corporation necessarily is, must needs be confined in well-defined limits, or else the individual must perhaps suffer worse at the hands of this power then at the hands of the comparatively weaker criminal. Experience has demonstrated this, and the constitutional limitations of the age are the result. Thus the constitution is an afterthought. It is an ingrowth of political needs and the people's welfare. "Written constitutions," says Webster, "sanctify and confirm great principles, but the latter are prior in existence to the former."¹

And so declares the law. "What is a constitution, and what are its objects?" inquires the judicial magistrate in applying the fundamental law. "It is easier to tell what it is not, than what it is. It is not the beginning of a community nor the origin of private rights; it is not the fountain of law, nor the incipient state of government; it is not the cause, but consequence, of personal and political freedom; it grants no rights to the people, but is the creature of their power, the instrument of their convenience. Designed for their protection in the enjoyment of the rights and powers which they possessed before the constitution was made, it is but the framework of the political government, and necessarily based upon the preexisting condition of laws, rights, habits and modes of thought. There is nothing primitive in it; it is all derived from a known source. It presupposes an organized society, law, order, property, personal freedom, a love of political liberty, and enough of cultivated intelligence to know how to guard it against the encroachments of tyranny. A written constitution is, in every instance, a limitation upon the powers of government in the hands of agents; for there never was a written republican constitution which delegated to functionaries all the latent powers which lie dormant in every nation, and are boundless in extent and incapable of definition."²

Wherever force is, there is need for law. Wherever authority is granted, there is need for a measure of that authority. It is this purpose that the constitution serves. It expresses in words what exists in right and natural law, bounds over which those in control must not go. It is a restraint upon those exercising the "powers that be." The Constitution is for the purpose of affording legal protection to minorities against the forces exercised by majorities—it is to protect the weak against the strong.

When, therefore, the State legislature, the executive, or any other power attempts to interfere with one's freedom respecting Sabbath rest, the constitution steps in and calls a halt. It directs that no power of the State shall interfere with private rights; that religious belief and worship shall forever be free; that freedom to contract to work on any day shall not be abrogated; that, in short, men shall be men and not slaves. Such is the constitution, and such is the protection it is designed to afford.
