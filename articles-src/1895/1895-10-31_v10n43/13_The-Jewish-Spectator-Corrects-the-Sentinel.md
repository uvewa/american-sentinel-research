# THE "JEWISH SPECTATOR" CORRECTS THE "SENTINEL."

Some weeks ago we printed the following:—

One of the ceremonies observed by Jews in the celebration of Yom Kippur, or the Great Day of Atonement, is the sacrifice of a live chicken by each household.

The head of the house, it is said, swings a live chicken over the head of each member of his family, after which the fowl is killed by the rabbi and eaten by the family.

New York has an ordinance against the sale of live fowls, and it has been the custom of the police to raid the Jewish quarter every year at the Atonement season and arrest all dealers found with live chickens in their shops.

This year the Jews got an injunction, restraining the health authorities from making the customary arrests, but for some reason it proved to be invalid, and the authorities manifested a special zeal in making the raid. About fifty arrests were made on September 27th.

The Jews declare the raid an outrage, and so it was. No sanitary code or other code that interfered similarly with a Roman Catholic festival or with the rights of popular Protestantism could survive a week in New York; and neither should this senseless regulation. It may be wise to restrict to some extent the sale of live fowls in a large city, but to apply such a rule so strictly as to prevent the Jews from observing a time-honored, though it must be confessed, a very foolish religious custom, is an exhibition of despotism more worthy of Russia than it is of an American city.

The Jewish Spectator quotes this and then makes this comment:—

Our worthy contemporary and liberal co-worker does not state the case quite correctly. It is not one of the ceremonies observed by Jews, but only by a number of orthodox Jews, who still cling to this superstitious custom, which has met with disapproval on the part of many celebrated orthodox authors of ritual codexes, and is "more honored in the breach than in the observance" by the intelligent orthodox Jews of New York and other cities. Nor is the chicken killed by the rabbi. [Why use italics?] Any orthodox Jew, an expert in killing fowls, having the permission of an orthodox rabbi, can follow this "bloody business." But the logic of the SENTINEL is sound and to the point. The sanitary code of large cities requires that no fowls should be kept for any length of time by dealers, but in this instance the fowls for Koppores are immediately killed after the performance, hence the raid of the police is but an excrescence of prejudice, and naught else. Had those poor Jews on East Broadway the influence of ward politicians, and of wealthy monopolists, the raid would not have been made with such vindictive zeal.

The Board of Health of the city of New York neglects to enforce many a sanitary regulation much more important and of greater consequences. We are by no means in favor of the above-mentioned custom, fraught with superstition. In fact, we would like to see it suppressed and obliterated—but the policeman's club is not the instrument to do it. Education and a better understanding will lead the more ignorant adherents of Jewish orthodoxy to learn that the sacrificial polity of Israel has ceased, and soon will they, of their own volition, abolish an observance which has no biblical origin and authority, and has always been looked upon as a questionable minkay.

We give place to this as a matter of justice to those Jews who do not "still cling to this superstitious custom," and because we desire to place before our readers only the most reliable information upon all subjects. We were misled as to the exact facts by the daily papers.
