# "BLUE LAWS" REALLY DID EXIST.

[New York Herald, Oct. 7.]

NEW HAVEN, Conn., Oct. 6, 1895.—Attorney Henry G. Newton, of this city, who has a bias in favor of qualut and curious archaeological things, has accomplished some deep-sea dredging in the Elm City archives lately, groping after the authentic story of the famous old "Blue Laws" of the Nutmeg commonwealth. He came up out of the depths a day or two ago, and having divested himself of his antiquarian armor, furnished to the New Haven Historical Society the complete story of his findings.

Mr. Newton's report states positively that there is no such thing as Blue Laws anyhow—they are an out-and-out myth, just like all the rest of the treasured and trusted traditions of the world. In the second place, he alleges, what Blue Laws there are, are simply and solely an Elm City institution.

Attorney Newton says that the old Tory minister, the Rev. Sam Peters, who ran the English church in Hartford and in the Hebron village, among the wild hills to the east of that town, about the time of the Revolution, was to blame for all the Blue Laws ever enacted; that New Haven's alleged code of bluish acts was a fiction of his ingenious but spenetic and malicious brain.

The Rev. Samuel, who was English through and through, was not at all fond of his sharp-witted and cute but sombre-visaged Yankee parishioners and neighbors, and so, after the country, ringing with the peals of liberty bells, had become too warm to hold even a Tory clergymen comfortably and he had scudded back to England, he promptly sat down to his table and wrote his rancid book of Blue Laws—in violet ink, most likely. That was somewhere about 1781, and his famed and wonderful work, which is now one of the curiosities of the earth, embodied more than ten score of the very bluest Blue Laws—of twisted forged cast steel copper riveted, with galvanized wrought iron gearings—all the Blue Laws, in fact, that have been imputed to the handiwork of "blue," long-nosed, lean and vinegar visaged Yankees.

# "HUMBUG AND FRAUD."

"Many years ago," said Lawyer Newton in discussing the subject, "a small book containing these supposed Blue Laws, which were really extracts from Peters' history, was published, and is even now referred to as an authority by the unsuspicious. I saw them, and my anger was kindled, for does not every dictionary and encyclopedia say they are a humbug and a fraud, and has not Trumbull's 'Blue Laws, True and False,' put an end to the infamous slander? And so it seemed to be time to say something about Blue Laws.

"Now, then, the existence of such a code of Blue Laws is fully disproved; in fact, the only authority in its favor is Peters himself, who is untrustworthy. Peters' 'History of Connecticut'—the Blue Laws are embodied therein—was first published in London in 1781. It was put forth anonymously, and its title page bore the inscription. 'By a Gentleman of the Province.' That its author hated Connecticut is hardly to be doubted, and New Haven seems to have been foremost among the objects of his detestation. My special purpose is to show how much of Peters' Blue Laws was actually in force in New Haven before the union of the New Haven colony with the colony of Connecticut; how much a hundred years thereafter and how much now."

To that end he minutely and specifically examined each one of Samuel Peters' forty-five Blue Laws, and carefully compared or contrasted the whole batch with the actual codes of laws of the Nutmeg State and of the colonies.

# DOESN'T DISPROVE THEIR ACCURACY.

He found them, he said, to be a literal reproduction of old-time Connecticut or New Haven colony acts. Indeed, instead of refuting and confuting the old Tory minister's Blue-Law law book, Attorney Newton's disquisition showed, if it showed anything, that Mr. Samuel Peters was an admirably exact reporter, or, at least, copyist.

In fact, it is not easy to comprehend just what Mr. Newton's contention about Blue Laws is, unless he erroneously imagines that it is the popular idea that the colonies enacted a special and distinct code of adamantine laws, and in so many words gave it the theatrical title of "Connecticut Blue Laws." But no one, probably, ever supposed any such thing. And certainly, so long as it is proven that the Rev. Samuel Peters' book is a fairly accurate compilation or summary of the exceptionally rigorous and iron edged Puritanic enactments of either the New Haven or Connecticut colonies, then Mr. Newton's averment that the Blue Laws are a myth is as incomprehensible as it is pointless.

Here are some of Peters' bluest laws, all of which are identical, in a vital sense, with old colonial enactments:—

No. 1. (Curious rather than blue.) The governor and magistrates convened and General Assembly are the supreme power under God of this independent dominion.

No. 2. From the determination of the Assembly no appeal shall be made.

No. 10. No one shall be a freeman or give a vote unless he be converted and a member in full communion of one of the churches allowed in this dominion.

No. 12. Each freeman shall swear by the blessed God to bear true allegiance to this dominion, and that Jesus is the only King.

No. 13. No Quaker or dissenter from the established worship of this dominion shall be allowed to give a vote for the election of magistrates or any other officer.

No. 14. No food or lodging shall be afforded to a Quaker, Adamite, or other heretic.

No. 15. If any person turns Quaker he shall be banished, and not suffered to return under pain of death.

BARS UP TO PRIESTS.

No. 16. No priest shall abide in this dominion; he shall be banished, and suffer death on his return. Priests may be seized by any one without a warrant.

No. 18. No one shall ride on the sabbath day or walk in his garden or elsewhere, except reverently to and from meeting.

No. 19. No one shall travel, cook victuals, make beds, sweep house, cut hair or shave on the sabbath day.

No. 20. No woman shall kiss her child on the sabbath day.

No. 21. The sabbath shall begin at sunset on Saturday. [Mr. Newton, commenting, said: "The twenty-first Blue Law, making the sabbath begin at sunset, was, of course, the law of the New Haven Colony and the law of our forefathers down to a comparatively recent period. Under the Mosaic law Sabbath began at sunset, and such has been the law of the Sabbath since the evening and the morning of the first day."]

No. 22. To pick an ear of corn growing in a neighbor's garden shall be deemed a theft.

No. 24. When it appears that an accused has confederates, and he refuses to discover them, he may be racked. [This is about the only Peters' Blue Law to which Mr. Newton refuses to give a foundation in fact. He says: "I do not find any indication that this statement is true, and Trumbull says it is false." Anyhow, it is by no means a monstrously Blue Law, as compared with some of the black-and blue ones already quoted.]

No. 27. Whosoever publishes a lie to the prejudice of his neighbor, shall sit in the stocks or be whipped fifteen stripes.

No. 28. No minister shall keep a school.

DEATH FOR MEN STEALERS.

No. 30. Men stealers shall suffer death.

No. 31. Whosoever wears clothes trimmed with gold, silver or bone lace, above two shillings by the yard, shall be presented by the grand jurors, and the selectmen shall tax the offender at 300 pounds estate.

No. 33. Whosoever sets a fire in the woods, and it burns a house, shall suffer death; and persons suspected of this crime shall be imprisoned without benefit of bail.

No. 34. Whosoever brings cards or dice into this dominion shall pay a fine of five pounds.

No. 35. No one shall read common prayer, keep Christmas, or Saints' day, make minced pies, dance, play cards, or play on any instrument of music, except the drum, trumpet and jewsharp.

No. 40. Adultery shall be punished with death.

PARENTAL CONSENT NECESSARY.

No. 43. No man shall court a maid in person or by letter without first obtaining the consent of her parents; five pound penalty for the first offense; ten pound penalty for the second, and for the third imprisonment during the pleasure of the court.

No. 44. Married persons must live together or be imprisoned.

No. 45. Every male shall have his hair cut round according to a cap.

In conclusion and self-contradiction, the lawyer frankly admitted that "the Blue Laws of Peters are, for the most part, a reasonably correct statement of the law and practice of our forefathers of New Haven. Some of them are exaggerations; a few are fictitious, but probably not intentionally so."
