# ALL SUNDAY LAWS INTOLERANT.

The intolerant character of all Sunday laws, even the most "liberal," is illustrated from a legal standpoint, as follows, by a writer in the Boston Investigator, who signs himself, "An Iowa Lawyer":—

John Doe and Richard Roe are arrested on Monday morning, accused of the crime? of working on Sunday. Mr. Doe, on being arraigned, pleads not guilty, but admits that he had worked all day on Sunday, and that it was not the work of either necessity or charity. The court says that he shall have to find the defendant guilty under the law which provides:

Section 4,072, Code of Iowa: "If any person be found on the first day of the week, commonly called sabbath, engaged . . . buying or selling property of any kind, or in any labor, the work of necessity and charity only excepted, . . . shall be fined in a sum not more than five dollars nor less than one dollar, . . . and shall be committed to the jail of said county until said fine, together with cost of prosecution, shall be paid."

Mr. Doe.—But, your honor, let me read the balance of that section, as follows: "But nothing herein contained shall be construed to extend to those who conscientiously observe the seventh day of the week as the Sabbath."

Now, sir, it is true that I worked all day yesterday, but I conscientiously observed Saturday as my Sabbath.

The Court.—These facts, then, will change the nature of the case. Your conscience, although a matter of perhaps education, or a whim of your own, eliminates the element of crime from the case, and you are acquitted.

The case of Mr. Roe is called; and he pleads not guilty. Admits that he rested on Saturday and worked all day on Sunday, alongside of Mr. Doe.

Did you conscientiously observe Saturday as your Sabbath, or was your labor on Sunday that of necessity or charity?

Mr. Doe.—My conscience prompts me to tell the truth. There was no matter of conscience with me in resting on Saturday; it was a matter of personal preference; nor was there any necessity or charity in my labor on Sunday. I did it for the money. My conscience does not require me to observe any one day more than another. I disturbed no one with my labor, nor did I infringe upon the rights of any one.

The Court.—Your conscience prompting you to tell the truth, and not going to the extent of requiring you to observe one day as a sabbath, constitutes you a criminal. It is the duty of the court to protect society against the acts of criminals. Our statutes, unlike those of Tennessee, are quite liberal. In this State you have the choice of two days, while in that State you are limited to one. If you cannot conscientiously observe the one, we will compel you to observe the other. This law is destined to regulate the conscience of the citizen in case the citizen will not regulate it himself, so as to keep one day at least.

Such is one of the absurdities of Sunday "laws."
