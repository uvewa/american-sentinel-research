New York, December 12, 1895.

As one receiving the AMERICAN SENTINEL without having ordered it may know that it is sent to him by some friend. Therefore, those who have not ordered the SENTINEL need have no fears that they will be asked to pay for it.

The "Christian" nations of Europe would put a stop to the slaughter going on in Armenia, which is shocking the whole civilized world, for they have plenty of power; only they are too jealous of each other, and each is too fearful that the others will get the advantage of her, should she give them the least chance to do so. This is national "Christianity."

On another page we print an account of a recent trial and conviction at Olney, Ill., under the Sunday statute of that State, as viewed by one not an observer of the seventh-day Sabbath. The paper from which the report is taken says editorially: "The trial of a Seventh-day Adventist for breaking the sabbath, which occurred in Olney the past week, met with but one general verdict in the minds of the masses,—'persecution.'"

Reader, for which of two things do you entertain most respect,—for a statute enacted by men? or for justice? If you respect the law, do you respect it merely because men have enacted it? or because you deem it just? If you deemed it unjust, would you consider it more entitled to respect than that which would be justice in the same matter? If you respect a statute simply because it is the "law," though unjust, do you think that in passing such a "law" men have legislated justice out of existence upon that point? Then is there not always a divine law of justice covering every case? and ought not the primary consideration with respect to all human legislation to be not, What is the statute? but What is the law of justice?

While there is in our country an almost universal sentiment against a "union of Church and State," it is unfortunately true that the meaning of the expression is, in the popular conception, decidedly vague; and, what is worse, it is in many minds altogether different from what is meant by a union of the State with religion; so that while there would be an almost unanimous expression of opinion against a union of the State with some one religious body of Christendom, there would be very much less opposition to an effort to unite the work of the State with the inculcation of the "general principles" of the Christian religion. In the one case the opposition might spring wholly from a selfish motive of jealousy on the part of other denominations than the particular one chosen to be the recipient of State aid, and not from any opposition to the inherent injustice of the scheme. Such sentiment constitutes no safeguard to religious freedom. The true champion of human liberty acts from a love of liberty itself, and from a desire to see all mankind in the enjoyment of their common, God-given heritage.

The Evening Sun, of this city, had in its issue of the 25th ult., this item of news:—

Jacob Levy, of 145 East Broadway, was arraigned in the Essex Market Police Court this morning by Policeman Holland, of the Madison Street station on a charge of having sold an overcoat yesterday in violation of the Sunday law.

The policeman was passing Levy's place yesterday when he saw a woman and a boy in the store. The boy had a new overcoat on, and the policeman concluded that it had just been purchased. He arrested the proprietor.

Magistrate Wentworth, after hearing the case, discharged Levy.

The same policeman also arraigned Louis Samuelson, of 49 East Broadway, on a similar charge. The prisoner said that he always observed Saturday as his Sabbath. He said that he did not know that he was violating the law. He was discharged.

The same paper told of the arrest of John Stimmel, proprietor, and Max DeWinter, a waiter, for selling a glass of soda-water. They were both held for trial in General Sessions.

Such arrests simply illustrate the absurdity of Sunday legislation.
