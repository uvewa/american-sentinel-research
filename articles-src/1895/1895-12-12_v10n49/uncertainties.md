# Uncertainties Log - v10n49 (1895-12-12)

## Page 1, Column 1
- **OCR error corrected:** "AMERICAN SPORTING" appears to be "AMERICAN SENTINEL" (header clearly shows SENTINEL in context)
- **Confidence:** HIGH - confirmed by context and publication name

## Page 2, Column 2
- **Text obscured:** Footnote numbering appears inconsistent (multiple "²" references on same page)
- **Transcribed as:** Kept footnote marks as they appear in OCR
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM - may need verification against original

## Page 3, Column 2
- **Punctuation uncertain:** "But that was not the final end" - "Be that" appears to be OCR error for "But"
- **Transcribed as:** "Be that was not the final end"
- **Confidence:** LOW - appears to be OCR error, should likely read "But that was not"
- **Corrected to:** "But that was not" (obvious OCR error)

## Page 5, Column 1
- **Word uncertain:** "larefut" appears in context "it is larefut to do well on the Sabbath"
- **Transcribed as:** "larefut"
- **Confidence:** LOW - likely OCR error for "lawful"
- **Corrected to:** "lawful" (contextually clear)

## Page 7
- **Advertisement text garbled:** Price information and formatting severely corrupted by OCR
- **Transcribed as:** Kept OCR output as is (advertisements not substantive content)
- **Confidence:** LOW - but not critical to preserve

## General OCR Issues
- Multiple instances of "·" appearing between words (Greek text sample)
- Greek text sample heavily corrupted - kept as is since it's illustrative material
- Some price/formatting information in ads is garbled but left as OCR produced it

## Corrections Made
1. "AMERICAN SPORTING" → "AMERICAN SENTINEL" (obvious OCR error in header)
2. "Be that was not" → "But that was not" (obvious contextual error)
3. "larefut" → "lawful" (obvious contextual error)
4. "Senktor" → "Senator" (obvious OCR error)
5. Page 1 masthead: "CALVIN P. BOLLMAN, | ASSISTANT EDITOR. LEON A. SMITH," appears to have layout issue - corrected to show Leon A. Smith as Assistant Editor based on 1895 editorial structure
