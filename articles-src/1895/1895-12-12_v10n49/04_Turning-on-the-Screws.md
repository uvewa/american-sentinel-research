## TURNING ON THE SCREWS.

It is evident that neither the recent political victory of Tammany nor the experience of a period of strict enforcement of the New York Sunday "law," has weakened the intention of the present city government to proceed the full length of the statute in the direction of enforced Sunday observance. Commissioner Roosevelt's threat that should Tammany win at the polls, he would turn the screws (of Sunday legislation) on harder than ever, is in process of execution.

The situation at present is outlined by the following, published in the Mail and Express, of Nov. 30:—

In consequence of the decision of Judge Allison, in General Sessions on Tuesday, when he dismissed an indictment against Peter Felser, a delicatessen dealer, of 1361 Third ave., who had been arrested for selling sausage on Sunday, there has been some doubt as to what course the police would pursue in enforcing the Sunday law.

Acting Chief Conlin to-day made a plain statement regarding the matter. He said: "In the case of the man Felser, I understand the indictment was dismissed because the evidence was weak. I shall enforce the Sunday law just the same as before. Bakeries and delicatessen stores can sell up to 10 o'clock in the forenoon. After that hour they cannot sell anything excepting prepared food to be eaten on the premises. There are many bakeries where light lunches are served, like coffee and cake. In these places there will be no police interference after 10 o'clock, providing what they sell is not carried away, but eaten right there.

"The situation is the same regarding delicatessen stores. They can sell until 10 o'clock a. m., but after that if they sell any prepared food it must be consumed in the place. If they sell goods to be taken away after 10 o'clock, they will be arrested for violating the Sunday law. Section 267 of the Penal Code

is very plain and covers the point. It says that all manner of public selling or offering for sale of any property on Sunday is prohibited, except that articles of food may be sold and supplied at any time before 10 o'clock in the morning, and except also that meals may be sold to be eaten on the premises where sold or served elsewhere by caterers. The captains have instructions to enforce the Sunday law under the provisions of this act."

The "law" is to be enforced a step at a time; and its demands having been secured on one point, attention will be given to the next in the logical sequence of Sunday enforcement. But where will the process end? Doubtless the logical end of this crusade is not discernible to most of those engaged in it, perhaps not to any; but we may learn from Scripture what it will be. The culmination of the process of the restriction of buying and selling, by the force of popular deference to that institution to which the papacy—the apocalyptic "beast,"—points as the sign of her authority,—the Sunday sabbath, is thus foretold: "And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads; and that so man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name." Rev. 13: 16, 17.

At present the general public are rather slow to see the propriety and reasonableness of the demands of the Sunday statute, and very naturally so, since neither reason nor justice affords a foundation for such legislation. Indeed, the features of the "law" strongly remind one of the ancient Jewish legislation on the Sabbath question, by which they loaded the Sabbath institution with numberless requirements and distinctions altogether without support in either reason or revelation. But what they produced was simply the result of human legislation concerning an institution with which no human power has any business to meddle. Their work—the pharisaical sabbath—stands as a type of the product of human legislation upon Sabbath observance.

But in process of time—and that not long—public sentiment will doubtless acquiesce in the various proceedings required by the anomalous features of the Sunday statutes; and when once such proceedings become the custom, few people with whom they do not interfere will stop to ask whether they are reasonable or just. The Sunday-Juggernaut is in motion, and is designed to crush all such as will not pay homage to the institution of the "beast."
