## YOUR RIGHT TO THINK.

An individual's right to think is inseparable from his right to act in accordance with the dictates of his best judgment and of his conscience. If he has no right thus to act, he has no right to think.

By this it is not meant that an individual's proper liberty in this respect is unlimited. No person has any right, under the plea of liberty, to invade the rights of another. Rights do not conflict. When a person's liberty, so-called, would lead him to encroach upon the rights of his neighbors, he has passed from the sphere of liberty to that of license; he has passed beyond the domain of his own rights, and beyond what reason or necessity require of any individual.

But there is a sphere of natural individual rights, which we cannot too carefully consider. We hold these truths to be self-evident; that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness." These are the rights of every individual. Governments are instituted to preserve these rights, but not to prescribe the manner of their exercise. In other words, the civil government is not instituted to do the thinking for individuals. Our Government is supposed to be a government of the people and by the people, as much as for the people. Its actions should represent the thought of the people.

God himself, who is all-powerful and allwise, does not invade any person's liberty of thought. He it is who has given each one the power, and with it the right, to think for himself. But power and liberty of thought would be a curse rather than a blessing without the accompanying right to carry that thought into execution. An individual judgment and a conscience would, without that right, be but the means of torture to their possessor. It is not for such a purpose that a loving and all-wise Creator has thus endowed the human mind.

God will neither compel man's mind, nor relieve it of the necessity of action; and he has not delegated to any lesser being the right to do that from which he himself abstains. The Creator wants men in his world that he has made, not automations or slaves. He wants virtue, honesty, and all the traits of true manliness, and not imbecility. Therefore he wants his creatures to think, and think for themselves, and has given them minds in order that they may think, and that they may act for themselves as well. He who ceases to act for himself will soon cease to think for himself, and he who does not think for himself is fit only to become the inmate of some institution of charity.

When we surrender the right to act for ourselves in all matters which do not involve a violation of the rights of others, we logically surrender our right to think. Reader, are you ready to make this surrender?
