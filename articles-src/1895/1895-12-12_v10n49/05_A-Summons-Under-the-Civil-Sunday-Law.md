## A SUMMONS UNDER THE "CIVIL" SUNDAY "LAW."

We have received from A. O. Burrill, the Adventist Elder at Chatham, Ont., a copy of the summons served upon him, Nov. 29, by the civil authorities for working on Sunday. It reads thus:—

### SUMMONS TO DEFENDANT.

Canada: Province of Ontario, County of Kent.

To A. O. Burrill, of the Township of Chatham, in the County of Kent.

WHEREAS, you have this day been charged before the undersigned, Geo. A. Watson, a justice of the peace, in and for the said County of Kent, for that you on the third day of November, A. D. 1895, at the Township of Chatham, in the County of Kent, did exercise worldly labor, being the Lord's day (the sabbath day), by working at the carpenter and mason work.

These are therefore to command you, in her Majesty's name, to be and appear before me on Thursday the fifth day of December, A. D. 1895, at ten o'clock in the forenoon, at the Old Town Hall, Ridgetown, or before such other justice or justices of the peace for the same County of Kent as shall be there, to answer

to the said charge and to be further dealt with according to law. Herein fall not.

Given under my hand and seal this twenty-second day of November, in the year 1895, at Ridgetown, in the county aforesaid.

GEO. A. WATSON, J. P.

Mr. Burrill adds: "We were at work erecting a new church building at Darrell. The Methodists, who have a church building about one mile away, formed a league and appointed a committee to watch us and lay complaints, which they did." The reader will see that Pastor Burrill's violation of the Sunday statute was of a very aggravating nature,—assisting in the erection of what the Methodists regarded as a rival house of worship. The reader will also observe that this summons affords clear(?) evidence of the purely civil nature of the Sunday statute. Yet the law-enforced Sunday is just as much a civil institution in Canada, as it is in the United States.

Our next issue will probably contain a report of the trial of Mr. Burrill and three other members of the Adventist Church of Darrell, who are under similar arrest.
