## THE LOGIC OF IT.

[Sabbath Recorder, Dec. 5, 1895.]

The tide seems to be setting in very heavily in favor of a union of Church and State, a sentiment that to the majority hitherto has been very repugnant. This effort now appears to have only a partial application, and would not be tolerated at all were it not for the purpose of enforcing the observance of Sunday and thus overriding the conscientious convictions and guaranteed rights of many loyal citizens. To carry this one point of religious legislation, Protestants unite with Roman Catholics, reformers with conservatives, and political organizations consort together to compel all men to bow to the will of the majority in matters of conscience. Carried out logically in States where Baptists happen to be in the majority, a law may be passed compelling all who would enter into church relationship to be immersed, forbidding infant baptism by methods now acceptable to pedo-baptists. Then, when the latter is in the ascendancy it would be easy to secure legislation forbidding baptism by immersion, since sprinkling is believed to be more convenient, and accompanied by less exposure. Therefore as a health measure, for the public good, immersion would be ruled out. Just such a condition now exists in Saxony (Europe,) where Baptists are forbidden to immerse or do anything to disturb the quiet of the Lutherans.
