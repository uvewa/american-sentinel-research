## A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

WHILE so much is being said and done in nearly every State of the Union to turn back the tide of human progress in liberty of thought and practice toward the religious despotism of the Dark Ages, it is pleasant to note here and there a break in the current, which gives evidence that the principles of religious freedom still live in the hearts of men, and that many minds in high stations are still bent toward that human liberty which was the goal of the efforts of our forefathers. Such an incident was the recent passage by the Georgia House, of the following resolution, introduced by Representative Hurst:—

Resolved by the House, the Senate concurring, That any movement either in this State or in the United States tending towards a union of Church and State is deprecated and condemned, and in our opinion is contrary to the principles of our government and the Constitution of the same.

This resolution was introduced in the Georgia legislature two years ago, and has been carefully fostered by its promoters ever since. It passed the House by a good majority, which result is believed to be largely due to the influence of the AMERICAN SENTINEL, which has been regularly supplied to the members during the past year.

It is to be hoped that this action by the Georgia House, with the check recently put upon Sunday prosecutions in Tennessee, will do something to stem the tide of religious persecution, temporarily at least, in that section of our country.
