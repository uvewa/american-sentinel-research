## THE ADVENTIST'S TRIAL.

[Clay County (Ill.) Advocate, Nov. 29.]

The case of the People vs. Ross Foll, John Foll, George Dunlap, J. C. Schnell, and Charles Schnell was called Thursday morning at Olney. It was a test case, Ross Foll being the defendant, the others being bound. The selection of a jury was not an easy matter, as it took nearly three hours to impanel it. It was made up of the following sects: Methodist 1, Christian 2, Baptist 1, Catholic 1, German Reformed 2, United Brethren 1, non-professors 4.

H. G. Morris, attorney for State, and Hon. R. N. McCaulay, of Olney, and Judge G. A. Hoff, of Flora, for the defendants.

The case was tried under the Sunday statute, Criminal Code, par. 317, sec. 216, chap. 38, which reads as follows:—

Whoever disturbs the peace and good order of society by labor (works of necessity and charity excepted) or by any amusement or diversion on Sunday, shall be fined not exceeding $25. This section shall not be construed to prevent watermen and railroad companies from landing their passengers, or watermen from loading or unloading their cargoes, or ferrymen from carrying over the water travelers and persons moving their families, on the first day of the week, nor to prevent the due exercise of the rights of conscience by whomever thinks proper to keep any other day as a sabbath.

## THE PROSECUTION.

The prosecution produced evidence claiming that the minds of the witnesses were disturbed by seeing defendant plowing on Sunday, July 28. He claims to have been disturbed by the defendant talking to the team. He is not a member of any church. He also admitted that the defendant was of good moral character. He denied on cross-examination that he was guilty of making a bee-hive on the same date and "was not at home after 9 o'clock that morning."

The second witness had substantially the same yarn to spin. He also belongs to no church.

The third witness was a woman, and her only complaint seemed to be that she hated to see a good man like the defendant work on Sunday.

The fourth witness allowed her prejudice to get the better of her in the following tirade: "Those that were good Christians before the 'cranks' came are now 'cranks,' and violating the laws of God, the State of Illinois, and the Constitution of the United States. I want to raise my children [she has none at the present time, so it is said] in the proper manner." Her conscience hurt her so at the sight of a nice boy working on Sunday that she has not been able to sleep since.

## THE DEFENSE.

The defense then placed Ross Foll on the stand, and he admitted that he worked six days (including Sunday) and rested on the Sabbath (Saturday) according to the commandment. He believes in the teachings of the Seventh-day Adventists.

The second witness testified that he assisted the prosecuting witness in making a bee-hive on the same Sunday. (The prosecuting witness denied this charge in his examination.)

The third witness testified that he knew the defendant to be a quiet Christian boy and his character above reproach.

The fourth witness lives on the same farm as the defendant, was with him on the sabbath in question, but did not hear the noises which the prosecution claim.

The attorneys on each side consumed fifty minutes each in citing the law and reviewing the testimony to the jury, and after five hours deliberation they returned a verdict of guilty, fining defendant $1.

The case will be taken to the higher court.
