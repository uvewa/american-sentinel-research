## WRESTING THE SCRIPTURES.

Our attention was recently called to an illustrated book for children, in which was related the story of some of the works of mercy done by our Lord on the "Sabbath;" and in this connection the names "Sabbath" and "Sunday" are used interchangeably, with at least the seeming purpose to lend the children to believe that Sunday is the Sabbath, and that the Saviour so regarded it. This is nothing short of a wicked wresting of the Scriptures. Such writers should heed the injunction, "Lie not against the truth."

Sunday is not the Sabbath, and never was, and to substitute that name for "Sabbath," and to tell how "Christ healed on Sunday because it is larefut to do well on the Sabbath," cannot be too strongly condemned. The child so instructed is apt to sustain a rude shock when he learns, as he must sooner or later, how his credulity has been imposed upon; and to say the least, his confidence in his religious instructors is destroyed and his faith in the Scriptures weakened in a like degree.

Sunday is a false sabbath and it ought to have a monopoly of false support. But we are sorry to say that it has not, for some people, in their zeal for the true Sabbath, sustained as it is by a "Thus saith the Lord," many times repeated, resort to methods and "arguments" no better than that instanced as used in behalf of Sunday. One of these more than doubtful "arguments" is the effort to show that Christ did not rise from the dead on the first day of the week; just as though it made any difference.

Another even more objectionable attempt to steady the ark of divine truth, came under our notice recently; it is nothing less than an effort to prove by bringing together the 4th and 11th verses of the 18th chapter of Acts, that Paul held seventy-eight Sabbath meetings at Corinth! Even a child who would take the trouble to read from the 4th to the 11th verses inclusive ought to know better. The Sabbath, resting as it does upon the immutable word of God, needs no such "support."

It is doubtful if the Apostle Paul spent the entire "year and six months" of Acts 18:11 in the city of Corinth. One writer says:—

It is recorded that Paul labored a year and six months in Corinth. His efforts, however, were not exclusively confined to that city, but he availed himself of the easy communication by land and water with adjacent cities, and labored among them both by letter and personal effort. He made Corinth his headquarters,

and his long tarry and successful ministry there gave him influence abroad as well as at home.—Sketches from the Life of Paul. p. 109.

Even a good cause is weakened by a poor or false argument, and for this reason we are pained to see anything that even appears to be a wrestling of the Scriptures in the supposed interests of truth. Truth is never served by falsehood. Sound doctrine never consorts with error, and the pen picture that represents truth as leaning upon the arm of falsehood inflicts upon truth a wound from which she recovers only because "the eternal years of God are hers."
