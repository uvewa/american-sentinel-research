AGAINST SUNDAY STATUTES.

Views of a Prominent Southerner.

The New Orleans Times-Democrat, of Nov. 28, 1895, quotes as follows the substance of a recent interview of a committee of the Ascension and Donaldsonville (La.) Board of Trade, with Hon. Wm. P. Miles, in which the latter expressed himself strongly against all legisl-

tion of the nature of Sunday "laws." Mr. Miles said in substance:—

I am opposed to all religious legislation of whatever character. All religious and creeds in our free country should stand upon an equal footing, and it is not right to compel an observance of the Christian sabbath by the Israelite or the followers of Confucius. If we have a Sunday law it should bear equally upon all, which is not the case with the existing statute. I am inimical to all legislation of a puritanical character or tendency; and although a church member, I have no objection to trading on Sunday by those who find it more convenient and profitable to do so on that day.

Theaters and other places of amusement are permitted to be open on Sunday, and it is right that they should be; and if a merchant chooses to keep his store open on that day, I think he should have that privilege just as the other merchant who so prefers may close his store and observe the day as one of rest or recreation.

Being asked if he regarded the Sunday law undemocratic, Mr. Miles replied that he did not consider it a political question in any manner, and did not see how it could be made so unless one party assumed the pretension of greater sanctity than its opponents, and he did not anticipate that the Democratic party contemplated taking any such stand. He confessed that from a standpoint of personal interest, sugar planters might be disposed to favor the Sunday law, as it had relieved them in great measure of the drawback formerly experienced of laborers getting drunk on Sunday and not being able to do a fair day's work on Monday; but he regarded the principle of such legislation as utterly wrong, and hence had no hesitation in announcing himself opposed to the Sunday law and favorable to its repeal.

It will be observed that this expression of opinion leaves room for doubt as to whether Mr. Miles would not favor a Sunday statute which would "bear equally upon all." This constitutes a weak point in the views of many who are in general opposed to Sunday legislation. The truth is, that a Sunday "law" is in its very nature an unequal thing. It cannot be made to fit into the conditions which have always prevailed and must prevail among men, so as to bear equally upon all. And even equality, while abstractly a virtue, loses its good character in such a case. Equality of application can never justify a thing that is in its very nature an evil.

In nearly every case of persecution that has arisen under the Sunday statutes, it has been claimed by their advocates that they bore equally upon all classes. But so long as there are people left in the world who keep the law of Jehovah,—that law which says, "The seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God; in it thou shalt not do any work," there will be those upon whom a Sunday statute must of necessity bear with much greater severity that it will on others.

In many cases an effort is made to equalize matters by an "exemption" clause releasing from the demands of the statute such persons as conscientiously observe another day than Sunday as the Sabbath. But if a Sunday "law" is right, if it is a proper law for the civil power to enact, why should it exempt a certain class of citizens on account of their religious belief? This only adds another inequality to the "law," and helps to demonstrate the fact that under the existing status of human society, no Sunday statute is possible which can present in its working the essential features of consistency and equality of application.
