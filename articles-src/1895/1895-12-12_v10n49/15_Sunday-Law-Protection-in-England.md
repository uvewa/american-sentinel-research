## SUNDAY "LAW" PROTECTION IN ENGLAND.

Under the working of the Sunday "law" of England which applies to labor done in factories, the publishing office of the Present Truth, 451 Holloway Road, North London, has been obliged to close its manufacturing department, owing to repeated fines and seizures of property used in operating the plant.

The "law," which says that women and minors must not work in factories on Sundays, was designed to protect this class of individuals from the unscrupulous greed of factory owners and operators. Its purpose was thus a very good one. But this good purpose, sought to be carried out by a Sunday "law," has resulted in some strange proceedings, and in injury to the ones whom it aimed to benefit.

For several years the publishing house in question, all whose employés regularly rest on the seventh day, observing it as the Sabbath, was permitted to do its work unmolested; the officials knowing that no hardship or oppression at which the law aimed existed within it. But latterly they or their successors became seized with an inspiration to apply the Sunday "law" to the case; and this brought before the operatives the following alternatives:—

1. They could renounce Christianity and become Jews, or proclaim themselves such, and continue their work as usual; the "law" containing an exemption for Jews. This the visiting officials repeatedly urged them to do.

2. They could comply with the law, and rest on Sunday, thus violating their conscientious convictions of right and duty as defined by the fourth commandment, besides suffering the financial loss involved by Sunday idleness; or,—

3. They could continue to work as usual, adhering to their convictions of duty, and suffer whatever consequences their disregard of the "law" might bring upon them.

They chose the latter alternative, and the machinery of legal compulsion was speedily set in motion, with the result which has been stated.

Formerly, for several weeks, the employés affected by the statute, ceased work on Sundays, in the endeavor to conform to its demands. Some of them felt keenly the hardship of the loss of a whole day's wages each week from their limited income; but they could comfort(?) themselves with the thought that they were "protected"! Now they are thrown out of employment altogether (unless they have found new employment, which in England is a matter of great difficulty) and are brought face to face with all the hardships of enforced idleness, without the means of support; but—they are "protected"!

Speaking of the seizures which have resulted in closing their manufacturing department, the Present Truth, of Nov. 28, says:—

We have no words of reproach for those who are engaged in this work of spoliation. They are to be pitied rather than blamed. We are sure that personally they dislike the business, but are moved by a mistaken sense of duty. They are in the tolls of the papal system, which has infected all nations, and which puts earthly governments in the place of God, and so they imagine that they are "compelled" to enforce laws regardless of how much they conflict with the law of God.

The end is not yet. God is not dead, nor asleep, nor indifferent. "He hath appointed a day in the which he will judge the world in righteousness." Then that divine law, which is now so lightly set aside by legislators and judges, will be the accuser, and "the Lord alone will be exalted in that day." "The mighty man shall cry there bitterly." Who will be wise in time to have God's truth a protection instead of a destruction?

We may well beware of the Sunday "law" and its "protection."
