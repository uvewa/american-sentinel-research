MEANING OF THE OATH OF OFFICE.

[By Addison Blakely, Ph. D., Lecturer in Political Science and History, University of Chicago.]

It is an important political fact that our free Government with its Constitution and Declaration of Rights is the result of a hundred struggles for freedom and a century of battles for liberty. Never did a generation pass but what the authorities in control have attempted either to infringe upon or to override the rights of the people. Treason has been a cloak to shield a myriad of governmental crimes. When the Constitution was adopted it had yet been scarce a hundred years since Rev. John James, a Seventh-day Baptist preacher of England, had been hanged, drawn and quartered for his "treasonable" ideas in opposition to the religious views of the persons then having charge of the State. Not only that, but "after he was dead, his heart was taken out and burned, his quarters were affixed to the gates of the city, and his head was set up in Whitechapel on a pole opposite the alley in which his meeting-house stood."

The Constitution of the United States, for the purpose of preventing any such crimes against opponents of Sunday laws or others in America, very wisely provided that "treason against the United States shall consist only in levying war against them, or in adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort." The enthusiastic Sundayist, no matter how many statutes he may use to throw Sabbatarians in jail, has been stripped of one of his most important weapons of the past.

But the Constitution goes further. It exacts of every official,—legislative, executive, and judicial,—an oath to support the Constitution of the United States, any "law" or statute to the contrary notwithstanding. It imposes this oath not only upon the judge who applies the law to the case before the court, but it imposes the oath upon every officer through whose hands any accused person may go. Any member of the legislature who knowingly votes for an unconstitutional Sunday bill, any officer who wittingly arrests a person under an unconstitutional Sunday statute, or any justice who understandingly condemns one under such a "law," is a violator of his oath of office and a perjurer before God and the law. The law attempts to protect all in their equal rights, and it attempts to throw around each person ample Constitutional safeguard. It is therefore that every person delegated to enforce the law in any position, high or low, swears to support the Constitution.

The provisions concerning the oath of office under the United States are as follows:—

The senators and representatives before-mentioned, and the members of the several State legislatures, and all executive and judicial officers, both of the United States and of the several States, shall be bound by oath or affirmation to support this Constitution; but no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States.

The oath of office in the State of Illinois is as follows:—

I do solemnly swear (or affirm, as the case may be) that I will support the Constitution of the United States and the constitution of the State of Illinois, and that I will faithfully discharge the duties of the office of — according to the best of my ability.

It should be noticed that his oath of office binds him to support only the Constitutions. All obligations resting upon him he derives from that document. He can receive no power or authority of any kind whatever from any statute or pretended law not made in pursuance of that high authority. And as he is bound to the best of his ability to carry out his oath, he is constitutionally bound to the best of his ability to judge whether he is obeying the Constitution when he is called upon to enforce some statute, or execute some act in connection with the office which he holds.

In other words, the very purpose of this oath of office was to make the Constitution supreme. In the first place, every member of the legislature swears to support the Constitution, and in voting for what law shall be, is bound to vote only in harmony with the supreme law. But legislatures have, in the past, usurped authority, and therefore the Constitution, in the second place, exacts of the officer who is to execute the law an oath that he will enforce only statutes in harmony with the Constitution. He must take notice, according to his oath, whether or not they conflict with the supreme law. If the legislature has overstepped its legal power, he is bound to stick to the Constitution, and not to such unlawful statute. And in the third place, the same principle applies to the judiciary.

Under our system of government there is a threefold guard placed around the Constitution and the rights of the people. These are (1) the oath of the legislature—the body whose office it is to declare the law; (2) the oath of the judiciary—the body whose office it is to apply the law in the particular cases that may arise of violation; and (3) the oath of the executive—the body whose office it is to enforce the law. Each body, however, is legally independent of the other, all receiving their authority from a common source—the Constitution.

No one department takes any oath to obey or support the acts of any other department, and it is their duty to do so only so far as such duty is laid upon them by the supreme law itself. It is therefore evident that the support or enforcement of any Sunday statute or any other unconstitutional "law" can never become a legal duty; but on the contrary, every official swears that he will not support them because opposed to that fundamental law which is his sole official guide. Such "laws" to him must be as though they were not.
