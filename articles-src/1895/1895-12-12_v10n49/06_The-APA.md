THE A. P. A.

The purpose of the A. P. A., in so far as it means the preservation of American civil freedom and American civil institutions from the encroachments of religious bigotry, is a worthy one; but the methods of the organization cannot be commended. As an illustration of the latter we notice the following press report of recent A. P. A. work in a Kentucky town:—

The emissaries of the A. P. A. have been successful in re-introducing religious services in the public schools at Bellevue, Ky. The motion was a surprise to the majority of the school board, and though many protested against it, when the time to vote came, in addition to Rev. Chas. M. Gallimore, who introduced the motion, and Mr. Burgtorf who seconded it, Messrs. Peacock and Vance voted in favor of it, leaving Mr. Mayer's vote the only dissenting one. When those in favor of the sectarian resolution were asked about the motive of their action, they said: "We did it to annoy the Catholics and keep their children away from the schools."

No good can come from such methods of work. No good can come from opposing evil with evil; no success can come from fighting the devil with fire. When Rome's methods are used to oppose her, Rome will gain the victory.

There is but one way to overcome evil, and that is, "Overcome evil with good." That is the rule laid down in the Word of God. Do not fight the devil with fire, but oppose him with that inspired Word. Thus it was that the Saviour of the world opposed and conquered him; and it is very sure that weak, erring mortals of this day cannot successfully meet him otherwise. The Word of God is all powerful, and therefore nothing can stand against it.

The AMERICAN SENTINEL exists for the purpose of opposing the encroachments of Rome, and also of Romanized Protestantism, upon the liberties and rights of the people. It wishes the American Constitution preserved as it came to us from our honored ancestors of the days of Washington, Madison, and Jefferson. It wishes American institutions to be maintained as bequeathed to us by those forefathers, disconnected from all religious questions and considerations. It wishes to see maintained the principle which has found its fullest national expression in our land, of the separation of Church and State. And to this end it is opposing error with the truth, both as found in the Scriptures of truth and in those eternal principles of right and justice which were implanted in the heart of man by his Creator.

In adopting the methods of Rome, the A. P. A. is in reality, though unwittingly, playing into Rome's hands; for thereby Rome's methods are justified, and whenever this is done Rome's hands are strengthened. We regret most deeply the waste of an amount of energy and effort which might, rightly directed, do much to stay the rapid encroachments now being made upon that liberty which is the birthright of all men.
