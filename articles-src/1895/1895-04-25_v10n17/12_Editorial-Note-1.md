Any one receiving the AMERICAN SENTINEL without having ordered it may know that it is sent to him by some friend. Therefore, those who have not ordered the SENTINEL need have no fears that they will be asked to pay for it.

The press is still busy printing copies of our extra of the 11th. We are pleased with the loyal coöperation of our friends in the circulation of this number, and are prepared to fill promptly all orders for this important issue.
