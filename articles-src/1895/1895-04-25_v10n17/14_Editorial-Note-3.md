The military craze seems to be sweeping everything before it. The "King's Daughters," of Quincy, Mass., have formed themselves into a rifle company, and after a practice drill under the instruction of a regular officer of the United States army, they recently gave a public exhibition of the regularity and precision with which they could manipulate the instrument of death. Think of it! The "King's Daughters," presumably the daughters of the "Prince of Peace," publicly exhibiting the dexterity with which they can handle the instruments of strife, war and bloodshed.
