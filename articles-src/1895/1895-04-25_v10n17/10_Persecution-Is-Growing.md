# PERSECUTION IS GROWING.

RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION seems to be growing in the United States. The latest instance is in a town in Tennessee where a prosperous Seventh-day Adventist academy has been practically broken up by the imprisonment of the teachers for violation of the Sunday laws. That this is religious persecution is shown by the fact that in the same town and county and State railroad trains run every Sunday, ironworks are operated seven days in the week, and innumerable forms of work and play are indulged in by the people without molestation, simply because no denial is made of the religious dogma that Sunday is the Sabbath of the Lord. But when a religious sect teaches that Saturday is the Sabbath, its members are persecuted and imprisoned though otherwise they are the best citizens in the land. The people who believe in religious liberty should rally to the defense of these persecuted people; for the liberty of all is endangered. As the Age has previously remarked, the A. P. A. society will find in Tennessee a broad and consistent field of labor and one which will relieve the society of the odium of having no apparent object other than that of dividing the workingmen into hostile political camps.
