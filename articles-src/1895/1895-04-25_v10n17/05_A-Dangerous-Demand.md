# A DANGEROUS DEMAND.

The Christian Statesman publishes, with special commendation, a string of resolutions by a "Sabbath convention" held at Altoona, Pa., in which it is desired that the Constitution of the United States be amended so as, among other things, to acknowledge "Christ as the nation's Sovereign, Lord, and King."

This no doubt sounds well to many who do not stop to consider its full import. Christ himself said that his kingdom was not of this world, but too many of his professed followers have been unwilling to take him at his word and have set themselves up, or have been set up by other men, as authoritative interpreters of his will, and as empowered to enforce the same; in consequence of which the blood of innocent thousands, murdered in the name of religion, like Bruno at Rome and Michael Servetus burned at the stake under John Calvin's rule at Geneva, cries out to God and humanity to put an end forever to any legal or constitutional enactments or systems which put it in the power of any man or set of men to punish their fellow-men for differences of religious opinion or practice.

The acknowledgment, by each individual, of Christ as the individual's teacher and master, is well and good, but the constitutional statement that he is "the nation's Sovereign, Lord, and King" would at once bring to light the necessity of some earthly representative, vicecrescent, vicar, delegate, deputy, or whatever name may best suit the ear, authorized and empowered always and everywhere to interpret, apply, and enforce through subservient agencies the supposed will of the "Lord and King."

But how is the designation of such a representative to be secured? No one will pretend that he would be authoritatively named from on high by the "Lord and King." The appointment or selection must, in some way, come from man, it may be in a great national council, or in a church council, perhaps by a mere majority of votes, secured—could it be possible—through influences so similar to those of the "politician" that the "irreverent" and "heretical" could see no difference. And thus the vicegerent on earth would be selected and installed into authority and power. But the "Lord and King" being one over all the nations of the earth, what more natural and reasonable than that one vicegerent should represent him, interpret his will and enforce his authority over all? And the "Lord and King" persistently refusing to make a selection because he says his kingdom is not of this earth, what more natural than that the election should be made by such as think it is the proper thing—say in a great world's council—and what more natural than that the one so chosen should claim, as his right, supreme authority over all nations and individuals and exert it wherever and whenever opportunity offers—making opportunity as rapidly as possible. And what security would there then be against the fate of Bruno, or Servetus, or that of Elder Colcord and Prof. Colcord and other good men who are to-day languishing in jail in Tennessee, because they conscientiously differ from others in a matter of religious belief and practice?

We have been looking forward to the probable, the logical results of a proposed plan. Have we been at the same time reading a page of history already made? Look backward. Read the past, ponder, beware! No religious expression or distinction can have any rightful place in the Constitution of the United States, and if it shall ever be placed there, the day will be one of direful import, a day dark with gloomy forebodings of a future whose depths of intolerance, of infamy and outrage, only time can tell in full, though history does give fair warning.—Midland (Mich.) Republican, April 5.
