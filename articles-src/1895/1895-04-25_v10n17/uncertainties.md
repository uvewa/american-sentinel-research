## OCR Corrections Made

### Page 1, Line 33
- **Transcribed as:** "ABORTANT EDITOR"
- **Should be:** "ASSISTANT EDITOR"
- **Confidence:** HIGH
- **Reason:** Clear OCR error; "ASSISTANT EDITOR" is the standard masthead format

### Page 2, Line 82
- **Original OCR:** "docentees"
- **Transcribed as:** "docentees"
- **Confidence:** LOW
- **Note:** This appears to be an OCR error, but the intended word is unclear from context. Possibly "doctrines" or another term. Left as-is pending verification against original.

### Page 3, Line 117
- **Original OCR:** "surrisse"
- **Transcribed as:** "surrisse"
- **Confidence:** LOW
- **Note:** Unclear word in Factory Act context. Possibly "sunrise" or another term related to time/labor. Left as-is pending verification.

- Some articles from pages 6-7 are promotional/advertisement content and were not transcribed as separate article files
