The earnest, consistent Protestant could not but notice the silence maintained by the press of the country toward the pope's recent bold, unequivocal condemnation of the American principle of separation of Church and State. The following, printed in the Catholic World for April, in an article by Walter Elliott, a priest of the "Paulist Fathers," entitled the "Musings of a Missionary," will present what papists regard as the reason for this silence:

The press dare not openly attack the Church, and in large part has no desire to do so, and it is quite accessible to the publication of articles on the Catholic side.

The press of the country is a powerful factor for good or ill, and if it is true that the Roman Catholic Church has silenced its protest against Catholic encroachments, the final and complete triumph of the papacy in this country will be comparatively easy.
