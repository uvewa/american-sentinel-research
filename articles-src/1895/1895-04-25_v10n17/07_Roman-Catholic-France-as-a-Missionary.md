# ROMAN CATHOLIC FRANCE AS A MISSIONARY.

The Catholic Times, of Philadelphia, which puts whiskey advertisements in the same column with its appeal for St. Joseph's House for Homeless Boys, gives room to the following illuminating paragraph in its Paris letter:

The first batch of soldiers left Paris this week for Madagascar. As they marched through the streets considerable emotion was displayed by the people. Tobacco, money, flowers, and little presents of every description were forced on the men by enthusiastic citizens, while incessant cries of "Vive la France" and "Vive l'Armée" were kept up. The French protectorate over Madagascar is now only a question of time. There is a determination on the part of the republican government to assert supreme control over that distant and beautiful island. In the meanwhile the Catholic missions there may suffer somewhat, although from a letter just received from Mgr. Cazet, the vicar apostolic, I learn that so far the Catholic religion has not suffered on account of the approaching French invasion. The expedition, indeed, from the Catholic point of view, is most desirable. The Protestant sects have had their own way there far too long. The time is approaching when our missions will receive a substantial support from that European power which, whatever the faults at home, has never failed to protect Catholic interests abroad. It is the fashion to speak of French policy in Madagascar as a check to England. It is nearer to the truth to regard it as a check given to British Protestantism.

The French invasion of this native African State, already largely Christianized, with a Christian queen and a Christian government, is supported by Catholics, it seems, as a war upon Protestantism. This is a shameful confession. See how these Catholic Christians love the Christians of Madagascar! The gospel was carried by Protestant missionaries to the Malagassy while they were yet savages. These brave men sacrificed themselves, shed their blood, that the cross of Christ might be set up in that heathen land. Now, after the heroic days of missionary work are over, and after the people have become true followers of the Lord of love and peace, Catholic Christians propose a war of subjugation that the dominant Christianity may be put down or superseded. Shame at those who avow a sympathy so foreign to the character of the gospel.—The Independent, April 4.
