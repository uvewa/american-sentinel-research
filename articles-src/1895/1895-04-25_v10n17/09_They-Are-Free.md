# THEY ARE FREE.

Governor Turner Pardons the Seventh-Day Adventists.

LAST Tuesday Governor Turney pardoned the remaining five Adventists who have been lying out their cost in the county jail. They are Elder G. W. Colcord, W. S. Burchard, M. C. Sturdevant, D. C. Plumb, E. S. Abbott.

This disposes of these cases until the July term of Circuit Court. A number of indictments have been found against others of these Graysville Adventists and they are under bond to be tried at the next term for Sabbath-breaking. In fact, it is understood that these indictments reach every male Adventist at Graysville.

In the meantime bills are pending in the legislature affording relief to these people, and it is hoped that a way will be found to stop these prosecutions. It would certainly be a wise thing for the county to encourage these people who are bringing capital and prosperity into the community, instead of throwing such obstacles in their way as will result in driving them from us.

The pardon was granted upon the recommendation of Judge Parks.—Dayton (Tenn.) Republican, April 12.
