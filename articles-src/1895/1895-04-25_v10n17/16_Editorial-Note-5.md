The Catholic Mirror, of April 6, attempts another apology for the violence attempted by Catholics against ex-priest Slattery. The apology is a covert encouragement to violence as the reader will see. The Mirror says:

Slattery came very near precipitating a riot in Memphis similar to that of which he was the cause in Savannah. How can the people be blamed for showing indignation against this man? It is not the doctrines of the Catholic Church that he attacks, but the character of the priests and nuns. Catholics know how pure and devoted their religious are, and the feeling of anger when they are libelled by a wretch like Slattery becomes uncontrollable.

The Mirror asks "how can the people be blamed" for trying to kill ex-priest Slattery, and acknowledges that under the circumstances the "rage" of Catholics is "uncontrollable." If this were the apology of natural, unconverted men who made no profession of Christianity, who did not pretend to follow the example of Him "who, when he was reviled, reviled not again," we would not think very strange of it; but even then we would not expect to hear these sentiments uttered by a good citizen who always favors redressing his grievances by the orderly, legal methods provided by law rather than by the anarchistic methods of mob violence. Since Rome returns railing for railing how can she claim to be Christian? and since she admits that her children are "uncontrollable" when their religious teachers are spoken against, how can she lay claim to being the only force that can control the mobs of all the world in the approaching social upheaval? Let her control the "uncontrollable" within herself before posing as the only power that can control the anarchy outside the church.
