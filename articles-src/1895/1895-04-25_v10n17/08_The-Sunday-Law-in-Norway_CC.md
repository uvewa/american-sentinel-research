# THE SUNDAY LAW IN NORWAY.

Like all "Christian nations," Norway has a Sunday law on her statute books, but it never has, to my knowledge, been used to infringe upon the liberties of the people. Her Sundays are like the "Continental Sunday," spent mostly in pleasure seeking.

Of late there has been a movement on foot in behalf of the working classes, which has resulted in the enactment of a factory law. It must be admitted that the law has some good features, but in their misguided zeal and influenced by "The Society for the Promotion of the Right Use of Sunday," the legislators have inserted a paragraph prohibiting ordinary labor on Sundays and festival days.

Under this act the manager of the Seventh-day Adventist publishing house in Christiania has lately been fined forty kroner, the complaint being made by the bishop. A refusal to pay the fine was entered. A statement setting forth our reasons for resting on the Sabbath and working on Sunday was prepared and submitted to the Home Office; and a tract, "Religious Liberty and Sunday Laws," was mailed to judges, lawyers, editors, etc., to enlighten them on this important subject. On our appearing before the magistrate, the police sergeant agreed to suspend the fine until the decision of the Home Office came to hand.

On the 17th of March the following communication was received:—

The Local Inspector's Office, March 16, 1895.

Under date of March 14, 1895, the Home Office has, in accordance with the Factory Act, Section 27, 2nd clause, and by the recommendation of the Chief Inspector of Factories, given the "Scandinavian Publishing House" permission until further notice to do such work as the business requires, from six o'clock Saturday evening until ten o'clock Sunday evening—however, not on Easter and Whiteunday—on the condition that only such employés is belong to the Seventh-day Adventist denomination be allowed to work, and that these have the holiday rest stipulated in the Factory Act on another day; further, that no machinery be used, and that the society in all things observe such directions as the police may deem necessary to avoid making offense.

TRAF-JENSEN,
Local Inspector.

Why the Home Office could give permission to work on Sunday "in accordance with the Factory Act, Section 27," was because the paragraph has this exemption clause: "Except . . . other circumstances make it [the work] unavoidably necessary." In conversation with the secretary of the Home Office he admitted that the keeping of the seventh day is a circumstance that justifies our working on Sunday.

They claimed all the time that the law was not religious, that the only intent of it was surrisse for the laborer. And on this claim we also based our right to work on Sunday. We had of course the right to hold them to their law. But mark now the condition: Only laborers belonging to the Seventh-day Adventist denomination must be employed on Sunday. Why this distinction if the law is only civil? Now we have a few employés not of our faith; and in drawing this line, in making this distinction, the nature of the law has been plainly revealed—that Sunday is the object of protection, not the laborer. But could we accept an exemption in our favor only? No. Have we the right to work on Sunday? Yes; divine right. The Lord says: "Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work; but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God." Have we the right to employ anyone on Sunday who desires to be employed? God has given us this right, and no earthly power has it to give.

After interviewing the local inspector and presenting the principles before him, the following protest was entered:—

MR. TRAF-JENSEN,
Local Inspector.

—Christiania.

Referring to our interview of today, we wish to submit the following statement that you may the better be able to understand our position in regard to this matter:—

If the Factory Act, Section 27, does not deny our right to work on Sunday, then we believe that this right also holds good for each of our workers not of our faith, and who also take their rest on Saturday. For us to close the office on Sunday would make us a party to forcing them into keeping a day which they have no regard for seeing they work on it. It would also make us accessory in using a law whose intent is to protect the worker (not Sunday) to rob him of one-sixth of his time and thereby cut him off from one day's earnings.

Referring you to the resolution handed you this morning, that "we cannot in conscience also close our office to our employés on Sunday, nor can we refuse to allow them to work on Sunday if they desire to do so,"—we had in mind all of our employés, both those who work here now and those who may work for us later, no matter to what denomination they belong.

Further, that we do not compel any employé to work on Sunday, as they themselves can testify, but that they have liberty to go to church or be free entirely.

Hoping that you may see the justness of our position, we remain,

Yours respectfully,
THE SCANDINAVIAN PUBLISHING HOUSE,
C. CARTRERO, Sec.

Whether the authorities have taken any notice of this protest or not we do not know. Of course the employés are prohibited from coming to work here on Sunday. But no arrests have been made yet. Norway is in the midst of a political contest that takes nearly all the public attention. Before this article reaches you we may have had a change in the cabinet, and with the new heads of the different government offices we may also have a change of sentiment. Be this as it may, we know that the time has come in Norway and in fact everywhere when liberty in Christ is to be maintained at the cost of the loss of civil liberty. But we do not fear the trials when we have Jesus Christ. At most the persecution can last only a little while. The end is not far off. If faithful, we shall soon stand on the sea of glass, having gained "the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name," singing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, a song of triumph and victory.

C. CARTRERO.
