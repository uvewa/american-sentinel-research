# A FEARFUL ARRAIGNMENT.

In 1885, Pope Leo XIII. admonished Catholics "to take an active part in all municipal affairs and elections," and "make themselves felt as active elements in daily political life," and "penetrate wherever possible in the administration of civil affairs," etc. Probably no command of the pope has ever been more faithfully obeyed. Our large cities have been practically controlled by the Roman Catholic Church. The fruits of this control in New York City have recently been exposed to the horror of all good men. It seems that the situation is no better in St. Louis. The following is an editorial description of Roman Catholic miscrite in that city from the Western Watchman, a Roman Catholic paper. It is a terrible arraignment of Roman Catholic miscrite, but as it is from the pen of an Irish Catholic, it cannot be attributed to racial prejudice. Let it be read with the recent utterance of the pope in mind, that the American Republic should grant to the Catholic Church "the favor of the laws and the patronage of the public authority:"

### The Don't Care.

The legislature of Nebraska has just enacted a law that places in the hands of an A. P. A. commission the power to remove all the Catholics from the public service in the city of Omaha. The law is especially directed against the Irish on the police force of that city. We don't know who those Irish are on the police force of Omaha; but if they are no better than the Irish on our police force we don't care a rap how soon they go. In Chicago and St. Louis the Democratic tickets were unmercifully beaten on last Tuesday. Those tickets were loaded down with Irish saloon keepers and tough Irish politicians; and we hope they will never be brought to the surface again. If the A. P. A. do nothing but clear the police force of our big cities of Irish uniformed brutes who never go to mass, and keep out of boodle city councils lazy and rascally Irish rumsellers, they will have our blessing and the blessing of all the decent Catholics in the country. Did anyone ever see such a ticket as was presented to the Democrats of this city on last Tuesday? Saloonkeepers until you could not see; sandwiched here and there between a notorious boucher or a ward bummer. Nearly the entire ticket for the lower house was made up of Catholics in name. Many of them never felt the touch of holy water since they were baptized. The party organization is wholly to blame for such a ticket. The central committee men are bums and they bring bums to the front at nominating conventions. The ticket was the work of the Democratic Central Committee and it was worthy of its originator. We have a word of advice to give our Irish saloon keepers, and that is to keep closely to their beer kegs and never be tempted to run for office again.

What makes the desire for petty offices so general among a certain class of Irish? Why are they so anxious to get into the House of Delegates? It is because of the opportunities of boodle there are in that body. Our petty Irish politicians are the most dishonest set of boodlers outside of a State prison. They don't scruple it. One of the cleverest Catholics we ever met, a man who has a brother a priest, was elected to the council years ago through the efforts of friends who really desired to improve the personnel of that body. He turned out the leader of a band of robbers who held up every man, friend or foe, who had a favor to ask of the city, and now holds an office in a corporation created by his dishonesty. We know many Catholics who go to the sacraments who regard boodle as legitimate gain, as honest as catching catfish in the Mississippi River. Leo XIII. calls on all Catholics to aid the State by promoting all schemes of public morality. They can best accomplish this by becoming honest themselves. There is no honesty in our public and political life in the United States. Our great corporations are controlled by robbers. The acts of our national legislature are tainted by dishonesty and corruption. Trade knows no law but "get there." If the Church fails to impress upon her children the supreme duty of justice, this country will soon become one vast den of thieves.

It is evident that the "church" has failed, and yet with this terrible failure before the face and eyes of all men, this same church is arrogantly claiming that there is "no champion that can save social order outside the Catholic Church."
