# NOT BIBLICAL.

A CORRESPONDENT sends us the Western Recorder (St. Louis), a Baptist paper, published by the Baptist Book Concern, containing an article entitled, "Christian vs. Jewish Sabbath," which he asks us to notice. Space will not permit of an extended notice, neither is such a notice needed. The author sums up his argument in three paragraphs which we quote with our comments inserted within brackets:—

"Condensed reasons for observing the Christian Sabbath." [The Bible nowhere calls the first day of the week the Christian Sabbath.]

1. It was the most appropriate day which a ransomed people could observe; [The most appropriate day for a ransomed people to observe is the day commanded of God]; being that on which the Saviour was raised from the dead and the Spirit inaugurated his reign." [The Bible does not record that the Spirit inaugurated his reign on the first day of the week.]

2. We have precedent, in a way [Yes, in a way, in the same way which Roman Catholics have precedents for purgatory, prayers for the dead. Mariolatory, invocation of saints, infallibility, etc.]; to show that it was custom, for Gentile churches, under apostolic sanction, to meet for public religious worship and for celebrating the supper on the first day of the week; and there could be no higher authority emanating from inspired men." [There is but one instance recorded in the New Testament where a public meeting was held on the first day of the week, and that was a night meeting beginning Saturday night and continuing until Sunday morning, after which the rest of the first day was consumed in traveling.]

3. We have the sanction of the Holy Spirit for the observance of the first day, in that the Spirit inspired Luke and Paul to record the fact, without censure, that the Gentile Christians did observe the first day instead of the Jewish Sabbath. [Neither Luke, Paul nor any other New Testament writer records any such change.] This ought, one would think, to be sufficient to justify [to] even the most scrupulous that the Christian Sabbath [meaning Sunday] is the day God designed should be observed by his people during the present dispensation." [It ought not to be sufficient, because it is not biblical.]
