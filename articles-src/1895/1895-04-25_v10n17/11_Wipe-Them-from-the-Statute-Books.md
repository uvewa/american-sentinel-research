# WIPE THEM FROM THE STATUTE BOOKS.

(From the Jewish Spectator, March 29.)

It seems that Judge Parks, of the Circuit Court at Dayton, Tenn. in pronouncing judgment upon the nine Seventh-day Adventists, felt that a wrong was perpetrated by rendering a verdict pronouncing those men guilty of having violated the Sunday laws of the State of Tennessee. Evidently he is a fair-minded man, who recognizes in that kind of legislation an anomaly a menace to the freedom of conscience. In the course of his remarks, whilst upon the bench, he said:—

If I were to express my private feelings, however, I might say that there is nothing I regard with more concern or solicitude than an encroachment of legislative enactment upon the personal rights of the individual in matters of conscience. That there is a limit in these matters beyond which legislation cannot rightfully go will be conceded by every man. Where is that limit? This is a question which even the enlightened civilization of the nineteenth century, it seems, cannot answer. Human laws are of necessity imperfect. One class of individuals will claim that their rights are encroached upon in this way; another, in that way, and so on.

The only answer "the enlightened civilization of the nineteenth century" can give is: Abolish the obnoxious, unjust laws, wipe them from the statute books of the States in which they are found. They are the vestiges still remaining of the union of Church and State, and honest judges will not be compelled to enforce penalties whilst they in their own judgment firmly believe that no wrong, no immorality, no injury have been done. As will be seen in the columns of our supplement, an effort has been made to introduce into the legislature of New York, a bill exempting those who keep the Saturday-Sabbath from the compulsory observance of the Sunday. Whatever fate may befall this bill, we do not consider it a wise measure; special legislation for a special class is not in keeping with the modern science of civil government. If the maxim is true, Lee est ratio summa, that "law is the perfection of reason," and that justice is not to be ignored and denied by any law in the democratic government of a nation, then both reason and justice demand that Sunday laws be annulled in every State.
