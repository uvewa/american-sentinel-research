# BISHOP AND PRIEST REVILING EACH OTHER.

The Converted Catholic has given considerable space to the quarrels between Roman Catholic Bishop McQuaid, of Rochester, N. Y., and Father Louis A. Lambert, one of the priests of his diocese, late editor of the Catholic Times of Philadelphia, and for the present editor of the New York Freeman's Journal. In the exchange of characteristic Roman Catholic ecclesiastical civilities, priest Lambert in his paper called his bishop "a political place hunter," "a disappointed office-seeker," and declared him "jealous of the success of some of his fellow-bishops." He instanced cases of the bishop's cruelty to his priests, who, for some reason, or none, as Father Lambert insinuated, were suspended, unjustly deprived of their rights and turned out to starve by this "charitable" bishop. Now, in turn, the bishop, in a recently started Roman Catholic weekly, called by the ominous name of The Vatican, published in Albany, N. Y., pays his respects to Lambert. In the leading editorial of that paper for March 16, 1895, Father Lambert is said to be guilty of "shameless and mendacious invention, to have encouraged a most malevolent and unchristian spirit." He is called a "clerical plotter," a "conspirator against truth and honesty," an "artful dodger," and other such complimentary names. We would commend to the consideration of the bishop and priest the words of Peter's First Epistle 8, 9: "Love as brethren, be courteous. Not rendering evil for evil, nor railing for railing; but contrariwise blessing.

But evidently Peter's counsel is thrown away upon the Roman Catholic bishops and priests of our generation. The echoes of the scandalous revelations by Dr. Ducey have not died away when here comes the learned Lambert of "Ingersoll" fame and the "holy bishop" of Rochester reviling each other like fishwives. "Come out of her, my people."—The Converted Catholic, for April.
