# DANGEROUS LEGISLATION.

It has generally been conceded that the State has the authority to declare legal holidays. This winter the State of Minnesota has added another to the list, in declaring that the birth day of Lincoln is to be a legal holiday. And as long as legislative bodies are content to leave the matter with the simple declaration that such and such days are to be legal holidays, and then leave everybody free to observe them or not, it will make very little difference to the average citizen. But should they attempt by legislative enactment to prescribe how these days shall be observed, and make certain acts, in themselves legitimate, misdemeanors because done on these days, they would then invade the inalienable rights of the people. And if they should go so far as to formulate a round of solemn, sacred acts of religious worship, imposing penalties of fines and imprisonment for certain acts of amusements, sports, and pastimes, they would then enter the realm of conscience, the realm of religion, which would not only be an invasion of the civil rights of the people, but it would be an attempted usurpation of the divine prerogatives of the mind; an exalting of the States above the religious convictions of the individual, a gross usurpation of authority.

Now all this is just what is being attempted in the legislature of Minnesota. Attempted, I say; at least a bill has been introduced by Representative Downs, to compel the decorous observance of Memorial Day until five o'clock in the afternoon. The first seventeen hours of the day are to be set apart for "sacred, solemn, and patriotic exercises;" while those who would engage in such sports as racing with horses, boats, or bicycles, or play any games, or attend any game of baseball or football, or other sports, on that day, before five o'clock in the afternoon, will be subject to a fine of from $10 to $100, or from ten to thirty days' imprisonment, or both.

In commenting on this measure, the Pioneer Press of St. Paul, asks the question, "Is Minnesota to have a set of Blue Laws?" It pronounces the measure "The grossest proposal to interfere with personal liberty that has been heard of in the State;" and adds that the presentation of such a measure is evidence of how far these paternalistic ideas have "carried us back toward the days of tyranny of opinion and the fettering of the individual." These are sound words and should serve to arouse the thoughtful reader, and lead the people to be more jealous of their rights lest they expire in a convulsion. Those who are acquainted with the history of the downfall of the republic of Rome, do not need to be told that we are living over again the history of that republic. H. F. PHELPS.
