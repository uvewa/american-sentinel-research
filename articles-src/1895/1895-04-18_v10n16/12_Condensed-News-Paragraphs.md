# CONDENSED NEWS PARAGRAPHS.

Governor McKinley has refused to dismiss Police Lieutenant Hehan, of Cincinnati, whose dismissal was demanded by the ministers of Cincinnati because he refused to arrest theatrical performers until the conclusion of the performance.

The Protestant ministers of Helena, Ark., invoked the aid of the law to stop a musical entertainment given by the Gilmore Band. The managers evaded the law by giving free entertainments. Collections were taken and the amount thus raised was donated to the poor of the city.

The election held at Bridgeport, Conn., April 2, was enlivened by women and religion. It is reported that in order to elect a Protestant school board, for which women are allowed to vote, the Protestants undertook to secretly urge the Protestant women of the churches to vote. The Roman Catholic priests got wind of the movement and instructed Catholic women to do the same; and since that church is the perfection of organization and discipline, it was able to vote its women to a woman, and consequently, completely overwhelm the opposition. However, the Catholic women, owing to a blunder in voting, failed to carry the election. They will be better instructed next time.

Los Angeles, Cal., April 2.—Judge Clark has overruled the demurrer interposed by Rev. J. C. Campbell in the suit charging him with slandering Miss Tessa L. Kelso, the librarian of the Los Angeles Public Library.

The basis of the action was a prayer offered by the defendant before his congregation in the First Methodist Episcopal Church, in which he said: "O Lord, vouchsade thy saving grace to the librarian of the Los Angeles City Library and cleanse her of all sin and make her a woman worthy of her office."

Rev. Campbell, in his demurrer, took the position that his statement was privileged. The court held that a slander can be perpetrated in the form of a prayer as readily as in any other form of speech.—New York World.
