# THE POPE'S LOVE FOR AMERICA.

[The following editorial kindly translated from Die Rundschau (Chicago) of February 6, and sent us for publication, by Rev. Oscar Goetz, of Gretna, La., displays unusual courage and perception.]

THAT Leo XIII. fondly cherished within his papal heart these United States, we knew long ago. Especially in the past three years have we been hearing much of it. In 1892, there came this bit of news from Rome: "What the church has done in the past for other nations, she will now do for the United States." In the following year this papal design materialized. Satolli came to this country as the pope's delegate, announcing the purpose of his mission in an address to the Catholic Congress assembled at Chicago in the month of September, in these pertinent words: "Bring your country into immediate contact with that great secret of blessedness—Christ and his church." A month later Professor O'Gorman of the Washington University, in a paper read before the World's Congress of Religions, made claim to this country for the pope "by right of discovery and possession," and because of "its religious character and Christian principles." Shortly after occurred Cardinal Gibbons' jubilee celebration, On this occasion Archbishop Ireland proclaimed the union of the Catholic Church and the United States at the banqueting hall, by congratulating those assembled there on the privilege they enjoyed of seeing this union "typified" in the arrangements before their eyes, in that "the Vice-president of the United States comes here and takes his seat alongside the cardinal." Then on the 22nd of September, 1894, Bishop Keane, Rector of the Catholic University at Washington, brought this item of news from Rome: "The policy of the pope is . . . the union of the church with the great democratic powers of the future, that is, America and France. This is his hope, and unto its fulfillment tend all his remarkable endeavors." And shortly afterward we were apprised of the pope's intention to declare America a Catholic country, and that he thought the United States "the most promising field for the church in the whole world."

The latest papal encyclical to the American bishops, the contents of which was made public the beginning of last week, breathes the same spirit of love for the United States. And this circumstance makes it noticeable also to non-Catholics. For this fact, the pope's bestowing his special favor on our country, is a very serious sign of the times, and all having at heart the welfare of our nation and wishing its liberty to be retained inviolate, would do well to closely observe this sign of the times and take to heart the lesson such observation teaches.

Referring to the Columbus celebration in his encyclical, the pope pays a high tribute to the American people for the powerful progress achieved. Naturally his special favor centers in the Catholics, giving expression to his joy over the fact that under the free institutions of our Republic, unfettered and unbiased by any legislation whatever, his church has de-

veloped gloriously. Yet it is far from the purpose of the pope to indorse these free institutions themselves. On the contrary, "it would," he says, "be very erroneous to draw the conclusion that in America is to be sought the type of the most desirable status of the church; or that it would be universally lawful or expedient for the State and Church to be, as in America, discovered and divorced. The church would bring forth more abundant fruits if, in addition to liberty, she enjoyed the favor of the laws and the patronage of the public authority."

We ought to mark well these words of Leo XIII. They are the key to the correct understanding of the whole remaining portion of his message, and clearly and plainly betray the pope's actual intentions toward our country. He certainly does approve of this, that his church enjoys the greatest liberty under our free institutions, but he is not at all satisfied with this state of affairs; he demands more. Naturally the complete and fundamental separation of Church and State existing in the United States is an abomination to him and a thorn in his eyes. The lawfulness of such a status is what he denies in emphatic terms. He only submits to it because he must, and because it is expedient for him to make the best of, and put up with, the existing condition of affairs. His ideal is still the union of Church and State, or rather the superiority of the former, that is, his sect, over the latter. The laws of the State are to favor his church, and, naturally, his exclusively; and the public authorities are to patronize her and be subservient to her. Such would be, in the eyes of the pope, the normal status, and to bring about this status is the aim and object of his endeavors.

All else he elaborates on in his encyclical and lays near the hearts of his people, is to serve the final purpose of hastening and materializing the Catholicity of these United States.

There is no necessity for still further following the tracks of the encyclical. What the pope urges the Catholic citizens of this country to consider, what he has to say about labor organizations, his admonitions to Catholic newspaper writers,—all this is in itself of no value to us and does not influence our way of thinking and acting. They are of interest and importance to us, only in so far as these utterances too are colored throughout with the same wish and mind of the pope we have just portrayed, and his design to bring our whole American nation in subservience to him. And for this reason the latest papal encyclical is a significant sign of the times, whereby we again may learn to understand that the greatest enemy of our nation and its liberty is, and will remain until the end of time, the popedom at Rome, an institution of the devil.
