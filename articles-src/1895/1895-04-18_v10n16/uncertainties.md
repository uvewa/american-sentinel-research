## OCR Corrections and Uncertainties

### Page 2, Article "Sin From a Roman Catholic Standpoint"
- **OCR text:** "9 John 3:4"
- **Corrected to:** "1 John 3:4"
- **Confidence:** HIGH - clear context, obvious OCR error (9 vs 1)
- **Reason:** The verse quoted is from First John, not "9 John" which does not exist

### Page 3, Article "Educational Work of the Adventists"
- **OCR artifact:** Incomplete sentence fragment appears in the middle of a paragraph ("Academy was nine; at Union College, thirty-seven...")
- **Transcribed as is:** Text appears to be describing the number of teachers at different institutions but the sentence is incomplete in the original scan
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM - preserved as printed, though sentence structure is awkward
- **Reason:** Cannot infer missing text without seeing original

### Page 6, Article "Pope's Love for America"
- **OCR text:** "discovered and divorced"
- **Likely should be:** "dissevered and divorced"
- **Transcribed as:** "discovered and divorced"
- **Confidence:** LOW - "dissevered" (separated) makes more sense in context, but OCR shows "discovered"
- **Reason:** Context suggests separation of Church and State, making "dissevered" more likely, but preserved OCR reading

### General Notes
- Author attribution "HFP" for H. F. Phelps identified from signature at end of article
- Author attribution "OG" for Oscar Goetz identified from introductory note
- Image references in original (e.g., college photographs, sanitarium) noted but not transcribed as content
- Table formatting in "Our Tennessee Letter" preserved using markdown table syntax
