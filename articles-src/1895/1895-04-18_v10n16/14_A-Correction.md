# A CORRECTION.

The first twenty-five thousand copies of the SENTINEL of April 11, speaks of ex-Governor James D. Porter, of Tennessee, as "now United States Circuit Judge." This is a mistake. He was nominated by Mr. Cleveland but not confirmed. The copies printed later correctly state that Mr. Porter is now United States Minister to Chili.
