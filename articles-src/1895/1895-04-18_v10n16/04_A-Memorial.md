# A MEMORIAL.

To the Honorable, the Senate and House of Representatives of the State of Tennessee:—

We, the undersigned residents of Rhea County, Tenn., respectfully petition your honorable body to repeal Section 2289 of the Code of said State, prohibiting secular employment on Sunday, for the reason that said Section is in contravention of Section 3 of the Declaration of Rights which declares "That no human authority can, in any case whatever, control or interfere with the rights of conscience; and that no preference shall ever be given by law to any religious establishment or mode of worship."

In support of this, our petition, we beg to submit the following facts and considerations:—

The American principle of government does not recognize in the majority any authority over the minority except in matters regarding the conduct of man to his fellow-man. Hence, Section 3 of the Declaration of Rights of the State of Tennessee, regards the conscience of the Jew as sacred as that of the Christian, and gives no more authority to adopt a measure affecting the conscience of a solitary individual than that of a whole community.

But Section 2289 of the Code of this State requires all men, whether Jews, Christians, or agnostics, to observe the first day of the week by abstaining on that day from all secular employments; and thus interferes with the conscience of every man: for it leaves no man free to change his opinion and practice in this regard. This is especially patent in the case of the Jew and seventh-day Christian, who, after having kept the seventh day according to the fourth commandment of the Decalogue, are required by said Section 2289 to observe Sunday also.

The law, moreover, works a special hardship upon your petitioners, who are Seventh-day Adventists, because we believe that the fourth commandment requires not only the observance of the seventh day, but that it forbids us to show a like regard for another day. The divine law of the Sabbath separates the seventh day from the other days of the week, and requires all men to respect that distinction. To treat two days alike by refraining from labor and business upon them, is to destroy that distinction which the fourth commandment makes between "the Sabbath of the Lord" (Ex. 20:10) and the "six working days" (Eze. 46:1); and is, therefore, to defeat the object of the divine law. For this, and analogous reasons, your petitioners cannot conscientiously refrain from secular employments, habitually, upon the first day of the week.

But notwithstanding the fact that this is a matter directly affecting the conscience, and that Section 3 of the Declaration of Rights contains a seemingly ample guarantee of freedom of conscience, Seventh-day Adventists have been repeatedly prosecuted in the courts of this State, under the said Section 2289 of the Code, have been mulcted in fines and costs, have been imprisoned in county jails and workhouses, and have even been set to work upon the streets with the chain-gang. At the March term of the Circuit Court in this county, nine of your petitioners were convicted on seventeen indictments under the said law, and in default of payment of costs, were committed to jail for terms of from nineteen to seventy-six days; and to-day Eld. G. W. Colcord (a minister of the gospel), E. S. Abbott, M. C. Sturdevant, William Burchard, and Dwight Plumb, are still in prison for no other offense than exercising the common vocations of life upon the first day of the week, in a civil and orderly manner.

And not only are the individuals named suffering imprisonment at the present moment under the operation of an unjust law, but our academy at Graysville, Rhea County, has been closed by the imprisonment of the principal and his first assistant; the school has been broken up, and the students, to the number of nearly one hundred, have been subjected to serious loss and disappointment.

We have repeatedly plead our rights of conscience in this matter, but our plea has not been regarded by the courts, and we have been told that our remedy is not in the courts, but in the legislature.

That this is a matter of conscience, was thus admitted by his honor, Judge James G. Parks, at the recent term of the Circuit Court in this county. In pronouncing judgment against the nine defendants already mentioned, his honor said:—

The Supreme Court of this State, whose decisions must be taken as final by the lower courts, has passed upon this decision, and we cannot rightfully reverse its decisions.

If I were to express my private feelings, however,

I might say that there is nothing I regard with more concern or solicitude than an encroachment of legislative enactment upon the personal rights of the individual in matters of conscience. That there is a limit in these matters beyond which legislation cannot rightfully go, will be conceded by every man.

But here we have a very respectable element of Christian believers who are honest, inoffensive, law-abiding people in all matters not conflicting with their sense of duty, who believe they are under divine command to observe the seventh day as the Sabbath. As a matter of abstract, individual right, can they be required to observe another day also? Their position is not that of a person who claims that as a matter of personal liberty he has the right, if he chooses, to run an open saloon on Sunday, or to do any like act. That is not a matter of conscience—this is. They claim that it is not only their right, but their duty under divine command to observe the seventh day. Calling them "cranks" is no argument and has nothing to do with the question. If there were only one of them he would be entitled not only to his honest belief, but to the exercise of that belief, so long as in so doing he did not interfere with some natural right of his neighbors. A man cannot kill another and excuse himself on the ground that he believed he was carrying out God's will in so doing, because this would deprive his victim of a natural right, viz.: the enjoyment of life. Do the defendants in keeping the seventh day and working on the first, thereby interfere with any natural right of their neighbors? Or is it an artificial right created by human law? Has any power but the divine will the right to establish any one day as the Sabbath? If the day has been appointed by divine edict, but two or more persons honestly and conscientiously differ as to what day was appointed, can the dispute be settled by legislative enactment? And shall one be given rights which are denied the other? Does might make right, and have the majority the right to dictate in matters purely of conscience?

In reporting the trials of the Adventists, the *Dayton Republican*, of March 9, had the following head-lines:—

**PERSECUTION.**

**Prosperous Community Broken Up.**

**GRAYSVILLE ADVENTISTS SUFFER FROM A BAD LAW.**

**THE COUNTY JAIL. TO BE RECRUITED WITH SOME OF OUR BEST CITIZENS FOR WORKING ON SUNDAY.**

But notwithstanding the fact that we have the sympathy of the court and of the considerate and thinking portion of the community, there are not wanting illiberal persons who seem determined to pursue us with the law; and at the recent term of court there were twenty additional indictments found against us—many of them for the most trivial acts which would pass without remark if done by persons not observing the seventh day.

Our enemies themselves being witnesses, we are law-abiding citizens in all matters not conflicting with our sense of duty to God. Our refusal to obey the Sunday laws of Tennessee does not arise from any disposition to defy the State, or from any willful disregard of civil authority; but is due solely to our conscientious convictions of divine obligation. Nor are we governed in this matter by blind fanaticism. The divine right of dissent is the most precious right with which the Creator has endowed man, and millions have laid down their lives rather than surrender it. That eminent citizen of Kentucky, Hon. Richard M. Johnson, in his capacity as chairman of the House Committee on Post Offices and Post Roads, in his matchless report to the National House of Representatives, on Sunday mails, March 4, 1830, said:—

The framers of the Constitution recognized the eternal principle that man's relation with his God is above human legislation, and his rights of conscience inalienable. Reasoning was not necessary to establish this truth; we are conscious of it in our own bosoms. It is this conscientiousness which in defiance of human laws, has sustained so many martyrs in tortures and in flames. They felt that their duty to God was superior to human enactments, and that man could exercise no authority over their conscience. *It is an inborn principle which nothing can eradicate.* The bigot, in the pride of his authority, may lose sight of it; but strip him of his power, prescribe a faith to him which his conscience rejects, threaten him in turn with the dungeon and the fagot, and the spirit which God has implanted in him rises up in rebellion and defies you.

Nor is it alone by statesmen that this principle has been recognized and defended. The eminent educator and moral philosopher, President Fairchild, in his work on "Moral Philosophy," states the same truth thus succinctly:—

It is too obvious to need discussion, that the law of God, the great principle of benevolence, is supreme, and that "we ought to obey God rather than men" in any case of conflict between human law and the divine. There are cases so clear that no one can question the duty to refuse obedience. In all times and in all lands such cases have arisen. In a case of this kind, either of two courses is possible: to disobey the law and resist the government in its attempt to execute it, or to disobey and quietly suffer the penalty. The first is revolutionary, and can be justified only when the case is flagrant and affects such numbers that a revolutionary movement can be sustained.

The second course will, in general, commend itself to considerate and conscientious men. It is a testimony against the law as unrighteous and at the same time a recognition of government as a grave interest.

The latter course mentioned by President Fairchild is the one which has been pursued by Christians in every age. The apostles refused obedience to civil authority when civil law required of them obedience which they could not conscientiously render; and thousands of martyrs have laid down their lives rather than yield to any earthly authority in matters of conscience. Our own country has not been without witnesses to this principle. The Baptists and Quakers of New England and Virginia, suffered fines, imprisonment, whipping, and some of them even death itself, rather than prove disloyal to conscience.

We are not asking special favors, or the patronage of public authority; we seek only the rights which we ought to enjoy under Section 3 of the Declaration of Rights. We do not ask toleration merely, but, in the language of Hon. Richard M. Johnson, we declare that "what others call religious toleration, we call religious rights. They are not exercised in virtue of governmental indulgence, but as rights of which government cannot deprive any portion of citizens however small. Despetic power may invade these rights, but justice still confirms them."

We do not ask simply for a clause exempting us from the penalties of the law, but for the repeal of the law; because simply to ask an exemption would be to admit the right of the State to legislate upon such questions, and to consent to the idea that the legislature might properly require of others that which we are not willing it should exact from us.

We believe that properly interpreted, the Declaration of Rights of the State of Tennessee would afford equal protection to all; and that justice to all, and a due regard for inalienable rights demand the repeal of Section 2289 of the code of the State; and for this we accordingly pray.
