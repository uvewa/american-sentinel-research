# CHRISTIAN CITIZENSHIP.

BY H. E. GIDDINGS.

This is the theme of the hour, because, to use the language of the movement itself, "Its officers and workers include representatives of all the churches and young people's societies," and plans were laid to have over one hundred thousand lectures delivered June 30, setting forth the objects of the "Christian Citizenship League," and exhorting all good people to enlist under its banner.

Christian Citizenship is clearly defined in its own literature which is sent out freely to all ministers and workers.

The president of the league, E. D. Wheelock, 153 La Salle Street, Chicago, says in the New Revival:—

The first league was organized in March, 1894. It has since been incorporated as a National League, and has organized auxiliary leagues in other cities in Illinois and other States.

The widespread interest in the work has made necessary the publication of an organ, the Christian Citizen, which includes among its editors and contributors, Dr. Carlos Martyn, Francis E. Willard, L. L. D., Rev. Chas. H. Parkhurst, D. D., and Prof. Graham Taylor.

With a league in every county or city in the Union, every public evil can be overthrown. The cooperation of all Christian people is invoked to this end.

"Christian" is a title which belongs to the follower of Christ, and signifies that he is like Christ. The association of such individuals forms the church. The work of the church is to enlighten the world.

Its mission, in the words of Christ, is, "Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature. He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved."

Its field of operation is the moral and intelligent nature of man. "Come now, and let us reason together," "though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow." "If ye be willing and obedient."

The weapons of its warfare are not carnal, but spiritual. The sword of the Spirit, the Word of God.

Its power is that Holy Spirit of promise, to guide into all truth. "No man can come to me except the Father which hath sent me draw him."

Its methods moral suasion. "Knowing the terror of the Lord we persuade men."

The mission of the State is to maintain civil order in society. "That we may lead a quiet and peaceable life."

The field in which the State has a right to operate is the relations between man and man, or the interests of the masses in common.

Its power is by human consent. As stated in the Declaration of Independence, governments derive "their just powers from the consent of the governed."

The proper methods are the sword and musket. "He benefit not the sword in vain." "He is a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil."

With such vastly different missions and widely diverging fields of operation, how can the elements of the Church and State, religion and civil power, or Christianity and civil citizenship, be blended to work in harmony to a common end?

Here we have a plan given which is neither new or novel.

"Christian Citizenship" has a special message to Christian men, and calls upon them to put their loyalty to Jesus Christ into their politics, to serve him at the caucus and primaries, and vote as he would have them vote.

"It maintains that to promote righteousness and justice is the duty of every official, from the President down, and that not one of them has any right to do anything which Jesus Christ would not do in his place."

"The Church manifestly should not, as an organization, go into politics, but the righteousness taught by the church should reach to the caucus, primary, city hall, state house and capitol."

"Neither the Church or young people's societies can, in their organized capacities, take political action; but every member of every church and society should be so well informed concerning public questions as to enable him intelligently and persistently to oppose corrupt political rule. In these days, ignorance is a disgrace and apathy is treason."

"It is not an attempt to bring the Church into politics, or to combine Church and State."

—Document No. 10.

"The Christian Citizenship League," of Chicago, was favored, on May 26, by a speech from Joseph Cook, of Boston, which it warmly indorsed by its official organ, The Christian Citizen, of June, 1895.

Mr. Cook said: "The power to dominate American politics lies in the hands of the five million American Christian voters, and that with the power is the equal responsibility." By indorsement this is Christian Citizenship literature. These utterances briefly stated amount to this.

The league does not believe in a union of Church and State, and the Church has no right as such to enter politics. But every member of each church and young people's religious society should be informed in the public evils of the State, and the righteousness taught by the Church, that they can become active in the political field purifying the State by infusing the righteousness of the Church through caucus and poles to city hall, state house and capitol. That the Church, with its five million voters, holds the power to dominate or rule American politics, and with the power is the responsibility to use it. In other words, the religious people are able to control the politics of this country according to the righteousness taught by the Church and as members of churches and religious societies it is their duty to learn the right thing at the Church, and then as dutiful citizens (not as church members) they must enter the caucus, primary, city hall and capitol, and see that it (the righteousness of the Church) is acted out in every avenue of State affairs.

The subtle danger in this movement lies in its generous profession and the credulity with which its sophism is received.

Its inexcusable wickedness is found in its assertion that it is not a union of Church and State. While it is planning in every proposition for the most gigantic and absolute union of Church and State that could be conceived in the mind of the most intolerant bigot.

Its generous profession that it is in favor of all good and no evil is deceptive in that it is not satisfied, like Jesus, the author of Christianity and the head of the Church, to live out right principles and teach them in love by doing good to all; but the modern idea of self-constituted guardianship proposes to take civil power to compel others to do right (their kind of right) which is much easier for the carnal mind than to do good itself.

The people seeing so much evil in the land and with a longing desire to see it eradicated seize with avidity upon anything that has in it even a promise of better things, without questioning the sincerity of the champion or the logical results of his plan.

This movement is wicked in falsely denying that it is a union of Church and State. Notice that every great national act, whether it be of origin or reform, is first born in the mind of some individual. It is then advocated until sufficient numbers form the same conception, to enable them to carry it out in legal form.

Now when an idea is formed in the minds of men that it is incumbent upon the Church to purify politics by putting the righteousness of the Church into every office of the State in the form of church saints for officers, and when every member of every church sees it this way, and they are strong enough to rule the State, or as Joseph Cook said, "dominate American politics," and having the power they feel responsible for its exercise; what more would it take to form a union of Church and State?

When the State is officered by the Church and its power lies in the hands of religious voters who receive their instruction at the Church as to the righteousness which should be infused into the caucus voted for at the poles legalized in the State House and executed at the Capitol, how much more would it take to put the Church power in a position to "dominate"?

From this standpoint, based upon their own utterances, we can see how subtly-wicked and dangerous this movement is.

To say that they do not want to unite Church and State, but simply want to organize in such a way as to at once put the Church in a position to dominate State affairs, is to deny in profession the object in view.

In the days of papal supremacy the State was officered by the Church, and the power to dominate politics was in the hands of the religious just exactly as this league proposes, and the State executed the enemies of the Church.

This league, as if purposely to fulfill Rev. 13:14, 15, by deceiving the people, is leading them to make an image to the papal theoc- racy. Beware of the snare. We are living in the days of that very thing, and its doom is given in Rev. 14:9, 10.
