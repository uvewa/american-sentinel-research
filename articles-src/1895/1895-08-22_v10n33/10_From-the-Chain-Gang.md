# FROM THE CHAIN-GANG.

The authorities of Rhea County, Tenn., have moved the chain-gang from the northern part of the county to the vicinity of Graysville, the home of the persecuted Adventists. The following extract from a letter written under date of August 13, by one of these criminals(?) will be of interest:—

We are located in an old two-story log house about one and a half miles north of Graysville. The house has been celled and weather-boarded in bygone days. All the windows have iron bars bolted across them. I slept last night behind the bars, but the door was open and the guard on the porch.

We went to work on the road about one and a half miles north of Graysville, digging up trees and making the roads wider. Wright Raine and B. F. Bowers have jobs driving teams on the road. Martins furnishes teams. All are prominent persecutors of the Adventists. But I think what little pay they get out of it and the satisfaction of seeing us at work on the roads is all the good they will ever get out of it unless they become as Paul.

The Graysville brethren and sisters came out to see us at work this afternoon.

We don't think now that any of us will ever work again in the chain-gang. None of us are sorry that we have worked, but I think in the future we will let them do what they will with us, but we will not work, should we be again prosecuted for exercising our God-given rights. If we leave it in the hands of the Lord it will all come out right in the end.

We are all well, healthy and happy. The sun has been extremely hot to-day. One big mulatto got so hot this afternoon he had to stop work, but none of us has done that yet.

They furnish us plenty to eat now, and as Brother Morgan is cook, it is well prepared. My time should be out in a week from to-day. I must close as it is dark, and workhouse is out of lamp oil.
