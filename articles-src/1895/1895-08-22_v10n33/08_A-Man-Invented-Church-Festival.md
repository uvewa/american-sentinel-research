# A MAN-INVENTED CHURCH FESTIVAL.

[From the New York Daily News, July 17.]

The penal code, in the sections quoted by Judge McAdam in his recent decision, uses the word "sabbath," for the first time, we believe, in the legislation of this State. Other enactments, for instance, the Revised Statutes, have spoken of "the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday," as the period set apart for abstention from labor. We think this change of designations, made by the code, is unfortunate and incorrect, not only because introducing confusion into our law, but as wrongly describing the space of time intended.

The "Sabbath" is the Hebrew word which the Bible uses for the last day of the week. "The seventh day is the Sabbath," say the ten commandments, which were dictated to Moses on Mount Sinai, and Saturday has been accordingly ever since observed by the Jewish people all over the world. The Emperor Constantine, though still a pagan, devoted the first day of the week to Christian observance, and the popes recommended Sunday and the general accord of Christendom established Sunday—the day of the resurrection—as one upon which pious ceremonies and invocations should be invariably used. But neither Constantine nor the papal authority ever presumed to authoritatively declare Sunday to be a sabbath, and the term "Christian sabbath" is applied to it merely by usage and not by any divine direction. The Christian sabbath is therefore not the Sabbath as proclaimed by the Jewish Scriptures, and by the law given to Moses on the Mount, for the Bible nowhere stamps it as sacred or applies it to the commands and prohibitions that belong to the Sabbath the Bible established. It is a man-invented, not a God-proclaimed church festival.
