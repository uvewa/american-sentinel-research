# SOUTH AFRICAN CORRESPONDENCE.

BY G. B. THOMPSON.

The agitation for Sunday laws increases. Like the pestilence that walks in darkness it moves on disguised and spreads its contagion everywhere. Religious bodies meet frequently and rarely adjourn without discussing what can be done to prop up Sunday. Their clamor for more laws knows no satisfaction so long as it is possible for the people to find anything else to employ their time other than attending church and listening to a dry sermon on Sunday.

In the South African Republic, the synod of the Dutch Reformed Church has recently had a sitting, and wrestled with the Sunday desecration problem. They memorialized the government, praying for such legislation as will put an everlasting quietus on all Sunday races, gambling, and work in the mines. Also that the government regulate the postal and telegraph business a little more in harmony with the supposed sanctity of the day. No protest being heard from these spiritual guides concerning gambling, horse-races, etc., on other days, and no demand being made for a law prohibiting them, we are left to conclude that they are not opposed to their running in full blast six days, so they stop on Sunday. But if held on Sunday, the people (and some are professed Christians, too) congregate to the horse-race more than to church. This causes many empty pews, and a corresponding shrinkage in the contents of the ubiquitous contribution plate.

This shortage in the church's exchequer, makes the sin of Sunday horse-racing exceedingly aggravating. One Transvaal clergyman is reported to have said that he saw no harm in an individual attending a "skirt dance" on Sunday, provided that he did not neglect any religious duties to do so. That is the point exactly; it is the formal religious observance of Sunday that is the object of all Sunday laws.

The Colonial Parliament is now in session in Cape Town. The members of that body had scarcely gotten into their seats before the demand for a more strict Sunday law began. And as usual the prime movers in the agitation are religious leaders. About the only thing that the Sunday law of the colony does not prohibit, is the holding of so-called "sacred concerts" on Sunday. Some have been recently held, with a good attendance. Some claim that nude pictures were shown. Perhaps so. But is a nude picture any worse to look at on Sunday than on Monday? And if it is the obscene pictures that they are seeking to prohibit, why do they ask for a law prohibiting them only on Sunday? Is not this sanctioning them six days in the week? It certainly is, and shows that all the stir is being made to exalt Sunday, and that the hubbub about the immoral concerts is only a lambskin to cover the gaunt-wolf of religious legislation.

The present agitation began in the Young Men's Christian Association, and finally crystallized into a deputation of clergymen calling on the premier and the treasurer-general, and asking for the introduction into Parliament of a bill prohibiting all sacred concerts on Sunday. The dean of Cape Town, Rev. Steyyler, of the Dutch Reformed Church, and the president of the Y. M. C. A., addressed the ministry. They thanked the Lord for the English sabbath, and argued, among other things, that voz populi is voz Dei. The reverend gentleman, no doubt, meant that the voice of the majority—"we"—is the voice of the Deity. "No doubt ye are the people, and wisdom shall die with you." Job 12:2.

The premier and the treasurer-general both replied to the deputation, promising them such a bill as they had asked for. The deputation then withdrew.

While they are thus seeking to suppress immorality by law, meetings are being held in different parts of the colony to protest against what they term as "iniquitous impost" being placed on breadstuffs, while Cape brandy is free from excise. One speaker claimed that bread was now dearer in the colony than any other place in the world, while brandy was cheaper.

If there is any other wonderful thing beside those enumerated by the wise man in Proverbs, it is the ways of a government that seeks to make men moral by law.
