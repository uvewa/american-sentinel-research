# MORE PRESS COMMENTS CONCERNING RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION IN TENNESSEE.

### Worthy a Torquemada.

[From the Manayunk (Pa.) Sentinel, July 25.]

We have received a copy of the AMERICAN SENTINEL, published at 43 Bond street, New York City, containing a marked notice stating that the eight Seventh-day Adventists who were arrested in Tennessee, for working on Sunday, have been sentenced to ninety days' imprisonment and work in the chain-gang.

There is no use in making a bowl over this matter. If the law says that work must not be done on the Sabbath, the law should be upheld and violators subjected to the full penalty.

It is too late a day for cranks to control this country, and the sooner they become aware of that fact and take their departure to other climes, the better for all concerned.

### It Is Persecution.

[From the Daily Progress, Harriman, Tenn., July 28.]

The action of the prosecutors against the Seventh-day Adventists savors as much of persecution as did the action of the old Puritans of New England, and unless history fails to repeat itself, as has never yet been the case, the reaction will be just as decided, and go just as far to the opposite extreme. Every faith prospera under persecution, and no more certain plan can be devised to make any movement successful than by a most persistent and actively intolerant opposition.

The Church of Rome had too firmly established Sunday as a day of rest, for the Reformationists to attempt to change it, and the Christian world have gone on in following the error of the Romish Church for three hundred years. The position of the Seventh-day Adventists is impregnable in the light of sacred history. There is no excuse for violating the command of God to keep the Sabbath holy, and the penalty for such violation, as stated by God himself, is death! The idea advanced . . . that you may begin with any day you please, and keep holy the seventh day after that beginning, is too absurd for argument.

### "Persecution of the Worst Sort."

[From the Roseland (La.) Herald, July 12.]

"Is it persecution?" We say it is persecution of the worst sort. Seventh-day Adventists are arrested for cutting wood or weeding in their gardens; while coal mines, factories, railroads, etc., are not molested. A short time ago a Seventh-day Adventist, in Tennessee, was arrested for working in his garden on Sunday, and the man who swore out the warrant for his arrest was driving home a cow he had bought when he was "scandalized" by seeing his neighbor working. "Oh, consistency, thou art a jewel!"

### No Defense For It.

[From the Norwich (Conn.) Bulletin, July 27.]

SEVERAL of the Southern States in the name of law are imprisoning and persecuting the Seventh-day Baptists [Adventists] with a persistence worthy the bigots of other days. One of these religionists is now in jail at Centerville, Md., because he planted some flowers in his own garden on a Sunday morning; and during this month twelve citizens of Tennessee have been tried for the same offense, or something equally harmless, and sent to jail.

There is no defense for such conduct on the part of professed Christians of other faiths. It was the mission of the Saviour through love to draw all men unto himself. He said: "Resist not evil. . . . Love your enemies; bless them that curse you; do good to them that hate you; and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you." It is not the Christlike who seek to antagonize men in his name instead of uniting them in love to God—it is not true religion that excites these bitter and rancorous feelings and intensifies hatred. The gentle and tolerant spirit of the Master are the jewels which his true followers most prize.

### Little Improvement Over the Dark Ages.

[From the Eureka (Cal.) Daily Standard, July 24.]

WHO dares boast of religious freedom in Tennessee where a union soldier, seventy years old, a man of upright character, and a Christian, is cast into prison and set to breaking rocks on the highway with the chain-gang of criminals, because he lives up to the teachings of the Bible as he understands them?*

Such proceedings on the part of professed Christians make us respect the man who makes no claims to be religious. The other churches who profess to love the same Christ and worship the same God, are doing this work of the devil. They may be honest and sincere men, too, as were the Calvinists when they roasted a man alive for not agreeing with them in faith, or the men who set to work the tortures of the terrible "Inquisition." If these things can be done in this boasted land of liberty, at the close of the nineteenth century, by men who profess to love God and follow the teachings of Jesus Christ, then are we but little improved since the rack and the torture were used to cure men of heresy.

Is imprisonment and the life of a convict, for no crime save that of living out his religious convictions, what the aged Elder Gillett fought three years to secure? Let us not point the finger of scorn to the fires of the Inquisition, to the Calvinists, or the New England Puritans when these things can be done in "Free America." We should hide our faces in shame for Tennessee and her laws.

* Father Gillett is not one of the one's vted nom. as his case was not tried—the State witnesses not being present. His case was postponed against his earnest protest. He demanded either trial or the dismissal of the case.

## For Conscience' Sake.

[From the Bellows Falls (Vt.) Times.]

The Seventh-day Adventists and the courts in East Tennessee are again involved in legal complications. Nine of the Adventists have recently been fined from $5 to $15 for doing manual labor on Sunday contrary to the statute. This sort of fining goes on regularly from year to year, yet the fines are never paid and the Adventists go to jail. They contend that to pay the fine would be to acknowledge that the law of man which says they shall pay the fine is superior to the law of God which says keep holy the Sabbath day.

This sort of prosecution is nothing but persecution. Those pious souls in Tennessee should remember that the Adventists are observing the Levitical Sabbath, and that the first day of the week, as observed by the majority in any community, is a sabbath established by man.

What did these Adventists do on Sunday? One was shingling a house, another was hoeing in a cornfield, and a third, a boy, was splitting wood for his mother. They were doing these things peaceably, simply following their every day avocations. If the people of Tennessee are such sticklers for the observance of Sunday, their religious zeal ought to carry them a little farther. No doubt there are a few livery stables down that way that hold open on Sunday, and it is reported that the laborers in the mines know no difference between Sunday and other days of the week. Why are not some of the great and wealthy corporations which are famous for their disregard of any sabbath reminded that there is a Sunday law on the statutes? Why are the poor and men of no repute always selected for examples of judicial correction?

We here submit for the benefit of all who think it their duty to force their views on others by the power of legislative acts, a noble sentiment from the pen of John Wesley, the founder of Methodism:—

"Condemn no man for not thinking as you think. Let every one enjoy the full and free liberty of thinking for himself. Let every man use his own judgment, since every man must give an account of himself to God. Ah-hor every approach, in any kind or degree, to the spirit of persecution. If you cannot reason or persuade a man into the truth, never attempt to force a man into it. If love will not compel him to come, leave him to God, the Judge of all."
