# Uncertainties Log - v10n33 (1895-08-22)

## OCR Corrections Made

### Page 1, Line 77
- **Issue:** OCR read "but iron" which appears to be an error
- **Context:** "hence the conscience is seared as with a but iron"
- **Transcribed as:** "but iron" (preserved as OCR read it, though "hot iron" seems more likely)
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM - this may be an OCR error, but preserved original reading
- **Note:** Common biblical phrase is "seared as with a hot iron" (1 Timothy 4:2)

### Page 3, Line 122
- **Issue:** OCR read "month of the Lord"
- **Context:** Isaiah 58:13-14 quotation ending with "for the month of the Lord hath spoken it"
- **Transcribed as:** "month of the Lord"
- **Confidence:** LOW - Bible text reads "mouth of the Lord" (Isaiah 58:14)
- **Note:** This appears to be an OCR error (mouth → month) in the original scan

### Page 5, Line 329
- **Issue:** OCR quality uncertain on word
- **Context:** "It is a man-invented, not a God-proclaimed church festival"
- **Transcribed as:** "man-invented"
- **Confidence:** HIGH - context confirms reading

### Page 6, Footer note (line 454)
- **Issue:** Multiple OCR errors in footnote
- **Original:** "Father Gillett is not one of the one's vted nom. as his case was not tried"
- **Transcribed as:** Preserved as written
- **Confidence:** LOW - likely should read "Father Gillett is not one of the ones voted on/mentioned" but preserved unclear OCR
- **Note:** Footnote provides important context about Father Gillett's case

This issue contains extensive legal and editorial commentary on Sunday law enforcement in multiple jurisdictions (New York, Tennessee, Canada, South Africa, England). The OCR quality is generally good with only minor uncertainties noted above.

The masthead lists three editors: Alonzo T. Jones, Calvin P. Bollman, and Leon A. Smith (Assistant Editor). This matches the known editorial structure for 1895.
