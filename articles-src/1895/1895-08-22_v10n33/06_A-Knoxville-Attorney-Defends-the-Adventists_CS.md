# A KNOXVILLE ATTORNEY DEFENDS THE ADVENTISTS.

The Knoxville (Tenn.) Tribune of the 7th inst., had a rather supercilious, but very shallow, editorial criticism of Seventh-day Adventists, their doctrines and practices, to which an attorney of that city replies in the Tribune of the 11th inst., as follows:—

**Law and Religious Freedom.**

**To the Editor of the Tribune:**

Your editorial on "Peculiar People" in your issue of Wednesday, the 7th inst., gives rise to three important questions:

First. Does the Sunday law provide for a "legal rest day" for civil purposes merely? The only way we may answer that is to try to ascertain the intention of the framers, both from the object of its passage, as may be shown in the recitals, and from the acts and the reasons therefor it purports to regulate. The recital in the act of 1741 which has been codified says: "That all and every person and persons whomsoever shall on the Lord's day, commonly called Sunday, carefully apply themselves to the duties of religion and piety." When the act was carried in the old code, the recital above quoted was omitted, the penal part of the language is about the same, with a few verbal alterations. It cannot be denied that the object of the act was to prohibit labor upon Sunday so that all might apply themselves on that day faithfully to religion and piety. The law did not and the law does not, as modified in the code, compel people to worship on that day, but it does say emphatically what day shall be set apart for everybody, irrespective of their belief, for religious purposes. It does not say, "You shall worship," but it does say, "You shall not work on that day." Why? Because as you have truly put it, "Sunday is the accepted sabbath of the country;" that is, the day for rest that the majority believe in. Does the majority believe in that day from a civil standpoint or from a religious? If from a religious view, have the majority the right to impose their matters of conscience upon the few because they are the stronger? Does might make right?

There is no use in saying the law is a mere civil regulation. It is true the acts it prohibits may be denominated civil, but the reason for which those acts are inhibited is religious. The court in construing this law says it "was to further the observance of the sabbath according to the spirit of its original institution." We all know the Sabbath was instituted for religious purposes; it gets its being from faith. It was set apart by the State because the framers of that law believed Sunday to be the particular day divinely appointed for rest. Though the law may regulate our conduct can it be gainsaid that it was enacted for the furtherance of and is founded upon religion?

Second. If founded upon religion is it right for the majority to be conscience for the minority? Let us be retrospective. Protestants have figured out the Latin Kingdom or Pagan Rome to be the numbered "beast" of Revelation, upon whose head the angels are directed to pour out the wrath of God without mixture. You know Pagan Rome's popular maxim was Vox populi vox dei. Rome presumed by her laws to provide for polytheism, her State religion (sic), "the largest religious freedom [for her subjects] consistent with common sense and good government." Everybody had all the religious freedom wanted till the followers of the humble Nazarene got to teaching in the name of "a certain man called Jesus." Then is when persecution began. Why? Because that was not in harmony with the State law. Their theory was that "the voice of the people is the voice of God." And if the majority had the right in their republic to say what gods should be worshiped, the State was not going to "undertake to adjust itself to exactly suit the views" of the travel-stained, humble, "fanatical" disciples, "whose peculiar ideas led them into deliberate violation of the law." Fanaticism is the most common application to any faith counter to our own because it does violence to our order of thinking. It is for that very reason religion and all its ordinances should be confined to its own church. The majority in Rome said what gods all should worship; the majority in Tennessee say what day all shall observe as holy time, or for religious purposes. The principle in the two republics is the same.

The same popular maxim was crystallized in papal Rome when the ecclesiastical and civil powers were united. The Protestants see in this unholy union the beast with the lamb-like appearance, and they heard its dragonic voice in the days of the Inquisition. Then the church was at the head of the State in all matters of religion; now, the church tells the State which is the day we should keep holy or observe for religious purposes. Is not the principle the same? Observe the differences of faith respecting the day in which we should rest. The Catholics observe Sunday because they believe their church changed the day by virtue of its divinely-delegated power. The majority of the Protestants observe Sunday in honor of the resurrection of Christ. The Seventh-day Baptists and Seventh-day Adventists contend that the rest-day has never been changed, and hence they keep Saturday, the Sabbath of the fourth commandment.

On this point, the editor of the New Orleans Times-Democrat says: "On the one side is the express command of Jehovah to keep the seventh day holy; and opposed to it is the injunction of secular legislatures to keep the first day holy. That is the difficulty in which Seventh-day Adventists find themselves, and as we said, they obey the voice of God rather than the voice of man. In this age of boasted civilization they are punished for acting up to their religious convictions." Is it not strange that after the gospel has been proclaimed for over eighteen hundred years that the most "fanatical" thing that a man can do is to obey the commandment of God?

Third. The act says: "If any merchant, artificer, tradesman, farmer, or other person, shall be guilty of doing or exercising any of the common avocations of life," etc. Don't you think this law is broad enough, if impartially enforced, to stop the running of steam and surface railways, milk and ice wagons, and even the printing of Sunday newspapers?

The "howl of 'persecution' and 'tyranny'" smacks very strong of that flavor when evidenced by the fact, as noticed by the Sentinel, of Knoxville, of the partial enforcement of the Sunday laws against Seventh-day Adventists, and when one of that faith who is now in the chain-gang in Tennessee for working on Sunday, stated to the jury that before he accepted the Advent faith he used to work every Sunday in the Dayton Iron Mills, walking through the city in his working clothes, unmolested by the law, and without disturbing the religious quietude of Sunday keepers.

CYRUS SIMMONS.
