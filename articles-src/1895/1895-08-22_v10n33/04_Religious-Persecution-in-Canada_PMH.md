# RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION IN CANADA.

Darrell, Ont., Aug. 14, 1895.

AMERICAN SENTINEL: On August 7, John Mathews, of Selton, Ontario, a Seventh-day Adventist, was summoned to appear before Magistrate Watson, of Ridgetown, Ontario, at 2:30 P.M., Aug. 10, 1895, to answer for the crime of cutting hay on the 7th of July, A.D. 1895, and building a fence, etc., on the 4th of August, A.D. 1895.

As the 10th of August would occur on the Sabbath day, Mr. Mathews left his work on the farm, five miles from Ridgetown, and visited the magistrate. He declined to appear on that day as it would be an open violation of the fourth commandment. It was arranged that he should appear on the 12th of August. Nevertheless the case was called Saturday afternoon, with two justices on the bench, and John Mathews' name was called twice. He was at that hour engaged in worship with others of like faith, some twenty miles from Ridgetown. The justice then issued a warrant with instruction to bring him by force to court on Tuesday, the 13th of August, at 2 o'clock, P.M.

When the case was called yesterday, the crowd was so great that the magistrate's office was too small, and the court adjourned to the old township hall. The large room was soon filled, and great interest was taken in everything said and done during the trial.

Four witnesses were called. One swore that he was not nearer to Mr. Mathews than forty or fifty rods, still he could see him plain enough. He also swore that he stood at his gate at sundown and saw Mr. Mathews raking hay. This gate is over sixty rods from the said field, and between is a thick grove of maples. He felt disturbed, too. Mr. Mathews was called, and here I give his testimony just as it was taken down in the court records:—

I am the defendant. I am a farmer. I was summoned the 7th of August. I am under arrest at the present time. I am charged with working on the Lord's day, July 7, 1895. I kept the day before, July 6, for the Lord's day, and on July 7, I was engaged in farm work. That was the first day of the week. That was not the Lord's day. Saturday comes on the Lord's day.

How do you know that?

I know that by the old family Bible.

Here the Bible, a large book, was produced and admitted as evidence. The question was referred to Elder A. O. Burrill and he was told that if he wished he could make a plea in its defense. The prosecuting lawyer kept objecting to any Bible proof. He said, "Let the statute settle which is the Lord's day."

Mr. Mathews answered again:—

The reason I did not appear on the summons, it was the Sabbath day.

I was cutting hay on July 7, 1895, also raked hay on that day. I am not in partnership with Mr. Watt. I am hired by the year to Mr. Watt—rate, $180; began working for him the 12th of September, 1894. This was a part of the work I was hired to do. I believe it would be wrong to work on Saturday, because the Bible tells us to keep it holy. I am a farmer; I work for my living.

(Signed) JOHN MATHEWS.

The case closed here. Mr. Watt objected to a conviction, on the ground that Mr. Mathews' act was not prohibited by the statute. Elder Burrill then made a strong plea for the truth. As he closed his argument with an exhortation to the court to consider well what it was doing; that they were called upon to-day to do the same work as the rulers were in the days of our Saviour; that a sentence of conviction would be convicting anew the Lord Jesus, the silence in the large hall was almost painful. We knew that the truth had scored a great victory in Ontario.

Justice Watson was greatly perplexed, but he had associated with him another magistrate, who was satisfied that the law should be enforced. They both were exceedingly kind and considerate, and we believe made their decision as they thought according to the civil statute.

Judgment as follows:—

Fine, $5; constable's fee, $5; witnesses' fees, $8; justice's fee, $2.65; total, $20.65. to be paid in ten days, or confinement in county jail at Chatham thirty days.

Mr. Mathews immediately refused to pay the fine, and told them that they might as well take him to jail. The court said, "No; you have ten days, then they will be after you." So we have one of our brethren, charged with a crime, taken by criminal warrant, tried by a criminal court and condemned to prison, left free for ten days to go where he chooses, and his prosecutors—persecutors—entertaining no fear but that he will be at his place of work ready to be offered when the tenth day comes.

May God awaken the liberty-loving people of Ontario to a sense of the dangerous work they are just entering upon, and save this goodly land and its citizens from the disgrace and ignomy that now hangs like a pall over Tennessee and other States of that mighty Union.
