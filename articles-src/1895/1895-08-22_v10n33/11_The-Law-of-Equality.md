# THE LAW OF EQUALITY.

[From the New York World, August 12.]

The law of equality is the foundation of the law of liberty. It is solely because men are "created equal" that they have an "unalienable right" to liberty.

If men were not created equal then one man or some men would have the right to rule others, to dominate their wills, to control their conduct, to direct their consciences. Every instinct of the American people denies the existence of such a right anywhere on earth.

Our system of government rests solely upon the doctrine of an absolutely equal humanity. Its first and fundamental proposition of "self-evident" truth is that "all men are created equal." It is as a corollary from this that the Declaration asserts that men are "endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights," and that "among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."

The entire history of humanity's struggle for freedom has been a record of the assertion of equal rights. That history is not yet complete. The struggle for liberty is not yet done. The actual as well as the theoretical equality of citizens is not yet fully recognized in our practice or completely guarded in our laws. All that was once claimed for despots as "divine right" is still claimed for majorities under the name of law.
