# SUNDAY HYPOCRISY.

[From the Truth Seeker, August 10.]

Oh, the hypocrisy of this Sunday business! On July 14th the old cup-defender, the Vigilant, and the new one, the Defender, tested their relative merits over the course at Newport. Says the report of the New York Press:—

As it was Sunday, the race was not called a race, but merely a friendly sail. It was a race, nevertheless, and decided just what everybody wanted to know—if the Defender was a faster boat than the improved Vigilant.

Could anything imaginable be more childish and pueril? This pretenses is akin to that which disgraces Congress—if it does—when the hands of the clock are turned back if a session holds over into Sunday, and the journal is made to read as the record of the proceedings of Saturday. Will we ever, here in the United States, get out of our swaddling-clothes?
