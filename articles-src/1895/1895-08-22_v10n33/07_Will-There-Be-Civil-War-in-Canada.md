# WILL THERE BE CIVIL WAR IN CANADA?

[From the New York Sun, August 12.]

Some articles lately published in newspapers regarded as the organs of the party in power in Manitoba, indicate that the province will persist in its refusal so to modify the school laws as to give Catholics part of the education fund. Moreover, the Dominion Government is invited to explain how it expects to enforce the threatened remedial measures should it venture to enact them at the next session of the Ottawa Parliament. That is to say, the party dominant in Manitoba avows its resolve to repudiate the British North America act, as the charter of Canadian Confederation is called, and this can only mean that if an attempt at coercion is made, an appeal for protection to the United States will follow.

It is, of course, possible for the lieutenant-governor of Manitoba, acting under instructions from the governor-general of the Dominion, to dismiss his present ministers and form a cabinet pledged to introduce a bill restoring to Catholics the privileges formerly enjoyed by them in the matter of education. But no such bill would be passed by the present provincial legislature, nor is there any reason to suppose, in view of the great preponderance of the Protestants among the electors, that a new legislature would evince a more tractable spirit. Sooner or later, therefore, the Tories, now in power at Ottawa, will have to keep the promise which they lately made to their Catholic supporters in Quebec, and carry through the Dominion Parliament remedial measures intended to supersede and override the will of the Manitoba legislature. The Tories will also have to provide for the execution of such measures by the coercive powers of the central government.

It is nothing short, then, of civil war which seems likely to be the outcome of the education crisis in Canada. In the threatened collision, however, between Federal and provincial interests the conditions will be very different from those under which the Riel rebellion took place. Then the central power, in its determination to discipline the French Catholics of Manitoba, had the ardent support of the Protestants of Ontario, while arrayed no less zealously against it were the sympathies of the Catholic population of Quebec. Now it is the Catholics of Quebec who call upon the Dominion Government to see to it that their co-religionists in Manitoba are not deprived of the rights guaranteed to them by the Manitoba act under which the province was constituted a part of the Dominion in 1870. That act, repeating a provision of the British North America act, declared that the provincial legislature should make no laws "prejudicially affecting any right or privilege with respect to denominational schools which any class of persons have by law or practice in the province at the time of the union." Now, at that time the Catholics and Protestants in Manitoba were nearly equal in point of numbers, and the first education act passed by the provincial legislature gave, conformably to the previous practice, to each religious community complete control of its own schools, with an equal share in all money voted for primary education. This state of things lasted for some twenty years; but in 1890 the Protestants, who had come to constitute a great majority of the population, passed a law making all public schools non-sectarian, and, while compelling Catholics to contribute to the school fund, refusing to appropriate any part of it for Catholic educational establishments. This law was declared unconstitutional by the governor-general of the Dominion in council, and upon appeal to the imperial privy council the decision was confirmed. One of the most embarrassing questions which will confront Mr. Chamberlain, in his past of secretary for the colonies, will be whether, seeing that the Protestants of Manitoba refuse to obey the mandate of the imperial privy council, he will authorize the Dominion Government to resort to military force for the purpose of executing measures designed to reinstate the Catholics of Manitoba in their legal rights with regard to school money.

Although the Catholics have law upon their side, it will be hard for Mr. Chamberlain, who is a nonconformist, to authorize the use of force to compel the appropriation of public money in Manitoba to denominational schools. It is even possible that the Tory Government at Ottawa will not ask him for such authorization; for the Orangemen of Ontario have given the ministers warning that they will enter on the path of coercion at their peril. The warning caused the Dominion Government to postpone definite action for six months; but this sign of hesitation gave such umbrage to their Quebec supporters that a crisis was only averted by an explicit pledge that, should the Manitobans in the interim fail to give the Catholics their rights, the necessary remedial measures should be introduced in the Ottawa House of Commons not later than next January.

The dilemma, then, in which the Canadian Tories find themselves is this: If they make up their minds to enforce the constitution of the Dominion they will provoke civil war in Manitoba, and will cause the Protestants, who constitute a great majority in Ontario, to regard with detestation the scheme of Federal union contrived by Sir John Macdonald. If, on the other hand, the Dominion Government shall decline or delay to employ force for the coercion of Manitoba, the Catholic masters of the province of Quebec will have a strong motive for speeding from a confederation in which their co-religionists are deprived of their legal rights.
