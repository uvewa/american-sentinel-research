Centerville (Md.) Jail, June 3, 1895.

**AMERICAN SENTINEL:**

For daring to exercise a God-given right, and for discharging my duty toward God, and in the fear of God, and that without disturbing anyone, or doing the least harm to any man, I have been taken away from my family and from my work, and put to jail for thirty days, for refusal to pay fine and costs, amounting to fourteen dollars and eighty cents. My offense was laboring on Sunday, May 12 and 19, setting out plants and hoeing in my garden. I made no noise, but was seen by certain individuals who take advantage of an old Sunday statute to persecute me, by taking away my liberty contrary to the Constitution of this country, which guarantees perfect liberty of conscience in matters of religion. It emphatically says that "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof." Such were the principles of those who framed the Constitution and who knew from the injustice and tyranny of other lands the value of the liberty to worship God according to the dictates of one's own conscience. And this is the principle taught by Jesus our Saviour. I praise him to-day for his precept and his example and for pointing out the way to all who would follow him. He says: "Fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul; but rather fear Him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell."
