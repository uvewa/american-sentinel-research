Our first-page article this week is somewhat long, and by some may be thought "dry," but it will well repay not only careful reading but study. The principles maintained in it are vital and far-reaching and ought to be understood by everyone who values human liberty, whether in civil or in religious things. We trust the article will receive more than passing attention, and that its length will deter no one from reading it.
