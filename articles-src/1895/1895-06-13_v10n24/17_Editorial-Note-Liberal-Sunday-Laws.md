At a recent meeting of the United Societies for Liberal Sunday Laws, held in this city, Hon. Otto Kempner, Chairman of the Committee of Agitation, reported that the committee had decided to issue a circular to all the trades unions of this city and vicinity asking their coöperation toward a monster two days' demonstration, next September, in favor of the liberal Sunday movement. It will be held on Sept. 25 and 26. Quite an elaborate program has been prepared for this demonstration. On the first day, says the circular, it is proposed to have a civic and industrial parade, in which all the societies and representatives of the trades and industries of the city are asked to participate. On the second day there will be a public reception, to be followed by a series of symbolical tableaux, illustrating the many unjust phases of the Sunday closing law. On both days there will be prize games among the societies participating, and athletic and dramatic entertainments. The object of the festival is to afford the general public an opportunity of expressing its sympathy with the cause of rational Sunday liberty.

We predict that this movement will amount to nothing. Doubtless many of the societies to take part in it have already forfeited their right to protest against Sunday legislation by asking the State to forbid certain kinds of business on that day, as for instance, the keeping open of barber shops, etc. The only effective opposition to Sunday laws is opposition based upon correct principles of separation of Church and State.
