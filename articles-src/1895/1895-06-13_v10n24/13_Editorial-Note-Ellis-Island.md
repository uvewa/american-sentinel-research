The latest attempted barbarism in the interests of Sunday sacredness(?) is the effort of the "missionaries" at Ellis Island to have it closed on Sunday. The effort failed as it deserved to do. The employés at the island now have two Sundays off out of three, and will be on duty only on alternate Sundays during the fall and winter. The "missionaries" who would keep hundreds of immigrants cooped up on shipboard from Saturday evening until Monday morning in the interest of their Sunday propaganda, should go and "learn what that meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice."
