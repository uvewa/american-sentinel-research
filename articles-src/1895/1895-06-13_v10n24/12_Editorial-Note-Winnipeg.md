Mr. W. H. FALCONER, Winnipeg, Manitoba, sends us the details of an attempt recently made there to compel Seventh-day Adventists to cease working on Sunday. As usual, the work complained of was quiet farm work that could not possibly cause anybody other than mental disturbance. At the time of writing, June 2, no arrests had been made, but the offending parties had been visited and threatened by the authorities. We will print Mr. Falconer's communication next week.
