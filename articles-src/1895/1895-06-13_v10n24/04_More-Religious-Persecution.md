[From the Times-Democrat, New Orleans, May 31.]

RECENTLY the Times-Democrat commented on exhibitions of grievous religious intolerance that had taken place in the two southern States of Tennessee and Georgia. In both of the instances in question, honest and industrious citizens who rested from their work on the seventh day, according to the command of the Decalogue and kept that day holy to the Lord, were fined and thrown into jail because they did not also rest from labor on the first day of the week. It is a mere question of religious belief and practice which day of the week, the first or the seventh, is kept as the day of rest or the Lord's day; and that the majority of the people of a State or nation should fine and imprison a minority who do not agree with them on the point, is neither more nor less than persecution for the sake of religious belief—a style of persecution which was in vogue three, four and five centuries ago, but has long gone out of date among all nations pretending to civilization and enlightenment.

We are astonished to see that this same religious intolerance is finding place in Mississippi. Here is a special dispatch which was published in our telegraph columns yesterday, and which explains itself:—

AERIDIEN, Miss., May 29.—Mr. Robert Nash, a Seventh-day Adventist, was yesterday arraigned in Justice Rye's court, at Amory, in this (Monroe) county, on the charge of working in his field on Sunday. Nash pleaded guilty and undertook the management of his own case, using the Bible for his law book. He keeps Saturday as religiously as a priest keeps Sunday. The case was continued until June 1.

The Mississippi statute bearing upon the subject, in Section 1291, provides that any one who shall labor or employ any one else to labor on the Sabbath day at any other than household duties, works of necessity or charity, or on railroads or steamboats, shall, on conviction, be fined not more than $20 for every such offense.

We do not profess, of course, to anticipate what the result of the trial of Robert Nash, Seventh-day Adventist, will be when it is held by the Monroe County Court on to-morrow, but as the majority of the people of Mississippi have passed a law prohibiting the minority of their number from working on the first day of the week, on which day the majority perform their religious celebrations, the chances are that Mr. Nash will either hand over $20 of his wealth (with costs, of course) to the State, or that he will be sold out by the sheriff, or go to prison until the fine is paid.

Any one of these results of the coming trial would be a disgrace to the State of Mississippi. The religious belief and practice of a citizen, especially when he is a good and honest citizen, ought on no account ever to be interfered with. The chances are that such a citizen has more religion in his little finger than the average legislator who made the Blue Law to punish him has in his entire composition; and that a Seventh-day Adventist by conviction should be maltreated by the State on the strength of a merely secular order to abstain from work on a certain day of the week, is equivalent to a relighting of the fagot which hurried martyrs up to heaven several centuries ago. It is simply religious persecution of the narrowest, most bigoted and most unenlightened sort; and the grand State of Mississippi would do well to wipe the relic of barbarism from her statute book.
