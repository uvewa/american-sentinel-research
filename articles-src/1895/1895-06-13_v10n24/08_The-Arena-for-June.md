One of the most valuable papers in the June Arena is "A Review of the Brooklyn Street Railway Strike," by G. Emil Richter. He begins at the beginning of the story. He shows that methods were used to consolidate all the different car companies of Brooklyn into two gigantic monopolies, and he describes the elegant deal through which the inner ring in these two companies forced the shareholders into a new combine that swindled them outright of $4,500,000. Then the squeezing process began to earn more than the five per cent. which the ring had stolen from the stockholders. The number of regular employés was cut down by one-half, and the "tripper" system of twenty cents a trip was introduced. By this means the men could not earn more than from sixty to eighty cents a day; but they were compelled to be in attendance fourteen to eighteen hours a day awaiting orders in order to obtain a commission. The company claimed that the ten-hour law did not cover this kind of service, and no time for meals was allowed in their ten hours actual service. The hours of the regular service men were also lengthened in the same way and upon the same knavish technically of legality. Then the time-tables were fixed up, and the regular men were required to make more trips in a shorter time, and the law which enacted that no car should be run at a greater speed than ten miles an hour was set aside. The time-tables were so arranged that the men were compelled in order to save themselves from fines and dismissal for impunetuality to run cars at a speed of from fifteen to twenty miles an hour. The result was great loss of life. When the contract with the Knights of Labor for the year expired, the executive committee of the Knights wanted to renew it, on terms embodying the law, regarding rate of speed and length of hours of service, and asking for an increase of wages of twenty-five cents a day. But the companies refused to treat with the committee. They wanted to run their "own business" as they saw fit. Of course they were not to be embarrassed with such presumptuous superficialities as certain legal enactments; but when the strike came they worshiped "law and order." The progress of the strike is then related as was told from day to day in the New York Recorder.

We by no means justify the violence which characterized this strike, but as Mr. Richter's article shows, the lawlessness was not all on one side.
