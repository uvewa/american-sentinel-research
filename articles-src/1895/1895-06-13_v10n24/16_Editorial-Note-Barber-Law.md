On the 2nd inst. there went into effect a new Sunday statute in this State forbidding barbering on Sunday, except in New York City and Saratoga, and requiring shops in these places to close at 1 p.m. on that day. The act was passed professedly in the interests of the "overworked" barbers; but a thousand Brooklyn barbers, in mass-meeting assembled, resolved a few days since, to test the constitutionality of the statue in the courts, and took steps to raise the necessary funds. About the same time a poor German barber, whose business had been ruined by the new order of things, committed suicide because he could no longer make a living. Sunday was his only good day, as during the rest of the week he could scarcely pay expenses. The new "law" is of course a benefit to the New York shops, as many Brooklyn men now get shaved in this city on Saturday evening before going home, who formerly patronized Brooklyn shops on Sunday. The act is unequal, unjust, and ought to be declared unconstitutional, as it certainly is.
