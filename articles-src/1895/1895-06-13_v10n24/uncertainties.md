# Uncertainties Log: v10n24 (1895-06-13)

## OCR Quality Issues

### Page 1
- **Line 27**: "ALONZO T. JOSVE" — OCR error, should be "ALONZO T. JONES"
- **Line 28**: "CALVIN P. BOLLINAN" — OCR error, should be "CALVIN P. BOLLMAN"
- **Line 33**: "ANNISTANT EDITOR" — OCR error, should be "ASSISTANT EDITOR"

### Page 2
- **Line 98**: Footnote marker placement — text reads "duty" with footnote, but the actual footnote appears to be editorial commentary rather than Nash's speech footnote. Left as is, but may need verification.

### Page 5
- **Line 268**: "AERIDIEN" — appears to be OCR error for "MERIDIEN" (Meridian, Miss.)
- **Line 302**: "steambasts" — OCR error, should be "steamboats"

### Page 7
- **Line 476-482**: Table formatting corrupted by OCR. Table of contents for "Steps to Christ" book appears garbled. Preserved as best as possible but may need manual correction from original.

### Page 8
- No significant uncertainties

## Editorial Decisions

- Split masthead information from main articles (appears to have OCR errors in editor names)
- Treated all press comment excerpts as one consolidated article rather than splitting each newspaper separately
- Book advertisements on pages 7-8 were SKIPPED per instructions (promotional content)
- All substantive editorial notes/short items given their own files with YAML frontmatter per current guidelines

## Author Attribution Notes

- No author initials found on lead article "The Courts, Constitutional Law..." — marked as "editorial"
- R. R. Whaley letter explicitly signed — marked as "explicit" attribution
- Press comments are reprints from various newspapers — treated as compilation with "editorial" attribution since American Sentinel is presenting them
- "More Religious Persecution" explicitly marked as reprint from Times-Democrat, New Orleans
