[From the Lester (Iowa) Record.]

GEORGIA is not in Russia; it is in the southeastern part of Protestant United States.

Mississippi has followed the example of Georgia. Mr. R. T. Nash was arrested May 9, at Amory, Miss., for hoeing in his garden on Sunday. . . Surely this is a Christian(?) nation.

[From the Wamego (Kia.) Times.]

THE laws of Georgia are severe on those who prefer to observe Saturday instead of Sunday as their day of worship. J. Q. Allison, of Douglasville, Ga., has been convicted for violating the Sabbath statute of that State. Mr. Allison believes that the more ancient statute is not obsolete, "Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work: but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work."

[From the Dixon (Cal.) Tribune, May 24, 1895.]

THE Seventh-day Adventists in this State are a peaceable, moral and conscientious class of people, who observe their own Sabbath with a rectitude which would do credit to other sects. We have every reason to suppose that the same characteristics appertain to the denomination in other States. The prosecution and inhuman punishment to which Adventists have lately been subjected in Tennessee and Georgia for laboring on Sunday, smack much of persecution and reveal a religious intolerance which should have no place in this enlightened country.

[From the Reedsburg (Wis.) Free Press.]

PROBABLY as long as the world stands the majority will misuse its power by punishing members of the minority for entertaining and acting upon unpopular opinions. We are sorry to notice the crusade being waged in Georgia and Mississippi against people who, believing in and keeping Saturday as the Sabbath, insist upon their right to labor on Sunday. We notice that recently a man in Georgia convicted of that offense has been placed in a chain-gang along with criminals whose punishment consists in working on roads and public works under a prison boss. The vindictive spirit that will enact and enforce a law to compel obedience to a religious form further than is necessary for the maintenance of good morals for the public good, is greatly to be deplored; but it exists, nevertheless, always has, and probably always will.

[From the Courier, Gibson City, Ill.]

A wave of religious bigotry and persecution seems to be sweeping over the South. Following the imprisonment of the Seventh-day victims in Tennessee comes the news that J. Q. Allison, of Douglasville, Ga., has been convicted of violating the Sabbath law of that State, and, as a punishment, sent to the chain-gang! Think of it. A Christian man, whose only offense was that he observed a different day as the Sabbath from his neighbors, is by their connivance forced into the chain-gang, to work with the vilest criminals, under cruel taskmasters! All this is sanctioned by the law in a so-called Christian State. Mr. Allison was saved from his horrible punishment by unknown friends' paying his fine, after the sheriff had started with him, but that does not mitigate the barbarity of the sentence.

And Mississippi, too, joins in the proscription of the Seventh-day Adventists. We read that at Amory, in that State, on the 9th inst., Mr. R. T. Nash was arrested and imprisoned for hoeing in his garden on Sunday, having observed the previous day as the Sabbath. It is not in evidence that the good Christians who caused the arrest made any effort to interfere with the running of Sunday trains or the grosser forms of Sunday violation; but the man who spent the quiet hours at work in his garden, alone with his thoughts and his God, interfering with the rights and pleasures of no one, must be arrested, fined and perhaps doomed to the unspeakable horrors of the chain-gang. Is it not time for the friends of religious liberty to arouse themselves when such things are going on in a number of our States?

**A Georgia Disgrace.**

[From the Four Corners, Wheatland, Cal., May 25.]

J. Q. ALLISON, a pious Seventh-day Adventist, of Douglasville, Ga., has been convicted of violating the Sabbath statute of the State of Georgia, and sentenced to the chain-gang. Mr. Allison believes that the more ancient statute is not obsolete: "Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work: but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work."

We have looked up the Georgia law and find that it provides that the offender may "be punished by a fine not to exceed one thousand dollars, imprisonment not to exceed six months, to work in the chain-gang on the public works, or on such other works as the county authorities may employ the chain-gang, not to exceed twelve months, and any one or more of these punishments may be ordered, in the discretion of the judge."

What is here but a possibility of, first, a thousand-dollar fine; second, a six-months' imprisonment; third, the chain-gang; fourth, all three combined; fifth, he faces the possibility of being hired out to the highest bidder, to some contractor, and in either case, whether in the chain-gang of the State or the private contractor, should he refuse to work on the Sabbath, as he surely would, he "may be punished with death"!

Upon the heels of this disgraceful proceeding in Georgia is flashed the news from Amory, Miss., that Robert T. Nash, of that place, has been arrested for working in his garden on Sunday. If these news items were sent from the unexplored regions of the South Seas, or were they dated back in those puritanic times when New Englanders loved to burn Quakers and witches, we could make some allowance, but coming as they do from a supposed enlightened portion of the land of liberty in an age when religious fanaticism in the form of persecution is supposed to be dead, these news items are startling. A cardinal American principle consists of permitting the worship of God according to the dictates of conscience, and for a Georgia or Mississippi law to stand unrepealed that will allow the chain-gang sentence to apply to Seventh-day Adventists is but a part of an American outrage.

[From the Warren (Ill.) Sentinel, May 22.]

Mr. J. Q. ALLISON, residing at Douglasville, Georgia, for violating the Georgia Sabbath statute, was last week sentenced to the chain-gang. The law provides that an offender may be punished by fine or imprisonment, or to work in the chain-gang. Another section provides that such offenders as members of the chain-gang who may be guilty of insurrection or attempt at insurrection (such as refusal to work on the seventh day) shall, upon trial and conviction, be deemed guilty of a capital offense and punished with death, or such other punishment as the judge may inflict.

Thus in this enlightened day and age, in the State of Georgia, . . . we find that for following his religious convictions alone, a citizen may be arrested, fined a thousand dollars, imprisoned for six months, sent to the chain-gang, or all three combined, or he may be "hired out" (sold) to a private contractor, and if he refuses to work on what he considers the Sabbath (which he surely would) he may be deemed guilty of a capital offense and punished with death!

Tennessee and Mississippi are but little behind their sister State of Georgia in this religious persecution. In the former State various citizens have been arrested and imprisoned for offending the Sunday statute, and even a promising college has been broken up by the persecution. In the latter State, at Amory, no longer ago than May 9, a Mr. R. T. Nash was arrested for hoeing in his garden on the statute Sunday. Thus we see that people desiring to go South and take with them their religious views should investigate the statutes before moving, or they may find themselves sold out as slaves or even sentenced to be shot or hung!
