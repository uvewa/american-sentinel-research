A DISPATCH, published in the Mail and Express, of the 8th inst., runs thus:—

CINCINNATI, O., June 8.—George Boehm, of this city, deserted the Franciscan Brotherhood Thursday night and escaped from the monastery near Louisville, Ky. He is only twenty years old, but has been at the monastery since he was sixteen. He grew tired of the restraint, and escaped from a window before a reply to his application for release could be received from Rome.

By what right do Roman Catholics imprison people in this country and hold them subject to orders from Rome? Does Rome suspend the writ of habeas corpus at will in the United States of America?
