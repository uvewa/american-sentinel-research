A PROMINENT and somewhat forbidding feature of the several cases under Sunday statutes which have occurred in the various States, is the blind adherence of the courts to precedent, and the utter failure of judges to grasp the idea that it is the duty of the magistrate, as a sworn officer, be he a justice of the peace or the chief-justice of the United States, not only to interpret the statute, but to declare the law, to sacredly guard the rights of the citizen, and to support the Constitution, not as others understand it, but as he himself understands it.

Of course, we have no means of knowing the private opinion of Judge Janes, of Georgia, in regard to the constitutionality of a statute which sends a man to the chain-gang and to possible death for doing honest labor on his own premises on Sunday; but we believe that his better nature revolted against the sentence which his mistaken sense of duty led him to impose. He said:—

I am here simply to enforce the laws, and no matter what a man's religious opinions are, if the laws [statutes] of the State are that he shall not work on a certain day, and he continues to work on that day, I am bound to enforce the law. I am simply bound to do that; that is my duty; that is my oath.

His Honor should remember that any statute which trenches upon inalienable right is not law, and that the law under which he acts is the Constitution which he solemnly swore to support when he ascended the bench; and that instrument provides that "perfect freedom of religious sentiment shall be, and the same is hereby, secured; and no inhabitant of this State shall ever be molested in person or property, or prohibited from holding any public office or trust, on account of his religious opinion; but the liberty of conscience hereby secured shall not be so construed as to excuse acts of licentiousness or justify practices inconsistent with the peace or safety of the people."

This supreme law of the State of Georgia is clearly violated by the statute which the judge imagined he was bound to enforce; because this fundamental law guarantees absolute freedom of conscience, except in "acts of licentiousness" or "practices inconsistent with the peace and safety of the people." And that the Sunday work done by Mr. Allison did not come under either of these heads is a matter of record in the case; for, according to the official notes of the court stenographer, the judge himself said to Mr. Allison: "You are not on trial for disturbing anybody;" and his honor plainly stated that the only question before the court was whether or not Mr. Allison worked upon the first day of the week, which the Georgia statutes denominate the "Sabbath" and "Lord's day." Thus the only possible civil question involved was utterly ignored, and Mr. Allison was tried, not for "acts of licentiousness" nor for "practices inconsistent with the peace or safety of the people," but for offending the religious sensibilities of the people by working upon a day which the majority of the people in Georgia regard as the Sabbath.

# Similar View Entertained in Tennessee.

Judge Parks, of Tennessee, took a somewhat similar position in the Adventist cases tried before him last March in Rhea County. It would seem probable, from the sentiments expressed by him at that time, that he does not regard the Sunday statute of Tennessee as in harmony with the Constitution, as he understands it, and that had he been upon the Supreme Bench instead of the bench of the Circuit Court, he would not have decided as he did. His excuse was:—

The Supreme Court of this State, whose decision must be taken as final by the lower courts, has passed upon the law [statute] in question, and we cannot rightfully reverse the decision.

We say this was Judge Parks' "excuse," because, as one learned in the law, he must certainly know that every government officer, from the lowest to the highest, is sworn to support the Constitution as he understands it and not as others understand it.

In his "History of the Formation of the Constitution," George Bancroft states this principle, which had, however, been previously enunciated by Alexander Hamilton and others. Of the Constitution of the United States and of the Supreme Court, Mr. Bancroft says:—

The Constitution retains the means of protecting itself against the errors of partial or interested judgments. In the first place, the force of the judicial opinion of the Supreme Court, in so far as it is irreversible, reaches only to the particular case in dispute. . . . To the decision of the underlying question of constitutional law, no such finality attaches. To endure it must be right.¹

It is true that this was said of decisions touching the Federal Constitution, but these words are just as true of decisions under the constitution of any State, for this has been a well-established common-law principle for centuries. Sir Edward Coke, England's greatest chief justice, discusses it at length, and shows it not only to be imbedded in law, but to be conformable to reason.

In a letter written in 1820, Thomas Jefferson denominated blind adherence to precedent and to decisions of courts, however high, a "very dangerous doctrine." To his correspondent, who had written a book, "The Republic," Mr. Jefferson said:—

You seem, in pages 84 and 148, to consider the judges as the ultimate arbiters of all constitutional questions,—a very dangerous doctrine indeed, and one which would place us under the despotism of an oligarchy. . . . The Constitution has erected no such single tribunal, knowing that, to whatever hands confided, with the corruptions of time and party, its members would become despots.²

In his first inaugural address, March 4, 1861, President Lincoln stated the same principle, thus:—

I do not forget the position assumed by some, that constitutional questions are to be decided by the Supreme Court; nor do I deny that such decisions must be binding in any case upon the parties to a suit, as to the object of that suit, while they are also entitled to a very high respect and consideration in all parallel cases by all other departments of the government; and while it is obviously possible that such decision may be erroneous in any given case, still the evil effect following it, being limited to that particular case, with the chance that it may be overruled and never become a precedent for other cases, can better be borne than could the evils of a different practice.

At the same time the candid citizen must confess that, if the policy of the government upon vital questions affecting the whole people is to be irrevocably fixed by the decisions of the Supreme Court, the instant they are made, as in ordinary litigation between parties in personal action, the people will have ceased to be their own rulers—having to that extent practically resigned their government into the hands of that eminent tribunal.

Andrew Jackson, when President of the United States, vetoed a bill for the rechartering of the National Bank, upon the ground that it was unconstitutional, notwithstanding the fact that the Supreme Court of the United States had passed upon that very question, and had declared such a law to be constitutional: but President Jackson very properly declared that he was sworn to support the Constitution as he understood it and not as others understood it. This is undoubtedly the correct principle, not only of American Government, both State and national, but of common law as well. And no judge, and no prosecuting attorney, is under any obligation to enforce an unconstitutional statute, which to him must be such as he believes to be unconstitutional, unless under specific and definite order from a competent tribunal in the identical case at bar; when the act in law is not his but the act of the tribunal issuing the order.

For instance, were a prosecuting attorney to refuse to prosecute a case arising under a law which he deemed unconstitutional, the judge of the court might order him to proceed and to prosecute the case, and it would be his duty to obey the order of the court; but he is bound by no decision either of that court or of any other court in any other case, and it is his sworn duty to administer the law and support the Constitution as he himself understands it.

This Principle in Tennessee.

This principle has been observed, too, in the State of Tennessee by her ordinary court officers. Some years ago, a justice of the peace, who was then, and still is, a practicing attorney in Henry County, Tenn., held the Sunday statute of that State to be unconstitutional, in so far as it is applied to the observers of the seventh day. And that there are those also who follow the law rather than the statute in this matter among the prosecuting attorneys of Tennessee, will appear from the following private letter, dated December 22, 1891:—

When I was—from 1878 to 1887—the attorney general of ——, I absolutely refused to make my office the medium through which to indict and punish men who tolled six days and then asserted their right to worship God under their own vine and fig tree according to the dictates of conscience.

The very moment the legislatures of American States declare (and that declaration is carried into effect) that men shall (without reference to their creed) have one Sunday, and that the Sunday of modern Christianity, commonly known as the Sabbath, shall be alike kept holy by every man under a penalty for its violation, you sound the death knell of American republicanism and open the way for a religious inquisition as infamous, devilish, and ungodly as was that of Italy. Our forefathers, with prophetic vision, saw the danger of commingling the affairs of Church and State, and, with a wisdom as consummate as it was politic, they laid the very foundation of this Government upon the idea that religion should never have any part or identity with the civic machinery.

Ten or twelve years ago when I was the owner and editor of the daily —— here (being attorney-general at the same time), the preachers briefed from their pulpits on the duty of the attorney general to rigidly enforce the Sunday law. I replied to their criticisms and I think I got the best of the argument—at all events I did not yield my principles, and defied them to carry out their threat to impeach me. They did not do so; and from that day to this, the men of —— worship God in their own way and each creed selects its own day. The churches are protected in their right to worship as they may deem proper; but the man who does not feel like going to church on Sunday but prefers to do as seems best for himself, is allowed to go his way rejoicing, with none to make him afraid. All Sunday laws ought to be wiped from the statute books and every man left free to pursue the line of worship dictated by his conscience.

Oh, if it were possible to rebuild the public sentiment of this country and model it after the plan of Richard R. Johnson, Jefferson, Washington, and the men of their day and generation!

But instead of taking this view of the case and asserting their independence as men, and fearlessly doing their duty as judges and defending the rights of the people against the misconceptions of the Supreme Court, the Circuit Court judges and prosecuting-attorneys of Tennessee have aided in the work of judicial legislation, and have actually added much to the Sunday law, even beyond what is necessarily involved in the decision of the Supreme Court, in the Parker case which has been so blindly followed.

Judge Swiggart's Charge.

In his charge to the jury in the case of W. D. Dortch, tried in Henry County, at the January term of the Circuit Court in 1893, His Honor, Judge Swiggart charged as follows, upon the particular point of nuisance:—

The law prohibits the citizens from following their daily avocations upon Sunday, and from performing secular labor on Sunday, works of necessity and charity being excepted; but it is not an indictable offense for a man to perform one act on Sunday against the statute. The statute prescribes a fine recoverable before a justice of the peace for such acts of work on Sunday contrary to the statute. But it is a misdemeanor against the laws of Tennessee under the ruling laid down by our Supreme Court for any one to engage openly and publicly in secular work and to repeat and continue such acts of work on Sundays in such a manner as to constitute a nuisance, such labor not being works of necessity or charity, such work being in such an open and public manner as to attract the attention of the public to it. Under the ruling, this would constitute a nuisance.

How Judge Parks Viewed It.

This was exactly in harmony with the decision of the Supreme Court which said that while "a single act may be liable only to the penalty prescribed by the statute, yet a succession of such acts becomes a nuisance and is indictable."¹ But in the several cases at the March term of the Circuit Court in Ilhea County, Tenn., His Honor, Judge Parks, charged distinctly and repeatedly, as follows²:—

A single act of work on Sunday is not a nuisance in the eyes of the law unless that act be done in some peculiarly flagrant manner. One act is indictable if it is done in this manner: if it will tend to corrupt the public morale. The question for you to determine is whether the work performed by the defendant in this instance was of such a nature or character as to come under this head.

Such was Judge Parks' charge upon this point, in the first Sunday case tried before him; and each succeeding charge was substantially the same. Of course, this charge left the jury an opportunity to return a verdict of not guilty, upon the ground that the work was not done in a "peculiarly flagrant manner." As a matter of fact, two members of the jury did wish to bring in such a verdict upon that ground. A temporary disagreement was the result, and the jury returned to court for further instructions. The judge then recharged them as follows:—

I charged you that one offense is not necessarily of itself a nuisance in the eyes of the law, but if it were done in an open and public way where the public might see it—in a public place, and if it were of such a nature and character as to be a flagrant violation of the Sabbath, that would be an offense under the law, and a verdict of guilty should be given. I also charged you that if the defendant did an act of secular work on Sunday, or if he had it done on Sunday, he should be found guilty. Now it is for you to judge from the evidence before you, whether or not the defendant, if he did an act of secular work on Sunday, or if he had it done, whether or not it was done in an open and public way, and whether if it were, it amounted to a flagrant violation of the Sabbath as regarded by the law.

In this recharge but little is left for the jury to decide. The judge plainly says: "I charged you that if the defendant did an act of secular work on Sunday, or if he had it done on Sunday, he should be found guilty."

It will be observed that there is a wide difference between the view taken of the law by Judge Swiggart and that entertained by Judge Parks. We have no reflections whatever to cast upon either of these gentlemen. Doubtless both acted honestly and charged as they understood the law. Judge Parks especially showed clearly by his leniency when he came to the matter of sentence, and by subsequently recommending the pardon of the convicted parties, that he had absolutely no malice in the matter; but notwithstanding this, his charge, taken in connection with the decision of the Supreme Court and with the charge of Judge Swiggart in a similar case, illustrates very forcibly the development of religious law by judicial legislation.

How the Courts Made the Law.

It will be of interest to trace this matter from its inception to the present time. It was first held by Judge Caruthers, at Knoxville, in 1855 (3 Sneed 134), that profanity was indictable notwithstanding the fact that the code of the State provided a fine of "fifty cents for every oath or curse." The judge held that while a single oath was punishable only under the statute, that "several oaths" constitute a nuisance and render the one uttering them liable to indictment. The next report of a case of this character occurs in 1871 in the case of the State ex. Steel (3 Heiskell 135). In this instance Judge Nelson followed the ruling of Judge Caruthers in the case which occurred in 1855. In September, 1877, comes the case of the State ex. Gaines (7 Lea 410), in which Judge Cooper, after quoting the two cases previously referred to, said:—

It was stated by the eminent judge who delivered the opinion of this court in the State ex. Graham, that an isolated act of profanity was only punishable under the Act of 1741 brought into the Code, Section 1735, which imposes a small pecuniary penalty for each oath recoverable before a justice of the peace. It is possible, however, to conceive of cases where even a single oath, either by its terms, its tone, or manner, might, under peculiar circumstances, be held to be a nuisance.

In the very next reported case, the State ex. Young (10 Lea 165), Judge Cooper himself takes advantage of this remarkable extension of law which he himself had made by judicial legislation, and says: "A single act of profanity would not ordinarily be sufficient to convict the defendant; but as we have stated, even a single oath, either by its terms or manner, or the circumstance under which it was uttered, might be a nuisance." He then holds that in this case a single oath was a nuisance. Such is the slander foundation upon which the courts of Tennessee have built, and upon which they have legislated until they now hold that a single act of Sunday work which the statute provides shall be punished by a fine of three dollars, is indictable as a nuisance, and may be punished by any penalty under fifty dollars, at the discretion of the jury, or above that sum, in the discretion of the judge.

As we said before, we cast no reflections upon the judges who have by their rulings so entirely changed the Sunday law of Tennessee. We simply state these facts to illustrate the danger that there is in judicial legislation, and the necessity of vigilance upon this point in order that the principles of freedom and the constitutional safeguards which have been thrown around our cherished liberties, be not entirely swept away by the courts in the exercise of too great a discretion in the direction of adding by judicial legislation to the statutes and of no discretion whatever in the interests of justice and the preservation of human rights.

The trend of the times is, however, toward centralization of power and the deification of law. Precedent is exalted to the place that properly belongs to the Constitution. Prejudices more or less pronounced have been allowed to swerve men from justice, and in this departure from well-established law and legal principles, the fundamental law of the State—that law from which all other law receives the only power to bind which it has—this fundamental law is well-nigh lost sight of; and when the guarantees of the Constitution are swept away, when our most sacred of all law is set aside, in what respect are we better off than the despotisms of Europe having no written constitutions,—no established charters protecting the people from the violations of law on the part of their servants—the governments?
