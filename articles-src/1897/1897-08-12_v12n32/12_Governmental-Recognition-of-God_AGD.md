BY A. G. DANIELLS.

We believe that God is, and that His existence and authority ought to be recognized by every intelligent being in the universe.

Nevertheless, we cannot approve of the proposal to make a formal recognition of God in the constitution of any civil government. The whole idea is wrong, and the consequences must be disastrous.

In proof of this we submit the following simple, undeniable facts:—

The recognition of God is an act of faith. Heb. 11:6.

A statement of that recognition is a declaration of faith. Matt. 16:15, 16.

To incorporate in the constitution of a civil government a recognition of God, or a declaration of faith, is to insert a religious clause.

To insert a religious clause in the constitution is to give the government a religious basis.

A religious basis confers power for religious legislation.

Power to legislate on matters of religion implies power to execute religious laws.

Power to execute religious laws means compulsion in matters of religion.

To compel the conscience in religious matters is to invade the rights of men.

To invade the rights of men is to subvert good government, whose primary object is to protect those rights.

Thus it is proved that—

To insert a religious clause or a declaration of religious belief in the constitution of a civil government lays the foundation for the subversion of that government.

It is difficult to see how any one can reasonably deny the correctness of these propositions. They are self-evident. They show that the worst possible consequences will follow if the proposal of the churches should carry.

### THE TRUE RECOGNITION OF GOD.

As already stated, we believe that God is worthy of the grateful recognition of every intelligence in the universe. We believe, too, that there are proper lines on which we should seek to express and secure such recognition. But we do not believe that the formal recognition of God in civil and political compacts is the proper means for the expression of such recognition.

That is not the kind of recognition God asks.¹ It is not the kind that will honor Him. Nor is it the kind that will benefit the nation.

The recognition that God asks of men is personal faith in Him, and obedience to His just requirements. To recognize God truly means to recognize the sacred rights He has conferred upon men. The only true governmental recognition of God that can be made is for the government to recognize the teachings of Christ regarding the total separation of Church and State, and to frame such laws as will safeguard the rights and liberties of all its citizens.
