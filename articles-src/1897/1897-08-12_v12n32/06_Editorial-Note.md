WHERE in all history is there any record of a good civil government managed by the church, or conducted upon a religious basis? On the other hand, it is easy enough to point to some exceedingly bad governments which have been run by the Church, or have been established upon "Christianity." The pagan governments controlled religion, and they were bad enough; but the papal governments, in which religion—and "Christianity" at that—was the controlling power, were infinitely worse.

This question is meant especially for the "Christian citizenship" and Christian Endeavor people.
