"The mixing up of politics with religion under any circumstances, is fraught with manifold and multiform dangers. There is no tyranny so cruel, no yoke so intolerable, as priestcraft when vested with temporal authority. More political atrocities, butcheries, crimes and enormities, have been committed in the name and on account of religion than have arisen from any and all other causes combined."—Bishop Venner.
