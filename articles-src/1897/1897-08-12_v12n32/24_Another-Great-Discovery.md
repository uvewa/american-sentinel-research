ANOTHER "great discovery" has been made by "prospectors" in search of Biblical support for Sunday observance; and Mr. Gamble's great "find" of a perambulatory attachment to the ancient weekly Sabbath, must now sink into insignificance. For this new "great discovery" brings to light nothing less than a plain, unequivocal command, "On Sunday thou shalt rest."

The discoverer is the *Ram's Horn*, a Chicago journal which has made quite a reputation in the religious world. Contrary to Mr. Gamble's style, however, the *Ram's Horn* brings out its discovery in the form of mere casual mention, thus: "It is true that there is a more profound objection [to the Sunday newspaper] in the fact that it is hostile to the law of God, which says, 'On Sunday thou shalt rest.'"

The exposure of such a "nugget" as this—worth millions if it is only genuine—ought to create a great rush to this new Klondike of the Sunday supporters; only—what must be very disappointing—the *Ram's Horn* omits to tell where it is located. When its latitude and longitude become known and when it is proved that this wonderful nugget is genuine gold, there will be the greatest excitement and joy in the Sunday camp that was ever known.

But meanwhile it is all a question of only "when."

A CONGRESS to consider the question of Sunday enforcement was recently in session in Brussels, Belgium. It was decided that Sunday rest could be applied to nearly all the industries in the country, and a special effort will be made to secure a cessation of Sunday work by the railways.
