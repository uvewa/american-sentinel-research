Again a correspondent calls upon me to "explain" myself. This it is to write over a signature. I have sometimes lamented the absence of personal responsibility in American journalism—have wished that our papers would have the name of each editorial contributor printed at the end of his article. But I see now that anonymity is not without its advantages, at any rate, for the writer. If he overstates or understates or blunders in any way, the "Messrs. Editors" are promptly called to account, and, save as it may affect his chances of promotion on the "staff," the individual escapes.

Yet the use of a signature undoubtedly tends to make the writer careful and painstaking about what he writes. One is more fearful of saying the wrong thing, and of saying the right thing in a wrong way, than when he is sheltered under the regis of the collective "we." And I believe that the influence of the signed paper is vastly greater than that of the unsigned. The reader may not know his man. But it is something for him to be reminded through the name affixed that he is addressed by a being like unto himself, and not by a mere abstraction, or "composite body."

***

But to my correspondent. He wants to know why I take it upon myself to say that a lawyer cannot dispute the decision of a court as to what is the law, while such privilege is open to an ordinary layman, and he observes that this was not the view adopted by Mr. Lincoln. The answer cannot properly or profitably be given in a single paragraph.

Everybody knows that, in order for men to get along together in a high state of civilization, certain fictions are necessarily assumed to be true. Some of these are social. Others are legal. Legal fictions may be compared, in the operations of the body politic, to the square root of minus *a* in the operations of algebra and of the higher mathematics. There is admittedly no such thing as the square root of minus *a*; the very definitions, the basic assumptions of algebraic science expressly repudiate it, and render its existence impossible. Yet we have a symbol for this non-existent thing, and we assume, therefore, that it does exist. We carry out long and complicated calculations in which it frequently appears, and is dealt with just as we deal with the square root of plus *a*. The result thereof is materially affected by its presence, and the processes in which it plays a part. These results are practical and real, and by means of them we may build a railroad, a locomotive or a steamboat.

***

It is so in jurisprudence. On that broad, and sometimes dangerous, yet often salutary consideration known as "public policy" is based the acceptance of certain general rules which are the expression of that which is not. But working under these rules, the affairs of human life are administered, if not in consonance with exact justice, yet so as to preserve the public order, and keep the popular mind in a reasonable state of content. More than this it is vain to expect of any machinery that is the work of mortal hands.

***

One of the most important of all legal fictions is that every person knows the law. This applies to civil as well as criminal jurisprudence. If I commit a trespass, ignorantly, on another's land, the owner is entitled to damages, though they may be merely nominal. If I do in a strange country what is therein forbidden it is no excuse for me that the same act was not only tolerated but commended in my own land, and that I had no reason to suspect that the rule was otherwise abroad. So far, the assumption that every person knows the law is applied with absolute strictness.

***

But, now, as a matter of fact, nobody knows the law. This is, among other reasons, because the law is human, and therefore its language needs an expounder. The merchant does not know the law; and, accordingly, he consults counsel. Counsel does not know the law; so he asks the court of first resort to say what it is. This court does not know the law; therefore the judge signs and seals the "Bill of Exceptions," in order that the highest State court may pass upon the points involved. If a "Federal question"—that is to say, a question under the Federal Constitution or a United States statute—be in issue the Supreme Court at Washington is the tribunal of last resort. But, like the judges of the highest State court, the members of this august body do not profess to know the law. They listen, for information, to the arguments of eminent counsel; they consult authorities for light; they discuss with each other, carefully and laboriously, all aspects of the case before them. And then they deliver—what? Not the law as it must be taken by all men, for all time, but the opinion of all or a majority of the judges who are at the time upon the bench, as to what is the law governing the particular case before them.

***

There is no finality even here. Sometimes a "rehearing" is granted, and the court, after more mature deliberation, or upon the strength of new points adduced, or new authorities cited, reverses its decision. Always, there is a chance, owing to the infinite variety of circumstances, that a case apparently exactly similar to one already decided will to the court present some variance calling for a decision of a different kind from that delivered in the first. New judges succeeding the present members of the court may take exactly the opposite view to theirs where the facts are to all intents and purposes identical.

* * *

FROM all this we see that human law differs radically from physical law, for example, in that it is, in the last analysis, a matter of opinion and not a matter of demonstration. Change your professor of natural philosophy as often as you please—you will get the same statement of the law of gravitation. Change your judges, and you will very probably change your law and get new ideas of constitutionality, interpretation and application.

THIS judicial opinion, which is the law for the time being, binds an attorney as it does not bind the people at large. Setting aside matters of conscience, all are bound alike to obey the law as it is judicially construed. But the attorney, who is an officer of the court, who holds his position subject to its judgment upon his conduct as such, who comes before it to inquire concerning its judgment on certain facts, is, according to the etiquette of the profession, debarred from criticising the court's conclusions. He is like to a military officer attending a council of war. He gives his ideas; he argues his positions; he defends and attacks a series of propositions. But when he and the rest have all exhausted their resources and the commanding general has ordered that a certain movement shall be undertaken, it would hardly be conconsidered appropriate in him to return to his men and denounce his superior's estimate of the surrounding conditions and determination as to the most advisable course for his army, under the circumstances.

AND here I am reminded of that fine and philosophical distinction made by Cardinal Newman between assent and belief. I cannot agree with that master of beautiful English in his position that belief is a matter of will. If I remember rightly, he boasts—he always gloried in the extent and intensity of his "faith"—that he was able to believe in the liquefaction of the blood of St. Januarius, and in the "winking virgin" by merely resolving (through grace, of course) to do so. This is beyond me. Nevertheless, I cheerfully concede that belief is one thing and assent is another.

* * *

AND I suppose that assent to a court's opinion of the law is all that can be demanded of an attorney. There is certainly no obligation on him, when he takes his place on the Bench of the Supreme Court, to officially indorse the opinion of any or all of those who have preceded him, or of those with whom he thus becomes associated, "Respect" fairly sums up his accepted duty in this regard. Not even assent is required of him.

IT is manifestly impossible to keep the action of the Supreme Court of the United States altogether out of the domain of politics. The fact that it has frequently to deal with matters over which contending statesmen have striven fiercely before the people, concerning which party platforms have given forth no uncertain sound, which have aroused the fiercest passions, and have been keenly discussed from every possible standpoint by a ubiquitous press, exposes its work to all the dangers and all the advantages of the widest publicity. And this suggests some points of peculiarity in the composition of the Supreme Court which are not generally attended to, and may form the subject of a future contribution.
