BY G. E. LANGDON.

B. R. BLEAKNEY, a member of the Seventh-day Adventist church at Goshen, Albert Co., N. B., was summoned recently to appear before Justice Roboson for "plowing on the Lord's day" (Sunday). It was a strange sight to see a criminal(?) going to court with a Bible in his possession with which to defend himself.

For years Mr. Bleakney has been a deacon of the Goshen Baptist church, but last summer he, with his wife, was expelled, as was said, "not because we do not consider you Christians, but because you are not in harmony with the church."

His arrest is a clear case of persecution. He lives on a back road, and the nearest house in sight of his work was two and one half miles distant. The informant is a maid about fifty-six years old, who lives two miles from Mr. Bleakney's under a big hill. She has left her home and spent several Sundays spying around so she could be disturbed with his quiet work.

When it was learned that she could not induce other magistrates to engage in the inquisitorial business, one willingly volunteered his services. Rather than not prosecute the peace-loving Adventists, the case was submitted to him. Not being satisfied with the fines stated in the "Lord's Day Act" of New Brunswick, which fixes the maximum penalty at four days' imprisonment or $8, this justice sought to place the fine under another code, where $40 could be imposed. This code was entirely beyond his jurisdiction, and the case was withdrawn.

After the court was ended the justice(?) stepped up to Mr. Bleakney, who had made no remarks, and said, "You needn't feel too keen, sir, for we have two more cases against you, and we'll show you that you'll have to obey."

It is a shame to our country that laws fit for the Dark Ages are on our statute books, to be used against inoffensive, God-fearing people, by every capricious person who can skulk through the fields and woods for miles in order to find an old neighbor over sixty years old, seeking to eke out an honest livelihood, and following the perfect Pattern in working six days and resting on the seventh.

It will not be out of place in closing to say that the better class of people are not in sympathy with this effort to deprive a man of his civil rights and his "soul liberty." Mr. Bleakney found many friends who were not anxious to see a person persecuted for conscience' sake.
