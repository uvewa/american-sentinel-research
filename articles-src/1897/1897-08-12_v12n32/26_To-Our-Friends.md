We wish it were our privilege to look into the face and shake the hand of every member of the SENTINEL family, but this is impossible. We wish also that our circumstances were such that we could respond to every letter containing subscriptions under our special offer that have come to us during the past two weeks, but we cannot well do this either. However, we want you all to know that the SENTINEL gratefully appreciates the self-sacrificing efforts that are everywhere being put forth in its behalf. In hundreds of instances, we know that the letters of remittance have come to us watered with a tear and hallowed by a prayer, that the "silent messengers" will go forth to bless those who receive them. With such a spirit back of the message the SENTINEL bears, is it any wonder that the people are ready to respond, and send us such lists as we are daily receiving? Certainly not; for that is the chord, when touched, that moves the universe to action.

"Ours is a civil government, strictly and exclusively; its jurisdiction extends over only civil affairs. A Christian government implies a State religion. Religious liberty does not mean liberty for the Christian religion alone."—Rev. J. L. Wilkinson, Baptist.
