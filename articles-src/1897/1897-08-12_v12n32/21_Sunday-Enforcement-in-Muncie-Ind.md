IN our last issue, we made mention of the inauguration of a crusade by the "Young Men's Christian Band" of that place, for the enforced observance of Sunday. From a report published in the Indianapolis News, of July 30, it appears that the movement has already borne fruit, but not of a very Christian character.

Recently, this "Christian Band" published in all the papers in Muncie, a pronouncement, setting forth the character of the Band and its intentions. This manifesto declared that "The Young Men's Christian Band is an organized body of earnest Christian young men, who are banded together for the purpose of doing 'whatsoever the Master would like to have them do.' Their motto is 'Not to be ministered unto, but to minister.'" It stated that for a long time the members of the band have viewed the "wholesale desecration of the Christian Sabbath" and the decrease of Sunday observance as being "one of the greatest dangers to our Christian nation and to Christ's cause." Also, that "decadence of Sabbath observance is an outrage on labor and capital." It recited the fourth commandment, which commands the observance of the seventh day as the Sabbath, and quoted also the Indiana statute for Sunday observance, as being "based upon this divine law," —forbidding all secular labor except works of charity and necessity, and all rioting, hunting and fishing on the first day of the week—and warned all grocerymen, meat markets, bakeries, fruit stores, confectioneries, notion stores, bicycle shops, ice cream parlors, tobacco stores, and even drug stores and news stands that the running of their business on Sunday could not be considered a work of necessity or of charity. The closing paragraphs read thus:

"Without fear or favor, and with no other than a Christian motive, we call upon every person who has been following his regular vocation and doing business on Sunday to close up and observe the day as a day of rest. We also invite and urge the hearty coöperation and assistance of every loyal citizen, young people's society and church society in enforcing the law by filing affidavits against any and all who are found doing business contrary to the spirit of the law on Sunday.

"Beginning with Sunday, July 18, the members of our band will make affidavits against any and all persons engaged in the above named businesses whom they may find selling on Sunday.

"With malice toward none and charity for all," we are the

"YOUNG MEN'S CHRISTIAN BAND."

The membership of the band is said to include four Sunday-school superintendents and five Christian Endeavor presidents.

On the Sunday following this pronouncement the stores were open as usual, and members of the band were seen at several places of business collecting evidence for the prosecution of proprietors for Sunday work. This did not tend to make the majority of the citizens feel more pleasantly disposed toward the band.

Monday evening, July 26, a meeting of the band was announced at the office of their attorney, in the business section of the city. Several members were present at the appointed hour and were waiting the arrival of the president, who had gone to the house of a clergyman to get some resolutions that had been passed on the subject of Sunday enforcement by the Ministerial Association. At this juncture three of the "best citizens" of Muncie, as they are called, entered the place of meeting, for the purpose, as alleged, of talking matters over and getting information of the band's intentions. However this may be, a fistic encounter was the result, in which blood flowed freely. While the members of the "Christian Band" were doing their best to avoid defeat in this carnal warfare, the president arrived, bringing the resolutions and a revolver which he had borrowed from a friend for anticipated emergencies. The president entered with ardor into the fray, and at once brought his revolver to bear upon the forces of ungodliness, but happily without serious results, owing to the fact that his friend had taken the precaution to load it with blank shells. Cries of "murder!" and "help!" issuing from the meeting place quickly called a crowd of several hundred citizens to the scene, with several policemen, by whom the contestants were taken in charge and escorted to the police station. Afterwards those of the "Christian Band" who took part in the encounter swore out warrants against their opponents charging them with assault and battery, upon which charge the latter must stand trial in September.

To such results does the combination of force with religion lead. Having started out to enforce a religious institution upon the people of the town, it was perfectly consistent with this step for these representatives of this "Christian Band" to use fist and revolver in fighting the battles of their cause. It was all simply the use of force.

But force is not to be combined with Christianity. Force is an element of carnal warfare; and the Christian's warfare is not with carnal weapons, but with the "sword" and power of the Spirit, which God has provided for the conquering of all opposition to the cause of righteousness and truth. 2 Cor. 10:3-5.
