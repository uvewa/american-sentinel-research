While the Powers may reap some temporary advantage from this new arrangement, the great and permanent advantage will be that reaped by the papacy. This latest step is one of the greatest which the papacy by her astute diplomacy has been able to take in a long and steady rise toward her old-time position of prestige among the nations. Upon that proud eminence her eye is fixed; and, as she nears the goal, the thought of her heart is that which the language of Scripture ascribes to her (Rev. 18:7), "I sit a queen, and am no widow, and shall see no sorrow." But a change—sudden and unlooked for—is imminent, in which will be fulfilled the words, "Strong is the Lord God who judge her."
