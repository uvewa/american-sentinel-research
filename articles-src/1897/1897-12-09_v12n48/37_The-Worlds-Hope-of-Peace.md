**The World's Hope of Peace.**

In a recent speech, the English premier, Lord Salisbury, touched upon the world's outlook for peace, in the following words:—

"You notice that on all sides the instruments of destruction are piling up—armies become larger, the Powers who concentrate them become greater, the instruments of death become more effective and more numerous, and are improved with every year, and each nation is bound for its own safety to take part in this competition. Those are the things that are done, so to speak, on the side of war. The one hope that we have to prevent this competition from ending in a terrible effort of mutual destruction which will be fatal to Christian civilization—the one hope we have is that the Powers may gradually be brought together, to act together in a friendly spirit on all subjects of difference that may arise until at last they shall be welded together in some international constitution which shall give at last to the world as the result of their great strength a long spell of unfettered commerce, prosperous trade, and continued peace!"

Such is the statement of the world's hope of peace, as made by one whose position eminently qualifies him to speak understandingly upon the subject. It is not a bright outlook; in these days the world's outlook is not bright, in any direction. "The one hope," says this eminent statesman, "is that the Powers may gradually be brought together in a friendly spirit," "until at last they shall be welded together in some international constitution," etc.,—a consummation which evidently lies at the extreme limit of vagueness, uncertainty, and improbability.

Yet now, as ever, it is true that "Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on Thee." That is the Christian's hope of peace,—a sure hope, which no commotion of earthly forces can overthrow. And this is the hope which remains for the individual.
