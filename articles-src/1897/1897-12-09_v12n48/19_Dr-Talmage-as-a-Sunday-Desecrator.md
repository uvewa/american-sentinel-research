### Dr. Talmage as a Sunday Desecrator.

Dr. Talmage and Sam Jones are now to be counted as contributors to the growing disregard of Sunday, if we may believe what is said by the advocates of strict Sunday observance concerning their influence. For instance, a writer in *The Advance*, of November 18, says this:—

"Now we do feel that no agency is more effectively breaking down the Christian Sabbath than the practice of noted ministers like Dr. Talmage and Sam Jones, of joining with the railroad companies in encouraging Sunday excursions."

But in condemning Dr. Talmage and his brother "evangelist" for their course in this respect, it should be remembered that there is no divine command at all for Sunday observance, and that in the absence of this, the doctor and Mr. Jones may well be pardoned for holding that it is no sin for excursion trains to bring people on Sunday to their meetings to hear them preach.
