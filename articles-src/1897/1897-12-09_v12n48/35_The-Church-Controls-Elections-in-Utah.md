## The Church Controls Elections in Utah.

*"The Outlook," November 27.*

The elections in Utah demonstrated that a large element among the Mormons still retains an intense respect for the revelations of the church leaders. That President Wilford Woodruff's demand at the October conference that Mormons should unite in politics was taken as more weighty than the light talk of an old man was shown in the results in Salt Lake City. John Clark, the candidate for mayor of the citizens, but a very devout Mormon and the undisputed church candidate, was elected by a small majority. The Gentile vote and the Independent vote were divided among three candidates—all Gentiles. Mr. Clark was supported by the politicians whose names are always associated with church politics, and the conclusion that the church elected him is well supported. Every Gentile who was on the ticket with him was defeated. Every Gentile who was on the other tickets was seriously "scratched," and every Mormon running received a comparatively large vote.

The same result was seen all over Utah. Ogden's administration, as well as Salt Lake's, will be in the hands of Mormons, though in each case the Gentiles form the bulk of the population. The City Council in each case, by a majority of Mormons, shows a result of religious voting. The tendency of Mormons to vote for men of their own faith has an important bearing on national affairs. It is not improbable that next year a legislature may be elected in Utah which will be so overwhelmingly Mormon that a United States senator will be chosen who will give his chief allegiance to the church leaders.

It may well be that a merciful Providence allowed the development of Mormonism in this country to the church-and-state system which we now see virtually established in Utah, in order that the people in this country might, by having this object lesson before their eyes, be saved from the fatal folly of setting up a like system which would embrace not one single State merely, but the whole nation. Certain it is that it is high time the people of this country should take warning from the situation in Utah, and repel the efforts of the religious organizations who are working with might and main to compel this government to profess religion.
