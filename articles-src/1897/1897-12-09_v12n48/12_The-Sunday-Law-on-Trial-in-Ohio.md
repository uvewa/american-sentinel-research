## The Sunday Law on Trial in Ohio.

For the first time within recent years, if not in our national history, a judge on the bench has declared that a Sunday law is unconstitutional on the ground that it is contrary to the principle of American government which demands the complete separation of church and state.

The case was that of a man who was a proprietor of a bowling alley in Columbus, O., and had been arrested for having violated a city ordinance against giving public exhibitions on Sunday. This step was taken at the instance of the Sunday-law element in the city, who decided to make a test case for the purpose of establishing a precedent. The case was tried in the police court, the presiding judge being Samuel J. Swartz. The latter dismissed the case on the ground of the unconstitutionality of the ordinance.

The Cincinnati Enquirer, of November 28, from which these facts are gathered, says of Judge Swartz's ruling in this case:—

"He based his decision upon the sweeping ground that the measure was contrary to the constitutional principle of a complete severance of church and state, and reasoned that anything which is not a crime on a week day is not a crime on Sunday."

Yes; this is "sweeping ground," for it logically sweeps every Sunday law in the land out of existence; but it is solid ground, for it is the ground of a broad constitutional principle of American government. It is the best ground upon which any decision against Sunday legislation can be based.

The Enquirer adds that,—

"The decision really depends for a precedent upon the holding of Judge Ong, of the Cuyahoga courts, who recently took the ground in a prosecution against Sunday baseball that all laws prohibiting amusements of a moral character upon the first day of the week were unconstitutional. Judge Ong's decision has been taken to the Supreme Court, where it is now pending. In the event of its being affirmed by the highest tribunal, it is difficult to see how the Sunday saloon laws, or almost any other Sunday prohibitory measures, such as are now on the statutes of this State, can be longer effective."

This decision certainly marks a most interesting and critical stage of the Sunday-law movement in Ohio.
