## Clerical Intermeddling in Civil Government.

From "The Legal Sunday," by Jas. T. Ringgold.

In his profound and suggestive work on "The Study of Sociology," Mr. Herbert Spencer shows how necessary it is for any right and profitable thinking on public topics that the thinker should be altogether free from bias or prejudice of any kind. He develops here and elsewhere the correct conception of human government or civil administration as a machine. Properly to determine the purposes to which the proposed machinery of government ought to be adapted, and then properly to construct and manage the machinery, requires the scientific cast of mind, that is to say, a mind which approaches the conditions to be dealt with, free from preconceptions, recalling impartially the experiences of the past, ready at any moment to receive suggestions from the phenomena of the present. One of the most valuable chapters on "The Study of Sociology" is one dealing with "The Theological Bias," under the influence whereof the clerical intermedi­der always approaches a question of civil administration, and which as Mr. Spencer shows, is utterly incompatible with the scientific state of mind, and therefore renders it unthinkable that his intermeddling should be otherwise than hurtful.

This theological bias causes the clerical intermeddler to take false and unscientific views of the purposes for which the governmental machinery should be designed, and also of the principles on which it should be constructed and managed. Of the purposes for which it should be designed, because he would have it regulate human conduct with the view to men's happiness in the next world, whereas its sole proper concern is to regulate that conduct in the way which will the least interfere with the attainment of the greatest possible happiness by the greatest possible number of people in this world. Because he would have it applied to the greatest good of his own particular religious denomination, and its members, and its application to the greatest good of any one portion of the community is inconsistent with that purpose of the greatest good to the greatest number which is the true purpose of governmental machinery. Because he would have it "run" upon the assumption that the religion of his denomination is superior as a religion to all others, and to adopt such an assumption as this is to recognize and prefer one religion to another, to establish a union of church and state, all of which is inconsistent with the right purpose of civil government.

But the theological bias is no less fatal to right and serviceable thinking about the principles upon which the machinery of government is based, than it is to right and profitable thinking about the purposes for which it should be designed, and with a view to which it should be managed. The government is a machine. Like all other machines, to be a good machine, it must be constructed on scientific principles. These principles require a reference to facts, not theories. One of the most important things to be considered in the construction of any machine, is the materials of which it must be made, and the materials upon which it is to operate. Now scientific principles require that in the construction of our governmental machinery, we shall have regard to the facts of the materials of both kinds, and not to any theories concerning them.

The scientific builder or alterer of a machine, studies these materials as they are, and gives no thought to the question of what they ought to be. He does not say to himself: "Here is material out of which I am to make a saw; the metal is very soft; but it ought to be hard, and so I will make the saw in such a manner that it will be a very good saw indeed, if the metal ever becomes hard." He does not say: "Here are certain logs which I am to make a saw cut; the wood is very hard; but it ought to be soft; so I will make such a saw as will cut it easily enough if the wood should ever become soft." But the effect of the theological bias is to produce just this unscientific attitude of mind toward the construction and alteration of the machinery of government. The material out of which the machinery must be constructed, and that on which it must operate, is human nature. It is true that the business of the clergyman is with human nature. But the business of the geologist and the analytical chemist may be alike with strata and ores and yet the training and profession of one would not qualify him to deal scientifically with the problems that lie within the domain of the other.

It is easy enough to see how the training and profession of a clergyman not only do not tend to qualify him, but inevitably incapacitate him from taking a right view of the principles upon which the governmental machinery should be constructed. That training and profession necessarily and rightly commit him to a view of human

nature framed with reference to what it ought to be, rather than to what it is. Necessarily and rightly, because his business is to teach men what they ought to do, and to induce them by sweet and soft persuasion to do it. But the business of the government is not to teach men what they ought to do, but what they must do, or be punished for not doing.

Here we have another illustration of the principle that law or the government has nothing to do with immorality, but deals with incivility alone. What men ought to do, is the same on a small island where there is no government at all, as it is in a great republic with the most complex system of several governments,—federal, state, municipal, what not—that can be imagined. The work of the clergyman, then, is, in a sense, above that of the government; it would exist, though no government existed; it would remain, though all government should perish.

But the clergyman's work is done when persuasion and exhortation have failed. The clergyman cannot judge, because the Master has declared that though a man shall refuse to receive his word, yet he judges not that man. The clergyman cannot punish because the Master has said, "Put up again thy sword into his place; for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword." And here the government steps in. It has nothing to do with persuasion or exhortation. It wastes no time in trying to convince the citizen that he ought to do this, or ought not to do that. It is perfectly indifferent to his views upon the subject. It simply commands him to do or refrain, as the case may be, and judges and punishes him in its own way for disobedience. The spheres of clerical and governmental action being thus entirely distinct, the relation of the two to the material of human nature is also distinct, and the clergyman is not merely non-qualified, but disqualified, so far as government is concerned, by reason of his calling and profession, from taking a scientific view of the material out of which government must be constructed, and on which it must operate.
