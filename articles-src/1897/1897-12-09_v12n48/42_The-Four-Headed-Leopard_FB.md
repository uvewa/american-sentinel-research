# ELIGIOUS LIBERTY FOR GONG PEOPLE

## The Four-Headed Leopard.

"This is the queerest beast we have struck yet, mama. Let me read you about it."

"After this I beheld, and lo another, like a leopard, which had upon the back of it four wings of a fowl; the beast had also four heads, and dominion was given to it."

"Yes; this is a strange beast. What was he like?" asked Mrs. Ross.

"Like a leopard."

"Now tell me what a leopard is like."

"Something like a cat," said Charlie. "More like a wildcat. I would not like to meet one at night in the woods. I saw one at the menagerie. He ran up and down in his cage, and O how his hungry, yellow eyes did glare! Leopards are very cunning and crafty. They creep along slyly, and then suddenly pounce upon their prey. They are very ravenous and cruel, and do not know the meaning of mercy."

Charlie grew quite animated in speaking of the leopard, and made some gestures that made his mother laugh.

"Dear me, Charlie; you almost frighten me. You can look a great deal like a leopard yourself, and sometimes I have seen you act like this very beast of prey. O Charlie, let us ever remember as we read these prophecies that unless God's love continually controls us and subdues our fierce passions, we shall show the very characteristics we abhor. The kingdoms represented by the beasts were made up of human beings like ourselves when the grace of God is left apart from our lives."

"I see," said Charlie, soberly. "But God made leopards."

"Yes; but at first you remember they were harmless, subject to man's dominion, even as our passions serve us well when they are under the rule of love. But now to the kingdom. What was the third universal kingdom?"

"Greece," said Charlie.

"Yes. Greece grew in power during the latter part of the Medo-Persian reign, and an occasion for war was sought by the Persians, but they went home completely discomfited. The Grecians displayed great bravery, and some of the most thrilling incidents of history cluster about their struggle to evade the Medo-Persian yoke."

"Yes, mama. Of all the people I have read about in history I like the Greeks best."

"There were many attractive features in the Greeks. But with all their grace, we can see the leopard characteristic. Do you remember how the Greeks looked upon the feeble and deformed?"

"They despised them, and left the feeble infants and the aged, and infirm, and deformed to die on the mountains."

"How did they treat their children?"

"They made them suffer hardships. They trained them to run races, and set before them the Olympian games as the most desirable goal. They taught them to suffer pain, and if they winced under it, they ridiculed and punished them."

"This kind of an education made them very agile, graceful, and unfeeling. We have the best examples of physical grace from Grecian sculpture. If they had also given their children the proper mental and spiritual training, what a race they would have been! Even as it was, Greece developed some of the greatest poets, artists, philosophers, and teachers of the world. The grace of God did work among the Greeks, and here and there we see a flower in the midst of the poisonous herbs. But we are not here to look up the exception, but the rule. What man among the Greeks is known as 'The Great'?"

"Alexander," said Charlie. "My Reader says—

> "How tall was Alexander, pa,
> That people call him great?
> Was he like old Goliath, tall.
> His spear a hundred weight?
> O no, my child, about as tall
> As I or Uncle James,
> T was not his stature made him great,
> But the greatness of his fame."

Then the little boy goes on asking questions till he finds out that Alexander was not very great in God's sight.

"Well, tell me, Charlie, what you have found out in regard to Alexander's fame."

"He was a wonderful general. He marched the Grecian armies against Medo Persia as soon as he thought them strong enough to overthrow this kingdom. He traveled over 51,000 miles in seven years, or a distance more than twice around the earth. He fought three battles that were disastrous to the Medo Persians, and every battle was a surprise. He would march up, and fall upon the Medo-Persian armies very much after the manner of a leopard; and the cruelty practiced by the Greeks was certainly as bloodthirsty as the action of the leopard on its prey. There were three great battles at Granicus, Issus, and Arbela, and Alexander was acknowledged the conqueror of the world in 321 B.C., and Greece put in power as the third universal kingdom."

"Well, Charlie, you have brought out the characteristics of the leopard-like kingdom in the swiftness, the strategem, and cruelty of their warfare. There is one point we have not yet touched."

"I know," said Charlie; "and it is the very point in which I am most interested—the four heads. What does that mean?"

"We shall soon see. What happened to Alexander after his conquest of the world?"

"I know. He laid a wager that he could outdo his generals in drinking, and he drank the Herculean cup twice full. It was said to hold eleven quarts. The feast must have lasted some time. But as a result of this terrible wager, Alexander died in the very prime of his life and power."

"Right here, Charlie, you may read the 21st verse of the eighth chapter."

Charlie read, "'And the rough goat is the king of Grecia, and the great horn that is between his eyes is the first king. Now that being broken, whereas four stood up for it, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not in his power.'"

"What position did Alexander hold in the newly-conquered world?"

"He was the first king."

"When the horn representing the first king was broken off, how many horns rose in its place?"

"Four," said Charlie.

"And what did this indicate?"

"That four kingdoms should rise."

"That's right. The Grecian kingdom was divided into four parts, and this explains the beast with four heads."

"Yes, I remember now," said Charlie, "that there were four of Alexander's generals that divided the kingdom among them. Wait; here is my history. I'll find out who they were. Lysimacus, Cassander, Seleucus, and Ptolemy."

"After we are through, take your map and trace out the territory each one occupied."

"You remember that Babylon was to be entirely overthrown. In Alexander's march he came to the ruins of the great city, and determined to rebuild it. His horses were stabled in some of the palaces of the city. As he tried to investigate the palaces he found them full of venomous creatures, and though the work was begun by Alexander and his workers, his death put a stop to the rebuilding of a city that God had said should never again be inhabited."

"We have spoken in regard to the intolerant character of other governments, but Greece was not at all behind them in trying to order the religious thought of the world. The Greeks were a very religious people. You remember what Paul says in Acts about their altars and their gods. Long before his time Socrates lived among the Greeks. He was very liberal in his thought, and did away with their gods, and died a martyr for his faith, or rather, for his lack of faith in their prescribed religion. All through the history of Greece, both before and after the coming of Jesus, are evidences that it was no friend to civil and religious liberty. Exceptions were found among her statesmen and thinkers, but the whole government carried out the leopard-like spirit. I would like you to read from the 17th to the 20th of Acts, and you will find incidents that will help you to understand the spirit of the Greeks, both when they would and when they would not see Jesus."

"And now, dear, our next talk will bring us to the great and terrible beast that represents the fourth kingdom."
