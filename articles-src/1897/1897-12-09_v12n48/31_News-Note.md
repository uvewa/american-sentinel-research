Now, however, comes the news from Rome, upon the authority of the Italian journal *Roma*, that "the pope has demanded that Don Carlos [of Spain] should postpone the issue of his manifesto to his adherents, at any rate for the present, under pain of his displeasure. This, it is thought, will avert the danger of a possible overthrow of the present Spanish dynasty by the adherents of Don Carlos. But why should the pope make use of the "pain of his displeasure" to secure certain political results in Spain, and refuse to make use of the same to ameliorate the lot of Protestants in Peru? The reason is evident, but it is one which fails to accord with papal claims.
