# The Way They Argue.

The December issue of The Defender, the organ of the "New England Sabbath Protective League," published, some "arguments" in favor of Sunday laws, from two well-known advocates of the same,—the Hon. John Charlton, M. P., and Rev. S. M. Dick, of Lowell, Mass. A comparison of some of the statements made by these two authorities on the subject, reveals the real force of the "arguments" upon which the cause of the Sunday law depends.

For instance, Mr. Charlton, among other statements, says this:—

"I might be asked to point out, as a justification for the enactment of this law, some beneficial fruits or results of rest from labor on the seventh day of the week, and I shall very briefly refer to a few facts, which, I think, warrant me in asserting that beneficial results do follow from Sunday rest. One of the great economic evils of the day is over production.

We have too much food produced, too many textile fabrics, too much of everything. Our markets are glutted, prices are cheapened, the whole course of business is deranged from over-production, and the employment of labor during seven days in the week is calculated to make this evil greater. The employment of labor seven days in the week is calculated to enlarge the volume of over-production, which in six days in the week is already too great. And for that reason, on economic grounds, the adoption of this system of securing a rest day for labor would produce important and beneficial results."

And almost side by side with this the Defender prints the following from Rev. Mr. Dick:—

"The second source of authority is found in the physical laws of the universe. It is a scientific fact,—time forbids giving the proof,—that if two men, equal in every sense, begin the same kind of work, one working six days in the week and resting one, the other working seven days in the week, that the one resting one day in each week, at the end of six months, will produce twice as much of the product that they are making, in one week's time, as the

one who works seven days in the week. The law is rest one day in seven, and he who violates that law pays for it in the value of his products."

And thus it appears that the result of allowing Sunday work will be a disastrous over-production, while at the same time the result of Sunday rest will be, in the course of six months, the production of twice as much as would be possible with Sunday work. You can argue with an individual for a Sunday law on the ground of the evil of over-production, and if this does not convert him, you can tell him that with Sunday rest a factory can produce twice as much inside of a year as would be possible without it; and both arguments will be equally good!

If we enforce the Sunday laws, we will have over-production, according to Rev. Mr. Dick; and if we fail to enforce such laws, we will have the same result, according to Mr. Charlton. Hence it appears that we are bound to have over-production anyway!

The advocates of Sunday laws sometimes lose much by failing to compare notes before giving their "arguments" to the public.
