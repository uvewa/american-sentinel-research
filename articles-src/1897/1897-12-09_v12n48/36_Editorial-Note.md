The Christian Citizen (Chicago), for November, remarks concerning the late political contest in New York City, that "the Citizens' Union has fought a good fight and kept the faith, but has by no means finished its course."

Perhaps not; but it has been defeated, and thereby conclusively demonstrated that it was not fighting the battle of Christianity; for "the good fight of faith" is always victorious. The defeat of faith would mean the defeat of God himself.
