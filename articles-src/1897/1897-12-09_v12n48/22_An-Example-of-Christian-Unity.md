## An Example of "Christian Unity."

RECENTLY, says the Living Church (Chicago) 400,000 "Assyrian Christians" have become adherents of the Russian state church. This adherence was secured through the influence of Russian emissaries, who promised the Assyrians the protection of their government if they would purge their religious formulas of Nestorianism and introduce a prayer for the czar.

The Assyrians have been for centuries believers in the doctrines of Nestorianism; but upon the promise of Russia to maintain their schools and give the country protection from the Turks, Kurds, and Persians, the great majority laid these doctrines aside and became orthodox Russians. And this is pointed to by the religious press as "one of the most remarkable examples in history of a restoration of long-broken Christian unity."

Yes; this is one way to secure "Christian unity;" it is a way with which history is quite well acquainted, but not to the credit of the church. The only true Christian unity is that which comes through adherence to divine truth. Not by giving up truth, not by compromising with error, not by bargaining in doctrines for the protection of earthly princes, but by counting the truth of God as more precious than all else, can the true unity of the faith be realized in Christendom.

Christian unity is a unity in love of the truth.
