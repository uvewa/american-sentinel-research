When it comes to the question, "Is ours a Christian nation?" we are compelled to pause. The Thanksgiving proclamations of governor and president do not stamp us as such; they merely show the spirit of the people in its annual recognition of the sovereign Ruler of the skies. They do not lift the veil of positive crime or of neglect of God, contempt of church privileges, and a life of more or less unblushing infidelity as led by some. They do not tell of the oceans of insidious literature with which too many presses groan in our land, in which the character and mission of Jesus Christ on earth are minimized and his sacred claims upon us reduced to the mere question of our acceptance of him as an historic model of a romantic legend. Indeed, the alleged Christian pulpit itself has contributed to this pernicious stream which is helping to make us a nation of practical skeptics.—New York Observer.
