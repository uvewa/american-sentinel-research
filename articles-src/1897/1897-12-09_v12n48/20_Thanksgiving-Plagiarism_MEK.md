### Thanksgiving Plagiarism.

BY M. E. KELLOGG.

The folly of Thanksgiving proclamations by civil rulers, and the perfunctory way in which they are issued, has been illustrated very clearly this year. Two proclamations, one by Governor Stephens, of Missouri, and one by Governor Pingree, of Michigan, are so nearly alike that the question is raised, Which one of these governors plagiarized? That one of them has done so is evident, as portions of the two proclamations, placed side by side, as below, will fully prove:—

From Gov. Stephens's Thanksgiving Proclamation.

"Our great commonwealth filled with a greater population than belonged to the whole country when our fathers fought for national independence, can look back over the seventy-six years of Statehood and see the simple industries of the pioneers grown to the many diversified industries which have made us the eighth State in wealth, and we are the fifth in numbers and political power in this great Union.

"The spirit of philanthropy among our citizens has been active in providing for the needs of suffering and unfortunate.

"Christian workers have brought many to acknowledge their obligations to lead better lives, and countless homes have been made happier for their efforts during the year."

From Gov. Pingree's Thanksgiving Proclamation.

"Our great commonwealth, filled with a larger population than belonged to our whole country when our fathers fought for national independence, can look back over the sixty years of Statehood and see the simple industries of the pioneers grown to the diversified interests which have made us a great State in wealth and in a great many other ways.

"The spirit of philanthropy among our citizens has been active in providing for the needs of suffering and unfortunate.

"Christian workers have brought many to acknowledge their obligations to lead better lives and countless numbers have been made happier for their efforts during the year."

When the similarity of the two proclamations was first discovered, the investigation of the matter afforded a rich field for the inquisitive newspaper reporters, and they at once started out to find the plagiarist—for to hunt down a governor is no common sport. The telegraph was freely used, and the following facts have been ascertained: Governor Stephens declares that his proclamation was issued four days previous to that of Mr. Pingree. This would throw the plagiarism on the governor of Michigan, but he has a loophole by which he, at least, almost escapes. He says he was very busy at that time,

and so he asked the secretary of state, Washington Gardner, to write it. Mr. Gardner, apparently not having the spirit of thanksgiving burning within him as it is popularly supposed to be burning in all State officials during the latter part of November, turned back to an old proclamation of a former governor of Michigan and copied it! In that case, both proclamations are borrowed from the same source, illustrating in a rather curious way that old principle that two things which are equal to a third thing are equal to each other.

But what shall be said of the virtue or utility of such proclamations? That a governor of a State cannot find time nor thought to write the annual Thanksgiving proclamation, and that a secretary of state, when called upon to do so, though a scholar and an orator, should borrow an old one from any source, instead of writing one himself, is a striking commentary upon the hollowness of the whole thanksgiving business as far as the authority of the state, manifested by executive proclamation, is concerned.

It is probably also safe to say that the real spirit of thanksgiving in these perfunctory thanksgiving proclamations is a very fair specimen of the amount of thanksgiving felt by those who give heed to them. The most important part of the American thanksgiving is the turkey, and no proclamation of president or governor, whether original or a plagiarism, can affect its gluttonous consumption.

The moral that may be drawn from all this is, that religion and religious exercises prescribed by a state, whether suggested or commanded, are always utterly devoid of that life and soul which makes their performance of any value.
