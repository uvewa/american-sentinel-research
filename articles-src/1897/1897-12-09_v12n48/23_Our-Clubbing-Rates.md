## Our Clubbing Rates.

In another column will be found a list of excellent publications which we have arranged to furnish at reduced prices. There is nothing in this to us, but we are glad to receive orders for any of them in connection with the SENTINEL at reduced prices as a matter of accommodation to our friends. The offer is being responded to to quite an extent. We desire to say that we shall discontinue this clubbing arrangement after the first of the year, and therefore those of our friends who wish to take advantage of it will please arrange to do so between this and January 1.
