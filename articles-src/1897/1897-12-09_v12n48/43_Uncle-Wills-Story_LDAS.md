## Uncle Will's Story.

There was a great uproar in the nursery. The day was so stormy and disagreeable that Mrs. Blanchard had decided that the children should play in doors, after their lessons had been recited. This happened quite often, and they had played so quietly and agreeably before, that Uncle Will was surprised to hear the commotion this morning.

"I tell you, Jennie Blanchard," yelled Charlie, "you've got to do as we say. Jack and me are older 'n you an' lots bigger, an' there's as many again of us; so it's no more 'n right; is it Jack?"

"Course not," agreed Jack. "See here now, Jennie, you be the horse, and we'll show you how Joe Simpkins drives his bus. This is the bus; get on, Charlie; I'll catch the horse. Whoa!" yelled the determined young driver.

But unfortunately this scheme did not seem to meet the mind of the "horse," who protested loudly:—

"I tell you the bits hurt, and I won't wear that harness; it makes my neck ache. It isn't any fun to be a horse, anyway. I'd good deal rather be a little girl," screamed Jennie.

"But you shall! Jennie Blanchard, you shall!"

Uncle Will thought it was high time that this kind of fun was stopped; so he stepped to the nursery door and called out: "Don't you want to hear a story, children? If you do, just step into my room here."

In a moment Uncle Will had Jennie in his arms, and two very eager little boys on his knees. They looked a trifle ashamed for fear their uncle had heard the row, but as he did not mention it, they soon began to breathe easier.

"O, Uncle Will! tell a giant story."

"A fairy story," suggested Jennie. But Uncle Will was not in a mood for either. "I'll tell you a true story, and you may see if you can guess whom it is about.

"Once, a great many years ago, there was a man who had twelve boys."

"Didn't he have any girls?" asked Jennie.

"Yes; but it's the boys I'm going to tell you about. These boys were not always good and kind. Sometimes they quarreled among themselves; but it was with one of their littlest brothers that they had the most trouble. They were afraid that their father thought more of him than he did of them. One day the boys' father gave him a real pretty present, and that only made his brothers all the more wicked and cruel toward him. So they tried to get rid of him in every way.

"At last, when the big brothers were a long way from

home, taking care of their father's sheep, the father sent this boy to see how they were getting along. The poor boy became bewildered on the road, and got in the wrong path, and spent quite a while wandering round and round in a field. Finally, a man found the lad and directed him on his journey. At last he found his brothers, but instead of going to meet him, and being glad to see him, they began to wonder how they could get him out of their way. I should have thought they would have been glad to see their brother; for they hadn't seen him in some time."

"So should I," said Charlie, "when Jack was gone only a week, last summer, I was so lonesome that I was glad enough to get him back again."

"Well, they were not; and they made up their minds to put him in a deep hole in the ground, and leave him there."

"Why, Uncle Will! till he died?"

"Yes, of course; you see he didn't act to suit them, and there were ten times as many of them as there were of him, so of course they decided that they had a perfect right to make him come to their terms."

"The mean fellows!" said Charlie.

"They ought to be hung!" exclaimed Jack excitedly.

"But, my boys, don't be too sure. Don't you see? they were older and larger than he was, and there were so many more of them, of course"

Charlie glanced uneasily at Jack, and said nothing. "Come, Uncle Will, go on," said Jennie.

"Well, they didn't put him in the hole, but they sold him to some merchants who came along, and then they thought sure they would have no more trouble. But really, their trouble was just beginning. When Satan leads any one to do a wrong act, he doesn't care how much trouble they have on account of it. These brothers told a wicked lie to their poor old father when he asked them where the boy was."

"O, I guess I know who that boy was," said Jack; "it was Joseph."

"Well, can you think now why I have told you this true story?"

"O, I 'spose you heard us boys try to make Jennie play what we wanted her to," said Charlie.

"But we didn't put her in a hole, nor we didn't sell her to wicked men, nor tell a lie to papa," said Jack, looking very self-righteous and virtuous.

"No," said Uncle Will, seriously; "but, my children, the very same spirit which prompts you to use force in any way to bring those who are weaker than yourselves under your power, is the same as that which caused these wicked brothers to do so bad a deed. Never forget, my dear children, that this is the spirit of murder, although it does not always lead directly to it."

"Was that what made Cain kill Abel, Uncle Will?"

"Yes; it was the same wicked spirit. He was older than Abel, and I presume he reasoned that he ought to know best; and so when he talked with his brother 'in the field,' and couldn't make him believe as he did, nor see things as he did, he became so angry that he killed him.

"Here is a little prayer that I want you to learn and repeat every day:—

"O Saviour, make me more like thee,
Peaceful and good and mild,
And may I daily grow to be
A harmless, gentle child.
Lord, may my deeds be kind and true,
And though I may be strong,
O may I never seek to do
My weaker brother wrong."

MRS. L. D. AVERY-STUTTLE.
