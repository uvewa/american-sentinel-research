Social circles in Kentucky are in a state of violent agitation over the settlement of one of the greatest questions which it could fall to the lot of real "society" to consider. It seems that two Kentucky belles have been designated in a more or less official manner to perform the important act of "christening" the new battleship "Kentucky," whose launching is a prospective event in naval affairs. As it requires only one person to attend to this ceremony, the question arises as to which one of these two shall be accorded the honor.
