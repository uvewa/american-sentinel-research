A great deal of news that is worth considering comes to us these days from across the water. In Austria, the body politic is convulsed by a bitter race war between the Germans and the Czechs, the immediate cause of the outbreak being a government decree authorizing the use of the Czech as well as the German language in the courts and in all official business. This the Germans bitterly resented, and the result was that the members of the Austrian national body—the Reichsrath—engaged in several pitched battles, the like of which has probably not been witnessed in the legislative halls of the nations in recent years. When human nature breaks away from the bonds of reason and self-restraint, the most august assemblies of earth speedily descend to the level of a mob.
