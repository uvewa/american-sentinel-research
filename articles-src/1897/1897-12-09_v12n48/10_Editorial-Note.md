HUMAN government demands the prompt execution of legal penalties upon the transgressor of the law. God's government names death as the penalty for every violation of law. God's government provides mercy for every offender; human government demand's only justice without mercy. Without mercy for all transgressors, God's government would fail; and with mercy for all transgressors, human government would not survive a day.
