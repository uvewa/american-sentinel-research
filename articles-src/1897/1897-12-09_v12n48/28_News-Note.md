The explanation is that the Powers have recognized that the Vatican is a more powerful ally than some of the weaker nations which have hitherto been included in the coalitions of Europe; and have decided accordingly to dissolve the old alliances and form new ones in which the Vatican shall be included. Italy is a weak kingdom, and demonstrated the fact in her late war with Abyssinia. In a great defeat which the Italian army suffered in this campaign, a large number of Italians were taken prisoners, and in the endeavors made to effect their release, it was demonstrated that the pope possessed more "moral" and diplomatic power than the Italian government. The great Powers of Europe have no use for a weak ally when they can get a strong one; and accordingly they have set out to form a new alignment of their forces, in which the Vatican shall be included, and Italy and Austria left out. This is the program which is said to be foreshadowed by the appointment of regular ambassadors from the Powers to the court of the "Holy See."
