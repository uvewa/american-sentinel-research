## The Church and Politics.

Considerable controversy has arisen in some quarters over the relation the late Henry George sustained to the churches of New York City. Everybody knew Mr. George as a politician of the most pronounced type. But now it is being made to appear that he was also a devout Christian. On this ground a minister in Omaha, it seems, took occasion publicly to upbraid the churches of Mr. George's city for not better sustaining him politically in his fatal canvass for the mayoralty, alleging that plutocratic influences were behind their actions.

Whether such charges could be fully sustained or not, is neither here nor there. It is well known that Mr. George held peculiar views regarding rich men and their estates, and these probably influenced the actions of these men, more or less, in their attitude toward Mr. George. But church members, whether rich or poor, are not bound to sustain a man politically because he is friendly to the Christian religion. The mission of the church is one thing, that of political organizations entirely another. The church is a divine institution, political systems are entirely earthly. The work of one is to preach the gospel of peace, the other to maintain party preeminence. The church has nothing in common with the various opinions relating to civil polity, but is, or should be wholly engaged in matters pertaining to the kingdom of God, which Christ has assured us is not of this world.

The more church organizations affiliate with politics, the less zealous they become in the work laid out for them by the divine Master. Before his return from earth to heaven, the Lord prayed earnestly that his followers might be one in their work, even as he and the Father are one. But when politics are permitted to become an essential feature in the welfare of the church, confusion and disunion quickly follow. The reason for this is plain. No affinity whatever exists between the two concerns. The work of the church is a spiritual one, set in order and conducted by divine instruction, which all are supposed faithfully to adhere to, while political affairs are planned and maneuvered by human minds, not infrequently for sordid purposes.

The members of the church were to be united through a divine fellowship. This breaks down every barrier of political distinction, or class preference; the high and low, the rich and poor, are expected to stand together in Christian companionship, bound by the sacred ties of holy love. In their common warfare against the wiles of sin, this complete union is necessary to prosperity. By this complete unison of sentiment and action the world also will be apprised that the purpose of the church is a true and noble one, and that its mission is a success.

In politics the tendency is to class distinction. Men of wealth usually enjoy the highest civil discrimination, by being placed in position and authority, who in turn reward with place and power those who have contributed to their elevation. Worldly policy and worldly schemes obtain in this work, and quite often any device that may tend to defeat an opponent is justified as expedient.

With such work the church can rightly have nothing to do. Its members are registered as citizens of the kingdom of God, in which Machiavelian tactics are unknown. Its adherents have been by the gospel called "out of the world," hence are "no longer in the world," so far as its strife for honor and power is concerned. While rendering to Caesar the things that are his, as sojourners in an earthly government, members of Christ's kingdom should never betray their Master by giving the strength of the church to political intrigues, thus uniting the church and the state only to corrupt the former, and make the latter an engine of intolerant bigotry.
