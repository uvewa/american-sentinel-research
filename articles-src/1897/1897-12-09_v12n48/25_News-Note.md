The premier and his ministry were forced to resign but even this move seems to have contributed but little to the stability of the empire. The great bugbear of government in Austria is the violent race hatreds of her heterogeneous people, which prevent any cohesion between the different portions of the empire. It might be well for the United States to learn from the experience of Austria a lesson of caution in adding to the heterogeneous elements under her sway, as for instance, in the proposed annexation of Hawaii. It is worthy of note in this connection that the people of Austria are almost wholly Roman Catholic. The Catholic religion claims to be the religion of Christ; but the religion of Christ does not go with race hatred, or with hatred of anything except sin.
