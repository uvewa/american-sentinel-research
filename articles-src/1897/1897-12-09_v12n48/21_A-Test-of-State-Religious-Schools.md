## A Test of State Religious Schools.

In New South Wales, Australia, a practical test is being made of the utility of giving religious instruction in the state schools. With a view of ascertaining the desirability of such a system for the state schools of Victoria, the inspector-general of schools in the latter colony, Mr. Stewart, made a two months' investigation of the results obtained in the New South Wales schools, and made a report, which was printed in the Melbourne Age, of September 20. Of the religious lessons given in these schools the report says:—

"They are not religious in the true sense of the term. They were not taken at any particular hour of the day, and might be placed between vulgar fractions and vocal exercise, according to the whim of the teacher." He was much shocked to hear such expressions as 'our Saviour' used glibly, and without any apparent reverence; in fact, the lessons did not appear to be of any more importance to the children or teachers than any other lessons, seeing that there was no test applied to teachers as to special fitness to give this instruction. It was given, not only by Protestants and Roman Catholics, but also by teachers who might have no religious sympathy or belief. It was said that all scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, and for instruction in righteousness. If that was the end of religious instruction, Mr. Stewart did not think that any attempt was made to reach it in New South Wales."

Experience is much more valuable than theory; and it is to be hoped that the States of the American Republic will profit from the experience of New South Wales in this respect. There could not be a much better plan devised for making the children irreverent than to teach them religion by such a system as that which Inspector-general Stewart described.
