### A Significant Incident.

The following incident, the account of which comes to us from a correspondent in a Western town, is significant of the spirit of the times.

In this town, which is in the State of Washington, a number of people have recently been converted to the observance of the seventh day as the Sabbath. Among these were two—father and son—whose business was that of box-nailing. They were employed in a box factory with seven other men, the latter being Methodists, Presbyterians, and Episcopalians. Our correspondent says:—

"Preceding the third Sabbath they kept, the manager of the box factory received an order for 5,000 boxes, which was to be filled by sunset Sunday evening. He told the two they would have to work Saturday. They told him they could not do that, but they would come back and work for him after sunset Saturday, and nail as many boxes as they would nail if they should work on the Sabbath; and they would work again for him on Sun-

day with the rest of the men. The manager said that would be all right.

"So they did as they had agreed. But on Sunday morning, when they went to work, the rest of the men said, 'We wont let those Adventists work here any more.' So they went to the manager and said: 'If you don't discharge those Adventists we will quit.' That meant he would not be able to fill his contract. So the Adventists were discharged. This comes pretty near being a boycott."

Note the point in this proceeding. These other men—Methodists, Presbyterians, and Episcopalians—were perfectly willing the two Adventists should work on Sunday, as they did themselves, provided they would also work on Saturday. But because the latter would not do this, the others said, If they wont work on their Sabbath they shall not work on ours. Out of their antagonism to the Adventist belief they suddenly developed a great regard for Sunday.

This spirit is plainly not the Christian spirit; yet it associates itself with regard for Sunday. But where was it ever known to be associated with regard for the seventh-day Sabbath?
