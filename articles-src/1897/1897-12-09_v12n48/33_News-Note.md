It is required by a time-honored custom that on the occasion of the launching of a battleship, the vessel shall be "christened" by breaking over her bow a bottle full of a well-known kind of liquid,—but not water; and this must be done by a young lady, the selection of whom falls to the secretary of the navy, or to some other official whom he may designate. One of the two young ladies in question claims the honor by virtue of the appointment of ex-Secretary of the Navy Herbert, and though the christening is to take place under a new administration,—Mr. Herbert having served under ex-President Cleveland,—she is not disposed to let the honor slip easily out of her hands. It is reported that she had counted on performing an unusually effective piece of christening, as regards the style, having confided to her friends that she meant to break over the "Kentucky's" bow nothing less than a bottle of real Kentucky whiskey, forty years old! Generally, the christening of a battleship is accomplished with the sacrifice of only a bottle of ordinary wine or champagne.
