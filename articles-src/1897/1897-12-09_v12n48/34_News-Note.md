Although it properly belongs to the present administration to select a christener for the new battleship, there seems room for regret, upon grounds of propriety, that the honor should (as it now appears) have fallen to the lot of one who will, perchance, fail to appreciate the value of Kentucky whiskey for christening purposes. For there can be no doubt that, for putting an individual in good fighting trim, a bottle of real Kentucky bourbon that is forty years old is far superior to a bottle of ordinary wine. And as it is the business of battleships to fight, the propriety of using whiskey for the christening will at once be apparent. However, it is announced that Secretary Long has officially settled the matter in favor of the daughter of Kentucky's governor, and with his decision the warring social factions will, we suppose, have to be content.
