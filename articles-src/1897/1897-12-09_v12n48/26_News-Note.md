But much more important than this is the news of a shifting of forces on the chess board of European diplomacy, by which old and long-established coalitions are broken up and new ones formed in which the Vatican holds the place of a member of the alliance. Thus, it is stated upon good authority, that Germany and the Vatican have come to an understanding by which the pope and the Kaiser are now virtual allies. In an interview with the pope on November 18, the German Minister of Foreign Affairs, it is stated, assured the Roman pontiff that hereafter regularly accredited ambassadors would be sent from Berlin to the Vatican, as well as to the Quirinal.
