Many readers of the SENTINEL will remember the agitation which was raised a few years ago by certain Protestant clergymen over the disabilities imposed upon Protestants in some of the Catholic countries of South America. The pope was asked to intervene and secure for these Protestants that civil and religious liberty of which the papacy has so often declared itself the champion. He replied that he could not be expected to interfere in the governmental affairs of another power; that to do what was asked of him would be a meddlesome act

which those countries would resent, and which would be altogether contrary to the papal code of procedure.
