Men and organizations who have stood in defense of a principle that is in its nature reformatory, that strikes at existing evils, have always been the targets of every abuse and calumny that the opposition could heap upon them.

In the days of Christ, the people garnished the sepulchres of the righteous, and with tear-stained cheeks exclaimed, "If we had been in the days of our fathers we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets." And yet this very people crucified the Prince of Glory.

Religious reformers in every age have had this spirit to contend with; but after their work is done and they pass off the stage of action, those who live after them, to enjoy the fruits of their labors, invariably look back upon the deeds of their persecutors with a holy horror, while at the same time they themselves may unconsciously be manifesting the same spirit toward a new truth for their day.

Seventh-day Adventists as an organization stand in defense of God's law and all that that implies. Their bitterest enemies, those who have been instrumental in invoking the power of the law against them, openly and under oath, acknowledge that they are good, law-abiding, honest citizens; temperate, and ready for every good word and work. Indeed, it is of them as of Daniel of old, the only occasion against them is "concerning the law of their God."

Seventh-day Adventists know that they have a work to do, and like faithful watchmen they have cried aloud and spared not. They have unflinchingly raised a note of warning against approaching dangers. They stand unalterably opposed to the strong trend of sentiment that is fast setting in favor of measures that have in them the principle of a united Church and State. Because of this they are maligned and denounced in the severest terms by the would-be guardians of Sunday-sacredness. And why? Simply because they see in them a Mordecai in the gate against the consummation of their cherished plans.

Nearly fifteen years ago, an authority among Seventh-day Adventists had this to say:—

"Those who honor the Bible Sabbath will be denounced as enemies of law and order; as breaking down the moral restraints of society, causing anarchy and corruption, and calling down the judgments of God upon the earth. . . . Conscientious obedience to the Word of God will be treated as rebellion."—"Great Controversy," vol. 4, pp. 409, 425.

This prophetic utterance has since been fulfilled to the very letter in many instances. Here is one. Speaking of the opposition of Seventh-day Adventists to National Reformism, Rev. J. R. Day, Secretary of the American Sabbath Union for the State of Indiana, at a mass meeting held in Chicago in 1892, said:—

"It is religious anarchy. It is calculated to break down our rest day, destroy the peace of the country, and bring the judgments of heaven down upon the land."

The Christian Endeavorer, whose "one absorbing purpose, one undying enthusiasm" seems to be that "Christ shall rule the caucus and the common council as he does the church," in its issue of November last, states that the Seventh-day Adventists are "carrying on a guarilla warfare against the United States Government," and in the December issue of the same publication, the editor says:—

"These Seventh-day Adventists are flooding our churches with their literature. . . . They co-operate with the open blatant infidels and other enemies of our country in their attacks upon the Christian Sabbath. . . . The friends of the Christian Sabbath have many enemies to fight, but none appear to us to be more mischievous than the Seventh-day Adventists."

Seventh-day Adventists are not nettled at this classification by the Endeavorer, though it is false in every respect. It is only what might be expected; indeed, it is just what is expected and what has been expected. For more than forty years, with voice and pen, Seventh-day Adventists have been telling all the people that what we now see enacted before our eyes, would take place; and no amount of denunciation, abuse, or misrepresentation will in the least swerve them from their duty as they view it. The warfare in which they are engaged is one on which hinge eternal consequences, and they have enlisted for life.
