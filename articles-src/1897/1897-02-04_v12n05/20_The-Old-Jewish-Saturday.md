The "Old Jewish Saturday" has been a source of untold trouble to the Sunday reformers for these many years. It has a certain dignity and persistency arising from its association with God, the Decalogue and Jesus Christ, which have made it so quietly stubborn when men have ordered it to get out of the way, that even Mr. Gamble, the latest "Daniel come to judgment," has not been able to order it out of court without a struggle. The special aim of these discoverers in the field of Sabbath Reform is to destroy "Saturday" as the seventh day of the week. To do this they are willing to destroy the week if need be,—anything to be rid of the one fact that the law of the Sabbath finds its full expression in the last day of the week.
