The proposed treaty of arbitration between this country and Great Britain does not now seem to be the embodiment of a desire for peace that it did at first. Lord Salisbury is quoted as saying that he will have the treaty in the form in which it was sent to the United States Senate, or not at all; and the Senate profess to see in it a shrewd scheme on the part of the English premier to put this country in a position of disadvantage. Consequently they have so amended the treaty that its acceptance by the representatives of both countries seems likely to be indefinitely postponed.

This only shows that the parties concerned in the matter are looking out for their own interests, respectively, much more than they are looking out for peace.
