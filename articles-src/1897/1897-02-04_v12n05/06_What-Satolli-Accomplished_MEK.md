Ever since Mgr. Satolli came to this country as Apostolic Delegate, it has been apparent that there was, in spite of a calm exterior, a deep under-current of clashing interests in the Catholic Church of the United States. There have been two parties in the Catholic Church here. One party wished to partake of the liberal spirit of the age and of this nation which has for the last one hundred years and more set the pace for the age in a liberal direction; the other party desired that the American Catholic Church should eliminate from herself the liberal tendencies of the country and age, and take on habiliments more in harmony with the Catholic Church of the past.

To settle these differences in harmony with the mind of the present Pope and in accordance with the historical character of the Roman Catholic Church was the object of Mgr. Satolli's mission to this country. Upon his arrival, each party strove to win Mgr. Satolli to its side of the controversy. Had the Apostolic Delegate been an American, an Englishman, a Frenchman, or a German, he would have been more liable to sympathize with the spirit of liberality. But he was none of these. He was an Italian—an Italian who does not accept any liberty for Italy except what the Pope may grant; an Italian whose mind from his earliest days has been saturated with the Catholic Church philosophy of the Dark Ages; and who had but one object in coming to America, and that was to check the liberal and independent spirit seen in the American Catholic Church.

The leading Catholic papers have all along denied that there was any such contention in the Catholic Church. They have asserted over and over again that these contentions in the church existed only in the minds of jealous Protestants; and that the church in America was perfectly united. But now that it is all over, and Satolli has put the brake down firm on liberalism, and the bishops have learned submission to the august pontiff who occupies the chair of Peter, the story is freely told.

The editor of the Western Watchman, in an authorized and official digest of the Catholic Church affairs in the United States of the past year, written for a denominational symposium in the New York Independent of January 7, practically admits all that has been suggested of the contentions and their causes in the Catholic Church in the United States. He admits that "the shock of the first encounter shook the whole American Church." The result was that "when the smoke of the conflict was lifted and we could see the result, Satolli was found in possession of the field, and his opponents fled over, a thousand leagues of seas."

Of the surrender of the American Catholic bishops to the will of Satolli, he further says:

"Never was there in the history of the world so powerful a class as the Catholic hierarchy from its institution till the coming of the first Apostolic Delegate; and never did class surrender dearest privileges with such lofty, if reluctant, magnanimity. The fact is the bishops of the United States were God-fearing men, and although unprepared for the change of discipline, they bowed to the command of the Holy Father."

It may be seen by this statement that the American Catholic Church was regarded by the Pope as being in danger of losing its distinctive historical feature of abject submission to the Papacy; and, more, he feared the further continuance in the liberal pathway, and hence interposed his authority to recall the church toward its true character of intolerance from which it has in this country imperceptibly drifted.

One of the steps taken in this direction was the removal of Bishop Keane from the rectorship of the Catholic University of Washington. Of this action the editor of the *Watchman* says:—

"Bishop Keane was not ponderous, and that was the extent of his offending. But it is doubtful if he would have been removed if he had not advanced dangerous views on Protestantism. Catholics believe that Protestantism is a damnable heresy, worse than any other that has yet arisen in the church. They think it is charity to tell Protestants so; to coöperate in bringing them out of their position of awful danger... Bishop Keene was the paraclete of American Protestants, and gave them consolation which better theologians considered cruel and unjustifiable. For this he was removed from the headship of an institution which was to train the men who were to lead the thought of the American Catholic Church in years to come."

The above is a very significant statement. It proves that the Catholic priests and people of this country are henceforth to be trained upon a method less in harmony with the spirit of American liberty, and more in a fashion of the priesthood of medieval Europe, when anything which did not agree with the Catholic Church was denounced as "damnable heresy" by decrees of the church, and the believers in such doctrines extirpated, if need be, by the civil rulers—who were the church's most obsequious and obedient servants.

One more thought in this connection is worthy of remark—the *time* when the Papacy determined to change its policy in America. As long as "liberty" was the true watchword of the American people, such a step could not be safely taken. This has been the condition of the American people from the birth of the republic until within the past few years. During these years no one suggested that the American people were in danger of becoming too free. Old barbaric, priestly laws have been swept from the statute books, or become obsolete from disuse.

But a change has surely come. The people of America are losing the spirit of liberty. Many of the great men of the nation distrust the people, and think that they can sniff anarchy in the popular discontent. There is a great movement for the enforcement of religion by law; and laws which men of the present age scarcely dreamed were in existence have been resurrected and enforced in our day. The various departments of our Government have at different times given authoritative expressions of governmental approval of that sentiment.

The Pope sees this significant change in American feeling, and as he sees the nation liable to make a great swing back from liberty toward despotism, he would preface for the change, that the Catholic Church may be in a position to reap the results from this retrogression of sentiment. To put the American Catholic Church into a position to gather the largest possible amount of results of this change in American sentiment was the mission of Satolli. No wonder that he has received a Cardinal's hat in acknowledgement of his remarkable success!
