"SENATOR HOAR," says the Independent, "is said to have betrayed deep feeling in resenting the threatening tone of some of the communications to Senators peremptorily demanding the prompt ratification of the Arbitration Treaty. He deemed it a grievous indignity to so honorable a body to hurry it into immediate action by 'jamming spurs into its sides.'"

The senator is right. The members of Congress are chosen to transact the most important business of the nation, and they should do this with that deliberation which waits on wisdom. We hope every member of our national Legislature will refuse to pay any attention to the threatening of any party or body, big or little, religious or secular.
