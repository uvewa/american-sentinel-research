In the Christian Statesman, of January 23, the editor reports that he called recently upon President Cleveland, "to express to the President our high appreciation of the far-reaching influence" of his Thanksgiving proclamation. "No sooner had we referred to that remarkable document than the President said: 'I have been amazed at the effect of that acknowledgment of Christ. Letters have come to me in large numbers from various portions of the country, expressing intense satisfaction. My only wonder is that I never made a similar acknowledgment before."

The author of that truly "remarkable document" is not surprised that none of his predecessors possessed sufficient wisdom to issue such a proclamation, but only that he himself had not thought of it sooner! That is surprising, truly!
