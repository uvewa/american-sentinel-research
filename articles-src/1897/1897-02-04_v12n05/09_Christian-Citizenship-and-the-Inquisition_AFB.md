PROBABLY all those connected with the Christian Citizenship movement, should they have occasion to refer to the matter, would severely condemn the Inquisition. But if their movement succeeds, will they not be driven to the establishment of some form of that tribunal?

Nothing is more logical than that an inquisition should follow an attempt to establish the Kingdom of God on the plan that the government should be controlled by the "saints," and that the Christian Citizenship leaders are the ones qualified to decide who are saints. If none but saints can get office under the government, there will be great additions to the number of saints, of those who are saints "for revenue only." And since the presence of counterfeit saints would ruin the proposed kingdom, it necessarily follows that there must be a saint tester to cull out spurious saints.

In the last SENTINEL, it was clearly shown that already our Christian Citizenship friends are sadly in need of a saint tester. It was shown that in 1890 they deliberately selected a Kentucky congressman, of good standing in an influential church, to start their movement, who was at the time he began work on the kingdom, what they now term "an infamous old libertine." They therefore confess that they selected "an infamous old libertine" as pioneer lawmaker for their kingdom, thinking of course that he was a saint. Nothing is clearer, therefore, than that some kind of an inquisition is needed by our Christian Citizenship friends to enable them to discern between the righteous and the wicked. This is what the original Inquisition was for, and this is what its apologists declare it was for, and this is the ground on which it is defended.

The Catholic Mirror, of Aug. 29, 1896, contained an article in defense of the Spanish Inquisition, which attempts to justify the acts of that awful tribunal on the ground that government favor to the Catholic religion produced so many hypocrites that the Inquisition was necessary to cull them out. Here is a portion of the article:

"To put it briefly, in those middle ages, there was the greatest union of Church and State. . . . All the laws, then, had a tinge of Catholicity, and they were carried out in a manner savoring of the principles of the universal church. . . . In those ages of faith, . . . it was well nigh impossible for a Jew or infidel to ascend to prominency in any walk of life. . . . This was very galling to the avaricious Jew, and numbers of them, thirsting for wealth, while secretly remaining Jews, pretended to profess the Catholic faith, were baptized, pushed themselves into the courts and kingly places, and even were found among the priests and prelates of the church of God. . . . In time, this consumptive germ did not fail to cause great trouble and danger and alarm in Spain. Such a state of things called for immediate action; but since there was no doubt but that very many of the Jews were honest in their conviction, what to do was a very perplexing question. Hence arose a very great difficulty—a difficulty which, as all will agree, could be overcome only by an inquisition."

Since the Roman Catholic Church has been in the State-Church business all her life, she is certainly qualified to know better whether it breeds hypocrisy than our Christian Citizenship friends who are just setting up in business. And from the foregoing we learn that it is the sober judgment of the papal church, the result of long experience, that governmental favor shown to a particular religion inevitably results in multiplying hypocritical professors of that religion, so perfectly counterfeit as to require an inquisition to discover the genuine. Any one with a mind to think and eyes to observe can see that this is true even if the long experience of the Catholic Church did not confirm it. It therefore follows that in the proportion that the Christian Citizenship movement succeeds, just in that proportion it will become the habitation of hypocrites, or as the prophet paints it, "the cage of every unclean and hateful bird." This being the inevitable result, the next question is what will the Christian Citizenship managers do about it? Will they undertake to cull out the hypocrites? and if so, how? It is useless for them to say that they can discern a hypocrite without some form of an inquisition: for it was shown at the beginning of this article that they have not the discernment to do so.

There is an infallible detector of hypocrites which belongs to the true church, but it is not the Inquisition. Hypocrites attempted to unite themselves with the early Christian Church, but in Acts 3:1–14 we learn that it was with fatal result. But this detector was the Holy Spirit, which departed from the church, as John Wesley tells us, as soon as the Church sought help from the State. No, the Christian Citizenship movement cannot have the Holy Spirit to protect it from hypocrites. An inquisition is all that is left. Will the Christian Citizenship managers organize an inquisition?
