"The essential principle of a trust where capital is involved is found in trusts where labor is involved. There is in our judgment no jurist, political economist, publicist of any sphere of experience or grade of acquirement, who can face the issue and point out a radical distinction between a trust which aggregates capital and an organization which aggregates and monopolizes labor."
