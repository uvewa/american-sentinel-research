The usual "contest" over the chaplaincy in the various legislatures is now the order of the day. A reporter of the St. Paul Dispatch, says that "In the house there will undoubtedly be a hot contest for the privilege of keeping up communication between the two very remote powers." It could well be added that such a farce as is often enacted in the name of religion in the utterly vain attempt to do this, could not be, if there were not found in our Government this relic of Church and State union.

The reporter suggests that "it would seem that there should not be such a contest for the place, but there is." But such a contest would never again be possible if the various legislatures would abolish the "place." Why not do it?
