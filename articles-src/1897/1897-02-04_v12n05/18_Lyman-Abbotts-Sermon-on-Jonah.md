One such "sermon" as was preached on a recent Sunday in Plymouth Church, Brooklyn, by the Rev. Lyman Abbott, in which he amused his congregation even to the point of open laughter by his treatment of the Bible story of Jonah, does more to break down the bars of moral restraint in a community than can be offset by all the efforts of reform societies. Dr. Abbott says that the Book of Jonah is a fable, written to teach the goodness and mercy of God. But the average person will lose confidence in a God whose goodness and mercy must be taught by falsehood. The God of the Bible was never reduced to any such straits.

The greatest need of mankind to-day is that of more confidence in God and God's Word.
