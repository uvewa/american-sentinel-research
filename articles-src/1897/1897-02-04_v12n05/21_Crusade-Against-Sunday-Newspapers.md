A CRUSADE against Sunday newspapers and Sunday distribution of mails, was inaugurated January 21, by ministers of Annapolis, Maryland. At a meeting held in the First M. E. Church, a committee of seven was appointed to petition the postmaster-general on the subject, and devise such other means as might be necessary to the success of the crusade. The Sunday sermon is coming to rely more and more upon State and municipal legislation to enable it to compete with the Sunday papers.
