THE National Reform party has now abandoned hope with reference to its so-called Christian Amendment to the Constitution, so far as concerns this session of Congress. After being so thoroughly disposed of before the hearing given by a committee of Congress last year, it was left in the hands of the committee without further action, and to a request recently preferred by its advocates for another hearing, reply was sent that no further discussion of the matter could be allowed. Of course it will make its appearance again before the new Congress.
