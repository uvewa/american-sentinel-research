## A Mythical Alliance.

The State Superintendent of the Nevada Christian Endeavor Society, Rev. Francis L. Nash, states in the Christian Endeavorer for February, 1897, that an alliance exists in Nevada between Seventh-day Adventists and the saloon. Here are his words:—

"The saloons and gambling hells make more money on that day [Sunday] than on all the other days of the week, and whenever an attempt is made to rescue the Sabbath, the Seventh-day Adventists stand in with the saloon men and do their best to stamp out the very last vestige of respect and reverence for the day which ought to be loved and honored. As a result, in many places the day is dreaded by the wives and mothers as the worst day in the week—the day for drinking, carousing, and horse racing, a day for fights and brawls, rioting and murder, heaven-daring impiety and beastly impurity."

And upon this the editor of the Endeavorer comments:—

"We are very sorry that this course should be pursued by these people, and hope that in the near future such an alliance of saloon-keepers and Seventh-day Adventists will be unknown."

All this reminds us of the familiar saying, "Important if true." But is it true?

We never heard of any alliance between seventh-day observers and saloonists, from either of the parties themselves. All talk of such a thing has come from other sources.

It is pretty certain that liquor dealers have had no suspicion that they have allies in the Seventh-day Adventists. About the last thing in the world that saloon men would want is a universal acceptance of Seventh-day Adventist doctrine on the subject of temperance.

Reason: Seventh-day Adventists use no intoxicants. In their communion there are neither drunkards nor moderate drinkers. And no saloon-keeper has ever thought of applying for membership in one of their churches. Does this indicate an alliance with the saloon?

More than this: Seventh-day Adventists are, and always have been, prohibitionists. Their literature proves this. We never knew liquor dealers to regard prohibitionists as their allies.

It is true, this religious body are the advocates of the seventh-day as being the Bible Sabbath, and are uncompromisingly opposed to the doctrine that the Sabbath is Sunday. And they are not backward in proclaiming these views, for they believe them to be part of a divine message which must go to the world. But does this constitute an alliance with the saloon? We think not.

And now a glance at the record of those who are publishing this "alliance," by way of comparison. What is their attitude toward the saloon?

Who are the ones that are advocating and working for a law to close all the saloons—on Sundays? Are they Seventh-day Adventists? No; they are the people represented by the Endeavorer. They would have a law closing saloons on Sunday, and allowing them to run the other six days of the week. And thus they would make of the saloon—that iniquitous thing—a law-abiding institution, wherever it would be willing to close its doors on Sunday; and this it is showing itself quite willing to do. It matters not that the Endeavors desire prohibition, as we fully believe, and have that as their ultimate aim. What they and Sunday advocates generally are actually working for now is the establishment of the saloon by law; for that is what Sunday prohibition means. Seventh-day Adventists regard the saloon as by nature an outlaw.

It will be a good day for the saloon, and a bad day for the cause of temperance, when that evil institution shall be established in our land by a law which rests upon the will of the (professedly) Christian Church.

The saloon wants nothing better than the opportunity to say, I am a law-abiding institution; I am respectable, for I keep Sunday.

Where then is the real alliance, if there be one, between church people and the saloon? Is it to be found with the advocates of the seventh day or of the first?

Finally, it may be mentioned that in 1893 the saloonists of Chicago joined heartily in the plea of the Church people that the World's Fair be closed on Sundays. Of course this constituted no real alliance between the saloon and the Church. The saloon would be better patronized on Sunday with the Fair closed, and it would be both business and good policy on its part to join in the petition. But there was just as much of an alliance as exists between the saloon and the Adventists.

The "alliance" of this people with the saloon is a myth.
