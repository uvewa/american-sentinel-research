## The Cold Wave in London, Ontario.

BY J. F. BALLINGER.

The cold wave of "Christian Citizenship" is not confined to the States, but has crossed the Lakes and struck Canada with its chilling blast of "moral reform through political economy."

The Rev. Dr. E. O. Taylor, of Chicago, came to this city by invitation of the W. C. T. U. He spoke in the First Presbyterian Church last Sunday afternoon. He spent one hour in defining what "Christian Citizenship" is. We have heard and read a good deal of the aim and object of this movement, but we never heard or read anything in which the real character of this organization was unmasked as in the above lecture.

The speaker did not try to hide the fact that "Christian Citizenship" meant that the Church should run the State, as the following utterances will show. He said:—

"Human governments are divine, and God's ministers are appointed to administer in civil as well as religious things."

The apostles said, "But we will give ourselves continually to prayer and the ministry of the word." Acts 6:4.

Now if to administer civil governments means to minister the Word, then it follows that the minister must use the power of the civil government to enforce the Word.

This position was further defined by another statement, that—

"Every question, both civil and religious, should be settled by the book" [meaning the Bible].

Then it follows again, that the minister must define the terms of settlement according to the Bible, and when he has decided what the Bible says are the conditions of settlement, he must use the power of the State, which is the sword, to enforce a settlement.

Did pagan or papal Rome ever contend for any more than this? If they did we would like to be shown the page in history where it is recorded.

Again, the speaker said, "Remove the stumbling blocks out of the way of the Church and thus make it easy for man to do right by improving your civil laws."

We had always supposed that the gospel was the power of God to enable men to do right by planting the righteousness of God in the heart through faith in Jesus Christ. Rom. 1:16, 17. We never once dreamed that it was in the power of civil law to remove the cross and make the straight and narrow way to heaven easy.

> "Must I be carried to the skies
> On flowery beds of ease,
> Whilst others fought to win the prize
> And sailed through bloody seas?"

Indeed, we can according to the above, just come and join the Christian Citizenship movement and improve our civil laws, and thus make it easy to do right by legislating away the cross. Then we will not need to be "crucified unto the world." We won't need to "suffer with Christ that we may reign with him." We shall need no longer to "watch and pray lest we enter into temptation," for temptations will be removed by improving civil law, and making it easy to do right. Then according to this proposed revolution we can all "live godly in Christ Jesus" without suffering persecution.

Once more; the speaker said:—

"Some people are very strict in attending to the ordinance of baptism and the sacrament, but neglect the ballot box. It is just as much our duty to vote as to pray or to take the sacrament."

Then the commission to preach the gospel should read, Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature, and he that believeth not and does not vote to help to improve the civil laws and make it easy to do right shall be damned!

How any man with an open Bible in his hand and the history of the past before him can put forth such reasoning is a mystery that we are not able to solve.

But such is the blindness of men when they "walk in the sparks of their own kindling." Were it not that the prophets have described and warned us against just such a state of things in the last days, we could hardly make ourselves believe that men could descend into such dense darkness.

Did we not read from the sacred page that there would be a union of religion and the State which would bring about the last great struggle between the powers of light and darkness, we could hardly believe our own ears as we listen to such sentiments as are put forth by these would-be reformers.

"Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come."

London, Ont., Feb. 2.
