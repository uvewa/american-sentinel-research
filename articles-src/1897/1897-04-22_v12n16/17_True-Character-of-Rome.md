The true character of a person can be known only when he enjoys the fullest freedom. It is so with an institution or a church. The thoughts and intents of her heart cannot be known by observing the doings of the Roman Church in our own land at this time and under present circumstances. She has too much of the wisdom of the serpent to disclaim against religious liberty in this country.—Converted Catholic.
