The public will please take notice that a "Good Citizenship" convention is to be held at Nashville, Tenn., May 18–20, for the purpose of providing, among other things, for the placing in public office of "able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating unjust gain." Will all such in the various States please communicate with the meeting, that at the proper time there may be as little delay as possible in filling the offices.(!)
