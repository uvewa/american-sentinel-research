The Sunday law forces have won what is reported as a great victory in Whitman County, Wash., the result of which will be, it is said, that "all business houses will remain closed on Sunday during the next two years." The fulcrum over which the leverage of the Sunday movement was obtained, was the saloon. The facts in the case are thus stated by the Spokesman-Review, of that State:

"Colfax, April 6.—All business houses in Whitman County will remain closed on Sunday during the next two years. The first case brought by Prosecuting Attorney Matthews to enforce the closing of all business houses on Sunday was settled yesterday by the defendant pleading guilty and paying a fine of $75 and costs.

"When Prosecuting Attorney Matthews was nominated for the office he now holds he promised to enforce all laws upon the statute books regardless of public opinion. During the campaign he and Sheriff Sims announced that if elected they would enforce all laws against immorality, and especially the Sunday closing and gambling laws. This was treated by many as campaign thunder and a bid for the church vote, and although again notified when the new officers took their offices the saloons of Colfax were open all day the first Sunday after these men went into office. The second Sunday they did likewise, but detectives visited the various saloons and the next day Riche Montgomery, bartender in the New Castle saloon, was arrested for violating Section 210 of the Penal Code. Upon preliminary examination he was bound over in the sum of $300 to appear for trial in the superior court.

"The saloon men and many merchants agreed to close their places of business on Sunday, provided no more arrests were made, and it was mutually agreed that a test case should be made. Accordingly the town was thoroughly canvassed for subscriptions to carry the matter up and quite a large sum was raised. Eminent counsel was employed by the defendant, and one of the leading attorneys of Colfax was employed to go to Olympia and look through the records to see if there was not a defect in the law whereby it could be rendered non-effective. The result was anxiously awaited and a reply was recently received by wire that there was no hope.

"The defendant, being only an employé of the saloon, desired to leave the State before the case was decided, so a certified check to cover any fine which might be assessed, together with all costs, was deposited with the court, and yesterday Mr. Lefrancis, proprietor of the New Castle saloon, appeared in court and on behalf of Mr. Montgomery, asked to be allowed to plead guilty of the charge. He also asked the court to be as lenient as possible, and declared so far as he was concerned there would be no further violation of the law. Judge McDonald sentenced him to pay a fine of $75 and costs, which he promptly paid.

"This case has been watched with a great deal of interest, as upon its result depended the fate of the Sunday closing law. The result is considered a great victory by the friends of the law, while those who opposed it are correspondingly dejected. Mr. Matthews says he will enforce the law to the letter during his administration, no matter if every voter in the county signs a remonstrance against its enforcement."

The saloon is no ally of religious liberty, and any fight that is conducted in its interests deserves to be lost. Let the battle for religious freedom be conducted independently of the saloon altogether. It is a Christian cause, and does not deserve to be associated with that which is purely of "the world, the flesh, and the devil."
