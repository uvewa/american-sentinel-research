The following from the *Evangel and Sabbath Outlook*, of March 25, exposes the ignorance out of which grew Mr. Gamble's recent "great discovery" concerning the Sabbath. Mr. Gamble says that the translation "first day of the week" occurring in the Authorized and Revised Versions of the English New Testament, is due to the ignorance of the translators; and that it should read "first of the sabbaths,"—that is, of the new, or Sunday sabbaths. The Outlook says:—

"As Mr. Gamble confesses, this bold arraignment of the translators of our English Bible is not original with him. A few others, whose knowledge of Greek seems to consist in obtaining the superficial definition of words from the lexicon without entering into the deeper knowledge of the genius of the language, or the nature of the passages translated, have attempted this method of escaping from the facts in the case. Every Greek scholar will smile at the assurance, born of imperfect knowledge, which Mr. Gamble's announcement of the ignorance of the translators and revisers of the New Testament evinces. The English reader can see the fallacy of this part of the new discovery by noting the following facts:—

"The Hebrews named no day of the week except the Sabbath; this was both named and numbered. It was so prominent a feature of the week that it was made the starting point from which the other days were numbered.

"Out of this conception grew the idioms which numbered each day as "First," "Second," "Third," etc., from the Sabbath and in its progress toward the next Sabbath. This conception carried the idea of ownership of the days by the Sabbaths between which they came and went. This thought and the idiomatic expression growing from it, is yet found in Hebrew references to the days of the week. To aid Mr. Gamble in future discoveries we refer him to the Hebrew Prayer Book in which the order of the lessons is indicated as we have explained. There he will find the Hebrew; Hayom yom rishon bashabbath.

"('This day is' one towards, or of, the Sabbath day) translated in the heading of the lesson so described: 'Psalm for the first day of the week.' Examples may be found on page 80 of the Prayer Book by Singer, London, and published for use in the United States under the sanction of the late Chief Rabbi Nathan Adler. The Greek writers of the New Testament followed the idea and the idiom of the Hebrew as nearly as the language would permit. Adopting the Greek 'genitive' (possessive), construction, they wrote: Mia toon Sabbatoon, which our (careless and ignorant translators, according to Mr. Gamble) render in the exactly equivalent English, 'First day of the week.' Mr. Gamble's discovery is the product of ignorance and not of even ordinary scholarship."
