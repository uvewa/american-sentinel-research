BY M. E. KELLOGG.

It is a great truth that the gospel of Jesus Christ is of inestimable benefit to mankind, directly, to every one who receives it, and even indirectly to others. The principles of love, mercy, purity and sobriety, which are developed in those who receive the indwelling Saviour, certify that the gospel is the greatest power for righteousness that there is in the world.

It therefore becomes a very important question from both the standpoint of individual salvation and of other interests as well, to ascertain in what manner the Christian religion can be the most successfully propagated, or in other words, the best manner to induce persons to accept for themselves the personal benefits of Christianity.

First, there is the old-fashioned way pursued by Christ and his apostles. That way is to preach Christ in all his divine power as the personal Saviour of every one who will accept his salvation; the receiving of his Spirit which will enable the convert to walk as he walked and to illustrate in his life the life of Christ himself. In this acceptance of Christianity no dependence is placed upon the flesh, nor do ordinances or ceremonies of any kind have any part in the justification or salvation of the sinner. He is saved by faith, which works in him the righteousness of the law.

This way of introducing Christianity was so eminently successful that in the early days of its proclamation, upon one occasion three thousand souls were converted in one day; upon another occasion five thousand were converted, and such perfect harmony and love prevailed among the converts that it has been put on record that "the multitude of them that believed were of one eart and of one soul." This was the primitive way of proclaiming the gospel, and in that period of its progress it has been fitly described as one on a white horse with a bow and crown who went forth conquering and to conquer.

But at an early period there came a great apostasy in the Church. A central head was established at Rome, individual liberty was repressed, the Holy Spirit was not recognized as the director of the Church, and men assumed the position of regulating and controlling the gospel. Soon the Church was joined to the State, and the power of kings and princes was invoked to carry the gospel. By proffered earthly rewards, by threats, by fears, a mongrel gospel was proclaimed. Great apparent results were achieved, but nothing approximating that early success has ever been obtained, nor could it ever be said of these converts from worldly motives that they were of one heart and of one soul. Instead of loving each other they have not hesitated to make war upon and to kill each other!

Strangely enough, with these two examples before the eyes of the Christian world, the tendency at the present day is to use the latter method. To this end ministers preach, editors write, and lawmakers legislate. Christianity by law, is the cry. Thus methods distinctively worldly are put into action to gain an object entirely spiritual and religious! Is it any wonder that the type of Christianity produced by such methods differs so materially from that seen in the days of the apostles? With promises of earthly honors and earthly temporal good entering so largely into the modern religio-political preaching, with man's power for God's power, man's approbation for God's love, earthly penalties for God's punishments, what will the "Christianity" which is the outcome be? It must be something so different from the biblical, the apostolical and the true, that the Lord will not recognize it as His.

The gospel itself, alone, separate from everything else, is a power—it is "the power of God unto salvation." It is so perfect of itself that the addition of anything to it or the taking away of anything from it as a help to rectitude and holiness lessens its power and mars the perfection of its work. It stands alone for perfection of righteousness and of character, high above all that can come from the power of man, either alone, or in an attempted union with it.

We need the gospel; it is the only hope of the age, but we want it pure. We want it separated from all man's pretended helps of governmental patronage, favorable legislation, and temporal rewards. Then will apostolical seasons of power and refreshing be seen, and the world will stand amazed at the exhibition.
