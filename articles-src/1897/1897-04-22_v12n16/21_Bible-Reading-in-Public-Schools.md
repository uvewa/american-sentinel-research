Do Bible reading and prayer in the public schools constitute worship? If so, they are prohibited by the constitutional provision of the States against compulsory support of any place of worship.

If they do not constitute worship in the public schools, do they constitute worship in the churches? If they do not, then it cannot be truthfully pleaded that churches should be exempt from taxation as places devoted wholly to public worship.

But if these exercises constitute worship in the churches, they must also constitute worship in the public schools.

This point furnishes ground for an antichristian journal of this city to charge the representatives of Christianity with "pious evasion" of their obligations; and the force of the objection must be admitted.
