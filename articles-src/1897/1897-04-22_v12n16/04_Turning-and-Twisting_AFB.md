Truth bears its own credentials. It does not need the advantage which results from a comparison with error. Yet to some minds the turning and twisting of those who attempt to defend error is the first indication that error is error.

Most people who observe the first day of the week as a weekly holy day, apply to it the Bible name "Sabbath," a name which the Lord applies to the seventh, but never to the first day of the week. "Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work; but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God," is the plain word of the Lord.

Those who teach that the first day of the week is the Sabbath are continually worried by demands from their followers for Bible proof for calling the first day the Sabbath.

One of these demands was recently addressed to a Mr. Gamble, who just now poses as the Sunday-sabbath champion for the Christian Endeavorers. Here it is:

"Where in the New Testament [give chapter and verse] is the first day of the week spoken of as the Sabbath, or a Sabbath?"

This question, with Mr. Gamble's reply, was published on the first page of the Christian Endeavorer, for April. We quote a part of the reply, and ask the reader to observe the twisting:

"Proceeding to speak of the resurrection day, he [Matthew] continues, 'as it began to dawn toward the one of the Sabbaths' [translated in the Authorized and Revised Versions, first day of the week], evidently meaning the 'one' of the system that belonged to the Christian era. If the resurrection Sunday was the 'one' of Sabbaths, the next Sunday was the second, etc."

In the very next sentence Mr. Gamble proceeds to destroy what he has attempted to build up, as follows:

"Acts 20:7, says: 'And on the one of the Sabbaths when the disciples came together to break bread [hold the communion], Paul preached to them, etc.'"

In attempting to explain his new translation, Mr. Gamble says, "If the resurrection Sunday was the 'one' of Sabbaths, the next Sunday was the second, etc."

Very well; then the resurrection Sunday would be the only day which could be called the "one of the Sabbaths," the following Sunday must be called the second of the Sabbaths, and the next one the *third*, and so on. The meeting on the first day of the week referred to in Acts 20:7, occurred about thirty years after the resurrection Sunday, and since there are fifty-two Sundays in a year, according to Mr. Gamble's new theory, this first day should be called the 1560th of the Sabbaths; but fatal to his new theory, the same words are used to designate this first day of the week as are used to designate the resurrection day, it is "one of the Sabbath," or, as the translators give it, "first day of the week."

Such twisting and turning should make the seeker after truth suspicious of the position which requires such methods to defend it. For a brief discussion of the reasons, for the translation as it appears in the Authorized and Revised Versions, see article on another page, entitled "A Product, Not a Discovery, of Ignorance." A.
