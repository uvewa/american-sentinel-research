The following description of Christians is given by an anonymous writer in the "Letter to Diognetus," written about the middle of the second century. It ought to be profitable for the politics- and pleasure-loving professors of this day to consider what Christians were like in the early days when Christianity went forth into the world with unparalleled power and success:—

"The Christians are not distinguished from the rest of mankind either by nationality or language. They have no separate cities, they use no special dialect, they practice no peculiar mode of life. They inhabit the cities of Greece and the rest of the world just as each finds his place allotted to him. They follow the local customs in respect to meat and drink, costume and other social habits, and yet they carry about them the strange and avowedly mysterious signs of their true nationality. They dwell in their own country but as strangers. . . . Every foreign country is to them a native land, and every native land is to them a foreign country. They marry and bring up their families like other folk, but they do not, like others, expose their infant children. They provide their meals in common, but theirs is no common meal. They live in the flesh, but not after the flesh. They sojourn upon earth, but their citizenship is in heaven. They obey the established laws, and yet by their individual lives they surpass the laws. They love all men, yet they are persecuted by all. They are put to death, and yet are raised to life. They are not understood and yet they are condemned. They are poor and yet make many rich. They are in want of everything and yet in everything abound. They are dishonored and yet by their dishonor are covered with glory. They are defamed, and yet are counted righteous. They are reviled and blessed. They are insulted and entreat men honorably. They do good and are punished as evildoers. When punished they rejoice as being raised to life. The Jews make war on them as Gentiles, and the Greeks persecute them, and yet those that hate them cannot state the cause of their dislike."
