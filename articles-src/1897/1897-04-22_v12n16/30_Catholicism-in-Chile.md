The Rev. Webster E. Browning, Ph. D., writes the following on this subject from Santiago, Chile, to the Herald and Presbyter:

"In Santiago, when rain was needed, it was once the custom to take the image of St. Isidore from the church of that name, in a procession to the cathedral. If rain followed this action, the image was escorted back to his own church with great honor. If no rain came, the image was publicly scourged or shut up in a room in the cathedral which is used as a prison for the refractory saints who refuse to hear prayer.

"One of the most important processions of the year is that given in honor of the wafer which has been blessed and represents the body of Christ. A procession of priests, boys, etc., issues from the cathedral, and to the sound of music proceeds to the central plaza of the city, where altars have been erected for the occasion. The priest who acts as chief at this time carries a tray upon which has been placed a small wafer. This is carried to the first altar, where it is placed, the altar being raised some fifteen feet, and the people bow or fall in adoration before it.

"According to the Council of Trent, the few words pronounced in an unknown tongue, and by a priest whose character is unknown, over this wafer, have transformed it into the real body and blood of Christ. He is there in that wafer—flesh, bones, skin, hair, muscles, nerves, and in all his personality as the Saviour of men. The wafer is thus escorted to the four corners of the square, and successively placed upon the four altars and adored by the people. The bands play airs from the operas, or other classical music, and all these things together make a scene of noise and confusion, mingled with some little idea of reverence among the people for the wafer god, and all combine to fill the mind with the idea that this is the hight of true worship, all that will be needed for many days to assure them of forgiveness of sin and justification before God.

"Evidence of the control which the priests [of whom there are about two thousand in this city] have over the people may be seen every day in the streets. When a Catholic who has faithfully supported the church is thought to be dying, the last sacrament is sent to him. A priest goes in a coach, clad in robes of white; the driver sits in front with uncovered head, and by his side is a boy, also uncovered, who continually rings a bell as the coach is driven through the streets. At the sound of this bell business is for the time suspended. The merchant turns from his customer and kneels at his counter; the driver and conductor of the street-car stop the car and also kneel; the passengers who are Catholics follow their example, and the people who may be passing through the streets immediately kneel and cross themselves. To be sure, there are many in the cars and in the street who do no reverence, but the faithful are expected to do so. There was a time, and not many years ago, when it was unsafe to be in the street and not recognize with due reverence this priest with the sacrament. The hat which was not removed was often knocked off by some zealot. But the sentiment against all these processions is growing, and one now hears only the muttered curse of the bystander, or of the priest if he fail to salute him.

"Other processions and extravagances could be mentioned, but these suffice to show the trend of all the worship, toward that which is outward and ceremonial, to the neglect of the inward heart religion. And it is almost needless to relate the consequences in the lives of the people of this externalism. It has been many times exemplified in history, and with always the same result. The Greek and Roman world, at the coming of Christ, in the depths of iniquity to which they had descended, were reaping the results of their superstitious formalism. The Pharisees made long prayers and gave tithes, but the Lord compared their hearts to charnel houses. The Chileans are a very religious people, so far as regards the observance of the outward form, but their lives show that they are strangers to the new birth which Christ declared to be essential. Mendacity is fearfully prevalent; theft comes as a second nature; the Sabbath is made a day of recreation, and the morals of the social life are very low indeed.

"And yet these are a splendid people. Many are breaking away from Catholicism, and many more secretly despise it. But, disgusted with this, the only religion of which they know, they fall away into French atheism or German rationalism, and cannot be reached. The whole of Chile is open to evangelization, and there are urgent calls in many parts. And, could any one who doubts the need of missionaries but see the degradation and spiritual poverty of the people, not only in Chile, but from Panama to Cape Horn, there can be no question that these doubts would vanish. India needs missions, and Africa; the Japanese and Chinese should be heard in their call for the gospel; other lands are in dire need of the water of life; but shall South America, blessed by nature in so many ways, but blighted by man, be left in darkness?"
