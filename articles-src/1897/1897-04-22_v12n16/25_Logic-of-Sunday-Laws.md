One of the most mysterious things in the world is the "logic" which upholds the Sunday laws. It may be illustrated thus (borrowing from the theology of Sunday observance for the purpose):—

The Sabbath commandment is so indefinite that it does not specify any particular day as the Sabbath.

The world being round, it is impossible for a definite day to be observed on it anyway.

Hence, you must observe that particular day of the week known as Sunday.

Or, again:—

All the ten commandments have been abolished, including the command to observe the Sabbath.

We believe in full religious liberty.

Therefore, you must observe the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday, or suffer the pains and penalties of the law.
