The "National Municipal League" is another organization of the "good citizenship" type, which has for its object the reform of municipal government. A conference under the auspices of this League will be held in Louisville, Ky., May 5–7. It is stated that at this conference the churches will be appealed to, "not as denominations, but as congregations and as Christians." What force this distinction will have from a political standpoint does not appear.
