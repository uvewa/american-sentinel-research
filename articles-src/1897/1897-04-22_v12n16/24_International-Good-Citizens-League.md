We have already mentioned the call which has been sent out for a "National Good Citizens' Convention," to be held at Nashville, May 18–20, of this year. This convention, it now appears, has for its main purpose the formation of a permanent organization to be known as the "International Good Citizens' League," with the following aims:—

"1st. To unite for efficient and concerted action, and for mutual encouragement, all friends of good government, liberty and prosperity.

"2nd. To purify politics, and for public office to 'provide out of the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating unjust gain.'

"3rd. To accept Christ and his law as the true basis of government and the supreme authority in national as in individual life.

"4th. For alleviation of suffering, uplifting of humanity, and, as far as possible, abatement of poverty.

"5th. For universal diffusion of knowledge and promulgation of truth.

"6th. To promote the study of citizen-duty from the Bible standpoint, the glorious opportunities, privileges, and possibilities within reach of that nation whose government honors God's authority."

The Christian Statesman prints the above with the observation that "the forces of this proposed convention and league might better unite with either the National Reform Association or the Christian Citizenship League." And this is true, as far as concerns its nature; for in spirit and purpose these three organizations are one and the same.
