## General Notes
- OCR source quality: Good overall readability
- Most articles clearly distinguished with titles and attributions

## Specific Uncertainties

### Page 5, Article "Ballot and Bullet.—No. 3"
- **Text:** "committed himself to Him that judge is right to plebe"
- **Confidence:** LOW
- **Issue:** This appears to be an OCR error. The biblical reference is 1 Pet. 2:23, which should read "committed himself to him that judgeth righteously"
- **Transcribed as written** in OCR despite apparent corruption

### Page 5, Article "Ballot and Bullet.—No. 3"
- **Text:** "The powers that behave a commission"
- **Confidence:** LOW
- **Issue:** Should likely read "The powers that be have a commission" - OCR error on "be" → "behave"
- **Transcribed as written** in OCR

### Page 7, Article "How to Proclaim the Gospel"
- **Text:** "the multitude of them that believed were of one eart and of one soul"
- **Confidence:** HIGH (with noted typo)
- **Issue:** "eart" should be "heart" - clear OCR error
- **Transcribed as:** "eart" (preserving OCR text exactly)
