The April *Christian Eudeavorer*, referring to a recent statement in the SENTINEL that what the workingmen of the country want is legislation that will provide more work rather than legislation which will curtail it, says that it certainly will help the situation to reduce the amount of work and the number of workers by means of Sunday laws. "Six men can do a piece of work if they work seven days in the week. If there is no work done on Sunday it will take seven men to do that same work."

But have not the advocates of Sunday laws been all the time telling us that people could do more work in a given time by resting one day in seven, than by working seven days in the week? They cannot deny that this has been one of their stock arguments. Now if this argument be true,—if six men, working six days in the week, can do more work in a given time than six men working seven days a week,—how can it be that seven men working six days a week can do no more work than six men working seven days in the week?

The same issue of the *Eudeavorer* prints a letter from Mr. P. Enright, of the "Executive Board Iron Moulders' Union of North America," in which he says:—

"That there is an estrangement between the Church and organized labor, I regret to state, is true. The unions have done much through agitation and legislation to help their cause. They have had the hours of labor reduced, in some trades, from fourteen to eight, and many other innovations equally as important to the welfare of their members. They claim that through this effort for their betterment the Church has never sympathized with them."

Why has the Church never sympathized with the labor unions in their efforts to shorten the hours of daily toil? Why have the preachers not agitated for reform in this direction in the interests of the laboring classes? The preachers and religious societies want Sunday laws in order (so they say) that the laboring man may have a chance to rest from his weekly toil. But does he not need any chance to rest till it comes Sunday? Is his physical welfare to be conserved entirely by what he can get on Sunday?

The workingmen themselves are the best judges of their own physical needs; and the fact that the labor unions have paid little or no attention to the question of Sunday rest, while making an earnest fight for a shorter day of work and "many other innovations equally as important," shows conclusively that they have not deemed Sunday rest a matter which demands their serious attention. On the other hand, the fact that the preachers and church societies have sought the physical welfare of the workingmen only through Sunday, shows with equal conclusiveness that not the workingman, but Sunday, is the object of their special concern.

More can be gained in the direction of providing work for the unemployed by shortening the day of work, than by shortening the week of work. But who ever heard of a ministerial crusade in favor of an eight-hour day, or of any of the other "innovations" of which Mr. Enright's letter speaks? As that authority states, the truth is that in these efforts for their betterment, "the Church has never sympathized with them."

Why will not the advocates of Sunday laws be candid enough to admit that their real purpose is the exaltation of Sunday, rather than the conferring of an unasked benefit upon the ranks of labor? They have nothing to lose by being frank.
