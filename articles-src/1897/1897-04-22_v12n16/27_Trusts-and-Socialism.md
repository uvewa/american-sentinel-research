Much comment has been caused in political and business circles by Senator Chandler's bill, recently introduced in Congress, proposing that the Government take possession of the plant of the Bethlehem and Carnegie steel armor "trust," and operate it until enough armor has been provided for the Government battleships now in process of construction. The occasion of this bill was the refusal of the "trust" to furnish armor to the Government except on exorbitant terms. How the spirit exemplified in the trusts and that in the proposed remedy as well are working away from that individualism which is the foundation of republican government, is set forth in the following from a leading daily of this city:—

"These trusts delight the true socialist. To him they are gratifying proof that unrestrained individualism is by evolution working toward collectivism. The concentration of capital made possible by the improved means of production, communication and transportation, and which results in trusts, the socialist regards as a movement altogether desirable. What he wishes for, what he expects, is that when the business of the country shall come under the control of a few great trusts the Government will step in and substitute itself for the individuals in enjoyment of the monopolies. Then we should have the Government as the only capitalist, the only employer, and the cooperative commonwealth, the dream of the socialist, would be realized.

"Of course there is nothing of which the Rockefellers and Carnegies and Huntingtons disapprove so heartily as socialism. . . . It will strike the millionaires of the trusts and their servitors as grotesque to accuse them of being socialists, yet the professed socialists recognize in them, if not brothers in purpose, then instrumentalities immensely potent for the breaking down of our competitive civilization.

"Senator Chandler, also, will be astonished, and vastly amused, too, perhaps, to find himself classed as a socialist. But, whether he knows it or not, he is really fulfilling socialistic prophecy."

"If the trusts are not too dull to perceive the significance of this Chandler bill they will mend their ways, moderate their appetites and not provoke the people to applaud a proposal which may readily be extended in its application to trusts other than the greedy and defiant, if strictly businesslike, armor combine."

But it is entirely too much to expect that the trusts will moderate their ways because of popular indignation or that the spirit which is separating the Government from the principles of individualism, will stop short of the political despotism which has always been its goal in the past.
