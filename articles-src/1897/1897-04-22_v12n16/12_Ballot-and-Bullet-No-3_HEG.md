BY H. E. GIDDINGS.

It is evident that if governmental power is derived from the people, who govern through their chosen agents the government can exercise no power except that delegated by the people, and as the people can delegate no power but what they possess, it follows that every one thus contributing to this general fund of power, in the nature of the case, not only claims to possess the power and the right to commission others to use it, but pledges himself to come with that power when called upon to repel invasion or to suppress insurrection, even to taking the life of his enemies.

The Christian must be Christlike. Christ was set forth as an example to us. When he was reviled, he reviled not again; when he suffered he threatened not, but committed himself to Him that judge is right to plebe. 1 Pet. 2:23.

At a time when Jesus was travelling through the country the people refused to open their doors and invite him in, and two of the disciples said, Lord, wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven and consume them? Jesus rebuked them, saying, "Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of; for the Son of man is not come to destroy men's lives, but to save them." Luke 9:52–56.

"As he is so are we in this world." 1 John 4:17. "Thou shalt not kill." "Put up thy sword, for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword." Matt. 26:52. In this Christ denied to his children the power or right of the sword. What right, then, have they to claim that power and delegate it to others to be used, when they are forbidden to use it themselves. Indeed, this is a virtual use of it themselves, only in an indirect way.

Now the civil government has the right to use the sword. Rom. 13:4. "For he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil."

This spirit that wields the sword is not the spirit of Christ. Suppose that a community of true Christians, with the spirit of true love to all men, even their enemies, were to organize a government, where would they get the power or the wrath to wield the sword? When an enemy marched against them they would go out and pray for them, and when they needed provision the Christian government must feed them. "If thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink." How could they fight? But the apostle says, "Let every soul be subject to the higher powers." Rom. 13:1.

Yes; and that is as far as the Christian is licensed to go in civil affairs. He should be the very best of subjects and be easily governed, but never assume the responsibility of governing others, or what is the same in a free government, become a sovereign element, a political citizen.

The Christian should not do anything to detract from the divine institution of civil order and its importance among men. He should never oppose any of the proper measures of government; he pays the tribute; constantly recognizing the sovereignty of civil government, in the affairs of this world; and at the same time protests solemnly against its invasion of the things of God.

The powers that behave a commission, and that is to keep the vicious from outward acts which would jeopardize the interests of society. The instrumentality to accomplish this end is the sword.

The Church of Christ has entirely another work—the revelation of Christ to the wicked world in both precept and example, and resounding the invitation, "Come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden [with sin and sorrow and evil passions] and I will give you rest," by sending the Holy Spirit into your heart to subdue all your iniquities. Matt. 11:28; Micah 7:19; making you the most peaceable of subjects to all rightful authority.

With this divine principle as the motive power in the heart no conflict or controversy could ever occur between the Christian and the civil government, so long as the latter contents itself with its own line of work, civil affairs.

The man of the world can be a good citizen by the proper exercise of sovereignty in things of this life, in civil conduct only.

The Christian, by devoting his talents to the things of eternal life and the world to come, things which make for peace, will be the most harmless and least troublesome subject; but cannot be a sovereign here while acting as an ambassador of his sovereign; and while he is a pilgrim and a stranger in the land.

Let the State fulfill its grand and important sphere. Let the Church pursue her humble mission. Then each will be at peace with the other.
