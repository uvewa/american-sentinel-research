At the New York Conference of the M. E. Church at Sing Sing, which closed April 13, some interesting facts were disclosed which throw light upon the controversy over the building of a Roman Catholic chapel on the Government reservation at West Point.

These facts came out in connection with the presentation of the following resolution, by the Rev. Thomas S. Bond:—

"On March 3, 1897, the Honorable Secretary of War granted permission for the erection of a Roman Catholic church on the Government reservation at West Point, such permission being contrary to the well-established principles of our Government, which, while assuring religious freedom to all, forbids sectarian discrimination and national patronage of any distinctive form of religious faith and practice, and we, the members of the New York Annual Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church, most respectfully protest against such action and respectfully request the Secretary of War to rescind the order granting such a permission.

"Resolved, That aforesaid protest, signed by the officers of this body, be forwarded to His Excellency the President, to the Honorable Secretary of War and to the Chairman of the Committee on Military Affairs of the United States Senate."

While this was under discussion the Rev. J. P. Hermance arose and said that the Methodist Episcopal Church had vainly sought the privilege of building a church at West Point, and had been refused for the reason that if such permission were given one denomination it would have to be given to all. Bishop Stephen M. Merrill followed, saying that he was very sorry to hear that the Methodist Episcopal Church had set a bad example, and that the Roman Catholics were only following that example.

A protest that is based upon jealousy has small claim to consideration. It is a pity that Protestants cannot oppose the encroachments of Rome without being logically estopped by their own example from protesting.
