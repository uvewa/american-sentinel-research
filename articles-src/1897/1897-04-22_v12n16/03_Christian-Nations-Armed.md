A New York paper, making note of the fact that on April 14 "many thousands of New Yorkers crowded certain streets of the metropolis, at some risk to life and limb, to welcome, cheer and honor a fellow-being who had just arrived and whose sole claim to distinction is that he is not so far removed from the gorilla as most of us are," gives an explanation for the phenomenon in the following:

"While every Christian nation in Europe goes armed to the teeth like a border desperado, and in its policies pays no more regard to the precepts of Christ than if he had never lived and taught, is it really so very odd that an individual fighter of genius should not encounter abhorrence only when he enters the chief city of the United States?"

The truth is that the very "Christianity" of most people to-day is of a fighting character. But for all this it is no less true that real Christianity means peace.
