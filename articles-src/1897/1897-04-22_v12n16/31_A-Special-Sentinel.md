The American Sentinel of April 29 will contain matter of a character to entitle it to a very large circulation. The first article, by A. T. Jones, will be a reply to the charge of sedition made against the American Sentinel. This article will show that the enemies of the American principle of separation of Church and State are really the ones guilty of sedition.

Another article entitled "Murder and the Millennium" will present the awful increase in the murder record of the country, notwithstanding the majority of church leaders declare that the world is growing better. This article will show that while the Church is devoting its time to fighting crime instead of sin, crime is increasing.

A third article entitled "General Grant and Religious Liberty," will present the clear utterances of this great statesman on separation of Church and State. This article will be illustrated with a fine cut of General Grant, and another of the new tomb which will be dedicated April 27, an event of international interest.

Steps should be taken to sell this number on the street and from house to house. This issue will contain at least six appropriate illustrations.

Extra copies can be secured by addressing your State Tract Society, or the Sentinel direct, at the usual price, $1.00 per hundred, $8.00 per thousand.
