But there is very much in the world which passes for goodness that is not goodness. The young man who came to Christ thought that he was good. He made a show of goodness in his life; and being outwardly a keeper of the commandments, he no doubt passed—and would pass in this day—for a good man. But his goodness was spurious, and only involved him in ruin at last.

God alone is good; and "God is love." Therefore there can be no goodness apart from love. The young ruler thought he was a good man, but he failed on the test of love. He was not willing to use his riches for the benefit of his fellowmen.

"Good citizenship" and "Christian citizenship" aim to "purify politics,"—to put goodness in the place of evil, in politics. But what kind of "goodness" will it be which will thus be put into politics? Will it be genuine goodness, which is from God alone, or will it be a counterfeit? As certainly as it is a counterfeit, it will involve in ruin all that which depends upon it.

And it is no small thing which is made to depend upon the success of the "Good Citizenship" movement. It is proposed to accomplish by it great things, even to evolve a government in which "Christ and His law" will be the "supreme authority in national as in individual life" (See p. 250). It is proposed by it to usher in the millennium and set up the kingdom of Christ on the earth. If the scheme fails, therefore, what will be the result? What less than the spiritual bankruptcy of all who shall have reared the edifice of their spiritual hopes upon it?

Love is the test of goodness. Will the goodness of "Good Citizenship" stand this test? Will this test be applied to it? Can it be applied by any method of political procedure?

"Love is of God," and "without faith it is impossible to please Him." Faith is the link which connects the soul with God. There can be no real goodness without love, no real love without faith. Does "Good Citizenship" operate through faith? Is faith a method of political action?

Human conduct can be purified only through faith in the Word of God? Nothing that is shaped by human conduct can be good or pure apart from the power of God through faith. And faith cannot enter into politics.

Politics is of this world. It has no connection with "Christ and His law," or with the kingdom of God. It cannot bring "a clean thing out of an unclean." It can prove only a deception to those who trust in it for good.
