The Bible doctrine of Christian unity knows nothing of the word "confederation." Christians are not confederated with God or with each other, though Christianity. "As thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us;" "I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one," expresses the mind of Jesus Christ upon this subject. John 17:21, 23. This alone is Christian unity.
