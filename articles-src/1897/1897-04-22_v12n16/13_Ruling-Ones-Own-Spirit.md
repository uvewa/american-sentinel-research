It was recorded by Solomon that he that ruleth his own spirit is greater than he that taketh a city; and the truthfulness of the utterance is demonstrated on every hand. The number of "bosses," dictators and popes in the world to-day is directly attributable to the fact that people generally are more willing to be ruled than to take the trouble to rule themselves.
