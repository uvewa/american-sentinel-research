The New York Independent, of April 1st, devotes nearly five pages to the subject of "Federation of Young People's Societies." These articles were furnished by officials of the several young people's societies. Dr. Carroll, of the Independent, closes his article introducing the subject with the following:—

"As a matter of interest, I give herewith the number of members of the various young people's societies in the United States, according to the latest reports:—

"Societies.
"Christian Endeavor Societies (40 Churches)...2,162,000
"Epworth League, Methodist Episcopal Church 1,500,000
" " " " South...150,000
"Baptist Young People's Union...400,000
"Young People's Christian Union, United Brethren 75,000
"Luther League, Lutheran...60,000
"Young People's Christian Union, United Presbyterian...35,146
"Young People's Christian Union, Associate Ref...2,223
" " " " Alliance, Ev. Assoc...30,407

"Total members...4,414,776

"Return from the Westminster League, which has, I believe, no national organization as yet, would doubtless swell the total to something like 4,500,000."

From the articles in the Independent it appears that earnest efforts have been made to unite all these societies under one organization, but the spirit of unity was lacking and their efforts failed. In the absence of Christian unity sufficient to effectual spiritual unity, it is now proposed to organize a gigantic federation of all young people's societies. That the reader may understand the motions actuating this scheme of federation, we quote from one of the articles from the pen of a trustee of the United Society of Christian Endeavor:—

"Federation is the next step forward in the Young People's movement. It is logical and providential. The uprising of the young people is the most significant fact in the history of modern Christendom—the twenty-ninth chapter of the Book of the Acts. Its import is far reaching."

"The importance of Federation as facing social problems cannot be exaggerated. The present exigency is putting an emphasis on problems sociological more than theological. Cooperation not as a sentiment but as a power, is demanded. Combine the moral forces of the community and there is no evil that you cannot crush. Combine we must."

"When the power of the whole Church is felt behind every church, when all the moral forces are coordinated, then it may lift up its head for its redemption draweth nigh.

"Take the Sunday question, which at this moment is paramount. While the Church is relaxing its regard for the sacred day, a conservative influence is coming from the workingman. . . . Facing outward toward all such questions, Federation grows immensely important."

With this gigantic Federation whose very existence is the result of the lack of Christian unity and therefore the lack of Christ, it is now proposed to crush all evil. With this confederacy it is proposed to save the Sunday-sabbath. "While the Church [professing to be organized by Christ with a union as close as the Father and Son] is relaxing its regard for the sacred day," it is proposed to save it with a confederacy which has its origin in the lack of this union.

Against all such confederacies the Lord warns us by the prophet Isaiah, thus:—

"For the Lord spake thus to me with a strong hand, and instructed me that I should not walk in the way of this people, saying, Say ye not, A confederacy, to all them to whom this people shall say, A confederacy; neither fear ye their fear, nor be afraid. Sanctify the Lord of hosts himself; and let him be your fear, and let him be your dread."

What the Church and the young people's societies need is the unity which results from the sanctifying power of the Holy Spirit upon the heart, and not the empty substitute, federation.
