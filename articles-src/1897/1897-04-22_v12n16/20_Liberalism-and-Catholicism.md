THERE has lately been running in the *Katholische Volks Zeitung*, a German Catholic paper published in Baltimore, a remarkable series of articles, purporting to be from the pen of the president of the new Catholic University in Washington City. There was a report that the president had disavowed responsibility for the views expressed in his name, but this seemed an improbable statement, in view of the standing of the newspaper and the well known high character of its publishers and proprietors. Now comes an interview with the president in which he frankly acknowledges the authorship of the papers and insists that they contain not merely his own personal opinions, but the very essence of true Catholicity. In consequence, they assume great importance and deserve the close attention of all thoughtful Protestants as well as Catholics.

THE articles are cast in the form of a dialogue, supposed to take place between a good Catholic and his duly authorized spiritual adviser. They deal with that curious phase of ecclesiastical controversy which has arisen from the growth of "liberalism" in the American Roman Catholic Church, which brought Satolli to the United States, and drove Bishop Keane from Washington to Rome. The Catholic layman, of course, is a mere "figure head," corresponding, for the purpose in hand, to the big bag that the pugilists hang up to "punch" for the exercise. It is a classical idea, and in skilful hands, like the present, it is a very effective way of writing.

THE layman in question, you understand, has a rather pronounced inclination towards the "liberal" school, and he wants to know if he may not legitimately follow its way, and if not, why not. At the same time he is prepared to yield his private judgment to the better wisdom of his professional guide, philosopher and friend, and he is just in the state of mind which enables him to ask the questions best adapted to bring out the latter's strongest points in reply, and to recognize their force when they are put before him. The result is foregone and he seems perfectly convinced of his error in every number of the paper, though he always comes back for more of the same sort in the next issue.

THE *gist* of the instruction which this anxious inquirer receives, is that "liberalism" is merely a form of heresy in the Catholic theology; that Leo XIII., so far from feeling kindly disposed towards the new "movement," is violently antagonistic to it, and has said so more than once; that, in short, no one can be a Catholic and a liberal in religion at the same time. Condemnation, in no halting or equivocal phrase, is put upon all Catholics who pretend the contrary.

IT seems to me that the learned president is correct. There are only two principles affecting religious belief—the principle of authority and the principle of private judgment. Between the two appears no middle ground. Catholicism stands for the first. It is her very foundation-stone, the cause, the excuse, the essence, the mission of her organization. Protestantism stands, or ought to stand, for the very opposite. The contest between the two for the mastery of the human mind can never, under the immutable laws of thought, be compromised, or settled, until the church Militant shall pass into the church Triumphant.

THIS is not to say that there are no liberal Catholics. If avowal counts for anything, I have known such in the priesthood itself. But the point is, that these people are liberal in spite of their church, and not because of it or even in harmony with its faith and spirit. To the extent of their liberality they are Protestants. Their position is a protest against the church's teaching and tendency, even though they may not be conscious of the fact. The president of the Catholic University evidently does not intend to be numbered among the church's protestors against intolerance and bigotry. His position is perfectly logical and perfectly consistent. The only wonder is that any one in his church should differ from him.
