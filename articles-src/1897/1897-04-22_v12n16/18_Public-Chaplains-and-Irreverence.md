Of course the maintenance of public chaplains in army and navy, and in legislative halls, is a survival of the union of Church and State which alleged Christian bishops and the pagan Constantine set up in the Master's despite. The thing is, perhaps, a small matter, politically speaking, though it is serious enough to one who sees blasphemy in its conception and its execution. But when you start wrong, there is no telling where you will ultimately land. And there are times when the wrong starting of this official chaplainship results in manifestations so grotesque that one may fairly hope, by calling attention to them, to arouse some minds now ignorant or disregarded of the essential evil of the whole business, and thus to discredit it, and help along, however little, the good work of its final abolition.

The latest gentleman to bring discredit on the employment of public chaplains is a clergyman of Little Rock, Ark. It so happened that on the day before he was called upon to exercise his official functions in the presence of the legislature of that State, one William Jennings Bryan arrived in the capital city. The preacher informed his Creator of this important occurrence, and also notified him that the town was "all astir" in consequence thereof; he then proceeded to deal with the reputation of his man, and communicated to the same Being the fact that many persons were under the impression that Mr. Bryan could travel more miles on the railway and make more speeches in a given time than any other citizen of the United States. He went into a number of biographical details concerning his subject, and served notice in advance that all proper arrangements had been made for the entertainment of Little Rock's distinguished guest, presumably in order, that Deity might understand that He need give Himself no uneasiness on this point.

Now, this is by no means a unique case. Similar irreverent utterances are made at nearly every session of a State legislature, and of the Federal Congress. And the pitifulness of it is that they are often made in perfect sincerity, and without the slightest idea of committing any impropriety or doing an act of irreverence—and made, too, by clergymen whose business it is not merely to be humble and reverent themselves before the Throne, but, by example, as well as precept, to teach the lessons of humility and awe to other people. Perhaps the clergymen themselves are, after all, not so much to blame. The real root of the matter lies in their position. The Catholic clergy come out of it best, because they have a fixed form of words which they repeat by rote, and those words, be it said with all respect and good will, embody "glittering generalities," which any man may believe are useless or profitable, but which, at any rate, never prove offensive to good taste or suggest the idea that the speaker is praying at his hearers, instead of praying to Deity.

On the other hand, however, nature seems hardly equal to the task of offering anything in the way of an extemporaneous official State prayer which is not more or less a speech to the audience, thinly and poorly disdisguised. And this for a very good and sufficient reason. Prayer is not a matter of State concern; prayer cannot, from its nature, be offered up in an official capacity; prayer cannot be made for an official body, an ideal, legal entity, like a legislature or an army or the Federal Congress. Hence the hired clergy of the State simply undertake a task too great for them or anybody else, and they uniformly blunder over it and bring the scorn and contempt of scoffers on the most serious and solemn function connected with the religious life.
