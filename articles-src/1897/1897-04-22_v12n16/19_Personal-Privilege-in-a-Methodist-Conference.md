A clergyman, of the Methodist Conference, lately in session at Winfield, Kansas, "rose to a question of personal privilege," according to the dispatches, during one of the debates in that body. I suppose he must have said that that was the thing to which he "rose," or the newspaper reporters would not have made use of the expression. But it would be very interesting to know just what the reverend gentleman himself understands by "a question of personal privilege," and what the presiding officer of the conference who, it appears, did not call him to order for his language, considers to be the proper meaning of that well-known Parliamentary phrase. Ordinary people imagine that when a man "rises to a question of personal privilege" in a deliberative body, he is, strictly speaking, "out of order," in the sense that what he has to say is not directly connected with the matter then under discussion, but that he is "privileged" to say it, because of its personal relation to himself, and because, otherwise, his conduct or motives might be unjustly impugned.

But this clergyman, his "monitor" and his conference evidently adhere to no such definition. The "personal privilege" to which the bishop arose, and which he was seemingly allowed to exercise without remonstrance or objection from any quarter, consisted in a particularly virulent personal attack on ex-Senator Ingalls for reporting the recent prize fight at Carson City. In the course of availing himself of this "personal privilege," the reverend gentleman charged the distinguished ex-Senator with "prostituting" his intellect, denounced the "ruffian spirit" of Mrs. Fitzsimmons, and branded Mr. Ingalls as a liar. This attack has provoked the caustic Mr. Ingalls to express to the preacher his hope that he has been incorrectly quoted by the press, because, says the ex-Senator, "I should regret to be compelled to believe that Carson has a higher code of ethics than Winfield, or that a pugilist may have better manners than a clergyman."

THE retort seems well-deserved. There are too many clerics who take advantage of their cloth to indulge in language which, it used by a layman, would very likely be followed by a blow. This is, however, not always deliberately done. It is often merely an effect, not fully appreciated, of long impunity and of constant associations with others similarly circumstanced.
