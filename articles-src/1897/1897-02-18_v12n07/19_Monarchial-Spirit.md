SPEAKING of the Senate's amendments to the proposed arbitration treaty, the New York Herald of February 4, says:—

"We all remember the instantaneous and decisive effect of Mr. Olney's manifesto on the question of recognizing belligerency or independence. He told the Senate they had nothing to do with it; that recognition was a purely Executive function, and that the Executive would not relinquish it. There was some senatorial spluttering for a few days. Then it was clearly seen and universally admitted that Mr. Olney was right, and the swagger about his 'defiance of Congress' subsided. In the matter of ratification, the constitutional right of the Senate is, of course, beyond dispute, and nobody disputes it. But what the President and Secretary of State can do is to compel the Senate to choose between ratification and rejection."

This is the language of that monarchial spirit whose growth in the United States constitutes a significant sign of the times.
