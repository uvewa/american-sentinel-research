The principle upon which the so-called Reform Bureau in Washington, is established, is shown in the following statement by Rev. W. F. Crafts, who presides over its functions:—

"A minister interested in a pending reform bill which The Reform Bureau is promoting, said to the writer: 'It seems as if Congressmen themselves ought to do the work which is done by the Bureau.' This doubtless common thought is due to a common failure to recognize the significance of the word 'representative' as applied to legislators. The Sovereign is the people. At the ballot box the people convey to their 'representative' in the active duties of government their wishes as to currency or tariff or both. On the other more numerous and to Christian citizens more important subjects of legislation, 'representatives' must get information as to what the sovereign people want through the lobby, of which the post-office is an extension."

How very gratifying it must be to Congressmen to know that they have such an easy access to the minds of the people—for of course the vast majority of American citizens make use of this Reform Bureau to communicate their will to Congress!

We had always thought that Congressmen were supposed to have some minds of their own, and were sufficiently well acquainted with the needs of the country and the elements of proper legislation, to be allowed to proceed in the main as their own judgment may direct. But this is because we have never looked at the matter from the standpoint of a "Christian lobbyist."
