One cannot but remark that when one of our American journalists describes the atrocities practised by the Kurd or the Turk upon the Armenians, he is careful to preface the words "Kurd" or "Turk" with the word "Mohammedan," and the word "Armenian" with the word "Christian." But when the same writers describe the cruelties practised by one people upon another, where both are professedly Christian, they drop those words out of their vocabulary. The following from an editorial in the *Inter Ocean* will illustrate the point:

"Cruelties not excelled by those of the Mohammedan Turk upon the hapless Armenian Christian have been perpetrated upon the Cuban by the Spaniard."

Why this sudden transition in the use of descriptive words, in so short a sentence? Why not give the cruel Spaniard the benefit of being Christian, as well as the cruel Turk the name of being Mohammedan? Or why not qualify the rebellious Cuban with the designation of Christian as well as the equally rebellious Armenien? There can be but one reason: It would be a great shock to the feelings of Christians to designate a Christian as a murderer; but the thought of a Mohammedan murderer gives them a very complacent and self-satisfied feeling.

But, really, where is the difference? Is a Christian(?) murderer any better than a Mohammedan murderer? And if it is proper to describe a murderer by telling what religion he professes, why not serve the murderers of all religions equally alike? Probably General Weyler is far more responsible for the atrocities perpetrated upon the Cubans before his eyes, than the Sultan of Turkey is for things done in remote parts of his empire by men over whom he never at the best exercised much control. Yet this will not be charged to Weyler's religion.

The fact is, human passions, when once aroused, know no religion. The fanatical Mohammedan who can, as a poet has expressed it,

"Pause and kneel unshod,
In the fresh blood his hand hath poured,
To mutter oe'r some text of God
Engraven on his reeking sword"—

has the same kind of religion that the inquisitors of Rome had, the same religion that the Duke of Alva and bloody Claverhouse had—the religion of a debased human nature, inflamed, to be sure, with religious prejudices. And when an American citizen, like a man trying to shoot a partridge, creeps around on Sunday, to destroy some one setting out tomato plants, or husking corn, that he may have him arrested, fined, and imprisoned, he has enough of this same religion of human nature easily to justify one in placing him in the same class. This religion of human nature is widespread. It may hide under some other name—even the name of Christianity—but it is always the same and is very easily detected.
