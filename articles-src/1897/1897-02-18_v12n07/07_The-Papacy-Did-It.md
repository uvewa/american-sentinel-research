The Papacy is never loth to admit that she changed the Sabbath from the seventh to the first day of the week, and to claim Sunday as a Catholic day. The latest on this point is this from the Western Watchman, of January 21:—

"The Rabbi Hirch, of Chicago, advises his co-religionists to give up the seventh-day Jewish Sabbath and take up the first day, Catholic Sunday. But he gives a very poor reason for the change when he says, 'we are in America and not in Judea.' He should have said, 'The Catholic Church has ordered the change, and her word is law for all men who want to save their souls.'"

Of course there was no real change of the Sabbath day; but Rome's claim of such a change has been recognized in the opinions and practices of the people. The expression "Catholic Sunday" is entirely correct.
