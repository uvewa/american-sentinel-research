The State of New York has got itself into a queer predicament. In the new constitution adopted two years ago, there is a provision prohibiting convicts from being employed in any kind of labor the product of which would compete in the public market with the product of labor outside of the prisons.

The consequence is that there are now in the prisons of the State thousands of men who are forced to remain in absolute idleness. The result of this enforced idleness is that the men are growing desperate and are fighting and trying to kill one another, or are becoming insane, and are trying to kill themselves. They beg piteously for work of any kind, only that they be allowed to employ themselves.

In an endeavor to relieve the horrors of the situation, it has been proposed that the prisoners be employed in the manufacture of such things as must be used in the service of the State itself, and which the State would be obliged to buy. This would give the needed employment to the convicts, and would be only supplying the things that the State must have anyhow.

Among the things that would be thus supplied were the uniforms of the State troops or national guard. It was decided by the State authorities to manufacture these. But as soon as this was learned by the troops, it was resented, "there was general indignation," and they threatened to mutiny rather than to wear any such clothing.

What the outcome of this particular phase of the difficulty has been, or will be, we do not know. But even though the issue were not raised, and the troops were content to wear the clothing so made, by the principle upon which the constitutional provision was established, we do not see how this plan could be allowed to be carried out.

The purpose of the constitutional provision is to prevent prison products from coming into competition with the product of outside labor. It is therefore forbidden to offer in the public market the products of prison labor. This, in order that the outside general laborer may not be in danger of losing the due return for his labor, by being obliged to stand the competition of convict labor.

Yet this same thing is done when the convict labor supplies all the needs of the State; for then the State gets for practically nothing what otherwise it would be obliged to buy in open market at a fair price. Certainly, therefore, this would diminish to that extent the sale of the product of outside general labor; and is in competition with outside labor, as really as though the product of convict labor were allowed to go on the regular market.

Therefore it is plain that even though the troops were content to wear the prison-made clothing, the principle of this constitutional provision would not allow the element that secured its adoption, to suffer this plan to be carried out; because in this way the very purpose of the constitutional provision is frustrated just so far as the proposed plan should be applied.

It is therefore perfectly plain that under that provision of the Constitution of the State of New York, the only thing that can be done with the State convicts is to keep them in absolute idleness. For it is impossible to have them employed at any work without competing with workers outside whose occupation is at the same kind of work whatever it may be.

But that alternative forces the prisoners into the position where they are the prey of evils to which death is preferable, and which when they cannot end in suicide, culminate in insanity. Surely, then, it is plain enough that there is but one thing to do with that provision of the Constitution—that is, to wipe it out at the earliest possible moment.

This, however, would be plain enough, even though there was none of this evil brought upon the prisoners. It would be plain enough, even though it were a benefit instead of an injury to the convicts. Let us leave out all the present situation, and look at the principle as it is in the beginning.

There are thousands of men in prison, who, while they are kept there, must be fed and clothed. There is no escaping that. And this is a great expense to the State. Now the question is, Shall the State bear all this expense itself, or shall it cause the convicts themselves to bear it by employing them in such a way that their labor shall pay the expense of keeping them? In other words, Shall they support themselves and so cost the State nothing, or shall the State support them at great expense? This provision of the Constitution says in substance that the State shall support them at great expense, while they do nothing.

It is true that the claim is that this is necessary and right "to protect the interests of labor." But there is precisely where lies the fallacy of the whole question. The interests of labor are not in any sense protected by this scheme.

Look at it. What is the State of New York? It is simply the people who inhabit the territory that composes, physically, what is known by metes and bounds or on a map as the State of New York.

Where does the State of New York get the money that must be had to pay for the keeping of these thousands of prisoners?—Only from the people in this territory, by taxation. There is no other possible source from which this money can be derived.

Then the naked question is, Shall you and I put our hands in our pockets and pay out honest and hard-earned money to keep in idleness thousands of criminals of all sorts? or shall we have them work and so pay for their own keeping?

It will not do for the laboring man to indulge the thought, that it is only the corporations, the capitalists, and the business men generally, who pay the taxes; and that therefore it is they and not the laboring men who support these convicts. This is not true in fact.

It may be indeed that not one laboring man in a thousand, ever sees a tax receipt of his own. But he is not for a moment to conclude from this that he never pays any taxes. The fact is that he is paying taxes in every cent he spends. When the State expenses increase the taxation must be increased. And when the merchant, the grocer, and the property holder pays increased taxes, this is carried to his expense account and is recovered in the increased price of something that the laboring man, as well as other people has to buy, whether it be house-rent, a hat, a suit of clothes, a pair of overalls, shoes, soap, or what not. So the truth is that if there is any set of men more than another who really pay the taxes, it is the laboring men, though they never formally pay any taxes at all.

Thus, if there is any set of men more than another who are paying the vast expense of keeping in idleness the thousands of criminals in the prisons of the State of New York, it is the laboring men of the State of New York. Yet this provision of the Constitution was inserted to satisfy the contention of the "labor" element and professedly in the interests of the laboring man. It is plain enough, however, that those who did it never thought three steps on the principles involved. That provision of the Constitution is the formulation of an utterly selfish and surface view of things. And in the attempt to remedy a single fancied inequality, a number of real evils are generated which can only grow greater the longer the thing is continued.
