An attempt is being made to revive in Illinois, a compulsory education law similar to the one that caused so much trouble there and in Wisconsin a few years ago. The author of this new trouble is Mrs. M. J. Flower, of Chicago.

Like the former law, this one invades the rights of private and parochial schools. It declares that "no private or parochial school shall be deemed a school within the meaning of this act unless the school files with the superintendent of public instruction, prior to September 1, of each year, the course of study that shall be pursued during the ensuing year, the course to include all the elementary branches and the English language."

If such a thing as this shall be allowed to prevail, it will be but another step to where there will be nothing that will be considered private—not even the family circle. It is probable though that the meddlers will never cease. We hope that all who have private or parochial schools will be awake to this evil thing as they were to the other and thoroughly kill this as they did that.
