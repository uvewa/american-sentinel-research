"Liberty," Toronto, Ont.

An interesting case has recently been heard before the Court of Appeals in this city. Justice Rose decided some time ago that the running of street-cars on a Sunday was not a violation of the Lord's Day Act. An appeal was made from this decision by the attorney-general of the province.

Of course the question could not be discussed upon its merits, as it was simply a decision, as to whether the terms of the Lord's day Act were such as to prohibit the cars from running. Some of the arguments presented by the prosecution were decidedly unique. Among other things it was argued that a "traveller" was not a person going from one part of the city to another in a streetcar. That "conveying traveler" was something different from "carrying passengers."

The question discussed was not, "Is it right?" but "Is it according to law?" The decision of the judges will probably not be given for several weeks yet.

We would gather from this action of the Union that, among other things, they considered good citizenship to consist in a strict observance of Sunday; and that good citizenship work consists in setting spies (good Christians, I suppose) to watch those who congregate at the parks on Sunday to see that they do not desecrate the Sabbath!

If those who visit the park on Sunday indulge in incivilities, or what would be considered such on other days of the week, they should be prohibited, of course; but if this good citizenship committee is so much taken up with its own affairs during the six days of work that they will permit then what they prohibit on Sunday, simply because they consider it to be Sabbath desecration, the committee would better be discharged. Their work is neither good citizenship nor good Christianity.
