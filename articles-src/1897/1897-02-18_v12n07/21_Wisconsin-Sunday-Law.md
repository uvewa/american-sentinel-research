A BILL is before the Wisconsin Legislature to repeal the Sunday law of that State. On the other hand, an agitation for stricter Sunday observance has been begun by the Christian Endeavor forces, who are pledging themselves to abstain from all Sunday trading, reading of Sunday papers, bicycle riding for business or pleasure, and also to call for the closing of post-offices on Sunday, and for a more rigid enforcement of the Sunday law.
