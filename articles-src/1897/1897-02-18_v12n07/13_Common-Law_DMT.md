In view of the obiter dicta of the Supreme Court of the United States in the Trinity Church decision of Feb. 29, 1892, viz., "that the Christian religion is a part of the 'common law' of Pennsylvania," and that "if we pass beyond these matters to a view of American life, . . . we find everywhere a clear recognition of the same truth," it is well to review this statement and to ascertain what the "common law" referred to is, and what bearing it has upon the correctness or incorrectness of that decision.

The great Lord Mansfield defines "law as nothing else than reason modified by custom and authority." Hence every law is composed of two elements—the rational and the historical. All systems of law are agreed in their principles or "rational element," and differ only in the peculiar national modifications, or as they might be termed the "historical element."

The Roman lawyers recognized these differences under the terms "jus civile" and "jus gentium," or "jus naturale." In the Institutes of Justinian we find this statement:—

"Every people ruled by laws and customs (*legibus et moribus*) uses partly its own peculiar law and partly a law common to all men; for that law or part of the law which each people has established for itself is peculiar to the State and is called the 'jus civile' as belonging peculiarly to the State; but that law which natural reason has established among all men is observed generally among all peoples, and is called the 'jus gentium' as being the law which all nations use." (Inst. III.)

Aristotle also recognized the same distinction under the terms *nomos idios* or peculiar law and the *nomos koinos* or common law. He defines the *nomos koinos* as "the unwritten rules which appear to be recognized among all men," and also as "that which is conformable merely to the dictates of Nature." Coke, the English jurist, agrees with this definition in saying that "the common law of England rests not upon the arbitrary will of man but upon that law which God at the time of the creation of the nature of man, infused into his heart, for his preservation and direction."

Blackstone, in the introduction to his Commentaries, calls this law "the law of nature," and of it says:—

"It is binding over all the globe, in all countries and at all times. No human laws are of any validity if contrary to this; and such of them as are valid derive all their authority, mediately or immediately, from this original. . . . Those rights, then, which God and nature have established, and are therefore called natural rights, such as are life and liberty, need not the aid of human laws to be more effectually invested in every man than they are."

Lord Chief Justice Hobart declares "that even an Act of Parliament made against natural justice . . . is void of itself; for *jura natura sunt immutabilia* [the rights of nature are immutable], and they are *leges legum* [the laws of laws]."

How then did Christianity, in opposition to the teachings of God's word and recognized legal authorities, ever become recognized by English and American jurists? We find that by a mistranslation from the Norman-French into English of the arguments of Prisot (A. D. 1458) in one case, and by the subsequent citation of that argument, it has been almost unquestioningly accepted by both English and American jurists ("American State Papers," pp. 127–138).

It is a sorrowful fact that the legal profession of both England and America have neglected the exercise of independent reason in the judging of decisions. The faculty of understanding the principles of the common law and consequently the application of these principles, is almost lost. In the place of that faculty is substituted the practice of citation of authorities, often very questionable and sometimes even palpably in conflict with the very principles of law. This fact has been especially noticeable of late years in the decisions of the United States Supreme Court.

In this matter history is simply repeating itself. The history of the Roman courts in the time of Justinian reveals a picture very similar. The faculty of weighing principles seems to have been lost and various expedients were resorted to for reaching a decision. Of course, all such expedients failed as all such must fail whether in Rome, England, or America, and injustice and folly became doubly apparent in their decisions. Can we expect anything different now?

It requires but the touch of inspiration to complete the picture:—

"The earth is given into the hand of the wicked: he covereth the faces of the judges thereof." Job 9:24. "Therefore is judgment far from us, neither doth justice overtake us: we wait for light, but behold obscurity; for brightness, but we walk in darkness. . . . And judgment is turned away backward, and justice standeth afar off; for truth is fallen in the street, and equity cannot enter." Isa. 59:9, 14.
