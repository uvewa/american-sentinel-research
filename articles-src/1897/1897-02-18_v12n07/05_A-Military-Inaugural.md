If reports be true, which we have nowhere seen denied, the inauguration ceremonies at Washington on March 4th next, are to present at least one novel and very suggestive feature. That will be the presence of an army of 35,000 troops, giving to the inaugural the air of a military, rather than a civil, proceeding.

Such an occasion will be hardly more suggestive of the democratic simplicity which marked the inaugural of Thomas Jefferson and other presidents of scarcely yet historic times, and which is eminently proper in a government whose officials are supposed to be servants of the people, than is the inauguration of a Russian czar.

The journey of the President-elect to Washington in the palatial, bomb-proof (or as it is said, accident-proof) car which has been specially provided for the trip, and his entry into office with the accompaniment of military pomp and the gleam of bayonets, can but contain a strong flavor of the despotism and militarism which are characteristic of the governments of the Old World.

Nor will this belie their real significance. Militarism and despotism go hand in hand. The love of military display is invariably greatest where there is the greatest love of arbitrary power. That the love of arbitrary power is great in this Republic, and that the lust for and the exercise of such power are rapidly becoming more marked in our national life, no one can well deny. It is only to be expected therefore that there should be an increase of that upon which arbitrary authority depends for its enforcement.

It is significant that the proposed military inaugural seems to excite little or no protest from the people. It would seem that either they have not yet been informed of the fact, or having fallen in with the view recently enunciated by Mr. Cleveland, of the White House, they believe they will "have to accept the situation," and "face the music." The *New York Journal*, however, is an exception, and it says:—

"Nothing betrays the departure we have made from the democratic simplicity of our fathers more than the preparations for a grand military display at the inauguration of President McKinley. It is true enough that the President is Commander-in-Chief of the Army of the United States, but that is a title and a prerogative that have never been obtruded except in time of war. The people prefer to think of him as a civil magistrate, setting the example of democratic simplicity and avoiding anything like pageantry in his public functions. Now for the first time in our history he is to be ushered to his place by an army of thirty-five thousand soldiers. What is there in the simple inaugural ceremony of taking the oath of office that is made more dignified or more representative of our tastes and national faith in surrounding him with bayonets. Some of our . . contemporaries speak of the projected affair with childish enthusiasm, as if indeed the choice of one citizen to execute the will of the rest were an occasion for a European display of militarism.

"Discreet patriots will regret that affairs of national importance are taking this spectacular turn."

We would that all patriots were discreet enough to know why it is that "affairs of national importance" are taking this turn, and what is demanded of them by the situation. The truth is that the Protestant and Republican principles of this Government are fast being repudiated by representatives of the people, and a despotism is surely coming as the result.
