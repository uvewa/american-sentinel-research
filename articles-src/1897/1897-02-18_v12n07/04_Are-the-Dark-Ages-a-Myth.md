The Papacy answers this question in the affirmative. Witness the following from the *Pittsburg Catholic*, of January 28:—

"The 'Dark Ages' is a favorite subject, constantly alluded to and harped on by dissenting friends. It would be a favor could they show us wherein is the superiority of the present day. Are our people more happy? The fact and truth are that we are relatively inferior to the ages when men had minds sound enough to bend proud reason in humble submission to the Church."

It would be better, then, to get back to the conditions of the so-called "Dark Ages" as quickly as possible! This is the principle upon which the Papacy is working; and this is what will certainly be reached when the people are persuaded to bow "in humble submission to the church," be that church papal or Protestant.
