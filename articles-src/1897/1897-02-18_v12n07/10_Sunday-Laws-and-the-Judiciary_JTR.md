TO SUSTAIN SUNDAY LAWS REQUIRES A NON-JUDICIAL FRAME OF MIND IN THE JUDGES.

By James T. Ringgold, of the Baltimore Bar.

The judicial frame of mind requires that a judge in ruling on the constitutionality of a statute shall be governed by the constitution alone, without the slightest reference to the wishes of the people as expressed otherwise than through that instrument.

The people may change the instrument as their will may change; the judge must follow the will as therein laid down. But judges are human, and, like other men, are under the influence of the Zeitgeist, or what appears to them to be such. And the Brownist religious sentiment has been so strenuously busying itself with this question ever since it obtained a foothold here that the Zeitgeist in America has seemed to set against any fair discussion whatever of Sunday laws.

Many persons desire the maintenance of these laws at any cost in the way of suppression or perversion of their fair consideration. And, while the balloting on such questions as Sunday street-cars, etc., has more than once indicated that in an American community of any considerable size, the "Sunday-law-at-any-price" men (whatever may be the case with the women) are a minority of the total population, they are a very large majority of the "fussy," aggressive, meddlesome folk; they make a noise in the world out of all proportion to their real numbers and importance; and so they are too often mistaken for real representatives of the Zeitgeist.

It is also true that among the supporters of Sunday laws are included many of their systematic violators, who are quite sincerely persuaded that they are necessary for other people. But, while it is true that the noise made by the Brownist Sunday-law advocates is out of all proportion to their numbers and importance (it is an old story, "The shallows murmur while the deeps are dumb"), nevertheless, as was said, this noise has its effect, and part of its effect on the minds of our judges is to produce the impression that an overwhelming majority of the people want the Sunday law sustained at any price. And our judges, being human, are thus biased in advance on this question, and caused to hunt up reasons whereby the Sunday law may be sustained, instead of examining its position under the constitution without any bias toward one conclusion rather than another. They are acting by their light as servants of the people, trying to do their will. But they forget that for them the will of the people is not to be gotten from Brownist pulpits nor Brownist newspapers, but from the constitution alone. And they are, therefore, in a non-judicial frame of mind.

Another effect of Brownism on judges as well as legislators is, by associating the Sunday law with a supposed special command of Deity, to throw around it a peculiar halo of sanctity, which prevents its calm and critical examination, like other statutes, upon its merits as a statute exclusively. It is like that old subject of secession which senators and representatives for so many years tacitly agreed should not be mentioned in the halls of Congress, though they "talked all around it," and the people and papers outside openly debated it in every aspect. There is about the idea of "our American Sunday" something of that "sacredness" that certain statesmen used to ascribe to "the Union." To impeach the eternal verity of the Sunday law or question its expediency is to "touch the Lord's anointed." It is evident that no judicial consideration of a statute is to be expected of a judge who approaches the subject in such a frame of mind as this.

The result of so approaching the consideration of a statute is fatally to blind the judge both with reference to the position and functions of the legislature and with reference to his own position and functions. He comes to look upon the legislature as in some sort the mouthpiece of Deity, and, of course, this renders the expression of its will sacred, and inquiry into the authority of its deliverances rather in the nature of blasphemy or heresy. But this inquiry is one of the chief purposes of his official existence. For him the legislature has properly no connection with Deity. It is simply a part of a machine constructed by human agency for human purposes, and his business is to see to it that the part does not go beyond the purposes for which it was placed in the machine of government. And these purposes are defined and limited by the constitution.

When the question of the constitutionality of a statute is at issue, the judicial frame of mind requires that that question shall be settled by the constitution alone. It no more admits of any deference to a command of Deity, real or supposed, than it admits of deference to a change in the minds of the people, real or supposed, subsequent to the constitution's adoption. So that, if there be a command of Deity recorded anywhere outside of the constitution that a Sunday law with certain provisions shall be enacted, yet this will not render its enactment a legitimate exercise of legislative power, unless it be so under the constitution. And, conversely, though there should be produced from some source an express command of Deity that no Sunday law shall be enacted, yet this will not render its enactment an illegitimate exercise of legislative power, unless it be so under the constitution. So that the commands of Deity have nothing whatever to do with the question of the constitutionality of a statute, except so far as those commands may be embodied in the constitution. And when embodied therein, so far as the courts are concerned, they derive all their sanction and force from their embodiment, and no sanction or force whatever from the fact that they are commands of Deity.

The prejudice produced by the influence of Brownism that there is a special connection between a Sunday law and a divine command, blinds a judge as fatally to his own position and functions as it does to the position and functions of the legislature. He comes to look upon himself as in some sort the upholder, the expounder, and the enforcer of a divine command when this statute is before him, instead of regarding himself in his true light, as part of a machine constructed by human agency for human purposes alone, and like the governor of the steam engine, having for his special duty the seeing to it that the other parts operate in a regular and orderly manner according to the law of their being. He begins to feel that Deity, instead of the constitution, is the author of his official being, to imagine that he has, as judge, a "mission" from "on high," instead of a mere commission from the governor or the people. And for him to falter in such a character, to look beyond this inspiration for guidance, seems like "kicking against the pricks."

And in his case, as in that of the legislator, all this implies a confusion of his personal and his official duty, and he ceases, in fact, to be a judge.

Supposed he is fully persuaded in his own mind that there is a divine command that men should not work on Sunday. It by no means follows that such a belief will justify him in sustaining the constitutionality of a law compelling everybody to be idle on Sunday. The old Hebrew judges decided the guilt or innocence of a party arraigned before them on the charge of violating the fourth commandment, without any reference to its validity, because, like all the rest of the law which they administered, it came from a source unquestioned and unquestionable.

That it was a command of Deity which it was their duty to enforce, was a point not to be mooted. It is otherwise with an American judge. He has no commandments to enforce. He deals with statutes. The statutes with which he deals do not begin, "Thus saith the Lord;" they begin with some such phrase as, "Be it enacted by the General Assembly," etc. And the very first question that he has to consider in dealing with a statute is, Had the General Assembly authority to enact it? And if he permits himself to decide this question with reference to any command of Deity, real or assumed, or with reference to anything whatsoever but the constitution which created the Assembly, and has defined and limited its sphere of action, then he is deciding a judicial question in a nonjudicial frame of mind.

His judicial oath included, his position justifies, no such performance. His oath is to support the constitution. If he does not support everything in that constitution, and refuse to support anything outside of it, in his judicial capacity, utterly irrespective of his personal views of what is or is not a command of Deity, then he breaks his judicial oath. If he finds that compliance with his oath forces him to violate a divine command, he may of course, resign; but he cannot act judicially on the bench and break his oath.

Even if there were an express command, "Thou shalt sustain the constitutionality of a Sunday law," no judge of ours could appeal to it as binding on his official action. To do so is at once to decide or judge purely religious questions—the question as to the verity of the command, the question to whom is it addressed, the question of the kind of Sunday law which might be referred to, etc., etc. And a judge who undertakes to decide such questions is setting up the union of Church and State at once; and when he sustains a statute as the result of his conclusions on these points, he is giving effect to a law that grants a preference to one religion over another.

And it may be added that to decide such questions is as impossible as it is illegitimate, for our judges. They have no means whatever of ascertaining what is the will of Deity, nor where it is recorded. They cannot decide for the Jew against the Mahometan that it is recorded in the Pentateuch—or Hexateuch, in modern parlance. They cannot decide for the Christian against the Jew that it is recorded in the New Testament as well as in the Old Testament of the King James version. They cannot decide for the Roman Catholic against the Lutheran that it may be found in the "Apocrypha" as well as in the Testaments recognized by Protestants. Nor, assuming that a certain mandate, couched in human language, could be ruled by the courts to be an expression of the will of Deity, would it be possible for them to authoritatively interpret that mandate when its meaning and application should be disputed; and it is hard to imagine a mandate couched in human language over which such a dispute might not arise.

It will not do, then, for an American judge, any more than an American legislator, to imagine that in his official character he is "an instrument in the hands of Providence." It will not do for him to be influenced in his official action by his private notions of what men ought or ought not to do. He may think it is the will of Deity that men shall not work on Sunday; but this is not the slightest reason why he should sustain the constitutionality of a Sunday law. He may think it is the will of Deity that no interest should be taken for the use of money; yet he dare not refuse to give judgment for its recovery in any amount provided for by the law. It is surely the will of Deity that the rich creditor should be merciful to his impoverished debtor; but the judge must sustain an execution for the uttermost farthing, under the harshest conditions, unless the will of the State, as expressed in its law, allows some exemptions. In short, the will of Deity, so far as the official action of the judge is concerned, is that he shall do his duty, and that duty consists in complying with his official oath to support the Constitution.

We see, then, that the judge who permits his view of the Sunday law (or any other law in free America) to be clouded by his notions of what are and what are not commands of Deity, confounds the official character of the legislator with his individual character, and his own duty, as a judge with his duty as a man. And one who does this manifestly approaches the decision of the constitutionality of the Sunday law or its construction, in a non-judicial frame of mind.
