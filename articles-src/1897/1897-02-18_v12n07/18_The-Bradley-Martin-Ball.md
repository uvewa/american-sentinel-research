Two events of recent date which were in no way related to each other, yet which have a bearing on the same subject, were, the meeting of the Woman's National Sabbath Alliance at the house of one of New York City's millionaires, January 28, and the Bradley-Martin fancy dress ball at the Hotel Waldorf, February 11. The meaning of the Woman's National Sabbath Alliance is that Woman has come to the "rescue of the sabbath,"—not the women of the lower or ordinary walks of life, but those of wealth and high standing in "society," such as figure in the homes of millionaires and in the functions of Washington social life. The meaning of the Bradley-Martin ball,—well, that can be left to the judgment of the reader. But the question which naturally arises is, Might not these ladies in "high society," who have arisen to "rescue the sabbath," properly begin their reform work a little nearer home?

Nothing worthy of mention took place at the Bradley-Martin ball at the Hotel Waldorf the evening of the 11th, but several things worthy of note took place just outside of it. One of these was the barricading of a public street leading past the hotel entrance, so that no one could pass along that portion of it unless he was so outlandishly attired as to look like a fool, in which case it was presumed he—or she—was to be a participant in the ball. The reason this is worthy of note is that there is not a very long step between the barricading of a public thoroughfare by the city's "four hundred" for their own selfish pleasure, and the barricading of public streets by the four hundred thousand at the other end of the social scale, for a purpose not in any way designed to promote the happiness of the rich.
