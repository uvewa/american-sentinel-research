A BILL is now pending in the Minnesota Legislature, which provides "That it shall be unlawful to give or permit to be given, any theatrical performance, amusement, or public exhibition of whatever nature on the first day of the week, commonly known as Sunday;" such act to be punishable by fine of $25 to $100, imprisonment for thirty days or less, and revocation of license for one year.

In view of this a "Protest and Memorial" has been drawn up by citizens of that State for presentation to the Legislature, based on the following reasons:—

1. Because, this measure enters the realm of the individual mind and would forestall the individual exercise of the right to decide for himself as to how he will spend his time.

2. Because, until a man shall seek to spend his time by overt acts in the invasion of the equal rights of others, the State has no authority. This is not and cannot be claimed in this case by the supporters of the bill inasmuch as the places of amusement are to be prohibited on one day only.

3. Because, that 'the first day of the week, commonly known as Sunday,' is the day designated upon which would be prohibited 'any theatrical performance, amusement or public exhibition of whatever nature.'

4. Because, that this prohibition being placed on Sunday stamps it as a religious measure, purely in the interests of Sunday, because of the supposed sacred character of the day. Thus the movers would guard the sacredness of the day and give the stamp of morality to the theatre.

5. Because, the State has no standard of morality whereby to measure the sacredness of any day or thing. Indeed, there is no such standard except the divine, even that of the Word of God. And if the State should attempt to apply this standard, it would thereby exalt itself in the place of God in the application and interpretation of that Word, thereby assuming to itself the attribute of infallibility which belongs alone to God.

6. Because, such an attempt to apply this standard in civil matters would lead to statutory interpretation which would be to set up a human standard above the divine, even above the Bible itself.

7. Because, that to allow that the State has the right and the power to apply the Bible in civil matters, would be to allow its right and power to apply that standard in spiritual matters as well.

8. Because, such statutory interpretations of that divine standard—the Bible—would be of no force whatever, except by penalties more or less severe (an example of which may be seen in the aforesaid bill), the execution of which would lead to persecution. Indeed, it could most truly be said to be persecution itself. All of which would be contrary to the Constitution and a gross violation of the true American principle of individual rights in all matters of conscience.

"The principle upon which all should act is well stated by Herbert Spencer, thus: 'Every man has a right to do whatsoever he wills, provided that in the doing thereof he infringes not the equal rights of any other man.'

"In the language of the citizen, soldier, statesman, General Grant, 'Keep the Church and State forever separate.'"
