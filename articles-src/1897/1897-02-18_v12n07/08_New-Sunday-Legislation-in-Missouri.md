A bill has been introduced in the Missouri House of Representatives, and passed by that body, which if it becomes a law, will prohibit all games of any kind, public or private, in any part of that State, on the first day of the week.

In the *Kansas City Star*, of February 3, we note the following relative to the discussion of the measure in the House:

"JEFFERSON CITY, Feb. 3.—When Burroughs, of Howell County, a young man fresh from college, introduced a bill in the House to make it a misdemeanor to play base ball on Sunday, and Regan, of St. Louis, taunted him with the declaration that Howell County was so hilly that it contained no place that would give room for a base ball diamond on flat ground, nobody thought that the bill would pass, but it went through the House yesterday afternoon, 77 to 42, and was debated afterward.

"It was the amended bill that passed, but in reality the old statute against horse-racing and cock-fighting, is only reenacted and the new portion only prohibits playing base ball and all other games. If it shall pass the Senate and become a law it will not only prohibit base ball games of any kind on Sunday, but the small boy who plays marbles in the back yard or his father who plays a game of chess in the parlor on Sunday will be liable to be hauled off to jail in the middle of the game. Unless the Supreme Court shall fall back on the old theory of ejusdem generis, which put an end to the prosecution of the ballot box stuffing cases, it is a serious question whether if this bill becomes a law it will not be held that it is an offense against the peace and dignity of the great State of Missouri for small girls to play with their dolls on Sunday, even though saloons are permitted to run wide open on that day."

"The bill was fairly railroaded through. The roll call began before members realized what was going on, and though a dozen tried to make speeches by way of explaining their votes, Collins, of Scotland, who happened to be in the chair, shut them off very promptly.

"After the bill had been passed, Johnston, of St. Louis County, moved to reconsider, and for an hour there was the warmest kind of debate. Martin 'roasted' the House for passing a bill which, he declared, was worse than the old Blue Laws of Connecticut. Crisp voiced his antagonism to the bill and declared that for twenty generations members of his family, when they knocked at the pearly gates of heaven, pleaded the promises of God, and that he did not propose to depend for his hope of future happiness on pleading the statutes of Missouri, the sufficiency of which he questioned.

"At 9 o'clock this morning the discussion was resumed on Johnston's motion to reconsider. Wade, of Springfield, surprised the House by urging reconsideration. He said that in the cities there were thousands who were too poor to dress their children properly to go to church. . . .

"Fitzgerald, who is tall and gaunt, twisting one long leg around the other and leaning against a desk in the middle of the House, said: 'I desire to ask the gentleman if he believes that when our forefathers landed at Plymouth Rock they would have spent one hour playing base ball on Sunday?' . . .

"Whitecotton said the House would find before this year should end that no man was more in favor of good morals than he, but this was a measure which could not be justified. 'The idea,' he said, 'seems to prevail here that the public can be made good by law. I say, as a former prosecutor and an attorney, that it breeds contempt for law to place on your statute books laws which the people will not respect. This law is unjust, unmoral, and I will show you by the example of the lowly Nazarene that it is unchristian. Your law will forbid the playing of a game of croquet on Sunday or arrest little boys for playing marbles. This bill is undemocratic; it is against American manhood; it is intolerant.'"

After some further discussion, the motion to reconsider was tabled by a vote of 71 to 52.

The bill was sent to the Senate, where, as is reported, it met with no very flattering reception. What further fortune may have come to it we have not yet learned.
