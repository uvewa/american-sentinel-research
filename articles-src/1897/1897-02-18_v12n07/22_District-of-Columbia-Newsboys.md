THE sale of newspapers by vocal announcement, in the manner customary with newsboys, is now prohibited on Sundays in the District of Columbia. The first Sunday on which the law went into effect, four newsboys were arrested for its violation, and were held for trial under bonds of $100 each. Friends of liberty in Washington have provided for their defense.
