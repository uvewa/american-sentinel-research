When the citizen takes the ballot where can he stop and be loyal to his pledge?

Where can the Christian begin and be true to God in keeping his loving commands?

Let us take one example. In 1844, many peaceful looking ballots were folded and placed in the boxes. These elected James K. Polk to the presidency. When he was inaugurated these ballots began to unfold, compelling him to take an oath faithfully to serve the people as they had prescribed in the Constitution. Let us carefully watch the ballot unfold and see what is in it.

Texas complying with the conditions was admitted into the Union as a State. The ballot sovereignty had promised to protect each State against invasion. The Mexican army invaded Texas, killing her citizens and destroying property. The President, in pursuit of his oath fastened upon him by the ballot, issued a call for some of the power which the people had promised him that he might carry out his obligations. The power came in the form of men with guns,—in those guns, bullets. The people know the result. Mexicans and loyal U. S. soldiers were killed by the hundreds. If this was not all in the ballot when it was first cast, where did it come from?

The ballot is of no force unless the men who cast it will stand by it,—the men can do nothing without guns and the guns are useless without bullets, and all falls as unmeaning as autumn leaves unless the bullets kill.

But, says the non-combatant, the Christian has no right to use the bullet. By what show of reason then can he fasten it upon others?

This peaceable ballot was bought with consecrated blood placed upon the altar by noble men who pledged their lives, their fortunes, and sacred honor at the shrine of liberty. He who will do less to-day has no right to employ the ballot. Those who use it to-day intelligently and sincerely stand on the same platform with those noble men pledging themselves as fully. He who, when casting the peaceful ballot in the decision of any political question, does not see in it the obligations he is placing others under as well as himself, is not qualified to vote.

A man in order to act properly the part of sovereign in the use of the ballot must see in it not only privileges but also the grave responsibility he is enjoining upon others. He must see that in placing men in responsible positions he is as truly holden for the discharge of their duties as they are, and if there is anything in it which he could not do personally he has no shadow of right to empower another to do it for him.

Our peaceful ballot, as well as the peace we enjoy in using it, was born in blood with the sword and bullet. It has been maintained ever since in the same way. It can be secured no other way.

He who does not see in the quiet ballot the nation's sovereignty in the voter, the solemn responsibility which rests upon officials, the oath of office, the call for troops, the trumpet and the drum, the belching cannon, the groans of the dying and the bloody field; the tears of widows and orphans, desolated homes and blasted hopes, has an imperfect idea of what it means to be a citizen of the grandest of all governments—the United States of America.

Let the Christian be true to his calling, the work of Christ, who came not to destroy men's lives, but to save them.

Let the sovereign citizen be true to the ballot, not only in its peaceful folding, but in its logical unfolding, knowing that the bullet is but the supplement to the ballot. They are by nature united; neither is of any force without the other.

The ballot is the premise of a practical sylogism: "A government of the people, by the people, and for the people," and the bullet is the conclusion.

Let every man stand loyal and true to his calling.
