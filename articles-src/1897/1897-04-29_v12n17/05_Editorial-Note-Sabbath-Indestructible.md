No conception of the nature of the Sabbath can be at all near the true one which is accompanied by any fear that it will become "lost" because people seem to be paying less and less deference to it. Such a conception puts the Sabbath on the basis of a mere human institution. But the Sabbath is divine, and indestructible.
