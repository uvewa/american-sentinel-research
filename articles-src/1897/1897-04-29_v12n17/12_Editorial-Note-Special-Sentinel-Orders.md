Feeling confident that our readers will appreciate the value of this special SENTINEL when they see it, much more than would be possible from the mere announcement of it previously made, we have printed a large number beyond that required by our regular circulation, and are ready to fill all orders promptly. Who cannot make good use of at least a few copies of an issue like this? We look for the friends of the SENTINEL everywhere to improve this grand opportunity to do effective work in the cause of liberty.
