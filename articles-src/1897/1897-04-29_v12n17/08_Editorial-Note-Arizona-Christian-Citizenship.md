ARIZONA too is afflicted with the Christian Citizenship Sunday Legislation Reform. A friend has sent to us a copy of one of their circulars.

In this they declare that, "If you love your home, you will not approve of foot ball on Sunday;" that, "If you love your country, you will not approve of baseball on Sunday;" that, "If you love your own best good, you will not approve of any public amusements on Sunday;" and that, "If you love God, you will keep the Sabbath holy as He has commanded."

The last of these statements is true enough, as He has commanded that you shall "Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy; six days shalt thou labor and do all thy work, but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God, in it thou shalt not do any work." But all this has nothing whatever to do with Sunday or with what a man shall do on Sunday except that he shall work.

As for the rest of these things, a man can love his home and approve of foot ball on Sunday just as well as to approve of foot ball on any other day. A man can love his country and approve of base ball on Sunday just as well as to approve of base ball on any other day. And a man can love his own best good, and approve of public amusements on Sunday just as really as he can approve of public amusements any other day.

One of the most surprising things in connection with this whole Sabbath and Sunday subject is that men will confound things that are absolutely distinct, assuming the one thing which above all other things it is essential to prove, and presume that the ignorance or indifference of the people will allow it to pass unchallenged. And all this in the face of the Word of God which makes perfectly plain the eternal fact that the seventh day of the week, and that day only, is or ever can be the Sabbath.
