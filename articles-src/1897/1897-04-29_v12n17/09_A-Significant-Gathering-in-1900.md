"At the recent meeting of the Board of Control of the Epworth League in New York," says a New York religious journal, "the following resolution was adopted: 'Resolved, That we desire, as heretofore, to express our wish for close fellowship with all Christian young people, and our readiness to coöperate in practical Christian work with the young people of all evangelical denominations, and hereby authorize the general Cabinet to receive or make such advances for a federation of young people's societies, or for a Young People's Congress in the year 1900, as they may deem advisable.'

"This desire for closer fraternal relations with other similar organizations has been ratified by the trustees of the United Societies of Christian Endeavor, who at their last meeting a few weeks ago decided to take steps toward the holding of a great Young People's Congress in 1900 in some central city to be determined upon later. It is proposed to omit all annual gatherings of such societies for that year, in order that they may be merged into the congress, which will probably be a great and significant gathering."
