There were 10,652 men, women and children murdered in the United States in 1896.

Allowing forty feet to each vehicle and ten vehicles to each funeral, the number of persons murdered in the United States last year would make a funeral procession eight hundred miles long.

Traveling at the rate of five miles an hour it would take six days and sixteen hours for this procession to pass a given point. Starting at noon on Sunday and traveling day and night, the last of this train of tears and blood and blighted hopes, this product of greed and rage and lust would pass by at the early hour of two on the next Sunday morning.

For years this record of blood has steadily increased. The number murdered in 1892 was 6,794; the number in 1896 was 10,652. This is an increase in five years of nearly 57 per cent., while the population in the same time increased less than 12 per cent. And yet in the face of these startling figures the large majority of religious leaders teach that the world is getting better, that we are entering the long-expected millennium.

The authority for these figures is the Chicago Tribune, which publishes on January 1st of each year, among other statistics, the number of homicides during the previous year. This responsible journal could have no object in exaggerating this record of crime.

Those who prophesy smooth things, who have predicted a millennial reign of righteousness now dawning upon the earth, have denied the correctness of these figures in order to break the force of their import. With this in mind the writer corresponded with the Tribune, and received the following clear statement under date of March 31, 1897, of the methods used in collecting these statistics:—

"The only defense needed for the statistics is an explanation showing how they are collected. Every morning the telegraphic reports to the Chicago papers are examined for these and other statistics. In addition to this the leading papers of every important city in every State and Territory are closely scrutinized, and each case is entered. The statistics as a whole, therefore, include every case of murder received by the Tribune by telegraph, and by mail in the exchange list. These cases are carefully kept day by day to the end of the year. My impression is that the totals are under rather than over the exact figures.

"Very truly yours,
"GEO. P. UPTON,
"Asso. Ed. Tribune."

Judge Isaac C. Parker, of the United States District Court, in a signed article in the New York World, of Feb. 9, 1896, writes thus:—

"The record of the last five years ('91-'95) shows that there have been 43,902 homicides in the United States, an average of 7,317 per year. In the same time there have been 723 legal executions and 1,118 lynchings."

"This bloody record shows a fearful increase of crime which destroys human life."

"How can we correct this condition of blood? It must be corrected. If we cannot, the man of crime will soon be in the ascendancy."

In the World, of Feb. 14, 1896, the Judge is reported as saying that—

"The number of persons who have been murdered in the United States in the last five years is six times larger than the continental army at the close of the Revolution, and the number murdered last year is greater than our standing army at the outbreak of the civil war.

"The issue before the country is not money or tariff, but whether or not we are able to guarantee proper protection to human life."

While these fearful facts do not agree with the programme mapped out by a large proportion of religious teachers, yet they do agree with the Word of the Lord, which speaks thus:—

"In the last days perilous times shall come." "Evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived." 2 Tim. 3:1–13.

The theory that all men are to be converted before the Lord's second coming is an error. The Lord's explanation of his parable of the wheat and tares (Matt. 13:37–39) reads thus:—

"He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man; the field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one. The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; the reapers are the angels."

Putting the Lord's explanation into the parable it reads thus:—

Gather not the wicked from among the just lest in destroying the wicked ye destroy the righteous. Let both the righteous and the wicked dwell together in the earth until the end of the world; and then gather the wicked to be destroyed in the furnace of fire, and the righteous for the kingdom of their Father. Compare Matt. 13:28–30 and 13:38–43.

Despite these plain scriptures the religious world is expecting a reign of righteousness and peace on the earth before the second coming of the Lord. Like the Jews at Christ's first coming, the religious teachers of to-day have fixed up a programme for the Lord contrary to the scriptures. Having done this they overlook the startling signs of the times, while watching for signs which shall confirm their unscriptural predictions. In the very presence of the most startling signs of the second advent they come, saying, Show us a sign; just as the Pharisees of old in the presence of the greatest Sign, the Lord himself, demanded "Show us a sign."

Error begets error, and growing weary of waiting for the predicted reign of righteousness they have come to the conclusion that they must bring it by their own efforts. Consequently, we have the modern "Christian Citizenship" movement, with the avowed purpose of bringing about a reign of righteousness by human law; but instead of a reign of peace we have almost a "reign of terror."

The preaching of the cross is the only way to reach the seat of the disease, the carnal heart; but this is fast being abandoned by the Church of to-day for the treatment of crime, the surface symptoms of the disease. Meanwhile, murder multiplies, the funeral train, the pageant of the prince of darkness, swells its ranks and moves on to the city of the dead.

Oh, where are the men of God, whose lips have been touched with a live coal from off the altar, who are men endowed with power from on high, who will at this crisis cry aloud and spare not, who will lift up their voice like a trumpet and proclaim that "all flesh is as grass," that "not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith the Lord of Hosts," are men to be saved from their sins?
