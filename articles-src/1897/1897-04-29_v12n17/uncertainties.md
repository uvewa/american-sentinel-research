## Specific Uncertainties

### Article: "Post-Millenialism Makes a Worldly Church"
- **Author attribution**: The text shows "By the late Dr. A. J. Gordon" - this is explicit, but unusual phrasing ("late" suggests deceased). Author confirmed as A. J. Gordon. Used initials "AJG" for file naming.
- **Text at line 237**: "she means time" - appears to be OCR error for "she meantime" or similar, but transcribed as appears in source per instructions.

### Article: "General Grant on Separation of Church and State"
- **Image reference**: Line 269 references "accompany-ing illustration" but image is on different page. Reference kept as in original.

### Article: "The Loss of Spiritual Power..."
- **Author**: Listed as "From 'Baptist Principles of Religious Liberty,' by Geo. B. Wheeler" - this is a reprint/excerpt from a published work, not an original article. Classified as reprint with original_publication field.

### Article: "Ballot and Bullet.—No. 4"
- **Author**: H. E. Giddings - full name uncertain, used "HEG" for initials.

### Layout/Structure Notes
- Original had multi-column layout; converted to continuous text per instructions
- Page numbers and headers ("AMERICAN SENTINEL" with page numbers) noted but not transcribed as article content
- Several advertisements and publication info on final pages - not created as separate article files per instructions
- Images referenced but not transcribed (photographs, illustrations)

## No Uncertainties Requiring Follow-up
All text was clear enough to transcribe with confidence. Any apparent OCR errors (like "means time" instead of "meantime") were transcribed exactly as they appeared, per project instructions.
