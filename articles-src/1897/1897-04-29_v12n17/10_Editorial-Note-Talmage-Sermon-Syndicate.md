The manner in which some kinds of spiritual enterprise unite in this day with carnal enterprise, is illustrated by the following from the N. Y. Christian Advocate, of April 1:—

"'Dr. Talmage's sermons' are sent out to the papers in a syndicate. They are generally represented as having been obtained at great expense by telegraph.

"On the 20th of February last he was advertized to preach at the Florida Chautauqua, at De Funiak Springs, but he failed to keep his promise, and some of the papers stated that a suit was to be begun against him for violation of contract. He appears to have stayed in Savannah, but the sermon that he preached in Savannah was not published in the syndicate papers, and all over the land they published one which he did not deliver, and which purported to have been given at De Funiak Springs."
