Some idea of the manner in which Romanism is intrenching itself in this Government, may be gained from the following letter written by an officer on the U.S. battleship Oregon, to a Protestant minister, and published in the Herald and Presbyter, of August 25th (the names of the parties in the correspondence being suppressed, for politic reasons):

"Dear Friend:—I will write you these few lines concerning a little incident which happened on board the United States ship Oregon, last Friday, to let you know how things are going in this grand United States navy.

"Last Friday was, as you know, Good Friday, quite a day among the Catholics. Early Friday morning, just before breakfast, there was an order issued by the captain that there would be no meat eaten by the crew or officers that day, which caused quite a bit of dissatisfaction among some of the men. But that was only a 'starter.' About 10.30 A.M., a big, burly priest came on board ship, and the whole crew had to attend a meeting in the officers' quarters, where they had a great many large candles burning and a lot of other foolishness. All the officers, with the exception of two, were dressed in big robes of white. When the priest left the ship all the crew were lined up on the quarterdeck, and, as he went over the gangway, the captain gave the order to salute him, which they all did with the exception of thirty-four, myself among the thirty-four. And we were every one of us punished for not saluting the priest, under a charge of not obeying orders.

"When I enlisted in the navy I did not think I was joining a Catholic institution, and I told the captain so, and he came near putting me in the brig (ship's prison) for saying it to him. Now that the officers know I am against the Catholics, I expect that they will make my life miserable the rest of my time on the Oregon, just because I let them know I am an American.

"Now, I would like to have you advise me on this subject. I have already been told by an officer that the best thing I could do was to get out of this, and, if I did not, I would be disrated to a seaman.

"April 22, 1897."
