A duel is a combat between two individuals. War is a combat between two nations. It is a duel on a grand scale.

In this country duelling is condemned. The individual who engages in a duel is regarded as lacking in the essential elements of moral character. He is classed with the gambler and with those who yield to the control of vice and passion. Yet the same ones who thus condemn the individual duel defend the national duel as an entirely proper and even honorable proceeding. The vast majority of the church people take this course, and even go so far as to maintain military organizations in their own midst. And while they justify duelling between nations, they affirm that the combatants in such a case may be "Christian" nations.

Such inconsistency is of course perceived in those nations of the Old World occupying a lower plane of virtue than that on which this country assumes to stand; and they are not slow to point it out. The following from the New York Journal, of August 25, sets the case before us upon its merits, and might be read with profit by several millions of our "Christian citizens":

"If France and Italy had any wish to know what is thought in the United States of duelling they have been fully informed. The press of this great country has spoken copiously, with the set-to of Prince Henry and the Count of Turin for a text, and it is decided that the duel is nonsense—that nothing could be more irrational than to endeavor to determine the merits of one question by settling the merits of another; that for the Count to prove himself a more successful swordsman than the Prince left as it was before the disputed point of Italian courage in Abyssinia.

"This is true, as obviously true as that man is a fighting animal. But it is unfortunate that the philosophers of Italy and France can inquire with force whether if we are so convinced of the folly and essential savagery of the duel, we ought not to sink or sell our navy and disband our army. For, after all, what argument is there that tells against the duel which does not also bear with equal weight against war? What does war prove except the superior strength or courage of the victorious nation? The duel between individuals and the combat between peoples are alike an appeal to force—the last arbitramen, to which we still resort in common with the lower animals.

"While every nation of Europe is armed to the teeth, waiting like a Klondike miner with his hand on his pistol to repel any attempt to jump his claim—while there are more soldiers in the civilized world than any other age ever saw—it is rather queer to witness the duellist haled before the court of reason and required to listen to philosophical lectures delivered with a Quaker accent.

"And the Italian or French defender of the practice of private war may express interest in the phenomenon of the survival in full strength of the spirit of the duellist among people who have abandoned the duel. In an industrial community such as ours, where the theory is received that the law affords reparation for all wrongs, and that it is disreputable as well as foolish for individuals to fight, the peaceful citizens desire that their government—which is themselves in the aggregate—should be guided not by Christian maxims of non-resistance to evil, but by the duellist's code. They wish their government to be sensitive upon the point of honor, to respond to rudeness by laying its hand upon its sword, and to resent an affront or avenge an injury precisely as the whiskered pandour and fierce huzzar would be expected to do by his duel-approving comrades.

"It is all utterly unreasonable and perfectly human."
