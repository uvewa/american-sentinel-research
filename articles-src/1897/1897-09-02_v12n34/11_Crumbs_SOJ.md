BY S. O. JAMES.

SATAN delights in oppression and succeeds in persuading a certain class of minds that even in its worst forms it is only wholesome discipline and that they themselves are the divinely-appointed agents to administer it.

IT is a good thing to seek for glory, honor and immortality with the hope that by patient continuance in well-doing we may have eternal life, but let those who are seeking to force measures which can be secured only by the spirit of meekness, gentleness and love beware lest their power be suddenly wrenched from them and their glory turned into shame.

THE freedom with which some men attempt to lay down the rules of religion for others is not the freedom that comes from God.

MEN take liberties that bind their own souls in the worst of bondage.

HONEST men are sometimes misled with regard to methods. Peter used the sword for his Master's sake, but the Master's timely and mild rebuke, so useful to him in future life, seems of little worth to the hasty impetuous throng who will have him to be king of this nation.

NO MAN can of himself free himself from the bondage of sin into which all have fallen, but when freed by the Great Emancipator, the Lord Jesus Christ, he immediately partakes of his spirit and heartily desires that others may taste the sweet boon. It then becomes his business to learn what will enslave and what will tend to freedom.

HAPPY is that soul who can see that it is not necessary to deprive any of one God-given right in order that others may be free or have a greater measure of freedom.

A LARGE company of Christians are now praying for a Sunday law; in other words, they would have the great God so move upon the minds of a majority in this nation that a stringent law would forbid all labor upon a day which he has never in any sense made sacred,—thus robbing that part of the people who keep the day he has blessed and one sixth of their time. By what mysterious principle in logic or precedent in the dealings of God with men do they expect an answer to their prayers?

OH that men in their work of Christian endeavor would study more carefully and prayerfully the things that are characteristic of God, of his law, and of his people and work, as well as those peculiar to the enemy.
