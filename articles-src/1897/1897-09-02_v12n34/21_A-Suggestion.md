# A Suggestion.

We have received several orders to discontinue copies of the SENTINEL sent to parties under our special offer, because of the impression that they would later be asked to pay for what they themselves had not ordered. We would again suggest the propriety of those who send the papers in this manner, notifying the parties to whom the paper is mailed that it is sent them free of cost.

Mr. R. G. W. Collins, of Dodgeville, Wis., in remitting for twenty-four subscriptions, says: "I enclose you a list of subscribers I have secured for the SENTINEL, which includes some of the best men of the city. I have not been well or could have done much better. Success to the little giant."
