UNDER this heading a New England journal says:—

"The church-going element of New England is stirred because the aristocratic sojourners of Newport turned last Sunday into an occasion of merry-making. First the nabobs had their showy carriages manned by lackeys in bottle-green livery bowling along Bellevue avenue and the ocean roadway until it seemed as if every swell turnout in the country was in the procession. Then Oliver H. P. Belmont gave a reception which was attended by a small army of well-dressed men and women and which was enlivened by the music of a brass band. Besides this there were eight more elaborate receptions including one given by Chauncey M. Depew. At the Casino, dinners were given by the dozen, the guests numbering all the way from ten to twenty, and in other ways the decorum prescribed by Christianity for observing the sabbath was trampled upon."

A Sunday law is essentially a restriction upon the poor. It can never be anything else than class legislation. The unfortunate circumstances which surround the poor sufficiently emphasize the contrast between them and the rich, where no Sunday law exists. And anything which tends to deepen this contrast, as a Sunday law does, can only tend toward anarchy and revolution.
