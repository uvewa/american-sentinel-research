It is not very consistent for a journal which is published in the interests of the papacy, to decry that which savors of the papal principle of union of Church and State; but it is plain that papal journals can see the evil readily enough and know how to state the truth when it is a case of union of the State with some other religion than the papal. The Catholic Mirror, for example, takes occasion from some recent utterances by the Senate chaplain of Congress, while in the discharge of his official duties, to comment upon the folly of political prayer. The Mirror says:—

"The offensive practice of Protestant ministers making 'prayers' of a certain character in legislative or political bodies has been often noted, and every now and then something of the sort occurs in Congress. Then there is a laugh from the irreverent, or an expression of disgust from serious and sensible people who feel that by these exhibitions religion is brought into discredit.

"A few days ago the chaplain in the Senate, Rev. Hugh Johnson, delivered one of these political prayers, in which he said:—

"'We recognize Thy hand in this work of commercial legislation now near completion in so short a period of Congressional history. We thank Thee for the courage, the disinterestedness, and the generosity exhibited by Senators and Representatives, and that party interest and feelings and local interests have been subordinated to the expressed will of the majority in this legislation.'

"The reverend gentleman, it may be explained, alluded to the tariff bill. Not a few persons, it is to be feared, will be profane enough to give expression to a good deal of mirth at the idea of the 'courage, disinterestedness and generosity' of the Senators and Representatives in connection with the pending 'work of commercial legislation.' It will be hard to believe that the hand of the Almighty directed some of the proceedings of the honorable members who have been laboring over the complicated and difficult schedules recently in Washington.

"Such 'prayers' have a sound of cant and hypocrisy, and it is not just to term them prayers at all, but rather political speeches. No clergyman of decent instincts and of proper reverence for the Almighty would address such offensive instruction to the divine Author of all things, patronizingly informing him of the satisfaction of critical observers here below with his direction of mundane things."
