## A Lot in It.

"MAMA, why did Cain kill Abel?" asked Charlie, looking up from Doré's picture of the murder of Abel in the large family Bible.

"I think it says somewhere," said Mrs. Ross, rather absently, without glancing at the eager face of her boy on the floor, "that it was because Cain's works were evil, and his brother's righteous."

Charlie's face was puzzled and unsatisfied.

"But why, mama, did he want to kill Abel, if Abel was doing right?"

"Because Abel's right doing condemned his wrong doing, and made him feel uncomfortable."

"But, mama, now think real hard, and tell me why Abel's right doing made him feel uncomfortable?"

"Why—why—because," said Mrs. Ross, slowly, "I suppose it annoyed him just as it annoys us to have people differ with us in opinion, and question our judgment and works."

Charlie thought a moment. "Yes; that's it. It annoyed me yesterday when Esther would not agree with me about how to sharpen a pencil. Cain wanted his own way, and of course did not want any one to have any other way than his. It's quite natural, isn't it, mama? But after all, mama, why couldn't Cain have his own way?"

"He could. No one hindered him that I know of. Did any one hinder him?"

"N-No," said Charlie, slowly; "but everybody knows that it wasn't right. Why wasn't it right? What is right, any way?"

"Why, right is right," said Mrs. Ross, "because it is right."

"What made it right?" questioned Charlie.

"O I do not know that I can explain it so you can understand. It is right because it is in the very nature of things. The universe could not exist if right were not right. Why, Charlie, it's the very nature of God himself."

"Did God tell Cain and Abel what was right to do?"

"Yes," said Mrs. Ross.

"And you say he is right. Then he must have told them to do what he is."

"That's just it, Charlie."

"Then Cain must have been angry at what God is, if Abel did what God is."

"Abel was representing God," said Mrs. Ross, "and it must have been as you say." Mrs. Ross laid down her sewing as if a new thought had come to her. "Can you tell me any text that tells what God is?"

"God is love," answered Charlie promptly.

"Yes; then love is right. What is it that makes you trust me, Charlie?"

"Your love," said Charlie, smiling. "It's because I know you love me."

"Then because I love you, you trust me, and can safely do anything that I tell you to do, because my commands are the commands of love. And you know I will not tell you to do anything but what will be for your good. Because God is love, and love works only good all his creatures may safely trust in him, and do just what he says. Abel did this. He recognized that God is what he is, that is, love; and obeyed his commands, believing in their blessing to him. God's commandments are just what God himself is, and the word God comes from the same word as good. He is the supreme Good."

"But when Cain heard God's commands, he did not believe in them and did not do them, and this shows that he doubted that God was what he was, and trusted in himself as being better, wiser, and higher than God. In fact, dear, when any one sets his way above God's way, he puts himself in the place of God in his own estimation, at least.

"Yes," said Charlie, "I heard papa read the other morning about a 'man of sin,' who opposed and exalted himself above all that is called God. But mama, I never knew before what there was in one's own way. Why, there's a lot in it," said Charlie, wrestling with a set of suggestions he could not put into words.

"So there is," said Mrs. Ross, looking far away. "There's Calvary and the dark ages in it."

"What you you mean, mama?"

"You asked me why Cain killed Abel," said Mrs. Ross.

"Yes; and you said it was because his own works were evil and his brother's righteous."

"Yes; and then we found that right was the very expression of what God is, and that Abel was expressing God's own nature, and that Cain was angry about it."

"Yes, mama, here it is in the Bible: 'And God said to Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen? If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if not, sin lieth at thy door.'"

"Now, Charlie, what was Cain really angry at?"

"At God," said Charlie, in an awe-struck tone.

"Yes, Charlie; and now I will ask you why did Cain kill Abel?"

"Why, really," said Charlie, slowly, "it was to get rid of being reminded of God; to get God out of the way. He really hated God."

"I believe that that was the bottom reason. Cain did not know all that was in his heart; but hate was there, and it is directly opposed to love, and God is love. Abel was representing God to Cain, and Cain could not bear his meekness and love. Did he leave him alone then? Did he give him liberty to go on representing God?"

"No, mama. Even after God spoke to him he still kept his anger. It says that when he was walking in the field with Abel that he rose up and slew him."

"Now, Charlie, was that blow struck only at Abel, or would he have killed any and every one who represented God as did Abel? Would he have hated the same God likeness in every one?"

"Everybody," said Charlie. "It was not Abel as a person that he was mad at, but God."

"Who has most fully represented God's love to this world?"

"Jesus," said Charlie reverently.

"Yes, and were there any Cains in his day?"

"Oh yes, mama; I see what you mean. The high priests, the scribes, and the Pharisees, and the mob that shouted 'crucify him.'"

"Now, Charlie, why did they kill Jesus?"

"For the same reason that Cain killed Abel,—because they could not bear God's love. They did not want to even have a God over them, but wanted to rule themselves,—wanted to show themselves to be God, and get God out of the way, and every one that reminded them of him."

"Can you think of any angel who wanted to have the highest place?"

"Lucifer," said Charlie.

"You may turn and read what is said of his ambition in Isaiah 14:12-14."

Charlie read, "How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning. . . . for thou hast said in thy heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God, . . . I will be like the Most High."

"Then Jesus says he beheld him fall like lightning from heaven, that he is now the god of this world, that it is his spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience. There are two classes of influences at work in the world, and we may choose which influence we will come under. One influence is of God, the other of Satan. One leads to right doing, one to wrong, one to love, the other to hate, one to liberty for all, the other to bondage and persecution. In love is life and every blessing of full liberty; in self is bondage, destruction and death. You can see how choosing wrong, how setting up one's own way above God's way, leads to hatred of those who take an opposite course, and who represent God on the earth by obeying his commandments. The disobedient in all ages have been persecutors, and in times past, because they had power to do so, have imprisoned godly persons, have had them burned at the stake, tortured and put to death as Cain did Abel, and as the Jews did Jesus, simply because they were so deceived by choosing wrong that they wanted to get God out of the way. But in getting God out of the way, they cut themselves off from the only source of love, life and liberty, and left for themselves and their followers only isolation and death. The history of many a nation who has forsaken God shows this to be the truth.

"Now can you see clearly why Cain killed Abel?"

"Yes," said Charlie, "and there's a lot in it,—a whole lot in it. I should think people better read God's word, and do as he says, so that they will be safe, and kept from being on Cain's side of the question against God and his people; for there's a whole lot in it." F. B.
