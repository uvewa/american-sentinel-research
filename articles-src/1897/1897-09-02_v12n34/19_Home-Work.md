## Home Work.

We design to make this department intensely practical by providing interesting studies in different phases of the question of religious liberty, and also by arranging for home work.

There are many remarkable instances in history where the rights of conscience have come in conflict with the powers of the State, and some of the utterances of those against whom the laws were directed are memorable, and should be indelible stamped on the minds of all. Here is one:

"Let us reject this decree. In matters of conscience the majority has no power."

Who said this and what were the circumstances surrounding its utterance? What was the result?

We would suggest that our young friends look the matter up, and write out a concise statement of the case, say not to exceed 250 words, and if you will forward the same to us, we will be glad to give space in this department to the one which, in our judgment, seems to be the most meritorious. From whom shall we hear first?
