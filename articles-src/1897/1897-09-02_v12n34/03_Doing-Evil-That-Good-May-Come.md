Under the heading of "The First Sunday Law Case," a late issue of the Providence Journal contains the following:—

"A certain deacon in a Connecticut town, feeling that the new Sunday law ought to be enforced, purchased a pound of crackers of a fellow-citizen on the first day of the week for the express purpose of having him hauled into court. The seller was promptly acquitted. This is a further indication of the impracticability of the law; but the interest in the case lies in the conduct of the deacon. It never occurred to him, apparently, that his zeal had led him into an unneighborly and unchristian action, and that he who tempts a man to break the law is as much to blame as if he had broken it himself. But Sabbatarian enthusiasm plays the deuce with moral perceptions."
