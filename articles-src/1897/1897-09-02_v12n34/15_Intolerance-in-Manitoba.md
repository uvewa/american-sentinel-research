## Intolerance in Manitoba.

RELIGIOUS intolerance has shown itself in Manitoba. The situation is set before us in the following letter, from a reader of the SENTINEL in Winnipeg:—

Winnipeg, Manitoba, Aug. 23, 1897.

EDITORS AMERICAN SENTINEL: I write to inform you that the spirit of persecution has again broken out in this province. During the present summer three of our people have been arrested in different parts of this field for Sunday labor. The first was Jacob Nickel of Morden, who was released and sent home when it was found he would go to jail rather than pay a fine. This occurred in June.

Last week John McKelvy was incarcerated in the jail at Portage La Prairie, for Sunday work. His time in jail was to be five days, which will expire tomorrow, August 24.

Last Friday Edward Kelly of Winnipeg was summoned to appear the next day, to answer to the charge of carrying on his ordinary occupation on "the Lord's day, commonly called Sunday." I enclose an extract from the evening edition of the Free Press:—

"On the docket of the city police court this morning, appeared the name of the well-known barber, Mr. Edward Kelly, who is charged with violating the Sabbath ordinance by shaving customers on Sunday. This case is likely to develop into one of the most interesting that has ever come before the police court. Mr. Kelly is a Seventh-day Adventist, and in accordance with his religious belief he observes Saturday as the Sabbath day. On that day his shop on Market Street is closed. On Sunday, however, Mr. Kelly keeps his shop open for his customers. It is understood that the Barbers' Union is behind the prosecution in this case.

"Mr. Kelly discussing the matter this morning, said: 'I observe the Sabbath day and keep it holy as my Bible teaches me. The Sabbath day, according to my Bible teaching is Saturday and on that day my shop is never opened. I have arranged with my customers to shave them on Sunday. This is a matter of conscience with me and I consider this prosecution an injustice.'

"'But your religious beliefs will scarcely be accepted as excuse for violating the laws of the land?'

"'I am obeying the laws of God. I will obey the laws of man when they do not conflict with the laws of God, but when they do I will not raise man above God. I will go to jail before I will submit to injustice. If by going to jail I can help mankind to see the truth of the gospel I will willingly go.'

"The case was enlarged until Monday at Mr. Kelly's request. On Monday he will be ready to submit his defense to the court."

On Monday the case was again enlarged till Friday, the 27th. Mr. Kelly desires to become acquainted with the law in the case, and carry it to the Supreme Court if convicted in the lower courts. We await the outcome with deep interest.

Yours truly,

W. H. FALCONER.
