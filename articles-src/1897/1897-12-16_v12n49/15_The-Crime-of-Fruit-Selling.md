New York "World," December 6.

LENA DWARTSKY, of 47 Ludlow Street, was sobbing when she was placed at the bar at the Essex Market Court to-day.

She was arrested yesterday by Patrolman Barnitz, of the Eldridge Street station, for violating the Sabbath law. The patrolman testified that he caught her red-handed in the commission of the crime of selling apples.

The woman admitted her guilt, but claimed that she was compelled to do so to feed her children at home. She said that she was a widow, and begged to be allowed to go home.

The justice learned that fruit can be legally sold on Sunday, and discharged her. The policeman was very angry.
