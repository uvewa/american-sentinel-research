The Farm, Field, and Fireside, November 13, gives the following:—

"General Miles recommends that the new Chicago post-office be fortified. . . . The sight of the muzzles of rapid-firing and gatling guns sticking out of the windows of the post-office building is necessary."

Why is it necessary thus to fortify a post-office in this "Christian nation"?

A nation is made up of people; so in order to have a "Christian nation," it must be made up of Christian people. Do the people who make up this so-called "Christian nation" need "rapid-firing and gatling guns" to check the sins they are likely to commit?

Christianity means "Christ in you, the hope of glory."

The fruit of Christ's Spirit is "love, joy, peace. . . gentleness." "The wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable." So if Christ is in a man, he will be a gentle and peaceable man. Of what use, then, are the gatling guns that will shoot six hundred times a minute?

The Fireside continues:—

"The general confesses he got this inspiration from Constantinople, where, as everybody knows, the political, economic, and moral conditions are practically the same as those in the United States."

This is a sad commentary upon the condition of this "Christian nation." If our nation continues to follow the heathen nations, it will not be long until "Mene, Mene, Tekel, Upharsin" will be written upon the banquet hall of the once grand Republic, and the so called Christianity of this "Christian nation" will ripen into open anarchy.
