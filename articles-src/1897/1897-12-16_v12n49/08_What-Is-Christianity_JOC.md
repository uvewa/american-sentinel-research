RELIGION is defined to be a system of faith and worship, which gives expression in outward conduct of one's conscious relation to God. While this may be mainly true, it must be conceded that religion does not express itself through all men alike; for while some in their devotion to it are led to coerce others to adopt the precise forms of worship with themselves, others, none the less zealous in their profession, and equally trustworthy as citizens, seem perfectly satisfied to have every one about them enjoy the rights of private conscience the same as themselves. Which is the proper course? In theory few would hesitate to pronounce in favor of the latter, yet, in practice, there has been for ages a tendency among religionists of nearly every sort to adopt the former course.

But the strange feature of this fact, and one worth considering, is that, in most cases of coercion, the oppressor and the oppressed have called upon the same God, and borne the same religious name. Why did expression of outward conduct differ so widely in these? Were both genuine promptings from the one eternal Father? If not, which acted the wrong part; those who suffered hardship, or those who inflicted it?

These questions are as practical now as ever, because the principles of pure religion are abiding. The precepts and life of Christ were not only the foundation of the Christian religion, but they still remain the guide and test of personal conduct in its profession. Christianity is, therefore, the "practical conformity of one's inward and outward life to the spirit of the Christian religion."

This spirit is plainly set forth by the Saviour himself in the parable of the wheat and tares. A certain farmer sowed wheat in his field, but as it appeared above ground found tares mixed with it. Members of his family asked if they might not root up the tares, so that the wheat might more easily develop, but were answered emphatically, "Let both grow together until the harvest." The Saviour explained the harvest to be the end of the world, when he himself would attend to severing the tares from the wheat. Matt. 13:30–39.

It was not then, nor is it now, the prerogative of any man, or government of men to root up error by coercion. Men are authorized to teach the principles of truth, but never to compel others to receive them. Kept free from civil force, as first established, Christianity retains the gentle, persuasive influence with which it was first endowed, and which is now its only mainspring of power in the conversion of men to Christ. But when a state attempts to enforce religious forms by civil enactment, it does itself an injury, as well as those whom it seeks to control in religious matters; for inasmuch as men are made to violate conscience for fear of the law, they yield the principles of integrity, which are the best security of good citizenship.

But when men's consciences are thus outraged by civil law, so that they constantly live a lie before God, what is to save them from doing the same before the civil courts? Why should such men be dealt with summarily, if they dissemble, or defraud in business, or appropriate public funds to private use? Force one's conscience by law, to the destruction of his integrity before God, and the legitimate result will be waywardness in society and a menace to civil government.

This is not an overdrawn estimate. History abounds with illustrations of the baneful effects of the interference of civil power in behalf of religion. One historian says "that in proportion as the church became established, by means of power and riches, religion declined, insomuch that it could scarcely be descried, except in the earthquake of dissension, in the fire of malice, or in the still small voice of some obnoxious sect."—"History of Intolerance," Vol. 1, p. 324. As early as the fourth century, it is said that the bishop of Rome had so much patronage of civil power to bestow, that men of the most corrupt lives fawned upon him, with his seeming approval, hoping for place and power, until the pagan prefect of the city said, in tones of bitter irony, "Make me bishop of Rome, and I, too, will be a Christian."

There is no question as to the effect all this had upon the people at large. Religious devotions were prescribed by law, and proclaimed by those who had little regard for even common decency. The same authorities which prescribed forms of worship for the common people, winked at the irregularities of those at the head of the church. The case of the bishop accused of adultery, which was brought to the notice of Constantine, is an illustration to the point. The emperor quietly passed the matter by saying that if he chanced to surprise a bishop in such an act, he would cover him with his imperial mantle. —Ibid., p. 274.

This was but the legitimate result of a state-directed church. As long as the church stood aloof from the world, it was directed and upheld by the arm of Omnipotence; but when it sought alliance with earthly power, which is always opposed to God's rule, it virtually abandoned the infinite power of heaven, for one which, though in appearance more tangible, yet is entirely destitute of that which can direct the church in spiritual lines. In its original organization, the church was guided in policy by the will of God; after the exchange, it was controlled by the will of a majority of human minds, many of them destitute of even the form of spiritual service.

And to this day such expression of conduct is called Christianity. Many now are anxiously hoping for the day when the name of God shall be placed in the Constitution of our civil government, and the religion of Christ, as interpreted by men, be made the basis of legislation for all. But the dawning of that day will surely bring to this country the same system of religious oppression that prevailed in Europe during the Dark Ages. It cannot be otherwise, since the laws regulating the customs of Christianity were established once for all, by the Founder of the system, and therefore do not admit of change, or reenactment by civil power. The laws of civil government are only temporal, and subject to change with each incoming administration. Inasmuch as men do not see alike in moral matters any more than in secular, it follows that radical changes of religious forms are sure to take place, according as the religious sentiments of legislators vary. To enforce these changes by law upon those who are conscientiously following the bent of duty leading in another direction, deprives them of the free use of that which God has bestowed, namely, the rights of conscience. This point is well illustrated by the history of attempts in England to regulate the observance of Sunday, which will be cited in another paper.
