The Catholic Mirror, of November 6 denies the report that has been in circulation of late, that the bureau of Catholic Indian missions was to be abolished. "Upon the authority of the prelates having charge of Catholic Indian school and mission affairs," says the Mirror, "we are enabled to state that there has been no thought of discontinuing the services of the Catholic Bureau, but that, on the contrary, it will continue, as heretofore, to act as the representative of the Catholic Hierarchy before the government in matters pertaining to Indian affairs."
