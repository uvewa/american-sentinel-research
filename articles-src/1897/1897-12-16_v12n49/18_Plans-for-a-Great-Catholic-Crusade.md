As outlined in the Freeman's Journal, of November 27, a project is beginning to take shape in the minds of papal leaders for a great Catholic crusade which shall mark the close of the nineteenth century in a manner calculated to turn all eyes upon that church. Of this purpose the Freeman's Journal says:—

"The Right Rev. Charles E. McDonnell, D. D., Bishop of Brooklyn, has directed his clergy to abstain from the giving of missions in their several churches during the whole course of the year 1898. With the close of the coming December, therefore, these occasional periods of special interest in religious affairs, analogous in many ways to the so-called revival services in Protestant churches, in the administration of Catholic parishes, will be abandoned for a twelvemonth in the diocese of Brooklyn.

"So far as is known, no similar action has ever been taken by any Catholic bishop in this country, but Bishop McDonnell and his board of consulters determined upon this course at a recent meeting, in order that they might better prepare for a great spiritual awakening among their people in the year 1899, the last of the century, when the cause of religion will be presented from their pulpits, from January to December, by the most powerful and eloquent mission preachers in the land.

"In reaching the conclusion to make the year 1899 memorable in the history of the Catholic Church in America by this long series of missions, Bishop McDonnell becomes the first American bishop to take definite action with relation to the desire of the pope on the question, as is evinced in the following letter from Cardinal Jacobini, secretary of the Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith, which was addressed to the bishops throughout the world a short time ago:—

"You have doubtless become aware of the project, advanced by a number of men of great piety, to get the faithful throughout the universe at the close of the present century to affirm in a solemn manifestation, by a series of religious exercises, their love and gratitude to the all-powerful Redeemer of the human race.

"The design of these men in this initiative was to respond to the desire of our Holy Father, Pope Leo XIII, who wished to consecrate the epoch of transition from one century to another by an extraordinary invocation of the divine assistance of Jesus Christ as a happy presage of peace and control. . . .

"Here, assuredly, is a noble task, and I own that I am proud and happy to undertake it. For what could be more agreeable to my feelings than the occasion so favorably presented to me at the end of my days to employ all the strength that is still left me in promoting the glory of our Saviour—all the more, too, in these last days of a departing century. And what a century has been this of ours, in which proud men, relying on a science unworthy of the name, and displaying an activity which might be called feverish, have carried their audacious temerity to the extent of calling in question the origin of Christianity, or even presenting as a fiction, as a lying legend, faith in the divine person of the Saviour.

"Wherefore we shall fervently strive to make reparation for the great injuries done to our Master, to appease God's anger by our prayers, to exalt in paens of praise the holy name of Jesus Christ, who is the splendor of the glory and the perfect image of the substance of God. Such shall be the task in which we shall set forth all our zeal at the dawn of the new century."

There is plenty of evidence that the close of the century will be a stirring time in every quarter of the civilized world. The forces of evil, of error, intolerance, and despotism are everywhere on the aggressive; and the cause of liberty needs the active, earnest endeavors of every one of its friends.
