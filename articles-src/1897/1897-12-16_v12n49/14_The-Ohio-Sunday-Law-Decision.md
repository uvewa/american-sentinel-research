We made mention last week of the decision rendered by Judge Swartz in the police court at Columbus, Ohio, concerning the validity of a Sunday ordinance under which certain religious people of that city sought to punish the proprietor of a bowling alley for keeping his place open on Sunday. Doubtless it will be of interest and value to our readers to have the views of Judge Swartz on the subject presented in the language of this decision; and having the same before us in full, as printed in the Columbus Sunday Morning Press of November 28, we quote from the decision as follows:

"The question is to be decided by the tests of the constitutional authority of the council to regulate or prohibit occupations on the first day of the week.

"The power of the legislature, and consequently of the council, does not extend to any measure looking to the observance of that day as a religious duty. Under our constitution, all men are permitted to observe any religious rights or beliefs that they may wish, so long as they do not infringe upon the legal rights of others; or, they may observe none. In other words, there is an entire and absolute severance of church and state under our constitution, and any encroachment upon the clear line of severance between them is viewed with a jealous eye by the law, and by courts in construing and interpreting the law.

"Since the first construction of the constitution of 1851 on this point, by the late Judge Allen G. Thurman, in the Second Ohio State, 387 et seq., the line of authority upholding this view has been unbroken. We therefore dismiss from consideration any claim that might be made for the ordinance as valid on the ground of enforcing an observance of the day as a religious duty. That has been eliminated. Would the alleged offense be a crime per se, an offense wicked and injurious, an infringement on the rights of others, if indulged in on any other day of the week? Or is there something in it, in its necessary results and associations, that make it, when indulged in on the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday, an offense in itself and of itself, an infringement on the rights and privileges of others, or an abuse of the legal and proper demand that there shall be one day of rest in seven? If it is not immoral or wicked on any other day, then, on this reasoning, it becomes immoral and wrong to Christians on Sunday, and to Hebrews on Saturday. Conversely it is not immoral and is proper to Christians on Saturday and to Hebrews on Sunday. Other sects of religionists may adhere to views constituting another day of the week a holy day, and their judgment as to the morals of the inhibited game would be determined by their religious views.

But this ordinance does not make it a crime to play at ten pins on any other day in the week than on the first day, commonly called Sunday. It, therefore, does not inhibit it as a crime in itself, but as a crime when played on one particular day of the week. Without now going into the question as to whether its indulgence on a day consubstrated to rest by law and to religious observances and usages by a majority of our citizens, organically changes the moral conditions of the indulgence in this game, when played on the first day of the week instead of some other, it is enough to observe that the ordinance, in meeting this requirement to bring it within the police power, seems fatally defective. It makes no exception in behalf of that class of our people who conscientiously observe the seventh day of the week as their Sunday or Sabbath. In the City of Canton vs. Martin Nish, Ninth Ohio State reports, page 439, the Supreme Court says:

"An ordinance of a municipal corporation, prohibiting under a penalty the opening of shops, etc., for the purpose of business on Sunday, without excepting cases of necessity and charity, and without exempting from its operation persons who conscientiously observe the seventh day of the week as the Sabbath, is inconsistent with the laws of the State, and therefore void.

"That is the law laid down by our Supreme Court in determining the validity of this class of ordinances, and has ever since been followed so far as courts have passed upon the question.

"Further, this consideration of the case brings it within the conditions of the case of State vs. Powell, 38 Law Bulletin 302, recently in the Court of Common Pleas in Cuyahoga County, in which Judge Ong, on demurrer, decided that the statute on which this ordinance is based, is unconstitutional as to this class of cases. This court will not attempt to overrule either the Supreme Court, or the Court of Common Pleas. The demurrer is sustained, and the defendant is dismissed so far as the affidavit under consideration is concerned."

It will be observed that while this decision claims to rest upon the ground of the separation of church and state under the constitution of Ohio, it falls short of the real reasons upon which the unconstitutionality of a Sunday ordinance properly rests. For if the ordinance in question did exempt observers of another day than Sunday from its provisions, it would be really no more in harmony with the principles of separation of church and state than it is now. The virtue of an ordinance cannot be properly determined by its exceptions; it must be judged by its foundation principles. And the foundation principle of every Sunday ordinance is that the state has a right to direct religious observances. And this principle is false, and full of harm.
