*"The Truth Seeker," December 11.*

If we understand the following language, the Unitarians propose to give us a complete union of church and state. Says the *New Unity*, of Chicago:

"As every one is born a member of the state, he is by right, also, born a member of the church. Every one is a citizen; but every one is also a religionist. . . . This grand relation ought to and must be recognized. It is the evolution of the original human family on the religious side. In this internationalism, creed and law become one. Thou shalt love God with all thy heart, and thy neighbor as thyself, we believe will be not only the creed but the code of the coming society—both state and church. It follows once more that no man can, with righteousness, any more vacate his church obligations than his obligations of citizenship. It does not follow that he must acknowledge fealty to a sect or a narrowness; but he must cultivate his relation to God and humanity, and this must be an active love, involving organic work. To shirk religious obligation is precisely the same as to shirk civic duties. No honest man does the latter, no right-thinking man will do the former."

The doctrine is not new. It belonged to a system formulated by Jean Jacques Rousseau more than one hundred years ago. Rousseau, of course, was not orthodox. Like the editors of the *New Unity*, he did not accept any particular creed, but he thought there should be only one organization, the state-church, hyphenated. The sovereign people would settle the articles of a state religion, of which Rousseau said:—

"Without being able to oblige any one to believe them, he may banish from the state whoever does not believe them; he may banish them, not for impiety, but for unsociability—as persons incapable of sincerely loving the laws or justice, and of sacrificing themselves to duty if needful. . . . If any one, after having acknowledged these same dogmas, conducts himself as if he did not believe them, let him be punished with death."

Rousseau saw plainly enough that in order to establish and maintain his state-church everybody would have to belong to it, and that the nonconformity of even one citizen would be fatal to the wholescheme. You might as well permit desertion from an army.

If, as the editors of the *New Unity* say, every one is born a member of the church as well as of the state, we would like to know what church. The name of the state is found on the map, while that of the church is omitted. The law is in the statute books, but where is the creed? The penalty for disobedience of the statute is prescribed; will it be visited also upon those who disregard the church canons? If the creed and the code are to be the same thing, they will of necessity be equally binding, and church and state will have equal authority. But the editors of the *New Unity* may be sure of one thing, namely, that the creed would not be that of the Unitarian Church nor anything like it; and unless they are prepared to assume the obligations of a Roman Catholic, they have no business to be advocating an amalgamation of the ecclesiastical and the secular.
