CHARLIE WHITE came in from school one day in high spirits.

"O mother! Professor Carman is going to do the jolliest thing! He is going to begin to-morrow to give the girls and boys in our grade short talks on French history. We are to have note books and take down the most important thoughts at the close of the study, or while it is going on. He says we can learn history this way, and he hopes it will be a pleasure to us instead of a drudgery. 'Course I'm only fourteen, but it's time I knew more about the nations of our world than I do; don't you think so, mother?" and Charlie stopped—his enthusiasm had not allowed him to do so sooner—to take a long breath and await his mother's answer.

"Well, my boy, I'm sure I am much pleased with the idea, for I think French history is especially important for all to be well versed in just now; I hope you will be as well pleased all the time the study lasts."

"O, I know I will, mother. But what makes you think the history of France so important just now?"

"Because the indications are quite plain that our own government is fast following in her track, and to be 'forewarned is to be forearmed,' you know."

"But mother," said Charlie, who had always had a great longing to be a soldier, "I thought you did not believe in Christians arming themselves to fight."

"O no, Charlie, I don't mean that; but if we know what is coming, in advance, it will help us to be prepared. That is why our Saviour taught us to watch the signs of the times; it is why he told his disciples about the destruction of Jerusalem, so that those who believed in him might hurry to a safe place outside the walls."

"Well, I'm glad he's going to do it—professor, I mean—'cause, you see, Rob Billings and I are pretty stupid in history, anyway, and we're so anxious to pass well, so we don't miss our trip."

Robert and Charlie had been promised a trip to Paris another year, with their fathers, who were partners in business, if they passed well in their studies. Of course this naturally added not a little to their ambition.

The boys and girls were to meet at three o'clock in the class-room, and Professor Carman promised them a half hour's study.

"Don't you think it's a nice plan, Charlie?" said Rob, the next day. "We get that extra, you see, and we'll enjoy our trip as well again if we understand lots about the country."

Three o'clock came at last, and Professor Carman was pleased to see so many bright-eyed lads and lassies before him, for he had told them that they might act their pleasure about attending.

"I did not think," said the professor, smiling genially at the group before him, "to meet with so many boys and girls this afternoon. I had feared that but few would care to stay for further study after the regular study hours were over, but I hope you will learn to look forward to this hour as one of the most pleasant and profitable of your school life. You will please feel perfectly free at any time to ask a question, indicating your wish to do so by raising the hand. After a time, perhaps we will ask those who feel so disposed, to write short essays on the subject in hand.

"How many of my boys and girls can tell me the name of ancient France?"

"Gaul," was the quick response of half a dozen eager voices at once.

"Right. A great many years before Christ that was the name of the country. The inhabitants at that early date were very wild and uncultivated; and clothed as they were in the skins of wild animals, they might almost be mistaken for them. They were a warlike race, and they used the skulls of their enemies for drinking cups. The country was also filled with many wild animals. The people were thought to have sprung from the fierce Celtic race, which lived in Central Asia.

"To-day France is such a pretty country, with its orchards and beautiful vineyards, that it does not seem as if it ever could have been the home of wild, uncultured people, who cared so little about their personal appearance that they did not even comb their hair, which must have given them a very wild look.

"Now, children," said the teacher, pointing to the map on the wall, "I have brought a fine, large map of Europe, and hung it here, where you can all see it; because one ought never to study history without a map at hand. The city of Marseilles was first called Massilia, and was settled by Greeks from an Asiatic town, Phocea, about 600 years n. c. These barbarians, I mean the early inhabitants of Gaul, were wonderfully warlike, and used often to trouble their more civilized neighbors. Especially were they a great menace to Italy, and upon more than one occasion these lawless people set fire to the city of Rome.

"You will remember that the Apostle Paul wrote one of his epistles to Galatia, a country in Asia Minor, which was settled by these people. The Romans pronounced a curse upon any one who should undertake to cross the Alps, which, they declared, was a natural dividing line between Gaul and Italy. Yet after a while, they did this very thing themselves. They were anxious to add to their territory the pleasant region of France which has Marseilles, or Massilia, for its center. This they succeeded in doing about one hundred and fifty years before Christ. Meanwhile the Gauls quarreled so among themselves, that some of them called for aid from among the Germans. This caused immense numbers of people from beyond the Rhine to flock down into Gaul, so that the inhabitants were really between two fires,—the Romans on one hand, and the Germans on the other. It is at about this time that Julius Caesar appears in connection with the people of Gaul. He succeeds in putting the fierce German chieftain to flight, and possessing himself of the land under dispute. The inhabitants, after some desperate struggles, submitted to the Roman yoke. But the Romans had not learned the first blessed lesson of kindness to those who were weaker than themselves, and I fear they never learned it,—or certainly did not practice it. They were very cruel to those whom they had reduced to slavery, and they would often put to death the entire inhabitants of a conquered city,—men, women, and even helpless children.

"I see Jennie Jacobs has her hand raised."

"Yes, sir; I notice then that in these real early times the disposition of the strong to torment the weaker and make it hard for them, was just the same as it is to-day."

"Yes, Jennie, I am glad you mentioned this point, but now as our time is up, I will close by quoting a little verse to the point, which I wish you would all learn:—

" 'Tis thus that man to man behaves
Witness the planter and his slaves,
'Tis thus that state oppresses state.
And civil freedom meets its fate.' "
