December 31, 1897.

We wish to call attention to our offer of a fine Combination Teacher's Bible, postpaid, and the AMERICAN SENTINEL, one year, for $3.50, that it closes on the above-named date. All orders dated not later than December 31, 1897, will be honored. After that time the price will be higher. We can make this offer only by reason of a special arrangement with our manufacturers. All who have the Bible are loud in its praise. Order now. See advertisement on last page.
