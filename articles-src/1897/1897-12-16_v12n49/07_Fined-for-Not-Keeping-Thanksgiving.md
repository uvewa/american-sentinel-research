Not recently, indeed, has any person been fined for a reason of this nature, but such a thing is not unknown in the history of the United States; and the fact that it has occurred in the past suggests the thought that a recurrence of the same is entirely possible, if not probable. For history repeats itself, and as this incident shows, a regard for feast and fast days of governmental appointment tends naturally to find expression, when fully developed, in an enforced observance of such days by legal prescription. The following is from the Waterbury American, and gives the record of the prosecution as it was set down at the time, ninety years ago:

"WATERBURY, Nov. 26th, A.D., 1807, at evening, personally appeared David Beecher, Seymour Tyler, Freeman B. Hine, and Harvey Payne, and acknowledged before me, the subscribing authority, that they were guilty of a breach of a certain statute law, entitled an act to enforce the observance of days of public fasting and thanksgiving, by attending to servile labor and recreation, by chopping, shooting, hunting, etc., on the 26th day of November, it being a day appointed by the governor of this State to be observed as a day of public thanksgiving throughout this State.

"Wherefore, it is considered and adjudged by this court that the said David Beecher, Seymour Tyler, Freeman B. Hine, and Harvey Payne, each of them, pay a fine of $1.25 to Ashley Scott, town treasurer, for the benefit of the town of Waterbury, where said offense was committed.

"FREDERICK HOTCHKISS,
"Justice of Peace.

"On the same Thanksgiving night David Beecher and Seymour Tyler paid the prescribed fines of $1.25 each.

"Harvey Payne paid four days later, but no record appears that Freeman B. Hine met the demands of justice."—Waterbury American.
