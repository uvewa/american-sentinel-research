"Now, mama, we have come to the most interesting of all the beasts in this chapter," said Charlie, as he rustled the leaves of his Bible.

"Read the description the prophet gives of it, Charlie," said Mrs. Ross.

"After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth: it devoured and brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with the feet of it: and it was diverse from all the beasts that were before it, and it had ten horns."

"Whew!" exclaimed Charlie. "I never heard of any beast in nature like that, did you, mama?"

"No, dear, no beast God has made has ever been so perverted from its original nature. But this beast is a symbol of the fourth kingdom."

"O yes. I had almost forgotten that, and was thinking of it as a part of some terrible menagerie."

"Then it would be a good thing for you to refresh your memory, and read the explanation of this strange symbol in the 23d verse of the 7th of Daniel."

Charlie read: "The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be diverse from all kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down and break it in pieces."

"You spoke of the beast as being worse in character than any beast in nature; but you see, dear, that the beast is used as a symbol of a government unlike anything that God ordained. One could see that by the results of its sway, because, instead of building up, of protecting, or nourishing its subjects, it broke the earth in pieces, and stamped the residue with the feet of it. O Charlie, in this government we find something that is utterly foreign to the nature and object of the government ordained of God; for it is a representation of the selfish and satanic."

"Well, mama, it 'pears to me that we've been seeing that in every government we have studied,'" said Charlie roguishly.

"Yes, that's so. But while others were like a growing tree, this is the tree matured and in full fruitage. In this government Satan seemed to have been permitted to a greater extent than in any other, to exemplify his methods and character."

"Mama, it seems strange to me that God permitted him to work out such dreadful results."

"It used to seem strange to me, Charlie; but now I see the reason of it, and it seems a wise and wonderful thing."

"Why, mama?"

"Because this world is a stage upon which the drama of good and evil is being played by heavenly and hellish actors in the sight of an investigating universe, and the principles of God's method of government are on trial, and placed in contrast with those of Satan. Satan claimed in heaven that God was wrong, that the law of love was bondage, that each soul by right should be as God in position and power, that self-life, self-government, was better than love's life and love's government."

"Well, mama, I should think by this time the angels would be anxious to have the play come to an end."

"They are, dearie, and it soon will end."

"O mama, do you really think so?"

"Yes; but we will talk of that another time. We are forgetting about the beast. Now, Charlie, tell me what was the fourth kingdom upon the earth."

"Rome," said Charlie, striking an attitude and branching off into "Spartacus to the Gladiators," and gesturing wildly.

"Yes, the gladiatorial shows were a part of the fearful atrocities of Rome. Here is one of Dori's famous pictures, representing the amphitheater after a day of blood and death. You may see the bodies of the martyrs strewn on the stones."

"How calm it looks!" said Charlie. "See those lions prowling round, ready to eat up the corpses."

"Yes, but look at the holy stars and the angels that watch the scene."

"O mama, do you suppose that these poor men knew that God loved them, and that they did not die in vain?"

"It may be, dearie. Here is another picture of the amphitheater when all the aristocracy of Rome watched the conflict of the gladiators."

"O mama, did women go there?"

"Yes."

"What are they holding their thumbs down for?"

"It was a sign that no mercy was to be exercised by the victorious gladiator. You see he has his opponent down, and is looking up, hoping that they will let him spare his life, but you see every thumb is down."

"O, how horrible!" said Charlie.

"Yes, but this was only a small part of Rome's cruelties. Gibbon calls it 'The Iron Monarchy,' and says, 'It was impossible to fly, and fatal to resist.' 'All roads lead to Rome,' was a saying that arose because Rome had subdued the earth. You have read of Caesar's wars in your Latin lessons, and know how he brought specimens of the nations he conquered to Rome, chained to his chariot wheels."

"Yes, mama, I was thinking the other day of an ovation they gave Caesar, when they honored him as a god, and I wondered if in the shouts of praise he remembered the groans of the slaughtered, the cries of widow and fatherless, or thought of the horrible battlefields where lay the dying and the dead. O, I am so glad I wasn't Caesar."

"So am I, Charlie; for then I should not have had you."

"Caesar's insatiable ambition tells the whole story of Rome. It was first power, then pride, prejudice, and perdition. There are some "p's" for you to remember and profit by. There is another name in Roman history that stands for cruelty even more than Caesar's: do you know who I mean?"

"Nero?" said Charlie.

"Yes. What did he do?"

"O, mama, he was a perfect monster. He set Rome on fire, and while homes were burning to ashes, he bade his musicians play to him, and when the people turned on him for this terrible deed, he laid the blame on the Christians, and had them sewed up in the skins of animals and tossed to dogs, and set them on fire to light his pleasure gardens by night, ugh!" exclaimed Charlie, with a look of disgust.

"The world hates Nero," said Mrs. Ross, "yet Nero was only the outworking of self."

"Well, we might name many Roman emperors who were equally wicked and cruel according to their ability. Wild persecution raged against those who were true to Christ during those old pagan days. Do you know what kind of government Rome was?"

"Why, it went under seven forms of government. It started out all right, or at least it was all right when it was a republic; for the United States is a republic and it is all right. I don't know as I know just what you mean."

"Did it legislate in matters of religion?"

"I should say so. The emperor was pontifex maximus, and that means chief priest, and the forum was crowded with the images of gods."

"Here is a quotation from Cicero that tells the spirit that actuated Rome. You can see that there was no religious liberty permitted. Cicero says, 'Let no one have separate gods, or new gods, and let no one privately worship even foreign gods, unless they have been received by public authority.' Death or banishment was the penalty for bringing in any new ideas about religion. You see the devil was behind that decree; for he knew that the religion of Jesus was to be preached in all the world, and he wanted to provide for the death of its advocates. Some one says that the utterance of Rome to Christianity was, 'You have no right to be.' Do you wonder that Rome was likened to a great and terrible beast with iron teeth, who stamped the residue with its feet, when she stamped out all individuality? When new ideas about God and religion are prohibited, thought is fettered in everything. Invention ceases, literature languishes, and the world comes to a standstill."

"And now, Charlie, under what power was Christ put to death?"

"Didn't the Jews put him to death?"

"Did they? Think. Who was Pontius Pilate and Herod?"

"O, I remember: they were Roman rulers."

"The Jews had no power to crucify Christ. You remember just before Jesus was born on earth, that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be taxed."

"I remember, mama."

"It was Roman authority that condemned Jesus, Roman soldiers who nailed him to the cross. There is meaning in this fact, dear, that may be you will not comprehend; but in Roman rule, Satan had his way, and his way from the beginning was to put to death the Son of God; and to try to hurl God from his throne."

"Rome was the instrument that Satan used to put out the light of life, and that government took the form of church and state, a form that Christ condemned when he said, 'My kingdom is not of this world,' and, 'Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's.'"

"Well, dear, we'll stop right here, and next time talk of the horns and the horn with the eyes of a man."

"I wish we could go right on."

"No, Charlie, here are some pages in history I wish you to read that will make you glad you waited."

F. B.
