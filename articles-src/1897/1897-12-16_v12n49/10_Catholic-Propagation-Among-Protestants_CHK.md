"LET us all realize that the providence of God has made our country an arena for the champions of the truth. In no section of the world has the truth of God so fair a field as in America." Thus writes "Rev." Walter Elliott, C. P., in the *Catholic Mirror*.

Whatever view Protestants may have with reference to the progress of Catholicism in this country, it is certain that the Catholics themselves are highly pleased with the advancement they have made. They rejoice over the fact that this country presents the fairest field for the propagation of Catholic doctrine that can be found anywhere.

It is not without good grounds for it that the Catholic Church takes such a hopeful view of the situation. The soil of the world in this nineteenth century of enlightenment and progression is just as good for the Catholic seed as was that of the fourth and fifth centuries.

It is altogether true that no other country has been so fair a field for the truth of God as this country, which, in reality, is to say that never was a field, apparently, so uninviting to the Catholic religion. When this government was started, its founders bounded it in such a way that they hoped Roman Catholic principles would never obtain a foothold here. So far as it could be done in a governmental way, everything was done to shut them out.

This is not saying that the Catholics have no right to propagate their religious views in this country. They have just as much right to do this as any other church or denomination. The danger that our fathers foresaw was that the Catholic Church would get hold of the civil power and use it for the furtherance of her own ends. So long as she is deprived of that means she is no more dangerous here than any other sect. The steps then taken against the Catholic Church were not against the Catholic Church, as such, but against the principle represented by that body; for the principle is just as dangerous when it is fostered under another name.

That being so, it was the design to prevent all religious sects from acquiring control, in any way, of the civil power.

Only apparently, however, was this country an uninviting field for Roman Catholicism; for American history is furnishing abundant proofs for the statement made above, that the soil of the world in this nineteenth century is just as good for the Catholic seed as was that of the fourth and fifth centuries.

Years ago a writer who is thoroughly acquainted with this subject, said: "A day of great intellectual darkness has been shown to be favorable to the success of popery. It will yet be demonstrated that a day of great intellectual light is equally favorable for its success."

This is the truth; and so-called Protestantism is doing much to demonstrate it. "Christian citizenship" leagues, "higher criticism," and "science, falsely so-called," are doing their work, and the Word of God, the only safeguard against Catholicism, is being undermined, and Protestants are being left without chart and compass. For what matters it though there be a thousand Bibles in the home, if the Bible is not studied, and studied too as the Word of God, as indeed it is.

With the pretensions that the Catholic Church makes it would not be strange if she should come with some specious arguments supposed to be based upon the Word. And the average Protestant finds himself no match for his wily foe.

In the early days of the Reformation it was Protestantism that was aggressive. But now the papacy feels that she can be on the aggressive. In the article referred to above it is said: "Always, . . . does the Catholic layman find an audience for the truth among his non-Catholic neighbors. Everywhere does the Catholic priest find it easy to secure a public hearing. 'I never yet have failed,' says Cardinal Gibbons, 'to find our separated brethren not only ready, but anxious to listen to the claims of the church.'"

They see their chance, and they are making the most of it.

Only within the past three years diocesan missionary organizations have been introduced, and now there are over a score of priests who have been wholly set apart by their bishops for the conversion of Protestants.

Think of it! Here are priests being sent out for the sole purpose of capturing "non-Catholics," devoting their whole time to propagating their doctrines among Protestants.

And what have been the results?—Simply that large numbers from the ranks of the Protestants have been brought into the fold of the Catholic Church. Not long ago in this city—New York—there were received into the Catholic Church over two hundred candidates, of whom more than a hundred were formerly Protestants; and this was the result of only a few months' effort.

But why is Protestantism so impotent, so weak? The answer is not difficult. It is because of forsaking the Bible, and standing upon genuine Catholic ground. With the Protestants generally, it is not, as in former times, "the Bible and the Bible only," but it is now really "the Bible and Tradition." That being so, it can mean nothing else than Catholic success.

Even where there is opposition to Catholicism, it is chiefly not because people are intelligent upon the subject, but because of bigotry and prejudice. But this is not argument—it is not reason. It will generally be found that but very few Protestants are acquainted with the first principle of popery. It is true they know there is such a power as the papacy, but what makes the papacy they cannot tell. And that being so, it is not to be wondered at, that, when they themselves, stand squarely upon Catholic ground, they do not know it.

Fettered as the Protestants are with the Sunday institution, purely a creation of the Catholic Church, with not a single scripture authorizing its observance, the Catholics certainly have no reason to be discouraged. With that one weapon they can silence all opposers, save the few who stand squarely on the Word of God.
