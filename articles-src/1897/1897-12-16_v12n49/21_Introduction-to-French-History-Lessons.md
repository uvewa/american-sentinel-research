We publish this week the first of a series of "Lessons in French History," written especially for this department of the SENTINEL, and which will continue through the greater part of the coming volume. We believe parents and others will see in them just the thing to interest the youth in those principles and events a knowledge of which will be invaluable to them at this time. Read the first one and see if you do not agree with us on this point.—Editor.
