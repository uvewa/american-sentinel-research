Often, in controversy, persons think that by saying sharp, smart, and insulting things they have gained their point. No mistake can be greater. Christ's victories are not won by witticisms and taunts, but by solid truths and living testimonies. Dr. Scudder, the East Indian missionary, relates the following:—

"A Hindoo, on one occasion, said to a missionary, 'Reviling our gods, criticising our Shastras, and ridiculing our ritual will accomplish nothing; but the story which you tell of Him who lived and died and rose again—that story, Sir, will overthrow our temples, destroy our ritual, abolish our Shastras, and extinguish our gods.'

"In this sign conquer. Overcome by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of your testimony. Leave Satan his weapons,—take unto yourselves the whole armor of God. And remember that 'the sword of the Spirit' is the only offensive weapon found in the gospel armory. But 'there is no sword like that.' It has hewn the path of victory before the war-worn church,—and as yet has lost none of its edge or power. Let us use that weapon! Let us tell to the dying that message of eternal life. Let us proclaim the gospel, assured that our labor will not be in vain."
