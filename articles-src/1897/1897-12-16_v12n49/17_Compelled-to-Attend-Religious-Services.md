The Kansas City World reports that Marshal Chiles, who is in charge of the jail of Jackson County, Mo., has made an order compelling all the inmates of the jail to attend religious services on Sunday. And this, it appears, is part of an arrangement made with a religious league for giving the prisoners religious instruction: it being the part of the league to provide the instruction, and of the marshal to provide the audience. As might have been anticipated, the plan does not work perfectly. One of the prisoners is quoted as saying to a World reporter:—

"These people don't understand us. They come and talk right at us and only harden us. Some of the prisoners are Catholics and some of the workers are strong A. P. A.'s, who never lose an opportunity to insult the Catholic belief."

Those who refuse to attend religious services, the report says, are deprived of food until they change their minds; which means, of course, until they so far lose what little regard for truth and honesty they have left that they will say they have changed their minds, when in reality there has been no change of mind at all. For any person knows that an individual cannot be made any more desirous of attending religious services by being starved.

The prisoner is right. It is a case of misunderstanding, on the part of both the marshal and the teachers of religion,—a misunderstanding of human nature and of the nature of Christianity. Christianity is free; and freedom being the very essence of its nature, it is evident that it must lose its force entirely when it is brought to people under compulsion. The prisoners can be touched by its freedom: but force can only repel them farther from it.
