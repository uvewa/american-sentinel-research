To one who would trust to the "enlightened spirit of the nineteenth century" to preserve the interests of mankind from the disasters which overtook them in the Middle Ages, there is food for thought in the following words of Bishop Doane, of the Protestant Episcopal diocese of Albany, N. Y.:—

"Ill suited as the creation of a papacy seems to be to the temper and spirit of this age, we cannot close our eyes to the fact that the most violent papal claim ever made was made, not in the days of feudalism and paternalism, but in our own days, at the Vatican Council, by a body of bishops, many of whom live in free countries and under constitutional government in various forms. The papacy has developed its intensest papalism in the latter half of our own century."
