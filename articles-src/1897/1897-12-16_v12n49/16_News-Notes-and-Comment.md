The most noteworthy thing about the President's message to Congress, if we may judge from press comments, is the virtual repudiation by the chief executive of one of the most important promises contained in the political platform of the party in which the people voted their confidence a year ago last November. It is that promise of the platform which relates to the war in Cuba.

***

Upon that point the platform says: "The government of Spain having lost control of Cuba, and being unable to protect the property or lives of resident American citizens, or to comply with its treaty obligations, we believe that the government of the United States should actively use its influence and good offices to restore peace, and give independence to the island." The significant part of this utterance, and that upon which the party most relied to secure the support of the people, is the last clause.

***

Of the platform which includes this declaration, the President, in his speech of acceptance, made in June, 1896, said: "The platform adopted by the Republican National Convention has received my careful consideration, and has my unqualified approval."

***

And now, in his message to Congress, the President says this: "It is honestly due to Spain and to our friendly relations with Spain that she should be given a reasonable chance to realize her expectations and to prove the efficacy of the new order of things to which she stands irrevocably committed." It is needless to add that Spain's "expectations" and her "new order of things" do not in the least degree look to the "independence of the island." They look in exactly the opposite direction.

***

The incident only illustrates the fact that political promises are made more for the purpose of trading upon the support of the people, than for the upholding of what the people conceive to be right and justice. In the political code of ethics, expediency is a word which ranks above all others. And he who can so feel the pulse of the people as most accurately to determine what promises it is most expedient to make to secure the people's support, and how the people can be humbugged in such a way that they will not find it out, is fitted to shine as a star of the first magnitude in the political firmament of this day.

The other day—it was on Sunday—a woman was arrested in the streets of this city for selling apples. When she was brought before the justice the next day, it seemed as though a case would be made out against her, notwithstanding her plea that her utmost efforts were required to keep herself and her children from starving. But the justice, having proceeded to look up the "law" on the subject, finally discovered that selling apples on Sunday was not a crime, as had been supposed, and the woman was accordingly set at liberty.

***

Could such a thing as this ever take place in any other way than through the operation of a Sunday law? Has any other law such anomalous features as has this law? Think of a city magistrate having to look through the code in order to determine whether selling apples on Sunday was or was not a crime! He was an intelligent man; he was well educated; he had good reasoning powers; he had the natural ability of any upright character to distinguish between right and wrong. But none of these things could give him any clue by which to determine whether this woman had committed a crime. So all these faculties had to be laid aside, and the case decided by a simple reference to what was said in the code.

***

If the judge had been looking for the penalty which had been prescribed for a transgression of some sort, there would have been nothing surprising in this; for it is frequently necessary for judges to refresh their memories as regards various specifications which the law lays down. But here the judge and all parties concerned were in absolute ignorance as to whether the act done constituted a crime or was entirely innocent. Who ever heard of a proceeding like this, disconnected from the operation of a Sunday law? And what clearer proof could be wanted that the provisions of such a law have their origin neither in justice nor common sense?

***

And now will somebody please tell us—some advocate of the Sunday laws, we would prefer—what is the use of cumbering the machinery of government with a law that declares something to be a crime which nobody, from consulting his reason or his sense of right and wrong, would ever imagine to be a crime at all? Are there not crimes enough to occupy the attention and absorb the energies of our departments of justice, without making crimes out of innocent acts? What time have policemen to spend, properly, in arresting such "criminals," or judges in passing upon their cases, or other officials in taking care of them after conviction? Is the country so free from murder, burglary, arson, robbery, assault, etc., that the force of the machinery of justice can be profitably expended in dealing with acts which reason and common sense cannot recognize as criminal at all? And have the people such a surplus of money that they can afford to expend it to no purpose? These are questions for the people to consider.

We spoke of the anomalies of the Sunday law. It might be well to mention some of them, as exemplified in this city. The case we have referred to illustrates some of them. It is all right to sell tobacco on Sunday, but a crime to sell clothing. Up to 10 o'clock, A. M., it is all right to sell groceries; but by virtue of the clock's striking that hour, it immediately and without further ceremony becomes a crime! It is all right to shave people up to the hour of 1 o'clock, P. M., but by reason of the sun's position in the heavens being such as to indicate that this hour has passed, the barber's profession becomes a crime dangerous to civilization! It is a crime to sell ice on a hot Sunday in summer, but all right to sell cigars, the latter being recognized by the law as one of the necessities of life! What else can be expected, under such a code, than that policemen, judges, and people in general, will get into confusion not only as regards the requirements of the law itself but as regards the essentials of justice and good government as well? A law must embody reason and justice; otherwise it can work only harm to every interest of the people.
