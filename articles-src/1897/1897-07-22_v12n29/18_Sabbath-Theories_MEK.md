If a record had been made of the various and contrary positions which have been taken by the Protestant ministry in regard to the nature and obligation of the Sabbath, it would present a mass of contradictions and absurdities such as could scarcely be equalled in the whole range of religious discussion.

The latest addition to this tower of Babel that we have seen is by Bishop Vincent, of the M. E. Church. The Chicago Times-Herald, of May 24, reports him as follows:

"Bishop Vincent, of the M. E. Church, talked to the students of the University of Chicago last evening on Sunday observance. He spoke in Kent Theater, and at the beginning of his address surprised his hearers by saying that he did not care on what day anyone observed the Sabbath, just so one day of the week was set apart for meditation and rest. It made no difference, he stated, whether the day was observed between sunrise and sunset, or within other division of time.

"Bishop Vincent drew his conclusions from the text that the Sabbath is made for man and not man for the Sabbath. But, although the eminent divine was liberal in his views as to the particular day to be set apart, he was equally positive in his statements as to what uses the day should be put. He said that he was in favor of a return to the old Puritan Sunday rather than have the day of rest used for anything else than religious purposes. He raised the question of how far a young man might use the day in recreation or business, concluding that the doer must be his own judge, and that society was incompetent to decide in individual cases.

"He argued, in conclusion, that for the safe-guarding of American institutions, the people must have a day of rest, and that the day should be spent in religious observance. The contrary would be certain to carry us into anarchy and ruin."

The M. E. Church ministers have very generally and strenuously maintained the doctrine of a change of the Sabbath from the definite seventh day to the definite first day of the week. To sustain this idea certain scriptures have been quoted as proof that this was an apostolic practice. True, this is nothing but a card-board theory with neither foundation nor cohesion, but at least it had the merit of being definite. Now Bishop Vincent sweeps away the whole idea of the transfer of the Sabbath from one definite day to another, and leaves the observance of the day to be determined by individual opinion!

While the bishop's theory gives up much that his church has strenuously maintained, albeit without any proof, he brings forward nothing for unanimity but much for division. But the bishop is certainly consistent in one thing. He acknowledges that society cannot control the individual conscience in the matter of Sabbath-keeping. Will all the M. E. Church be as consistent upon this point as is Bishop Vincent?
