Under this heading the Lowell (Mass.) Mail, of July 10, prints the following:—

"Somersworth, N. H., July 9.—Mayor B. F. Hanson, of this city, who is the proprietor of a livery stable, was arraigned in the police court this morning on complaint of Louis Jacques, for an alleged violation of the Sunday law. It appeared from the evidence presented in the case that horses had been cleaned, carriages washed, and teams let on Sunday, for which money was also received, on the sabbath.

"The mayor pleaded not guilty and stated that the teams which were taken out on Sunday were engaged on a week day. He also claimed that the prosecution was brought against him through spite. The court found the mayor guilty and imposed a fine of $5 and costs. Mayor Hanson appealed.

"The prosecution is the alleged result of Mayor Hanson's action in closing soda water and confectionery stores and restaurants on Sunday, in an endeavor to enforce the laws governing sabbath breaking.

"Jacques has been fined twice within the past month in the police court for keeping open on Sunday, and Jacques states decidedly that he will not permit the mayor to run his livery stable on Sunday if he has to close."
