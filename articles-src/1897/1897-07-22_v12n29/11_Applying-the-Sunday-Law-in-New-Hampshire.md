The endeavor to make an individual or class of the people conform by law to some other individuals' standard of righteousness, naturally provokes retaliation. Instead of making for righteousness and peace, it produces exactly the opposite.

This is illustrated by the effort to enforce the Sunday law in Somersworth, N. H. A restaurant keeper is retaliating upon the mayor (who is proprietor of a livery) for having enforced the law upon the restaurants, and now a lawyer of the town, says the Boston Globe, of July 10, has raised the question whether the business of running the church is to be made an exception to a law which forbids all unnecessary work and noise on the first day of the week. This lawyer has, says the Globe, notified Marshal Heaton that he must stop the unnecessary and excessive ringing on Sunday of the Methodist Church bell, near his residence.

There can be no reason why the law should not apply as well to the church business as to any other, if it be, as said, a purely civil regulation.

The Golden Rule, of June 17, states with reference to the Sunday observance feature of the Christian Endeavor convention, that "California is in especial need of all the help Christian people can give in the maintenance of the Lord's day, because in that State especially the sabbath is rapidly becoming a holiday rather than a holy day, since there is no sabbath law there."

Does not California have God's Sabbath law,—the fourth commandment,—the same as in other States? And is a law of the State so much higher than God's law that it can make the day of rest a holy day, while the law of God can but make it a holiday? Is there less force in God's law than in man's law? Has an act of the legislature any power to produce holiness? These questions answer themselves.
