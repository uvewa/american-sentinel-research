HAVING given in brief outline some of the principal features of the religions of Japan, we now inquire into the relation they sustain to the State. And we remark at the outset, that owing to the indefiniteness of the Japanese conception of both religion and State, it is not easy to determine just what the relationship between them is. For example, the emperor is regarded till this day as a heaven-descended monarch, and prominent among the myriad deities of the Shinto pantheon are the apotheosized spirits of dead rulers.

Prior to the days of Jimmu Tenno, who is accounted by Japanese annalists as the first human sovereign, the Japanese believe that their country was ruled directly by the gods themselves. Jimmu Tenno himself is supposed to be fifth in descent from the sun-goddess Amaterasu, and the present emperor a direct descendant of Jimmu Tenno.

Concerning this fact Griffis remarks: "In this enlightened age, when all authority is challenged, and a century after the moss of oblivion has covered the historic grave of the doctrine of divine right, the Japanese still cling to the divinity of the Mikado." One of the titles of the emperor is Ten shi, literally, son of heaven. For ages he was considered too sacred to be looked upon by the rude gaze of the populace, and even to day no one is allowed to look down upon him from an eminence. While residing in Kobe, it was our privilege to see his majesty as he rode by in closed carriage. Thousands of eager spectators thronged the streets, but all heads were bared, and not one, even of the most curious, was allowed to stand in upstairs windows or view the procession from any height at all.

This doctrine of the divine origin of the Mikado, that has been implicitly believed by the masses for centuries, implies an interfusion of religion and State that approximates a theocracy. And we are constrained to believe that their institutions were theocratical in former years.

Professor Chamberlain, an authority in things Japanese, says in reference to the early days of Shinto, "the Japanese had no notion of religion as a separate institution." And even after the introduction of Buddhism, the Mikado still being the "Son of Heaven," the theory of government was unchanged. But what was the extent of influence exerted by religion upon legislation does not seem to be clear. For centuries a dual form of government existed. The heaven-descended Mikado, too sacred to be serviceable, was little more than a royal figurehead, while the Shogun, or generalissimo, vigorous, aggressive, ambitious, virtually held the reins of control in his hands, and guided the chariot of State according to his own selfish desires. But with all his power he never claimed the prerogatives of the emperor. He was theoretically his majesty's servant, while in fact he was master. He upheld the popular superstition concerning the divinity of the Mikado, and inculcated reverence for his person.

The laws that were promulgated were an admixture of moral and civil duties. In the "Legacy of Iyeyasu," a code of laws numbering one hundred, sixteen consist of moral maxims, fifty-five pertain to politics, twenty-two refer to legal matters, and seven relate to episodes in Iyeyasu's personal history. There was no sharp discrimination made between law and morality—between the duties of the citizen and the excellencies of the man. This confusion of the civil and moral in governmental affairs existed till the promulgation of the constitution in February, 1889. At that time the constitution, which clearly defines the duties and privileges of citizens, was given, and since then Japan has taken her place among the constitutional monarchies of the world. It is true that even now Shinto is the national religion.

In 1868, as the result of a concatenation of circumstances partly religious, partly political, and partly literary, Buddhism was disestablished and disendowed, and Shinto again installed as the religion of State. The Council for Spiritual Affairs was established and given equal rank with Council for State. Shintoists were led to rejoice at the promise of an era of prosperity before them. But their system was too weak and shadowy to influence the hearts of the people. Buddhism soon rallied, and in consequence the Council for Spiritual Affairs was reduced to the rank of a department, then to a bureau, and finally to a sub-bureau. In name Shinto is still the official cult. Certain temples are maintained out of public moneys, and the presence of certain State officials is required from time to time at ceremonies of a half-religious, half-courtly nature. But its practical influence upon the government is small. This fact is clearly shown by an article of the constitution which declares that priests and religious teachers of all kinds are not eligible to seats in the Imperial Diet. Buddhism, though disestablished, is far more potent, and in an indirect way, capable of exerting a far greater influence upon legislation.

Under the constitution a good degree of religious freedom is now enjoyed. In defining "Rights and Duties of Subjects," Art. XXVIII reads: "Japanese subjects shall, within limits not prejudicial to peace and order, and not antagonistic to their duties as subjects, enjoy freedom of religious belief." This definition of rights has already proved a blessing to persecuted Japanese Christians, and has multiplied the liberties of the missionaries and enlarged the sphere of their usefulness. The wave of religious legislation has not yet reached Japan, and may the Lord restrain it till the Third Angel's Message shall have been heard throughout its length and breadth.
