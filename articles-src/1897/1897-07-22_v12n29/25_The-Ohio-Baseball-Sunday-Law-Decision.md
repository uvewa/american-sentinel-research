The decision of Judge Ong, in the Common Pleas Court at Cleveland, Ohio, July 9, in the case of the State of Ohio vs. John Powell, representing the Cleveland baseball club, adds one more chapter to the fund of legal literature respecting the validity of Sunday laws. The substance of Judge Ong's ruling (which we take from the Cleveland Recorder, of July 10), is as follows:

"It will be observed that Section 7032A provides that 'whoever on the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday, participates in or exhibits to the public with or without charge for admittance, in any building, room, ground, garden or other place in this State, any baseball playing, he or she shall, on complaint made within twenty days thereafter, be fined in any sum not exceeding $100, or be confined in the county jail not exceeding six months, or both, at the discretion of the court.' It is perfectly apparent to the mind of the court, and we think it must be to every one learned in the law, that such a statute must and does rest for its validity on one of two predicates, to wit: it must either be unlawful or an offense to play or exhibit baseball on Sunday because it is Sunday, or it must rest, in order to be an offense, upon the fact that it is an immoral game or exhibition falling clearly within the police power or regulation, and therefore, a crime and a violation of its provision punishable as therein provided.

"Can the statute, then, be upheld, and is it a constitutional act as resting upon the predicate that it is unlawful and a crime to play baseball on Monday, or any other day of the week. If it rests upon the fact or is made a crime because it is played on Sunday, then it is clearly in conflict with the constitution and cannot be upheld, because the doctrine is well settled, and especially in Ohio, that all statutes which inhibit common labor,—statutes that refer to 'the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday,' are not enacted or enforced to compel the observance of that day as a day of religious worship, but as a day set apart by the statutes of Ohio as a day of rest.

"No statute could be upheld under our constitution for one moment that required the people of the State of Ohio to attend any kind or any form of religious service on Sunday or any other day of the week. Such an act would be clearly in violation of the spirit and language of the organic law of the State, but no more so than would be a statute which undertakes to make the omission or commission of an act a crime because it is done or omitted to be done on the first day of the week.

"Again, if the power did exist to enact the statute under consideration and inhibit the exhibition or playing of baseball upon Sunday, then it would be clearly void because it makes no exception in behalf of that class of people who conscientiously observe the seventh day of the week as Sabbath. The Supreme Court of Ohio have two or three times very distinctly declared that a statute providing for the observing of the first day of the week, as a day of rest, is void and unconstitutional unless it contains a provision exempting those who conscientiously observe the seventh day of the week as Sunday for the operation of the statute.

"Whether the legislature of Ohio may or may not enact and place upon the statute books a section that would be constitutional and valid as inhibiting the playing of baseball on the first day of the week, we are not called upon to say; but clear it is to the mind of the court that as the statute now exists, enacted and grouped among a lot of immoral games, such as gambling, sale of intoxicating liquors, etc., the provision therein referring to the game of baseball is unconstitutional and void."

This decision, while its practical effect is against Sunday legislation, still comes far short of what might have been stated with perfect truthfulness, upon the subject. The judge discriminates between rest and religious worship, two things which are distinct from each other in all ordinary cases, but which blend in one when we come to the matter of the observance of the Sabbath. Hence his argument at this point is defective. But this is purely a matter of religious belief—a truth which rests wholly upon a scriptural basis; and it serves here to illustrate the fact that a Sunday law must, in its very nature, involve a religious controversy.

The court which is called to pass upon the validity of a Sunday law cannot avoid coming in contact with a religious question; namely, whether the mere act of resting on Sunday is or is not an act of religious worship. And this is a question which no lawyer or judge, as such, is competent to answer. It is answered by revelation, and by that alone.

Hence a Sabbath law is, in its very nature, a thing which has no business outside the province of religion, and therefore no proper place upon any of the statute books of civil government.
