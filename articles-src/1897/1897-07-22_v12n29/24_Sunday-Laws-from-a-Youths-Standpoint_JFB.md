CHARLIE—Do you really think, George, that Sunday laws are wrong?

GEORGE—Yes; I know that they are wrong.

Charlie—What makes you think so?

George—Well, I will tell you. Somebody sent father some papers called the AMERICAN SENTINEL, and I read them, and I tell you, Charlie, I got more out of them on religious liberty than I ever knew before; and father says he has, too.

Charlie—What do you mean by religious liberty? I don't know that I just understand what that means.

George—Why, that means that the Government should not make laws to try to compel men to be religious or to keep Sunday, but to leave every one free to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience.

Charlie—Oh yes, I see; it means the same as the First Amendment to the Constitution, where it says "Congress shall make no laws respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof." We had that in our lesson on "civil government" in school just a few days ago.

George—That's it, exactly, Charlie; Sundays laws are contrary to the Constitution and take away our religious liberty; and the paper I spoke of shows that Sunday laws are not only contrary to the Constitution, but also contrary to the words of Christ, for you know he says, "Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's." The things of Caesar means the government of the State, and the things of God, the government of God. To keep a day as a Sabbath holy unto God is something that belongs alone to God, and the State should have nothing to do with it.

Charlie—Would it not be wrong for me to work on Sunday?

George—If you believed that Sunday is the day that God commands you to rest on and then you should go right on and work on that day, you would be sinning against God, and you would have to give an account to Him alone and to no one else. But suppose you believed that the seventh day or Saturday is the Sabbath and kept it, as many good people do, and as the commandment plainly tells us to do, and then went quietly about your work on the first day of the week, wherein would you harm any one else? Could not everybody else go to meeting or stay at home or do as they liked just the same as though you were sitting in the house or at church, or just as they do on other days of the week.

Charlie—Why, yes, I should think so. But would I not be casting a bad influence if I should work on Sunday?

George—No; not if you believed that the seventh day and not the first day is the Sabbath. Suppose you honestly believed that the seventh day or Saturday is the Sabbath, and that you ought to keep it, and that God commanded you to work six days, and then you would keep Sunday because you were afraid or ashamed to work on that day; what kind of an influence would that be? Would that not be a bad influence rather than to go on and work on the first day as God commands you, and as He himself did? and would not the State be exerting a worse influence in compelling you to keep Sunday contrary to your religious convictions than you would were you to act according to your convictions.

Charlie—I believe it would, and I am almost convinced that Sunday laws are wrong and Sunday-keeping, too. Are you going to keep Saturday, George?

George—If I ever make a profession of religion and join a church I will keep the seventh day. I could not do otherwise, as the commandment is just as plain as words can make it.

Charlie—I wish you would bring those papers over and let me read them; I want to post up on this question.

George—I will be glad to do so, for I know you will be interested. But I suppose we will have to go, or we will be late to school. I want to see you and have another talk with you on this subject.

Charlie—All right; come over to our house next Sunday and bring your Bible and those papers, and we will study up on this question.

George—If nothing happens I will. Good day.
