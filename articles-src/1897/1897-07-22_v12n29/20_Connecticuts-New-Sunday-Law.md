A NEW Sunday law has just gone into effect in the State of Connecticut. It provides that,—

"Every person who shall do any secular business or labor, except works of necessity or mercy, or keep open any shop, warehouse, or manufacturing or mechanical establishment, or expose any property for sale, or engage in any sport, between 12 o'clock Saturday night and 12 o'clock Sunday night, shall be fined not more than $50."

The old law provided for the observance of the day only from sunrise to sunset, and the maximum penalty for its violation was $4. Thus it is evident that the new law is meant to be much more stringent.
