"THE Lord is our Judge, the Lord is our Lawgiver; the Lord is our King; he will save us." Isa. 33:22* The Christian's life is ordered by laws which are righteous and eternal, and judgments which are infallible and irrevocable. The government of heaven is as superior to the governments of earth as God is superior to man.
