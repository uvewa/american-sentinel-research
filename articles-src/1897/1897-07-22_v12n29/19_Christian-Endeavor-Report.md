From the report of the general secretary of the Christian Endeavor society, given at the San Francisco convention, it appears that five thousand new societies have been added to the organization during the past year, making the present membership fully 3,000,000. The whole number of local societies is 50,747. The organization is strongest in Pennsylvania, where it has 3,443 local branches, New York coming next, with 3,049. The "Christian Citizenship" banner for the city which should make the best report of work done in this line, was captured by Indianapolis.
