God is love.

True love, forgetful of self, seeks to bless others, and is therefore unselfishness.

Unselfishness is an attribute of God's character.

Instead of seeking to gain happiness and pleasure for self, he uses his almighty power in distributing these things to his creatures.

But these gifts can only be received into an unselfish heart; so one of the conditions for the reception of God's gifts is unselfishness, or a willingness that others should be favored instead of self.

God's happiness and joy are infinite because his almighty power is exerted in the diffusion of good to his children. Our joy will be great in proportion as we also work for the good of those around us; and while thus working our power for so doing will increase and grow continually, bringing an ever-increasing return of the very things dispensed. This is the pursuit of happiness. The chance to follow this pursuit is the broadest kind of liberty, the true province of life.

God's law is the law of liberty, because the keeping of its precepts calls out the trait of unselfishness in the doer, thus opening the gate of liberty to him. Nothing but unselfish love, to God first, and then to man, can be the keeping of this law; so there must be a likeness to the character of God in the one who would keep his law before it can be kept by that one. This is wherein God writes his law in the heart. It is this unselfishness planted in the heart that moves men to the voluntary worship of God by keeping his commandments. Without it they cannot serve him nor keep his law.

This power of service is the gift of God; and the voluntary submission and desire which make it possible for us to be recipients of this power are the first steps toward the possible practice of unselfishness and the enjoyment of liberty. This kind of service is true religion, and such as have this kind will practice it regardless of all obstacles and hardships. So the brave and loyal servants of God and his law are not the servants of compulsion, but of volition. God knew all this, and his wisdom compels not, but says, "Whosoever will, let him come." He leaves us free to serve him or not to serve him, as we choose.

Now, if God has left this power of choice with us individually, then no man or combination of men, no government or combination of the same, can have any right to interfere in any way with any one, no matter how great or how humble, in the practice of religion in the way he sees it, or in the non-practice of any. The civil law is for the regulation of civil affairs only, and may compel men while they remain among their fellows to be civil in their outward acts; but not to be religious either inwardly or outwardly.

Thomas Jefferson saw these points when he said in the Declaration of Independence that "All men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness." He held that governments are instituted among men to protect them in the enjoyment of their rights, not to take them away; and this protection is what the United States Constitution was intended to impart, in that clause known as the First Amendment, which declares that "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof."

Let each and every citizen and lawmaker, as well as all Christians, zealously cherish these rights. And, reader, consider, if your neighbor differs from you in his religious practice, he is no more different from you than are you from him; and if God in infinite wisdom has left us all at liberty to choose our own service and the manner of it according to conviction, then we ought also freely to grant the same to our fellowmen. In so doing the blessings of liberty may be gathered in rich measure; for as has been shown, the reward of unselfishness is liberty.

WHEN Mr. McAll, the founder of the McAll mission in Paris, went to that city, he knew but two French words, —"God," and "love." The prevailing religion was against him, the power of the State was not in his favor; yet by the power expressed in those two words he established his gospel mission and was highly successful in rescuing souls from the slavery of sin. He was encouraged to undertake his seemingly difficult task by these words, addressed to him one day by a stranger: "Sir, I have something important to tell you. You are now in a quarter inhabited by workmen. We all have left a religion of superstition and tyranny; if some one came to teach us a religion of liberty and sincerity, many of us would be ready to listen."

THE truth shall make you free."
