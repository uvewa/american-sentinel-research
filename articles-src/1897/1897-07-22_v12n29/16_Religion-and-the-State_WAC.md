RELIGION and civil government occupy two separate and distinct realms.

Religion pertains to man's personal relation of faith and obedience to God.

Civil government has to do only with man's duties as a citizen.

Religion concerns man's relation to a future state and the world to come.

Civil government deals with men only in their civil relations to each other in this present world.

Religion has to do with the heart, the spring of actions, and its relation to the individual possessing it.

Civil government deals only with outward actions, and their relation to and effect upon others.

The object of religion is to regenerate men, and fit them for another kingdom, by purifying the heart of each individual.

The object of civil government is to protect men in the enjoyment of their natural rights in this life, by restraining, through fear of temporal punishment, those who would not recognize these rights from any higher motives.

Religion works from within.

Civil government operates from without.

The business of religion is to gather out of the nations subjects for a kingdom where civil governments will not be needed.

Civil government became necessary when sin entered the world. Then men became covetous, untruthful, lustful, thievish, murderous, and prone to do all evil. They then needed something more than moral restraint, or the fear of God, or even the fear of future punishment, to deter them from encroaching upon the rights of their fellowmen. But when man is redeemed, and sin is no more, he will need no such restraints. He will do right because he loves and chooses the right. Even in this world, those who have been born again, whose hearts have been regenerated, need not the restraints of civil authority to make them do right. They do not refrain from theft, murder and adultery, because they fear what the State may do to them should they transgress in any of these respects. They do not desire to steal, murder, and commit adultery. They do right from a higher motive than the fear of what men may do to them. When tempted to do evil, with Joseph they say, "How can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God." Concerning such John says, "Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him; and he cannot sin, because he is born of God." 1 John 3:9.

It is therefore evident that religion and civil government occupy two separate and distinct realms; that civil government exists and is necessary because of sin; that in proportion as men are genuinely converted, civil governments have less to do; and that finally, in the redeemed State, there will be no civil governments at all.

THE "Christian" powers of Europe are trying to make the Sultan see that he ought not to take possession of Thessaly after having conquered it. It can hardly be wondered at that they should find the task a difficult one, in view of the fact that their own example in such a case is almost always to the contrary.
