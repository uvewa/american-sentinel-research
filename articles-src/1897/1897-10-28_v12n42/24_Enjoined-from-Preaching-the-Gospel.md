"Union Signal," September 9.

The latest encroachment of the "blanket injunction" covers the preaching of the gospel! The Rev. Mr. Wiley, of the Methodist Church, is enjoined from holding Sunday services and week-day religious meetings on or near the property of the Worthington Coal and Coke Company in West Virginia. Truly the judges could not emphasize more effectively than they are doing the dangers attending government by injunction, nor aid in a more practical manner in securing its abolishment.
