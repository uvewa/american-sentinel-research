### SOME INTERESTING FACTS RELATIVE TO ARMY CHAPLAINCIES.

A WRITER who "has had exceptional opportunities to study federal chaplaincies, and is thoroughly well informed as to the facts relating thereto," contributes an article on this subject to the Christian Register, of September 23, in which we note the following interesting statements:

"A well-located chapel is in use at West Point by the government chaplain. Another is open for Catholic and other services. They are styled 'the cadet chapel' and 'a soldiers' chapel.' The 'soldiers' chapel' is 'inconspicuous and retired in location,' 'a mean and shabby building.' Thus the Catholics are compelled to hold their services in an inferior building and under very unfavorable conditions as compared with those of the government chaplain; and the Roman Catholic priests and all Protestant ministers are not put on a plane of equal privileges with the Protestant Episcopal priest, who officiates in the well-located and well-cared-for post chapel.

"There is now a Roman Catholic chapel on the Leavenworth Military Reservation, in a good location. It is the second here owned and occupied by this church. The first was sold to the government for $12,000, and the second was erected out of this money. At Leavenworth is the United States Infantry and Cavalry School, and it is thus a military post of special importance.

"A noted Catholic writer, Dr. Condé B. Pallen, asserts that 'at West Point itself the Episcopalians have a handsome stone church, whose support the government assumes and the salary of whose minister it pays.' This is true. The dominant official element at West Point is Episcopal. Any one but an Episcopalian as chaplain there would not be thought of. The present incumbent was selected for the place by Bishop Potter. No other church representatives were supposed to have any right to be consulted. And the chaplain is a Protestant Episcopal priest, wears the dress of one, conducts the services strictly according to the forms of his church, works for its interests, and is to all intents and purposes Protestant Episcopal rector at West Point, and is supported handsomely from the United States Treasury, his salary being several hundreds of dollars more than that of any other army chaplain. This money is used to promote sectarian ends,—i.e., the ends of a single church,—as definitely and purely as though the government should itself build a Roman Catholic chapel at West Point, and pay a Roman Catholic priest to conduct its services. In maintaining that chapel and Episcopal service, one religious body is distinctly favored; and all others—Roman Catholic and Protestant—are as distinctly subordinated, Should Dr. John Hall, Dr. H. M. Storrs, or Dr. R. S. McArthur find his way into that West Point Episcopal Church, called chapel, he would on no consideration be allowed to share in the service in a way to recognize him as a valid Christian minister by the Episcopal rector, styled chaplain. The canon of the Protestant Episcopal Church absolutely forbids such recognition. It represents the Roman Catholic as much as any Protestant church, and even more, because it recognizes the Catholic ministry as valid,—a recognition refused to the ministry of other Protestant churches. The service in the Episcopal Church at West Point, styled 'chapel,' and conducted by the Episcopal priest, styled 'chaplain,' is distinctly Episcopal, and only that.

"West Point regulations compel cadets to attend this service unless they sign a statement that they wish to 'attend some other place of worship', on the ground of 'their religious or conscientious objections.' Thus they are forced to listen to this Episcopal clergyman as, through strict adherence to his priestly dress and to his church forms and canons, he inculcates the constant lesson of the lofty claims of his church. This year the naval cadets have been prohibited, by order, from attending services in Annapolis except on communion days, when they must obtain a special permit to do so, although the churches of Annapolis are within ten minutes' walk, and although there is at the Navy Yard only a Roman Catholic church and a government chapel at which the Episcopal service is used.

"Is it any wonder that a very large part of the commissioned officers of the army, who are church members at all, are Roman Catholics and Protestant Episcopalians? They go to West Point, many of them, with no decided religious preferences, to be subjected by military regulation to the services of a single faith. Nothing is more natural, so far as they become church members at all, than that they should fall into the ways of either the Roman Catholic or the Protestant Episcopal Church. That few of them belong to any of the other churches, that a number of them are Roman Catholics, and a still larger number Episcopalians, is largely due to this fact.

"But many of them, thus compelled to attend this lengthy ritualistic service, leave the academy with a feeling of repulsion to all religious services. They suppose themselves to have been guaranteed freedom of worship by the Constitution of the United States, and they resent this compulsory church attendance as interference with this freedom; and they are often heard to date their indifference to all church going to this treatment at West Point.

"Are chaplains appointed to the army because it is in the government service? Then why keep up mere appearances by having so few chaplains that not more than one third of the army are within reach of them at any given time? General Sherman wrote a letter, in 1882, concerning army chaplains, in which he speaks of the nearly one hundred posts, with only thirty chaplains to occupy them, and says, 'Of course, the whole system is a farce, and meant to be so.' This is true; and the fewness of their number proves it to be true. It is a relic of a state-church system, and as such, with its paucity of numbers, is, indeed, 'a farce, and meant to be so.' But if the army is provided with chaplains because in government service, why not thus provide for the thousands in the departments in Washington and in the postal service?

"The army, as a whole, does not want chaplains. See 'Gospel Work Among United States Soldiers,' page 42 (the United States Army Aid Association, 82 Nassau St., New York), where the matter is fully stated by a chaplain, who says, 'The idea of having chaplains does not come from the army.' Why, then, violate the voluntary principle by forcing an institution of this sort on the army, leaving it no choice?"
