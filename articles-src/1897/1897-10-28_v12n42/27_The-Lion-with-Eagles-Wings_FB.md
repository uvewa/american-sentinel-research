"This seems to be a very strange chapter, mama. I've been studying the first few verses as you told me to. Now listen, this is what the prophet says, 'I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the four winds of the heaven strove upon the great sea. And four great beasts came up from the sea.'

"Now, mama, I know the Bible tells us that the four beasts represent four great kingdoms, but does it tell what the wind and the sea stand for?" asked Charlie Ross, as he came for his promised talk.

"Water, in prophecy, stands for multitudes of people. Rev. 17:15 says: 'The waters which thou sawest . . . are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues.' There are other passages that lead us to the same conclusion. Daniel writes of an army as 'a flood that shall overflow and pass over,' and in another place a nation is spoken of as a sea,—'the waters of the Assyrian Sea.'

"There seems a peculiar fitness in this symbol. If you ever cross the ocean, you will see it more clearly. The whole world of men and nations is like a tossing sea. It is true that in the sea there are currents, tides, and streams that have a steady course, just as in the tossing sea of humanity there are servants of God who are guided into peaceful courses; but the mass of the world is like a tossing sea."

"I know one text that says, 'The wicked are like the troubled sea, when it cannot rest, whose waters cast up mire and dirt.' Well, what is the wind for?"

"Wind is an element of strife in nature, and the Bible interprets it as a symbol of war. Now, let us look at these symbols as they are interpreted, and we have war raging among the people, and resulting in the rise and fall of four great kingdoms. You have studied enough of history to know that is the way nations do rise and fall. As I think of the nations to-day, they seem to me like so many beasts waiting to spring upon each other."

"O, yes; I remember a picture where Russia was represented as a bear reaching out its paw over Turkey. And I remember seeing Great Britain represented by a lion. That reminds me," said Charlie, "of the next verse here."

"Read it."

"'The first was like a lion, and had eagle's wings: I beheld till the wings thereof were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth, and made stand upon the feet as a man, and a man's heart was given to it.' This, mama, was the first kingdom named in the prophecy."

"Yes; and it was lion-like. Tell me some of the characteristics of the lion."

"Well, the lion is the king of beasts. I read yesterday that a lion has both good and bad qualities. Of course, it is savage, and has a very frightful roar. It does most of its prowling by night; but the father lion takes care of his mate and cubs, and is often faithful and sociable. But all the other beasts have to give way before the lion. This lion here has eagle's wings. That is rather queer; what does it mean?"

"Well, before I answer, I will ask you to tell me about an eagle."

"The eagle is the king of birds. It is a bird of prey, and can even stare at the sun. The eagle is very strong, and is capable of enduring long flights."

"That's good, Charlie, and I hope the talks we are having will spur you up to study not only history and the Bible, but to find out all you can of the beasts and birds used as symbols."

"Now, what do the eagle's wings indicate? You may read what I have marked in Hab. 1:6-8. 'For, lo, I raise up the Chaldeans, that bitter and hasty nation. . . . They shall fly as the eagle that hasteth to eat." Here is a nation described in the act of conquest, as an eagle flying for its prey. The wings indicate the swiftness of the conquests of this lion-like beast."

"Well, now, mama, what was the first kingdom that is represented by this first beast?"

"Can you tell what was the first city built after the flood?"

"Let me see if I can find about it. Here's the flood, —oh, here it is. Why it was in the plains of Shinar. They said, 'Go to, let us build a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven.' It was the city in which was the tower of Babel."

"Now, Charlie, turn to the map. Right along the Euphrates was the plain, and the first kingdom noticed by prophecy was called Babylon. From this grew the wonderful kingdom represented by the lion with eagle's wings. In many things it surpassed any other kingdom on earth. God has spoken of this kingdom as 'the golden kingdom,' and in the second chapter it was represented as 'the head of gold.' In another place in Isaiah it is called 'the beauty of the Chaldee's excellency,' 'the glory of kingdoms.' Please read the first verse of the first chapter of Daniel, and see who was king at the time it was represented under this symbol."

Charlie read, "In the first year of the reign of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, came Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon."

"That will do, Charlie. Who was king of Babylon?"

"Nebuchadnezzar."

"Under this king it was represented as a lion with eagle's wings. In Nebuchadnezzar's day it reached the height of its power. The first chapter opens with an account of the conquest of the Jews, and their captivity in the land of Babylon. Among the captives were Daniel, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who afterward served to bring out still clearer the beast-like characteristics. But before we go into that part of the subject, I would like to tell you a little of the wonders of Babylon, to show you how apt was this figure of its majesty.

"The city of Babylon, or the capital of the kingdom, was a city that seems always like a dream of beauty and power to me. It was laid out in a perfect square, and was surrounded with walls three hundred and fifty feet high and eighty-seven feet thick. That would be as high again as our church steeples, and its depth was capable of giving space to four of our ordinary dwellings. Twenty-five gates of brass, with as many watch towers, adorned the wall, and four large chariots could ride abreast on its top. From the top of the walls one could look over onto a most beautiful city, whose streets were one hundred and fifty feet wide, paved with polished marble, from which was reflected its stately palaces. The king's palace was eight miles in circumference. In the city were large temples; one was the tower of Babel, known as the temple of Bel—another name for Baal; for the Babylonians were self-worshipers. The city was built on either side of the Euphrates, and its parts were connected by bridges that were closed away from travel at night by gates of brass. Every house formed an enclosed court in which was a beautiful garden, and beside this one of the seven wonders of the world was there."

"Oh, I know," said Charlie,—"the hanging gardens."

"Yes. They were built up until their tops reached the height of the wall."

"How I should have liked to have been on the top of the wall!" said Charlie. "But what about its being a beast, and how else did it show its lion-like character?"

"Well, it subjected the people by force, and then preyed upon its captives, and especially showed its beast-like character in the way it enforced Baal worship, or even in seeking to enforce the worship of the true God.

"The Lord had given Nebuchadnezzar a dream, which Daniel had been enabled to interpret to him. It was just as convincing as was the fire Elijah called down from heaven of the fact that there was a living God. Through the four young men in his courts, he had repeated evidence of the truth, and he knew they were ambassadors of the King of kings. You know it is an insult to a government to insult its ambassador, but Nebuchadnezzar set up a golden image—"

"Oh, I know, mama, and he was angry because these young men would not bow down and worship, and thus break God's law, and he had them cast into the fiery furnace."

"Yes, and when he saw the form of the Son of God in the furnace, and the young men walking in the flame, he was frightened, and had them delivered. But his heart was still unchanged. With a great show of righteousness, he then made a law that everybody in his kingdom should refrain from saying anything against the God of heaven, on penalty of death."

"But, mama, wasn't that right?"

"No, Charlie. In doing this, he put himself in the place of God. This law, in the sight of heaven, was worthless; for God is a spirit, and those who worship him, must worship him in spirit and in truth. No worship compelled by law is acceptable to Him who sees the very heart."

"I see it," said Charlie. "What he ought to have done was to have given his subjects full liberty to worship according to the dictates of their own consciences, as the Constitution of our nation does. Our government is all right, isn't it?"

"Every government is all right as a civil affair, till it goes back on the principles of liberty, and forgets that it exists for the protection of our natural rights. Well, Charlie, here is Rollin's Ancient History. I want you to read up all you can about Babylon. In our next talk, we'll study the change that came over the lion that was lifted up as a man and had a man's heart given unto it."
