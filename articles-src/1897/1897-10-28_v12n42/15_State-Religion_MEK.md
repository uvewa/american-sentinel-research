It is quite commonly believed that the United States Constitution forbids the establishment of any church as a State church in any of the States of the United States; but it does not. It simply prohibits the United States from doing so, either for the States or for itself; and each State is left free to adopt a religion if it wants to. The fear that the State of Utah will establish a State religion and enforce it, is bringing this fact—that a State can establish a religion—very forcibly home to many who have heretofore been in darkness upon this subject.

The Methodist Episcopal Church is doing quite an extensive missionary work in Utah, but it is now confronted with the fact that there may soon be a State church established there which will effectually bar its progress.

Discussing the situation in Utah, the Christian Advocate of October 7, says:—

"Concerning Statehood and its relation to the strengthening of Mormonism, we remind our readers that the Christian Advocate for a number of years directed attention to the fact that the power of the States with regard to religion is not limited. There is nothing to prevent any State from setting up an established church, except its own constitutional provisions, which may be changed according to methods provided for by existing constitutions. The public seems to sleep under the idea that because the Constitution provides that 'Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,' the States have no power to do so, forgetting that the Constitution also provides that 'the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.' Consequently, should the Mormons possess a vote sufficiently large to alter the Constitution, they could make Mormonism the established religion of Utah, and crush out all efforts to promote Christianity; and even in the absence of that, in the counties where they are sufficiently strong they could nullify the laws against polygamy by intentionally delaying indefinitely the prosecution of offenders. We know of no power existing, under the Constitution, to maintain the rights of Christians in that State except the mighty force of public opinion throughout the land, and the propagation by slow degrees of the American idea."

The Advocate sees very clearly that there is a danger that the State of Utah, through and by the use of its regularly established and recognized powers, may make the State an engine of tyranny to oppose and oppress those who do not accept the doctrines of the dominant church. It also believes that this would be a great wrong, which nothing but the "mighty force of public opinion throughout the land, and the propagation by slow degrees of the American idea" could eradicate.

The Advocate is able to see this because of the danger that one church, the Mormon Church, will gain the power, and especially because the Mormon Church will be liable to use that power to prevent the extension of the Methodist Church in that State.

Right here some very important questions may be asked: Should two or three churches unite together upon something concerning religion, which they consider fundamental, and, by pressure on the legislators, cause it to be incorporated into the laws of a State,—forbidding or commanding a practice,—would it not be a step in the same direction as the establishment of a State church, and would it not be precisely the same to those who regard such law as an abuse of clerical influence and authority and an invasion of natural right? It surely would.

But to be more precise: should the Methodists and Mormons of Utah unite in securing a strong Sunday law in that State, would not those who believe they have a God-given right to labor on the first day of the week consider such a law an abridgment of their rights; that the power that caused the law—the Methodist and Mormon churches—was one, and that the yielding to their demands by the legislature was at least a quasi acknowledgment of a union of those two churches—one in purpose—with the State? They would; and they would have a perfect right to think so.

Now, it is this religious pressure by various churches joined together that has caused the enactment of every Sunday law in the different States of the Union. And a purely church practice forced upon all the people by several churches is just as bad as though it were so done by one church alone. Of course a church and state union may go farther than this; but the same principle as here outlined lies at the foundation of the religious laws of our States, whether of Sunday laws or laws against blasphemy or witchcraft.

It is to be hoped that this investigation, helped on by the discussion of Utah affairs, will enable the people to see that every State of the Union is menaced just as much as Utah is. A Catholic, Episcopalian, or Methodist union with a State would be just as bad as a Mormon union, and if all of them together should influence a State to enforce a religious tenet, the evil would be precisely the same. In either case the honest dissenter would feel the tyranny of a religion through the power of the State, and it would be of little moment to him what church or what churches were at the bottom of it.

Those churches which are frightened at the thought that the Mormon Church may yet control legislation in Utah so that the doctrines of that church may be favored there by law, should look very carefully over their own history and present tendencies before they lock horns with the Mormons upon this subject. It is a very old axiom that people who live in glass houses should not throw stones; and churches which are doing their best to influence legislation in the United States Congress and many of the State legislatures, should either cease their efforts in that direction or cheerfully yield to the Mormons the same privilege they claim for themselves.

The "American idea" is that no church either directly or indirectly should meddle with the State, or in any way attempt to gain State patronage for its dogmas. In other words, the American idea calls for a purely secular government. But alas! in many ways we are yet far from the ideal.
