"New York Journal." October 12.

Boston, Oct. 11.—Golf as a Sunday sport is tabooed at Watertown. For some weeks past the police have received complaints from residents that they object to the games being played on Sunday in the vicinity of their homes. Sunday morning the police proceeded to the fields. Just before noon nine golfers, said to be Harvard students, were placed under arrest.

Bail was furnished and the party left for home. It is expected that the case will come up in the Waltham Police Court some day this week.

Last summer, the pope favored Queen Victoria with an autograph letter. Now, we are informed, the queen has returned the compliment, requesting the pontiff to kindly interfere in Irish politics, to secure the "pacification" of Ireland.
