RELIGION concerns the relations of the individual man to the Supreme Being. It is a personal matter between a soul and its Creator. It has nothing to do with bodies of men. A corporation, whether secular, or ecclesiastical, or civil, cannot be religious, although everyone of its members may be; for it has no soul or conscience. The directors of the Standard Oil Company may all be pious men; but that does not make the oil religious or its sale a pious act. The president, his cabinet, and the justices of the Supreme Court might each and all be Mohammedans, but that fact would not make our republic Moslem. They might be Unitarians or Mormons, and our Constitution would undergo no change. A church corporation, as such, cannot believe in any doctrine or be held corporately responsible for sins; the individual members must answer, each for himself. So, religious belief cannot be predicated of any State or nation. Governments have neither feelings, nor sentiments, nor opinions; to them devils, angels, and ghosts are equally indifferent; the United States will have, as a corporation, no account to render at the judgment. It cannot, from its very nature, be either Christian or Mohammedan.

Religion not only concerns the individual, but deals with his spiritual nature. For this world, it seeks to purify and elevate his personal character; it appeals to his conscience, emotions, affections, and motives. Its methods are persuasive; it aims at moral and intellectual conviction, which cannot be accomplished by force. Violence does not command belief. A man may be constrained to say that the sun does not shine in the heavens, but he does not believe what he says. Galileo was compelled to recant his teaching that the earth moves; but he struck his staff on the earth and exclaimed, "It still moves." Religion has never gained anything by legislative penalties. Its natural weapon is *love*. Persecution in the name of religion may make hypocrites and martyrs; it cannot make converts.

The sanctions of religion are moral; its rewards and punishments germinate in this world and ripen beyond the grave. Its punishments are for wrong feelings of the heart, for sins; if a man lust after a woman, or covet his neighbor's property, or hate him, he is amenable to the divine law, though his sinful feeling may not find expression in acts. He may have violated no penal statute, and may have enjoyed the esteem of his fellow men during a long life of outward innocence; but in the eye of God he is a sinner.

As religion is a matter between the individual man and his Creator, there is no escape for man from his personal accountability. He cannot shift it to the shoulders of other persons, or to a church or nation. He cannot shelter himself under the provisions of a statute or the indulgences of an ecclesiastical superior. He must obey God rather than man. If Nebuchadnezzar, the king, orders him to fall down at the sound of the trumpet and worship the golden image, he should not obey, though he knows he shall be cast into the furnace seven times heated; or, if the order be not to pray to God, his duty is to disobey with the certainty before him of being thrown into a den of lions. While he should promptly obey all the laws of civil government, enacted within their proper sphere, he should refuse obedience when they clash with his religious obligations. Every religion teaches martyrdom in preference to sin.

The repentant sinner escapes the penalty of sin. No matter how black his sin, he needs nothing but repentance to wash him whiter than snow. If the heart is right, there is no punishment for past offences. "God is love" is the fundamental principle of religion.
