So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty. James 2:12.

James here speaks of the law of the ten commandments, which he calls "the royal law," or the law of the great King. This is evident in that he quotes two of the precepts of that law. See verses 8–11. Why is this called the law of liberty? What is liberty? The child will answer, "The right to do as I please." It is evident, however, that to this there must be some limitations. I might please to do something which might justly displease many others. My liberty would then, in this sense, mean their slavery. It is evident that liberty, in its truest sense, must be a blessing which is possible to every one at the same time, and not to a few only, and that at the expense of the many. There must be recognized, therefore, some boundary lines of right between man and man, else liberty is impossible.

The Bible, in several places, represents the law of God as a hedge or fence. What is a hedge or fence?—What but a boundary line of right between two individuals? It says, "You must not come over this side to infringe my right, and I must not go over on that side to infringe yours." Just such a hedge, just such a boundary line of right, is each one of the ten precepts. This is not more true of the last six commandments than of the first four, but it is more apparent. "Thou shalt not steal." That means that you must not step over the line to take what is mine, and I must not take what is yours. "Thou shalt not commit adultery." "Thou shalt not kill." These two precepts fence in or guard the sacred rights to families and to life. "Thou shalt not bear false witness." This guards the right to reputation, and also to property. These are rights between man and man.

Even so between God and man there are rights. It is God's right to have the supreme love and worship of every human creature, for he made us "for his pleasure," and his pleasure is our love. It is man's right, also, to worship the true God. He must, from his nature, worship something; but who, knowing the true God, with his infinite tenderness and love, would worship idols? God is infinitely above every human conception of him, and he seeks ever to lift us into higher conceptions, and unite us more closely to one another, by uniting us all to himself. But an image is only a creed in marble, seeking to make permanent the present conception of him, and robbing men of the right to walk in the dawning light. Taking his name in vain, also can do naught but rob that name of its sacredness, and of its mighty power to uplift the soul and set it free.

But how shall I in few words speak of the fourth precept? God, who created all things, has a right to set apart and sanctify what he will unto himself. He has chosen to set apart and sanctify the seventh day of each week. He has made it a weekly memorial of the fact that the only God worthy of worship, the only being in the universe who has a right to command the consciences of men, is the Creator. All history proves that when men seek to command the consciences of other men, the result is always to enslave the soul, and to bind it in priestly fetters, and tether it to stationary and dying creeds. But God, the Creator, commands the soul but to uplift it and set it free. He who worships the Creator only finds an infinity of beauty, which he cannot fathom, in every flower at his feet. Flower, and tree, and earth, and star, and sun, each made by him, and each touched with his infinity, are so many stepping-stones by which the soul mounts to God, and learns never to confine itself by any creed from learning more of him. Who cannot see that here is the very guard and guide to liberty and freedom, and that all men, had they not been deceived, and robbed of their rights, would have rejoiced in his holy day? God's law, then, states the very principles of liberty. It marks out the boundary line of right between God and man and between man and man, a boundary line which must be recognized else liberty is impossible to intelligent beings, either in this world or in any other.

But while these boundary lines of right must be recognized, else liberty is impossible, there is still a kind of slavery in being compelled to recognize them against our wills. So God does not compel us. He made us, and he leaves us free—as free to do wrong as to do right, seeking all the while, however, by his infinite love, through the new covenant, to write these principles in our hearts. See Jer. 31:33; Heb. 8:10. When that law is written by the finger of divine love, not on tables of stone merely, but on the fleshy tables of the heart, then we with Jesus can say, "I delight to do thy will, O God; yea, thy law is within my heart."

When a man is free to do what he delights to do, and delights to do what will make him free, he has perfect liberty. This is the liberty of the angels, and of all the sons of God. It is the result of the "perfect law of liberty" being perfectly written in the heart. When this is accomplished, all the redeemed will throughout eternity enjoy perfect liberty to do what they please, because they please to do just what is in harmony with liberty and joy. Fruit is an easy growth, the result not of effort and struggle, but of indwelling life. "But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance; against such there is no law." Gal. 5:22, 23. Such are free, and can do the things that they would. See verse 17, compared with verses 22 and 23. "Christ is the end of the law for righteousness" to such as thus believe. Rom. 10:4. The law commands them no more, simply because it is no more an external law. It has become instead the inner, living, actuating principle of the whole being. Ah, then, there is joy and privilege in keeping God's commandments, not duty merely. The good stepmother does her "duty" by the wayward boy. She will not turn him out-of-doors, because she knows people will say, "That is what you might expect of a stepmother," and she has resolved to do her duty. This is obedience to law. Could she but wake some morning and know that she was indeed his mother, and feel her heart thrilling with the unspeakable tenderness of a mother's love, she would be free. Love and privilege would have taken the place of duty. Others might say, "She makes a slave of herself for the child," but she knows that she is enjoying the perfect liberty to do just that which gives her the most pleasure.

May it please God to write his perfect law of liberty in all our hearts, that we, too, may be free as he is free. This he will do if we submit to him, saying with Jesus, "Not my will, but thine be done."
