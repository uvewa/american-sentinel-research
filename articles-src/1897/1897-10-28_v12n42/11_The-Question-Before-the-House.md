An individual may be pardoned for not keeping track of all that is going on in the world in this "fast" age, but there is a dangerous negligence in this particular revealed in the language of an esteemed correspondent who writes us that he does not see what use there is for the SENTINEL at the present time. "It seems to me," he says, "that there is no question before the house, and that the SENTINEL is firing at dead issues."

We had supposed everybody who read the SENTINEL was aware of the movement that has now for some years been on foot in the churches of this country to "enthrone Christ" in the politics of this nation. That movement was never so formidable as it is to-day. It is represented by the "Christian Citizenship," "Christian Endeavor," and other organizations of a religious nature, numbering millions of young, active, and zealous adherents. And these millions of young people are only the latest recruits to the army which is working to secure this "national reform."

Shall Christ be "enthroned" in our politics? is the question before the house. Or in other words, Shall the religious movement succeed which, its adherents claim, will "enthrone Christ on Capitol Hill," but which in reality will unite church and state? A very live issue is this, and one which concerns the welfare of every individual in the country. And—we repeat—this movement was never so formidable as it is to-day.

If to observe a weekly day of rest is a matter of personal right, it should be recognized as the privilege of the individual to so rest if he chooses to do so. But the Sunday law denies that any person shall exercise their own choice in the matter, and thereby denies that a weekly rest is a matter of individual right. Professing to uphold the right, it in reality denies it altogether.
