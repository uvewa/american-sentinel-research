**WILLIE.**—Mama, is the United States a Christian nation?

**MAMA.**—Why—I suppose it is, Willie; but why do you want to know that?

Willie.—Well, our school-teacher said it was, but I've read the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution all through, and couldn't find anything about it in either one (Pause). Oh, I know,—I'll find out what church it goes to.

Mama.—It doesn't go to any church, Willie.

Willie.—How can it be Christian if it don't ever go to church? Don't it belong to any church?

Mama.—Not that I ever heard of, Willie.

Willie.—I guess that's what Bill Meeker meant the other day when I asked him what church he belonged to. He looked at me rather funny, and said he belonged to the United States church. That meant he didn't go to church at all.

Mama.—Very likely.

Willie.—Seems to me, mama, the United States sets a bad example by being Christian and not joining any church.

Mama.—If it should join a church, Willie, it would make a union of church and state, and we don't want that in this country.

Willie.—Then it can't be Christian at all without setting a bad example.

Mama.—It would be a very bad example indeed if it should join a church.

Willie.—But it's right to be a Christian, mama?

Mama.—Why, certainly, my boy; that is a very necessary thing for everybody.

Willie.—Well, this looks rather mixed up. It's right to be a Christian, and yet this government can't be Christian without setting a bad example. Fact of the matter is, I guess, that Christianity don't belong to governments, even if my teacher did say so.

Mama.—Well, Willie, I wouldn't wonder if you were right.
