Some are very anxious to have the name of God inserted in the Constitution. But this is not the all-important thing. You might have the word "God" inscribed upon the White House, carved upon the gilded dome of the Capitol, engrossed upon the desk of every representative and senator, and yet it would not make much difference.

We have on our silver dollar the motto: "In God We Trust," but this has not stopped greed, covetousness, the love of money, which are some of our national evils. Nations are made up of individuals. It is the individual who needs to have God's name treasured in his own heart, to be held by him in reverence and love. And when individuals, who make up the town, the county, the state, the nation, have such due regard for God and his law, then is fulfilled the divine promise: "Blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord."

The Fourth of July recalls the fact that we owe our present freedom—that is, what is left of it—and our privileges to men who were not afraid to trust in God, nor ashamed to say so. In that immortal Declaration of Independence, the signers appealed "to the Supreme Judge of the world" for the rectitude of their intentions, and they said they were ready to support that Declaration "with firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence." To-day, our law-makers have a chaplain to do their praying for them. It is a much better thing when legislators can pray for themselves, are willing to do it, and to keep God's law by serving him and their fellow men.
