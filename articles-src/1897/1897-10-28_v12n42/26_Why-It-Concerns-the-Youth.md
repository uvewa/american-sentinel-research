The principles of civil and religious liberty are principles which are concerned in the life of every individual, in youth as well as in later years.

These principles are violated by the children in their conduct toward one another quite as frequently as by older people. It is in the period of childhood and youth that people learn either to respect the rights of their fellow beings or to disregard them.

The despots who have cursed the earth with their injustice and oppression, from the king on his throne who ruled over an empire, down to the day laborer whose tyrannical sway extended over only his own unfortunate family, have only put in practice in their despotism that disregard of human rights which they learned when they were young.

The inborn selfishness of human nature shows itself at a very early age; and it is only this natural selfishness that has caused all the oppression and persecution that the world ever saw.

The boy who wants to "boss" the affairs in which his youthful associates take part on an equality with himself, will naturally, as a man, want to "boss" the affairs of his fellow men.

The boy who shows a disposition to regard himself as entitled to the "lion's share" of good things among his young associates, will as a man be ready to deny to his fellow men the privileges and rights which he claims for himself.

The boy who rules over his playmates because he is bigger and stronger than they are, individually, will as a man have very faint conceptions of right independent of might. He will believe in the rule of the majority in everything, as though the minority had no rights which the majority were bound to respect.

All this applies equally, of course, to young people who are not boys. The girl who grows up without having learned to respect the rights of other people, will, as a wife and especially as a mother in the training of her children, exert an influence more baneful to the cause of liberty than would be possible to one of the opposite sex.

There is nothing more beautiful in human conduct than the recognition, by those of tender years, of the God-given rights of their young associates, in the spirit of the Golden Rule.

This is true politeness—the politeness which is based on principle, rather than on policy. Principle is to the character what a fine grain is to wood. It renders it susceptible of a natural polish which otherwise it could not possibly have. The politeness of the policy man is like a veneer polish on the surface of soft wood. It is not a part of his natural self.
