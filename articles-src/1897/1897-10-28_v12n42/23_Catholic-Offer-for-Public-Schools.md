At the opening of the public schools for the school year in New York City recently, it was found that the applicants for admission far exceeded the number which the capacity of the schools would accommodate. The papal church authorities saw in this situation an opportunity for missionary work, and, as usual, they rose to the emergency, with an offer to turn the parochial schools over to be used as public schools, provided an hour each day be devoted to religious instruction. The offer has not yet been accepted.

Of course it is very good of the Catholic authorities thus to come to the aid of the metropolis in the matter of providing for the education of its youth,—from a standpoint which does not take into account the evil principle of combining religious with secular instruction in the public schools. To secure the establishment of this principle in the United States, any church which would profit by it as would the papacy, could afford to be quite generous.

It is to be hoped, however, that the city government, bearing in mind the axiom that two wrongs do not make right, will set about remedying the evil by providing such an extension of the public school system as will be adequate to the demands that are made upon it.
