An authority on "Christian citizenship" says that "the Christian citizens of the United States can no more afford to be apathetic in the face of existing political corruption, than the health authorities of Southern cities dare tolerate filth in the streets and alleys while confronted by the yellow fever plague."

It is no new thing to say that Christians cannot afford to be apathetic. The Word of God—the Christian's guide-book—makes this fact plain upon every page. "Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour" (1 Peter 5:8)—this and many similar admonitions from the volume of inspiration are familiar to the Christian's ears. But "Christian citizenship" vigilance means something a little different from this; that is, something which has to do with political corruption,—a thing which has until recently, been supposed to be somewhat out of the line of the Christian's education and work.

The Christian's warfare, as set forth in that Word upon which Christianity is based, is first a warfare against corruption lurking in his own heart, and then against the abounding corruption in the world without. And "corruption," to him, is anything that is a transgression of the divine law. Now suppose that Christians are busily waging this warfare against corruption, is there any necessity for calling their attention to "political corruption?"

What does such a call mean, anyway? Does it mean that Christians have become apathetic as Christians? or does it mean that Christians are remiss in their duty if they do not engage in a crusade against political corruption, in addition to their regular warfare, as Christians, against sin?

Referring again to the inspired volume, we learn that to "fear God and keep his commandments" is the "whole duty of man" (Eccl. 12:13), and that "pure religion" is "to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world." James 1:27. We learn also that the followers of Christ—Christians—are commissioned to go into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature (Mark 16:15),

and that "he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned (verse 16). But in all this there is nothing that points out the supposed duty of purging the land from "political corruption."

We learn further that the Christian goes forth to his warfare clad in a certain armor and equipped with certain weapons. It might be interesting to note what part of this is adapted to warfare against political corruption. In the sixth chapter of Ephesians we find this exhortation given: "Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness; and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace; above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked. And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God." Verses 14–17. Thus equipped, the Christian is clad in the "whole armor of God." Verse 11.

Let it be noticed that there is but one offensive weapon in this equipment, and that is "the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God." Whatever attack therefore is to be made by the Christian upon corruption, must be made with this weapon. All the rest of his armament is adapted only for defense.

Is this weapon sufficient for all the requirements of the Christian warfare? Is it powerful enough to accomplish every work that can ever devolve upon the Christian to perform? For answer we may quote the words of the psalmist: "By the word of the Lord were the heavens made; and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth. . . . Let all the earth fear the Lord; let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him. For he spake, and it was; he commanded, and it stood fast." Ps. 33:6–9. As we know of no greater exhibition of might than that which brought into existence the heavens and the earth, we may safely conclude that the word of the Lord is powerful enough for any undertaking which can properly fall to the Christian's lot upon the earth.

What, then, about the supposed Christian duty of driving out political corruption? Can this be done by the Word of God? If it can, well and good; but if not, it is certainly not because the undertaking requires more power than the Word of God contains.

No; it is not power that is lacking in this divine implement of warfare. Is it, then, a design of Providence that the Christian warfare shall include a fight against political corruption? If so, then the "sword of the Spirit" must be adapted to this task.

But it is evident that no such adaptation exists. Political people recognize this fact. It is not proposed to make any use of the "sword of the Spirit" in accomplishing the intended purification. And how is it proposed that this shall be done? Oh, it is to be done by turning all the "rascals" out of office. And this will be done—by the Word of God? Oh, no; but by the ballot, "Above all, taking the ballot, which is the instrument of political righteousness," is an alteration which the "Christian citizenship" theory requires to be made in the text quoted from St. Paul's Epistle to the Ephesians. But if such an alteration were in harmony with the mind of Omniscience, the text would have been so worded at the first.

As Christians, we prefer to take simply the "sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God," and fight our battles with that. That is so great and so mighty a weapon that we are not able to carry another weapon without letting that one drop. Moreover, we find plenty of scope for the utmost activity with this weapon alone. It was by this that Jesus Christ overcame the devil in his temptation in the wilderness; and we believe his example to be the best one for Christians of this day. The devil has not grown apathetic, and Christians who are resisting his temptations and assaults will have no chance to become so. Indeed, with the Word of God abiding in the heart, apathy is impossible. There will be, on the contrary, a manifestation of all that Christian zeal and activity which marks the life of Christ.
