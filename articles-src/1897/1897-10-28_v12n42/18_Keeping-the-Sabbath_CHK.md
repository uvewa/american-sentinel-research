CHRISTIAN experience is personal experience. The aim of the gospel is "Christ in you, the hope of glory." The great commission of Christ to his disciples was: "Preach the gospel to every creature." In this connection Christ said: "All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth," and he encouraged his disciples with the blessed assurance, "Lo, I am with you alway." Wherever they should go and preach, there would be the "all power" to accompany the word spoken.

When Christ thus commissioned his disciples, there was the power of the whole Roman Empire to oppose their progress. There was no arm of the state upon which they could rely, had they been so disposed.

But before taking up the gospel work they must tarry at Jerusalem until they should be endued with power from on high—until they should receive the power of the Holy Ghost. If this power should not be sufficient for the work before them, then it must become a hopeless task; for there is none greater in the whole universe.

But the apostles found it abundantly sufficient. They were to fight "a good fight;" they were enabled to finish their course, to "keep the faith." What if the multitudes on every hand did not believe as they believed;—did not do as they did? What if the whole Roman Empire was against them? They were Christians; and that meant to each one individually just as though there was not another soul to keep him company, that there was abundant power in Jesus Christ to enable him to do as Christians ought to do.

According to the promise of our Saviour, what was possible for a Christian back there would be possible for Christians at this present time. The requirements and the conditions are precisely the same.

But there has come a change. At the State Convention of Christian Endeavors recently held in Paterson, N. J., Rev. Dr. Burrell solemnly, seriously told his fellow Endeavors that unless everybody was compelled to keep the Sabbath (by which he meant Sunday) he could not keep it. Why not? Has Christ changed? Has the gospel lost any of its power? Is the Holy Spirit less able to work upon human hearts and to strengthen them as in apostolic times? Blessed be God, there is no change in any of these. The change is in man.

What does this statement of Dr. Burrell mean when analyzed? He says, "My right to Sabbath observance depends upon a law for Sabbath observance for all. If others do not keep it, I can't."

Sabbath-breaking is a sin. The remedy for sin is Jesus Christ. "Thou shalt call his name Jesus; for he shall save his people from their sins." Matt. 1:21. The only way Jesus can save us from our sins is to save us from sinning. If he can save us from committing one sin, he can save us from committing some other sin. If he can save us from committing the sin of theft, or of taking the name of the Lord in vain, he is able to save us from the sin of Sabbath-breaking.

That Christ is qualified to save us from sinning he has abundantly proven. All the temptation to sin—Sabbath-breaking included—Christ has met and overcome, for "he was tempted in all points like as we are, yet without sin."

Nor is this all. He has measured the full strength of each temptation. Satan expended the full force of each one upon Christ.

Furthermore, Jesus met them in our flesh. What he did once he can do again. So we read that "what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh, that the requirements (R. V. margin) of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit."

This is true. God did send his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh. And in that way he did condemn sin in the flesh. And as certainly as he did that, so certainly will the requirements of the law be fulfilled in those who walk after the Spirit.

But let it be remembered that when Christ did this, "he was in the likeness of sinful flesh." In other words, in order that the requirements of the law might be fulfilled in us, Christ must be in us. Back there he was in our flesh all the time. Down here he must be in our flesh all the time.

Let it be remembered, too, that when Christ did all this, he was met with the fiercest opposition. The same conditions that exist now existed then. And further, he did it all in our flesh with all the rest opposing him, and did it as effectually as though there were no opposition. That being so, he is just as able to live in me now and keep me from sin, as though there were not another soul in the whole wide world. He is therefore able to save a soul from breaking the Sabbath while all the rest are breaking it, as though there were nobody else on earth to break the Sabbath.

Why, then, is it that Dr. Burrell and those who believe with him are not able to keep the Sabbath while others are breaking it? The answer is plain. "Be astonished, O ye heavens, at this, and be horribly afraid, be ye very desolate, saith the Lord. For my people have committed two evils: they have forsaken me, the fountain of living waters, and hewed them out cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water." Jer. 2:12, 13.

The power of God is infinite. He is so great, and his presence so all-pervading, that in his sight the nations of earth are but as drops in a bucket, and they are counted as the small dust of the balance. Isa. 40:15. It therefore cannot make much difference whether he deals with one individual or with the whole race of mankind together. If he cannot save a soul from sin, and thus from Sabbath-breaking, while all others are opposed, he cannot save anybody even though there be no opposition. If this be true, there is no salvation in Jesus Christ, and his name as a misnomer.

Now if I cannot keep the Sabbath without there being a law compelling everybody else to keep it, then in that thing the State is the saviour.

But why then not go the whole distance? If the State is capable of saving a soul from the sin of Sabbath-breaking, it is capable of saving him from all other sins. What need of Christ then? What need of the Holy Spirit?

But Christ is able to save, and to the uttermost, from the sin of Sabbath-breaking. The State is not. That being so, why look to the State for help? Why not to Christ?
