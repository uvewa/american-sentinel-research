The latest "turn of the wheel" in the effort to discover the meaning and application of the Sunday law in New Jersey, brings up the discovery that Sunday bicycling, so lately discouraged by several court decisions, is right in New Jersey after all. The law under which it is considered to be justified, is the following, passed in 1893:—

"It shall not be unlawful for any person or corporation, on the Christian Sabbath, the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday, to print, publish, and sell newspapers, to sell and deliver milk, or to walk, ride or drive for recreation, and to hire horses and carriages or other conveyance for riding or driving."

It ought to be apparent to thinking people that the effort to secure Sunday observance by law only tends to obscurity and uncertainty so far as concerns its application, and confers no dignity, but rather the reverse, upon law in general.
