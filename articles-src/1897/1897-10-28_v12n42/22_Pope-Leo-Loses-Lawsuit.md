A singular humiliation has befallen Pope Leo; he has just figured as the losing party in a lawsuit in the Italian courts. The suit was to obtain control of a church that was being built to commemorate the pope's recent jubilee. The work of collecting funds and building the church was in the hands of a French abbe, and on account of alleged mismanagement by the latter the pope decided to take the business out of his hands and intrust it to a commission, headed by a cardinal. The abbe brought the matter into the courts, where it has been decided that Pope Leo must not only surrender the church to the abbe, but must pay the costs of the litigation, which are by no means light.

The pope, it is understood, will even matters up by placing the church under interdict and excommunicating the abbe.
