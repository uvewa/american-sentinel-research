BY J. F. BALLenger.

George Thompson—Hello, Charlie! how are you getting along in mathematics?

Charlie Brown—All right; I have got to simple proportion,—what father calls the single rule of three.

George—Haven't got to the single rule of seven yet, have you?

Charlie—No; what do you mean? There is no such rule in my book.

George—You are not up with the times. If you had been over to the church last night and heard Elder Twist preach on the seventh-first-day-Sabbath, you would have learned something of the single rule of seven.

Charlie—What does the single rule of seven have to do with the Sabbath? What joke are you trying to play on me now? Be sober now, George, and tell me what you mean. You are always getting off some of your nonsense.

George—No; I am not. Elder Twist said last night in his sermon that the first day was the seventh day, and the seventh day was the first day; and that any day was the seventh day, and that the first day was any day; and that the Sunday law ought to be enforced to compel everybody to keep the first day.

Charlie—O, nonsense, George, you must have misunderstood him. A law like that would compel us to keep every day, and how could we do that? You are too full of your mischief, George, to listen to a sermon long enough to understand what the minister is saying.

George—Well, say; there comes Anna Hughes, our Sunday-school teacher; she was there, let us ask her.

Charlie—I will, when she comes up.

Charlie—Good morning, teacher; if you are not in a hurry, I would like to ask you a question.

Miss Hughes—Certainly; if I can assist you in any way I will be glad to do so. What is your question?

Charlie—George Thompson says that Elder Twist stated in his sermon last evening that the first day was the seventh day, and that the seventh day was the first day, and that any day was Sunday; and that we should have a law to compel everybody to keep Sunday. You were there, did you hear him say anything of the kind?

Miss Hughes (laughing)—I guess that George did not pay very good attention to what the minister was saying. We should be very careful when we try to repeat what our pastor says. I think Brother Twist is an excellent good man, and a very deep and profound reasoner, and sometimes it requires very careful attention to understand him.

George—Excuse me, Miss Hughes; did not the elder say we could call Monday the first day, and that would make Sunday the seventh day. Or, if we call Sunday the first that would make Saturday the seventh; or we could call any day the first day, and thus make any other day the seventh day of the week?

Miss Hughes—In that last word is where you misunderstood Brother Twist. He did not say that you could begin to count at any day and make any other day the first day of the week. He did not mean that.

George—Then what did he mean?

Miss Hughes—He did not mean that the Sabbath day in the fourth commandment was the seventh day of the week, but only a seventh part of time or one day in seven, and that you could commence to count where you choose.

George—Then the Bible does not recognize such a period as a week, does it?

Miss Hughes—O yes; the week is mentioned several times in the Scriptures. I think it is some place in Matthew we read that "In the end of the Sabbath as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week." And again, I think it is either in Luke or John that it speaks concerning the holy women, that "They returned and prepared spices and ointments and rested the Sabbath day according to the commandment," and then in the end of the Sabbath early the first day of the week they came to the sepulchre bringing the spices they had prepared, etc. And either in Acts or one of the Epistles, I am not sure which, Paul says, "Now upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning, when the people came together to break bread, Paul preached unto them till midnight," etc. And in several other places the week is mentioned.

George—In these texts you quoted, which day is referred to as the first day of the week?

Miss Hughes—Our Sunday, of course.

George—Then our Sunday is the first day of the week, is it not?

Miss Hughes—Why, certainly it is.

George—If those women you speak of kept the day just before the first day of the week, and the first day of the week is our Sunday, then which day did they keep?

Miss Hughes—Why, our Saturday, I suppose.

George—Then our Saturday is the seventh day of the week, is it not?

Miss Hughes—Yes; according to our count of the days of the week.

George—Then is not our Saturday the seventh day of the week, or the Sabbath according to the fourth commandment?

Miss Hughes—It must be if we abide by the present numbering of the days of the week.

George—You said, Miss Hughes, that the day Christ rose from the dead and the day the disciples met to break bread was the first day of the week, and that it answered to our Sunday. Then how could Elder Twist say that we could call Monday the first day of the week and Sunday the seventh, or that we could begin with any day and call it the first day of the week?

Miss Hughes—I presume that Miss Lovejoy is waiting for me, as we are going to Pleasant Lake to attend the picnic to-day; so I will have to leave you and Charlie to discuss the subject between yourselves until some day when I can have more time, and perhaps I can give you further information on the subject.

Charlie—I tell you, George, you got our teacher cornered, and I more than half believe that you are right.

George—I know that I am right. You think, Charlie, that I am a wild boy, and so I am; but I am not without feeling. When I go to meeting and hear the preacher talk about the love of God and how Christ came to die to save us from sin and give us the power to keep his Father's commandments, I am interested. But when I go and hear the minister mix up things as Elder Twist did last night, and tell the people that they ought to keep the first day of the week in honor of the resurrection, and that any day may be the first day of the week, and then want to enforce the law compelling everybody to keep Sunday, I don't take any stock in such preaching.

Charlie—But look here, George, if we had no Sunday law most of the people would stay at home and work or play or do something else. I would rather go fishing on Sunday myself, or play ball than go to meeting, and I would if it was not for the Sunday law.

George—Well, then, what good does the law do you? It does not take the desire out of your heart; and just as long as that is there you might as well go. And what good does the meeting do you while you are all the time wanting to go fishing or play ball? If there is not power enough in the preaching to take the desire out of the heart, you will never be any better by going, though you should go every Sunday as long as you live.

Charlie—That is all true. But don't you think, George, that we ought to go to meeting and Sabbath-school?

George—Yes, indeed I do, Charlie; I believe everybody ought to attend religious services. If no one went to church we would soon all be heathen. But what good does it do to compel us to go when we don't want to go? If the preachers would preach plain so that I could understand them and not put such queer interpretations upon the Scriptures and mix things up so, I would like to go to church, and I am sure I would be interested.
