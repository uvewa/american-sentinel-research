In Australia there exists a "National Scripture Education League," the purpose of which is to secure the teaching of religion in the public schools. In pursuance of this object, a meeting of the League was held in Melbourne, May 20, which was attended by about one hundred clergymen of the city and suburbs. Bishop Goe, of the Church of England, presided. The following comments relating to the occasion are from the Bible Echo (Melbourne), of June 7:—

"The object which the League has in view, as stated by the chairman, is 'the introduction of religion into our State schools.' And a communication read by the secretary stated that 'it is only through the ballot box that we can succeed.' The League, therefore, is evidently a religio-political organization. In view of this, it is not strange that the following resolution was introduced, and, with the exception of the negative vote of the writer, unanimously passed:—

"'That the ministers of religion and laymen here present pledge themselves to make every exertion to stir up the people in their districts so as to secure the return of members of Parliament favorable to the restoration of Scripture teaching in our State schools, and for this purpose pledge themselves to vote for no candidate whose opinions are not in harmony with the programme of the League.'

"This, as must be apparent to all, contemplates a purely political campaign. It means that both ministers and laymen shall engage actively in the business of political engineering, and shall 'make every exertion' to control the votes of the people, even by going to the length of obtaining beforehand a distinct 'pledge' from the electors that they will vote only as the League wishes them to vote. This is politics straight.

"And how purely political this movement is may be better appreciated from statements made by Professor Harper in introducing the foregoing resolution. He said, 'We are going to have some power.' Of course he meant political power, State power. But to seek such power in religious work is to deny the gospel. In the gospel there is all the power any Christian needs for the successful accomplishment of Christian work. Paul says the gospel is 'the power of God.' More than this, when Christians seek to accomplish their ends through the 'ballot box,' they thereby limit their power to numbers, and place their strength upon a purely numerical basis; for there vote simply stands against vote. On such lines they cannot succeed unless they are in the majority. But God's method of reckoning the strength of His people is very different. When they are connected with Him, and depend upon His power for the performance of their allotted work, He says 'One man of you shall chase a thousand,' 'and two put ten thousand to flight.' Josh. 23:10; Deut. 32:30.

"Again, Professor Harper said they intended to take such an attitude that politicians and men running for office would understand that the churches were 'a body of voters to be reckoned with.' This again degrades the church to a mere political level, and estimates its influence by the intimidating threat of how many votes it can cast in a political campaign.

"We are in hearty sympathy with the idea that the children need religious instruction, that no education is complete without such instruction, and that there is a lamentable want in this respect at the present time, as evidenced by the moral corruption and irreligious tendencies characteristic of the rising generation. But we are not in sympathy with the League's proposed method for remedying the evil. Religion, pure religion, the religion of Jesus Christ, cannot be inculcated through political measures and acts of Parliament. Neither has God made it incumbent on the State to see that men are brought up in faith. That is the work of the Church. And when the church endeavors to make the State do this work it is shirking its own responsibility. God never said to the State:—

"And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be in thine heart: and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.' Deut. 6:6, 7.

"No; this is God's instruction to His people, to the church, to parents. Here rests the responsibility; here is the tap-root of the whole question; here is the solution of the whole difficulty. Let parents do their duty in this respect, and the problem is solved. But if they fail, if they are not religious themselves, if they do not fear God and obey his commands, where is the hope for their children? We hear a great deal about our 'godless State schools;' but the difficulty is not with the State schools, but with the 'godless homes' in which the children are brought up."
