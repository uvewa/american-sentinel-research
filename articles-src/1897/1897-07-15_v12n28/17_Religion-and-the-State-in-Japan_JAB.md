By John A. Brunson.

In order to reach just and accurate conclusions in reference to the relation existing between religion and the State in Japan, it will be necessary to take a brief survey of the prevailing religious systems of the country.

The religious beliefs of the Japanese people may be divided into two classes—Shinto and Buddhist. It is not easy to define clearly either of these systems of religious belief, or the relation that they sustain to each other; for many of the Japanese exhibit a spirit of tolerance in matters theological that amounts to indifference, worshiping indiscriminately at either Shinto or Buddhist shrines. As a matter of fact, the two religions are so thoroughly interfused in practice that the number of pure Shintoists or pure Buddhists is exceedingly small. This rather remarkable and somewhat anomalous condition of things may be explained by the fact that Buddhism, after its introduction into Japan in the sixth century generously received into its pantheon all the native Shinto deities, explaining that they were only avators or visible manifestations of some Indian god, and therefore it would be proper for converts to Buddhism to continue to worship their ancient gods as before. By this compromise discontent among the Shintoists was allayed, and the Buddhist propagandists found their work of gaining adherents to their faith greatly facilitated. But mark the result—an instance of ecclesiastical hybridism, a corrupt system creditable to neither, so that the Buddhist gains were of rather doubtful nature.

Shinto is the native cult of the Japanese, being indigenous. Strictly speaking, it hardly deserves the title of religion, since it has neither creed, sacred books, nor code of morals. Certain modern Japanese writers, in their over-weening vanity, account for the absence of ethical teachings on the ground, that the innate purity of the Japanese people render such teachings entirely superfluous. Say they, only such depraved peoples as Chinese and Westerners need the restraining and constraining influences of a formulated ethical code.

Shinto recognizes a continued existence beyond the grave, but fails to teach whether it is one of joy or pain. Hence the doctrine of rewards and punishments is not inculcated as an incentive to right conduct. Its services are few and simple, demanding little more of its votaries than a visit to the local temple on the occasion of the annual festival. It is a combination of ancestor-worship and nature-worship. Homage is paid to the departed ancestors of the imperial family, who are supposed to be direct descendants of the sun goddess, and to the names of other distinguished dead. In the realm of nature there are gods and goddesses of fire, wind, ocean, rivers, etc.

The priests enjoy an unusual degree of freedom. They are not bound by any vows of celibacy, neither are they prohibited from seeking other professions, if preference so dictates. They are not distinguishable by their costume from other men, save when engaged in offering the morning and evening sacrifices, at which time they wear a robe peculiar to themselves. In short, the sum of man's duty as taught by Skinto may be expressed in a single line: "Follow your natural impulses, and obey the Mikado." As a religious system, it is vague and shadowy.

Buddhism, on the contrary, with its profound metaphysics, its gorgeous ritual and exalted ethics, powerfully appeals to the religious instincts of the people. It was introduced into Japan from Corea and China in the year 550 A.D. At first it was rejected by the emperor, and was more or less opposed for half a century or longer. But gradually it won its way to general acceptance by dint of prudent concessions and ardent, persistent labor. It soon became the predominant religion of the country, the Mikados themselves, the supposed descendants of the Skinto sun goddess, adopting it. Having once gained the ascendancy, it was comparatively easy to hold it, and it is to-day the prevailing religion of Japan.

As propounded by Shaka Muni, its founder, Buddhism may be called an atheistic philosophy. It teaches that ignorance is the genesis of all misery and suffering, and enlightenment the way of escape therefrom; that happiness and salvation come from within—from recognizing the impermanence of all phenomena, from the extinction of desire, the root of life. The salvation to be obtained is Nirvana, which Colonel Olcott, the modern apostle of Buddhism, defines as "A condition of total cessation of changes, of perfect rest; of absence of desire and illusion and sorrow; of the total obliteration of everything that goes to make up the physical man." It contains its decalogue, the precepts of which are as follows: refrain (1) from destroying the life of beings, (2) from stealing, (3) from unlawful sexual intercourse, (4) from falsehood, (5) from intoxicating liquors and drugs, (6) from eating at unseasonable times, (7) from dancing, singing, and unbecoming shows, (8) from using garlands, scents, perfumes, cosmetics, ointments and ornaments, (9) from using high and broad beds, (10) from receiving silver and gold. It is needless to add that priests and people live in constant violation of these moral precepts. Lying and licentiousness are prevailing sins of Japan, and frequently the priests set the example.

Numerically the Buddhists of Japan are strong. They are also active and aggressive, and vigorously oppose the advance of Christianity among the people. They are divided among themselves into various sects which detracts somewhat from their power, but nevertheless their hostility is the devil's most potent factor in retarding the progress of the gospel in Japan. They have learned, in recent years, lessons in propagandism from Christian missionaries, and are advocating the establishment of schools and kindergartens, the founding of orphans' homes and the education of women as indirect methods of spreading their tenets. They also make use of the printing press, sending out large quantities of tracts, papers and magazines, and are urging the priests to devote more time to viva voce preaching.
