The following from a resident of Kenmore, Ont., in the Canadian Baptist, of May 27, tells how the principle of religion in the public schools works in a district where the majority of the people are Roman Catholics:—

"In the eastern counties of this province, in districts where Protestant ratepayers are in the minority, the so-called public schools are practically Romish. The teachers in such cases are almost always Roman Catholic, which in itself, though not technically an injustice, is nevertheless an evil, for the door is thus thrown open to priestly influence and control. Think of a string of popish 'saints' days' and 'holy days' being observed as public school holidays in the Province of Ontario! Protestant pupils bringing home the tale that 'to-morrow is Saint so-and-so's day, or the feast of the holy something-or-other, and there will be no school.' Yet such is the invariable custom in some sections. And this is but a small thing compared with other abominations which they do. Prize books which inculcate the Romish religion are purchased from the general school funds and awarded to Protestant and Catholic children alike. Here are a few sample sentences from a book received in this way by a Protestant child a few months ago:—

"'The Immaculate Virgin was by her incomparable holiness, the masterpiece of her divine Creator. She it was who was to crush the serpent's head and save us from the curse pronounced on the first woman by bringing forth into the world the God-Savicur. She was that root of Jesse who was to produce the heavenly flower.'

"'Jesus Christ offered at the last supper and offers to God every day by his ministers, the sacrifice of sacrifices, that is to say, his body and blood under the appearances of bread and wine. O sublime mystery of faith! O abyss of power and mercy! Jesus speaks—and that which was but a moment before bread and wine is changed immediately into his body and blood. Then by an act of his sovereign will he gave to the apostles and to all their successors in the priesthood the power to renew upon the altar, until the end of time, the ineffable wonder he had accomplished.'

"'Feed my sheep;' it was in these memorable words that Jesus Christ invested St. Peter and the popes who succeeded him with the supreme power over the pastors as well as the people—a power which he had promised a year before when he said, 'Thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church.'"

All this only shows the injustice that is inherent in the principle of bringing religious instruction into the public schools. It matters not what religion it is that might be taught. The feelings and sentiments of the dissenting tax-payers would find expression in protests similar to the above. The only way to avoid injustice, discord, and religious controversy is to leave the teaching of religion to the Church, the home, and those schools whose support is wholly voluntary.
