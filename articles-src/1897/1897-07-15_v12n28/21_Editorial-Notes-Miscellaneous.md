THE "New England Sabbath Protective League," says its organ, the Defender, bases its conviction that "all classes and conditions of labor" ought to be made to take a weekly day of rest, upon "the great principle so felicitously expressed by Henry Ward Beecher, when he declared of Sunday: 'It is meant to be the one day in which a man shall feel, I am not a toiler, I am not a worker, I am not an underling, I am not an apprentice,

nor a journeyman; I am not a man on wages; I am not a hired man,—I am a MAN!'" This is very well so far as it goes; but the Lord wants an individual to be "a MAN" every day in the week, by becoming a son of God. Why not become reconciled to the Lord's way, and trust in the power of divine grace to make us what we ought to be, instead of in the power of a human statute?

A warm friend of the SENTINEL at Marquette, Kansas, writes: "To test whether subscribers could be secured for the SENTINEL here, I went out and in two hours received six subscriptions, the money for which I enclose. I am sixty-nine years old and not able to do much, but I simply wanted to learn whether or not the people here were willing to buy and read on the subject matter of the SENTINEL, and have found that they are. I shall do more soon."

FULL particulars of the unprecedented offer of the SENTINEL will appear next week, and we trust our friends everywhere will prepare to take advantage of it.

"RELIGION and the State in Japan," by J. A. Brunson (see page 442), comprises two articles, the second of which will appear next week.

By mistake, last week's issue was sent out as No. 28, which is the number of the present issue.
