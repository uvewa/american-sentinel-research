The incongruity of trying to follow the dictates of conscience and of what is commonly termed "patriotism," at one and the same time, is illustrated by the following, which was published recently in a New York City daily:—

"Lamar Fontaine, of Mississippi, killed sixty men in sixty minutes during the war. He bears a written certificate to this effect from Gen. Robert E. Lee. Now Mr. Fontaine does not care to be called colonel.

"It was in the battle of Waterloo Bridge, just below Warrenton, Va., in August, 1862, and immediately before the second battle of Manassas, that General Lee witnessed Fontaine's feet of killing 'sixty Yankees in sixty minutes.'

"Stonewall Jackson, under whom Fontaine served, was flanking Pope. The Confederate sharpshooters had possession of a long frame building, and were pouring death into Pope's ranks, when Lee rode up.

"The general had heard of Fontaine's wonderful ability as a marksman, and paid him a visit. A Federal battery was then directed on the sharpshooters.

"'Train your glass on No. 1, at gun No. 1,' Fontaine said to General Lee, 'and you will see him jump up in the air in a minute and another man will have to take his place.'

"Then he went on and killed sixty men, one after another, each in about a minute, until Lee told him to stop.

"'Doesn't your conscience ever hurt you when you do work of this kind?' inquired Lee.

"'Why, general,' replied Fontaine, 'when I enlisted in the army it was with the understanding that I was to kill as many of the enemy as I could. If I had any conscientious scruples against it I would quit the army. Don't you expect us to kill?'

And that is what every man who enters the army enlists to do. He does not enlist to follow the dictates of conscience, but the dictates of his superior officer, which are given with a view of bringing him to the highest point of efficiency as a fighter; for the one purpose of an army is to fight. And the best fighter is the one who can kill the greatest number of the enemy. An army composed of such men as Fontaine would be almost invincible.

But the "soldier of the cross" must follow always the dictates of conscience, enlightened by the Word of God. His pattern must be, not some man of military renown, but the Prince of Peace. His life must make manifest not feats of arms seen in the slaughter of his fellows, but "the meekness and gentleness of Christ."
