STRIFE is an exhibition of human nature; and there seems to be no way in which human nature manifests itself more readily. The mere-t trifle is sufficient to set the elements of contention in motion, regardless of the possible results. How this has been illustrated in recent history is mentioned in ●London (Eng.) daily of recent date, as follows:—

"Cicero said that the natural state of man is war. Certainly, whether savage or civilized he lets very few opportunities pass, as is proved by the trifles which have produced many terrible conflicts between nations. The Franco-German war, in which the loss of life was over 100,000, and the loss of money very nearly £1,000,000,000, resulted from a little bit of Royal match-making. Spain had a marriageable princess, and the German House of Hohenzollern a marriageable prince. Both were, apparently, anxious to join fortunes, but France objected. The King of Prussia generously agreed not to press the matter, but France, to make sure that a German should never rule the country on her south-western frontier, insisted on getting a promise that the proposal of marriage should not be renewed at any future time. Naturally Prussia declined to humiliate itself, and, unfortunately for herself, France, thereupon declared war.

"Perhaps our influence at Constantinople is of great importance, though some argue that it is of very little moment. Either way, it has cost as heavily, both in lives and money. That war of the Crimea, by the way, began in an absurdly trifling event. The cupola of the church of the Holy Sepulcher was out of repair. The Greek monks claimed the right of putting it in order. The Roman Catholic monks disputed their right. Russia supported one party, France the other. The monks came to blows; the diplomatists lost their heads. And then followed the war, with its frightful consequences.

"England's two wars with China have had admirable results, but the causes of them were really very trifling. The first one, in 1840, was about whether John Chinaman should be permitted to smoke Indian opium or not; and the second, that of 1856, resulted from the seizure of a villainous pirate by an armed Chinese vessel. The pirate was Chinese, and he sailed in a Chinese ship, but he cunningly hoisted the Union Jack. Under these circumstances, the pirate's capture was held to be an insult to England, and China's refusal to apologize led to hostilities.

"We all know that the Red Indians fought for the love of the thing, but we must have been pretty fond of it ourselves in days gone by, for we fought France 272 times between 1110 and 1815, and the cause in most instances was nothing more than revenge."

Strife is as foreign to the divine nature, as it is natural to human nature. The divine nature is the nature of the Prince of Peace, and it is the mission of the gospel to eradicate human nature from the heart and substitute for it the divine nature, which God gave to man at creation. In this, not in arbitration or peace treaties, lies the guaranty of permanent peace.
