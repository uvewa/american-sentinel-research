Moncton, N. B., July 8, 1897.

Editor American Sentinel: Bro. Andrew Turner was to-day brought before Justice Grant, of this city, for violation of the Sunday law. The complaint was laid by one Smith H. Brown, who runs a milk wagon on every day of the week.

The complaint was for doing servile labor on the "Lord's day, commonly called Sunday."

The complainant did not appear, and the magistrate dismissed the case, taxing the costs of the court upon Mr. Brown, and ordering that his goods and chattels be seized to pay the costs.

It was very evident that had any one appeared against Brother Turner, he would have had to suffer the full penalty of the law, as the magistrate stated emphatically that men may keep any, or as many days as they wish, but the law says that they must keep Sunday. He also declared that "it was fitting that one day in seven should be set apart by the law of the land as a universal Sabbath."

The neighbors and friends of Brother Turner were present and testified in a marked manner to the high esteem in which he is held by all who know him. It should be a source of joy to him, that the Lord has chosen him to bring the light of the message of Rev. 14:9-12 before magistrates in this place. D. G. Scott.

The Sentinel will have an offer to make next week that will interest every reader of the paper. Look for it.
