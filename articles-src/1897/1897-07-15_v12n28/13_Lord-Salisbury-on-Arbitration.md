In a speech before the House of Lords, July 8, the English premier referred to arbitration as a method of settling international disputes, and after expressing himself as in sympathy with the principle, mentioned the Delagoa Bay Railway dispute as an illustration. With regard to the prospect of an award by the arbitrators, he said, he could only say he was informed that it would speedily be given; and as that information had been regularly supplied to him for several years, the only consolation for them was that they were all supporting the sound principle of arbitration. The laughter which followed from the peers evinced their sympathy with Lord Salisbury's view of arbitration as a thing of practical value.
