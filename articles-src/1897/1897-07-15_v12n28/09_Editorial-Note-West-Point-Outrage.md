"The outrage at West Point is only one of the many injustices we have to suffer," exclaims the California organ of the papal church—the Monitor—in its issue of June 12. A church that is always complaining of injustice and railing against its enemies, as is the habit of the Monitor, thereby most conclusively proves that its character is non-Christian. Jesus Christ never did such things; he manifested another spirit entirely.
