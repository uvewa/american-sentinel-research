It is impossible to regulate conscience by law.

The truly wise man is he who can discern the signs of his own times.

It requires a whole week for the proper observance of the fourth commandment.

No person can keep the Sabbath before being converted to God. And the converted individual will keep the Sabbath of his own volition.

The correct standard of Sabbath-keeping—that which is acceptable to God—is infinitely above anything that can be defined in a human statute.

RIGHTEOUSNESS is no concern of the civil law. The Scripture says that an unrighteous person cannot perform righteousness; consequently, every law which is enacted to enforce righteousness is a square denial of the Word of God.

The worship of God is a matter which concerns the conduct of an individual not alone on the Sabbath, but on every day of the week. Freedom of worship does not mean that a person should be free to do as he may choose in religion on one day of the week, and be obliged to do as some one else may choose on another day.

The person who is not willing to make a sacrifice to keep the Sabbath, might as well not pretend to keep it at all. When the Lord comes to gather his saints, he will call for "those that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice." Ps. 50:5. People who want legislation to take all the sacrifice out of keeping the Sabbath, need not expect to get any benefit out of their keeping of it.

A RELIGION which will combine with civil government must be a religion which will fight, and fight with carnal weapons; for every civil government keeps a standing army for the purpose of fighting. Hence a union of religion with the State means the exaltation of an anti-Christian religion.
