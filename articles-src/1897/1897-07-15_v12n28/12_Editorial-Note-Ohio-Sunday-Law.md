THE Ohio law prohibiting Sunday baseball has been pronounced unconstitutional by Judge Ong, of the Court of Common Pleas. The case was that of the State against the Cleveland baseball club, and was brought before him on appeal from the decision of the State Supreme Court, by which the law was upheld. The basis of Judge Ong's decision is that baseball is not a crime on any week day, and that under the constitution all statutes make Sunday merely a day of rest and not of religious observance. The county will, it is said, appeal the case to a higher court.
