BY JESSE JARED.

Among the many blessings of our beneficient Father the power of exercising the will in all our actions is one of the strongest manifestations of an all-wise Creator. When we consider this subject in its great magnitude, it seems strange indeed that finite man should attempt a work that is so entirely foreign to our Creator, and still have it in mind to do honor to a Being of supreme love.

In contemplating this, as with most themes of God's dealings with man, our minds revert to the period in human history when all was as the mind of infinite Love only could devise. At that time when an all-wise Creator, who took in ages at a glance, placed man—the crowning being of his creation—in the position of ruler of the world, it must certainly have been that all was done which an all-wise Creator could consistently do to preserve him in perfect accord with the will of the Sovereign of the universe. Certainly if it were at all in keeping with God's nature to enact laws to restrain man from going contrary to the divine will, it would be expected that man would be placed under restraint sufficient to forever prevent him from reaping the fruits of a course of rebellion, which the Eye that beholds the end from the beginning, assuredly took in.

But what do we find to be God's plan of dealing with the creatures of his hand? Do we find such restrictions as would make it impossible for them to do other than what their Creator marked out as best? No; we find man made the recipient of the needed instruction, and warned of the fruits of transgression, but still left as free as the zephyrs that stirred the foliage in their Eden home. How easy it would have been to have prevented all that sin has wrought, had it been just in God's sight to enact even one measure to restrict man's will in regard to the service due the Lord. But a Being of love, as God is (1 John 4:8, 16) could accept only a service of love, and this could be rendered only by beings capable of serving the Creator from choice.

When man was placed in this position, there was a possibility that his choice would fall on the wrong side. What a short step it would have been to have deprived man of the power of going wrong! But He that "spake and it was done," did not deviate from the ways of right, eousness. After man fell through the influence of the wily tempter, and was no longer the free being that he was before, God pledged the sacrifice of heaven's best Gift that he might again liberate man's will. Gen. 3:15.

Passing through the centuries, we come to the time when God saw the wickedness of man was so great in the earth, that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually; and we find that God bore with their unbridled iniquity for one hundred and twenty years.

If ever there was need of a "national reform movement," certainly there was need of it then. But do we find the divinely-instructed Noah trying to effect the passage and enforcement of laws that would restrain that noble race from their course of immorality? No; we find only the record of his life of faith, and his preaching of righteousness. And after the great ark was finished, do we read that God caused man to go into the ark with the beasts? No; man was free to do as he pleased, and God could but close the great door on those that had obeyed the call of mercy.

We find all through the Scriptures striking evidences of God's plan to leave man free. He would devise ways almost without number to cause man to turn from the ways of death. When one servant was maltreated and the covenant people strayed from the ways of life, the yearning heart of infinite Love would institute other means whereby those that would might see and turn from the ways of death. And finally, the treasures of the universe were poured out in the gift of the only-begotten Son.

He came to a people that were in daily expectation of the Messiah, whom they thought would so reform the nation that the Jewish people might compel all to conform to the principles of the religion for which they were such ardent sticklers. But in all of the life of Christ do we find one instance of trying to reform the nation as such? He wrestled with the woes of this life for upwards of thirty-three years, and proclaimed the good news of salvation throughout the length and breadth of Judea in such divine power that the hardened officer returned word to the bigoted priests that "never man spake like this man." Whenever the touch or cry of distressed humanity reached him, his divine virtue went out to them in a degree that filled them with unutterable love and restored the stricken form to a condition of perfect health. All this was the manifestation of the life of God in mortal clay.

In all those years of our Saviour, who had all power in heaven and earth, can we point out one instance where he favored compulsion in the least degree. No; never do we detect the slightest indication of a spirit to use other than persuasive means to cause men to accept the offers of redeeming love. Amid a scene of universal rejoicing, that noble spirit was overcome by grief at the sight of the city that would not yield to the gentle pleadings of infinite Love.

If our divine Pattern would not compel even an assent to the doctrine he came from the throne of the universe to promulgate, how can fallen, sinful men engage in a work of judging and condemning their fellow-mortals? "If any man have not the spirit of Christ, he is none of his."
