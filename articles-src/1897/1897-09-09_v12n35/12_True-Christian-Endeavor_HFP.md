### True Christian Endeavor.

BY H. F. PHELPS.

"I THEREFORE, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called, with all lowliness and meekness, with long-suffering, forbearing one another in love; endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace." Eph. 4:1-3.

This is true Christian endeavor; and this is individual work. "Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith," is another exhortation to true Christian endeavor.

Some people are calling for a church party, that they may secure the election of church members to office, and clothe them with civil authority to examine others who may not be in harmony with their faith. They are calling for a church party, that they may bring all dissenters into the unity of their belief by the power of the State. This is not true Christian endeavor, as history will testify.

There was a church party in the time of Constantine, with which he exchanged his influence in religion for the influence of the church party in political matters. Thus an unholy alliance was formed, and the church party led the empire to ruin. This was not true Christian endeavor.

Inasmuch as the formation of a church party in this century is for a political purpose, for the sake of controlling the civil power in the interests of the church; and inasmuch as the logical result of the existence of such a party will be another such an unholy alliance as was formed in the fourth century; it follows that the logical result of such an alliance will be the ruin of this nation; and as the influence of this nation is world-wide, the ruin will be world-wide.

True Christian endeavor will not bring ruin, but salvation; for self-examination and keeping the unity of the Spirit, will bring the peace of Jesus Christ, which is salvation. True Christian endeavor is to follow Christ, and no one will deny but that Christ was the greatest leader in religious thought that the world has ever seen. He could have formed a church party, but he did not. He could have become a political leader, but he did not. And at one time when some of the people were determined to make him such, by making him king, he departed from them and hid himself. Christ made no mistake in thought or act. And the very fact that he did not form a church party nor become a political leader; nor even a religio-political leader, is evidence most positive that the followers of Christ should not attempt such a thing; and that such a course is not true Christian endeavor.

The example that Christ set is for believers to follow. Christ "emptied himself," and became a little child, that he might save others. And the fact that he did this is positive proof that salvation is not in a church party or any of its methods. Christ was emptied of himself who was all righteousness, and he who knew no sin became sin for us; and this is positive proof that we, who are all sin, must be emptied of self, or made righteousness in him, that we too may be instruments of salvation to others. And as Christ in the emptying of himself became a little child, so we too must become as little children; for it is said of us: "Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven."

As Christ was emptied of himself that he might save others,—not by the control of primaries and caucuses; not by or through a church party or a political alliance; not by the power of the civil arm, but by the power of his own love and goodness; "by the power of the Spirit of God,"—even so the Christian must be emptied of self and become as a little child, that others may be saved,—not by a church party, or by political methods; not by the power and authority of Caesar; but by the power of divine love, manifested in and through the believer.

This is true Christian endeavor. And the spirit of true Christian endeavor will lead the believer, as it led the Apostle Paul, not to be critical of others, but "giving no offense in anything," "in all things" to approve himself, even "unto much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in distress, in stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labors, in watchings, in fastings, by pureness, by knowledge, by long-suffering, by kindness, by the Holy Ghost, by love unfeigned, by the word of truth, by the power of God, by the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the left, by honor and dishonor, by evil report and good report; as deceivers and yet true; as unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and, behold, we live; as chastened, and not killed; as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things." 2 Cor. 7:3-10.

Let our good Christian endeavor people make a note of all this and follow, not their political leaders, but the Word of God. In so doing the blessing of heaven will follow them.
