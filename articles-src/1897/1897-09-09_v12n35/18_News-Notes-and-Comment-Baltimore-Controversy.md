NEWS, NOTES AND COMMENT

In Baltimore during the past two or three months, there has been quite a controversy going on between a Catholic priest by the name of O'Keefe on the one side and several clergymen of the Methodist Episcopal persuasion, the Methodist Protestant school, etc., on the other. The debate has been marked by the acrimony that too often characterizes ecclesiastical disputes, and the "calling of names" has been painfully frequent and severe. The subject-matter of the discussion is that old topic, "Sunday" and "The Sabbath."
