But Protestantism knows no "Labbaeus." Its ostensible essence, its one and only excuse for existence, is the utter repudiation of "councils," general and special, and of all their works. The Word of our Lord and Saviour is its code of laws, its only authority for points of religious faith and of religious practice. Not what has "the church" desired, but what did He do and say, is the sole question with which Protestantism has any concern. And upon "this rock" does Protestantism split to pieces when "the Sunday question" is in issue. Within the compass of divine revelation, as Protestantism receives it, there is no warrant, either in language or action, for the injunction not to "Judaize" by observing the Sabbath. Gentlemen who undertake to deal with this matter from the standpoint of the Protestant pulpit simply invite disaster and reproach.
