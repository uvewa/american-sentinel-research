**Some Signs of the Times.**

*From "Are We Nearing Anarchy?" by Chas. W. Super, President of Ohio University.*

It is sad to think that though Christianity has for eighteen centuries been proclaiming peace and good-will to men, no professedly Christian nation is yet ready to beat its swords into plowshares and its spears into pruning hooks.

Turning now to our own country, what are some of the signs of the times? . . . What evidence, for example, do they furnish regarding security to life and property and the impartial administration of justice? One thing is plainly evident—there is a growing disregard of human life. Fifteen years ago less than a thousand homicides and murders were committed in the United States. Within this time the record has been getting steadily darker. In 1888 the number was 2,884; in 1890, it was 4,290, and in 1895 it passed the 10,000 mark.

That these figures are not an exaggeration will be clear to any one who takes note of the contents of the daily newspaper. There is no nation in Europe whose government collects statistics that has one-fourth as many homicides in proportion to the population. We have even passed Italy in this respect.

This growth of savagery is attributed, and no doubt justly, to the increasing laxity in the administration of our criminal laws. On the one hand, the law abiding [?] portion of the people have lost confidence in the courts, and rather than take the risk of allowing vicious criminals to escape, they dispose of them when caught, red-handed. On the other hand, the criminally inclined exercise less restraint upon themselves, and run the risk of acquittal after they have been arraigned. It is not probable that a man who has murder in his heart usually deliberates carefully before the commission of a crime, but the uncertainty of conviction is "in the air"—is a theme of common conversation and has a baleful influence upon the minds of those who prey upon the public peace.

Either the standard by which the public judges its lawmakers is more rigorous now than formerly, or the quality of the article is very inferior. It is, however, certain that an extraordinarily large number of persons are eager to serve the government, whether Federal, State, or municipal, in almost any capacity. If there ever was a time when the office sought the man that time is not now. With every succeeding change of administration, the number of these increases. With the elective offices the case is hardly, if at all, different. For every seat in Congress, in the State legislatures, in municipal councils and even in school boards, there are usually from five to ten times as many candidates as can be elected.

What can we say of the sense of commercial integrity now prevalent among us? There is a widespread conviction that for a number of years there has been an increasing laxity in this respect. Men past middle life who have been engaged in mercantile pursuits for thirty or forty years, say that more persons now, than ever before, buy goods which they have no intention of paying for; or if they expect to pay when purchasing, they soon find it easier to repudiate their obligations than to meet them. To pay debts is hard work when it demands careful economy and self-denial; it is doubly hard when the repudiator loses nothing of his former standing in the community.

In many States laws seem to have been purposely framed to shield the debtor who does not want to pay. The assumption is that men get into debt unwittingly, or through the wiles of those who have something to sell, and not by a voluntary act. The enormous number of failures that have occurred during recent years, are for the most part caused by "inability to make collections." Let any one take the trouble in any small municipality where everybody is known to everybody else, to ascertain the number of persons whose commercial honor is beyond question, and he will probably be surprised at its smallness.

Coincident with the desire of so many persons to serve the public at the public expense, is the willingness of legislative bodies, no matter what their name, to appropriate money for the establishment and maintenance of all manner of public and private enterprises. Ours might be called an era of confiscation. There is much talk by public servants on the importance of economy, but nobody is willing to economize. Thousands of cities and towns have not only taxed themselves heavily for street paving, water works and other public improvements, but also to assist private enterprises that could not exist without such aid.

In most cases where large or relatively large sums of money are voted away by legislative bodies, charges of venality are freely made, and when they are sustained or can be made probable, the culprit or the suspects are voted out of office. But usually their successors are no better—proof enough that our standard of public morality is low. We seem to take it for granted that such offenses must come, even if we are willing to bring woe to him by whom they come. Furthermore, it is loudly asserted that in this country the churches, the great bulwarks of conservatism, have lost their hold upon the masses, especially in the large cities. The alleged reason is that the membership of the churches has, in a great measure, forfeited its character for uprightness, for fair dealing and for sympathy with the toiling millions.

Many of the struggles inaugurated by labor against capital are more or less tinctured with hostility to the Church. We are told that many of the clergy are more eager to hypnotize capitalists in order to get their money for some pet project, than to lead them to right living: that if a man is a liberal giver to ecclesiastical enterprises no questions will be asked as to his moral character, that this eagerness to get money for the church extends beyond its membership, and that the clergy are chary of denouncing bad men, no matter what their business, if they will only "shell out;" that the distinction between church membership and non-church membership is virtually obliterated; together with much more of the same sort. No careful observer will admit these charges in all their breadth, but who will dare say that they are largely false.

The decay of the old-fashioned orthodoxy has gone no farther among a certain class than it was a hundred years ago, but it has become more general. Has the spirit of brotherly love taken its place? The weak, the down-trodden, the oppressed and the neglected, are in many places yielding to despair. Having no hope or sympathy in this life and no expectation beyond, what is left for them but a practical application of the motto, "Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die." If the rich and the well-to-do make this their philosophy of life and are actuated by no higher-motives for themselves or their children, can we consistently expect anything from the rest?
