Mr. J. Alex. Chiles, attorney-at-law, Lexington, Ky., in remitting for several subscriptions he secured for the SENTINEL, says: "I am a constant reader of your invaluable paper. Every week it comes fraught with good, instructive and profitable information on topics of vital importance, and so much interested am I in the dissemination of these principles that after having read the paper, I take pains to place it in the hands of others. You are doing a great and good work. May you be blessed in it."
