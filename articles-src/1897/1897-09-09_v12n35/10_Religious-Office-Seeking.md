## Religious Office Seeking.

It is announced from Washington that the news of a vacancy in the grade of chaplain in the army, has brought in applications from three hundred ministers for the situation. This matter being under the direction of the war secretary, that official has fixed an age limit for the office, and has decided to require a physical examination of candidates, as in other departments of the service.

In the service of God the office seeks the man, and not men the office. "The eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to show himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him." 2 Chron. 16:9. God wants men; and when he finds a man that he can use, he has an office to put him in. The true Christian is never an office-seeker. He simply seeks to know and do the will of the Lord, and be faithful in whatever work God may call him to. There could be no stronger proof needed that the office of army chaplain is not of God's establishing than the fact that it is besieged by applicants and is under the control of the civil government.
