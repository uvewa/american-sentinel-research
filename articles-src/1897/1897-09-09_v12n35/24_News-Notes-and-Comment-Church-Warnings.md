Again and again does the "Holy Mother" warn her children not to "Judaize" (sic) by showing external respect to the Sabbath. Penalty after penalty is laid upon those who shall fall into this heretical custom. It is evident enough from these "decrees" that a strong antipathy existed at a very early date between the "orthodox" Hebrews and the Christians. Probably the work of conversion never made very great progress among the Hebrews at any time. The Gentile Christians were particularly anxious to be distinguished in the eyes of other people from the Hebrew race at large, because there was a great aversion to these last among the population of the Roman empire, easy enough to understand from their haughty exclusiveness, and not necessarily implying any reflection on their manner of life. Hence "the church" frequently enjoins a total disregard of the Hebrew Sabbath.
