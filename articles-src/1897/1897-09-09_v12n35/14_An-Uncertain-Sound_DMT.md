**An Uncertain Sound.**

BY DAVID M. TRAILL.

Our esteemed contemporary, *The Ram's Horn*, in its issue of August 7, gives an interesting account of an interview between a correspondent and "the only temperance cabinet officer," Secretary of the Navy John D. Long. After some excellent points on the good to be gained by abstinence from intoxicants, the writer proceeds as follows:—

"Then I turned to a purely religious subject and asked: 'Is prayer for divine guidance offered in the biweekly cabinet meetings, and do you as a Christian often feel God's presence there?'

"'Why, no, of course not,' he answered, 'The meeting is just like any other business conference.'

"'But do you not need wisdom from every available source at such times?'

"'We certainly do need wisdom,' he replied lightly.

"'And is not God the source of all true wisdom?' I insisted.

"'Yes; of course,' said he.

"'And do you not desire the prayers of the Christians upon the Cabinet deliberations?'

"'They can pray if they wish to,' he answered seriously, but with a view-point exactly opposite to the one I presented.'

"Far be it from me to criticise the Christianity of this honored body or any member thereof. But it does seem that there is something lacking in such a picture of the heads of an avowedly Christian nation directing the affairs of its people with no open acknowledgment of or request from the professed Ruler and Governor of that nation! Is not the ideal of every earnest Christian and may we not hope in the next century to have a Theocracy, where the chosen chiefs of the people will actually consider God as their Ruler and Head, and will accordingly openly invoke his presence in their midst and earnestly plead for his help in their undertakings?"

It is indeed extraordinary what false conceptions some honest and evidently intelligent persons will form of the duties of the cabinet and other governmental officers. The cabinet officers, on entering office, are sworn to fulfill the duties of their respective positions in accordance with law. Now the Treaty with Tripoli, made in 1796, and which according to Article VI of the Constitution is the supreme law of the land, declares that this nation is in no sense founded on the Christian religion. Why then should these officers turn the business conferences of the nation into prayer-meetings and so violate the spirit of the supreme law of the land? True that the Supreme Court has declared this to be a "Christian nation," but the decisions of no court are infallible and those of the Supreme Court have frequently already been reversed both by itself and by the people, and it is possible to do so again.

Furthermore, if some of the cabinet officers should decide to hold a prayer-meeting, according to what form of worship ought they to pray? Should our Catholic Attorney-General or the Catholic Secretary of State decide to get a priest to perform mass with all the accompanying Credos, Ave Marias, genuflexions and signs of the cross, what would the Ram's Horn think of it? And vice versa, would not our Catholic fellow citizens have a right to object to the Protestant form of worship in the same case? We would like to suggest to the Ram's Horn that it might be more in accordance with God's plan i public servants, in seeking wisdom from above, would follow the example of Daniel and Solomon as regards the time and place of their supplications. See Dan. 2:17-23; 6:10; 1:20; 1 Kings 3:5-12.

The writer is also much mistaken in supposing that an American Theocracy is the "ideal of every earnest Christian." Doubtless many honest but misguided persons are grasping at this ignis fatuus, but Bible-studying Christians know that a Theocracy will never be inaugurated till "He comes whose right it is." Ezek. 21:25-27. Our Saviour disclaimed the present kingship of this world. John 18:36. It was offered to him (Luke 4:5, 6) by the prince of this world (John 14:30; 12:31; Job 9:24; 2 Cor. 4:4), but refused under present conditions. On another occasion some good-intentioned but mistaken individuals tried to elevate him to the throne by force, but he very effectually prevented it. John 6:15.

If the writer of the above quoted article would seek the knowledge of God's plans of government for this world and compare them with his own plans, he would readily see that the "something lacking" is in his own view and not in that of Secretary Long. The Ram's Horn would not then give such an "uncertain sound" and would do more effective work in preparing the readers for the great battle between truth and error, between a false theocracy and God's system of government.
