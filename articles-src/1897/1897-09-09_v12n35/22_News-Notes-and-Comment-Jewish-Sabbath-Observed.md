The Founder of Christianity was a Jew, and he observed the "Jewish Sabbath." The first apostles were Jews, and they did the same thing. Their converts were, in the beginning, all of their own race, and it was never suggested to them that it was obligatory or expedient that a change should be made from this ancient, established and commanded way. We have a very clear account of the expansion of the Christian cult, so as to include Gentiles as well as Jews within its fold. We know that the extent to which the newcomers were bound to conform to the requirements of the Mosaic law gave rise to some discussion. And we are able to trace, though perhaps a little obscurely, the gradual increase in the proportion of Gentile to Jewish Christians, and side by side with this increase, the gradual rejection of the "Jewish Sabbath," and the adoption of Sunday in its stead.
