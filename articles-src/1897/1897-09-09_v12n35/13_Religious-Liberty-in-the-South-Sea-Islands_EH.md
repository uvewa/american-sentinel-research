**Religious Liberty in the South Sea Islands.**

BY E. HILLIARD.

In the South Pacific Ocean, near 21° S. latitude, lies a little kingdom known as the Tongan or Friendly Island kingdom. Its present population is 20,000. The inhabitants are of a dusky skin, and their habits and manner of living are similar to the people of the other South Sea Islands.

About seventy years ago, missionaries were sent among these Tongan Islanders to convert them to Christianity. As the result of a few years' labor, the entire population, nearly, accepted Christianity, and a marked change in religious customs was manifest. Idol worship and heathen superstition was exchanged for the worship of God and the principles of his Word. Everything has been gradually revolutionized until slight traces only of former times can be seen.

The methods of governing the people also have been changed. As far as the writer has been able to learn, Church and State were kept separate until the year 1887. About this time, some difficulty was experienced with a certain clergyman in the Wesleyan church. He withdrew from that religious body, and became a bitter enemy to it. Soon after, he became an active politician in the affairs of the kingdom. He was appointed a prominent position by the aged king, and soon after he became installed in his office, he inaugurated a plan for a new church organization. Other government officials cooperated with him in executing this plan, and by so doing flagrantly violated the governmental constitution which they had adopted.

In the granting of religious liberty, this constitution says, in its Declaration of Rights, Article 5: "All men are free to practice their religion and to worship God as they may deem fit in accordance with the dictates of their own conscience, and to assemble in such places as they may appoint." It was adopted in 1875, in the reign of George Tubou, amended by the legislative assembly in 1880, and ratified by the same body in 1882. The leading ones in the adoption of this constitution were the leaders in the open violation of the principles of religious freedom which it guaranteed to the people. Many things are labeled religious freedom, which strongly savor of religious bigotry, intolerance and even open persecution.

This was the case with this new church organization. Of course the church must have a name; and so the name of "Free" Church was given to it. It was a free church as long as men and women joined it of their own free will; but its members were not entirely made up of such ones. Some were compelled to join. Nearly all of the members of the old organization (Wesleyan) were natives, whose forefathers had been converted from heathenism to Christianity. When persuasion failed to woo them to the so-called Free church, then force was used and the power of the government brought to bear upon them, as the following sworn statements will show:—

**THE SWORN STATEMENT OF A NATIVE.**

"I, ———, make oath, and say as follows: On Monday afternoon, February 7, 1887, I heard the inspector of police tell the governor of Nina Foou that the Nina Foou fakaogos—i.e., Wesleyans—were to be sent by the government to him to do as he liked with, but he was not allowed to go off his premises. Early Tuesday morning I saw some men tied under the trees at the governor's place. This was at six o'clock. At about 8 o'clock, I saw the people, five men and one woman, brought by the police from the shade, and the men tied to stakes driven in the ground in front of the governor's house, exposed to the sun. I saw two men flogged, and I believe there were more. I saw two men, a native minister and a man with a red shirt on, repinioned. The men had their wrists tied behind them, and their elbows lashed together as close as they could be brought by a man applying a knee to the back, and so getting a 'purchase.' I do not know when the people were first tied under the trees. Later on I saw a native minister carried away, as he had fainted, and they placed him under an orange tree. This was about an hour and a half after he had been put in the sun."

This oath was taken in the office of the British Vice Consul. Another swore to the following:—

"I, ———, do hereby swear that on the morning of the twelfth inst., I witnessed several natives being thrashed and brutally treated in front of ———— (a high chief's) house, he himself watching the whole proceedings. Upon making inquiry, I found they were Fakaogos (Wesleyans) who had refused to join the Free church. They came from a village about twelve miles from Nukualofa. They were thrashed until they could scarcely speak; some fainting and others with blood streaming down their faces, were at last compelled to give in and become converts to the Free church."

**THE AFFIDAVIT OF A EUROPEAN.**

"I, ———, was at ———— on January 22, 1887, when a whole lot of painted men, naked to the waist, came up to turn the Wesleyans to the Free church. I recognized some of them. A man was asked to turn over, and he would not. He was then violently pounded with guns, and they threatened to club him. He did not turn over and they shot his pigs."

All of this cruel work was carried on in utter disregard of the constitution of the kingdom, which guarantees religious freedom to the people. When the spirit of revenge roots deeply in the soil of the human heart, government constitutions and laws are incompetent to restrain. It may have its beginning in the heart of the individual, but it is not always confined to that individual. Sometimes it breaks away, overflows its confines, and becomes a torrent that sweeps millions into the abyss of eternal ruin. Often personal hatred is meted out upon helpless, innocent subjects under the cloak of piety. The ones that carried on the fiendish work in the above-mentioned place will not admit for a moment that it was religious persecution; and yet church matters were the primary cause all the way through.

One of the singular features of this persecution is, that there was not a particle of difference in the creed of the old organization and that adopted by the new. It was simply a resolute determination on the part of one man, who was afterwards joined by others, to break up the old church, that a new order of things might exist under new leaders. How contrary such a spirit is to that of the meek and lowly Nazarene, who said, "Resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also." Not one of Christ's true followers ever raised a hand to compel any one to observe any religious institution, join any church, or accept any religious dogma. Men who are acquainted at all with the Saviour of mankind, know that he will not accept a coerced subject, and they never will go beyond persuasion, which, backed by the Spirit of God, is the only method of saving souls for whom Jesus died.
