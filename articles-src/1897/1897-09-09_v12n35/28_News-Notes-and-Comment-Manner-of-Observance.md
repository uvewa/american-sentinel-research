IT MUST BE BORNE IN MIND that the point is not the manner or way in which Sunday is to be observed. It is perfectly true that in this regard there is a great difference between Catholic practice and Protestant practice.

The chief observance exacted by the Roman church is attendance at "mass," at least once during the day. For the balance of the time, the faithful, it seems, are left pretty much to their own devices. On the other hand, most "evangelists" deem it righteous to abstain throughout the whole twenty-four hours alike from labor and from diversion. But this distinction is immaterial. To observe, or mark out, or distinguish, the day from other days in any fashion whatsoever on religious grounds is to accept the Roman Catholic church as a religious ruler and guide—to acknowledge her supreme authority, to confess her right to command us that we shall leave undone the thing that the Master did, and do, instead, in the name of His religion, that which he never did. Thus millions of Protestants weekly pass under the yoke, and, mirabile dictu, they are proud of it!
