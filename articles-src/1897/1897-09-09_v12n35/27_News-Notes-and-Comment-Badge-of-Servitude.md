FOR, I verily believe that there is no point of their entire theological system which these men would not sooner give up than this dogma of Roman Catholicism, that Sunday shall be substituted for the Sabbath. This badge of their servitude to Rome they flaunt in the face of the world, as if, in good sooth, they were proud of the collar that they wear. Calling upon all good men and true to unite against this enemy of American institutions, seeking to exclude the members of Rome's communion from all public positions of honor and trust; crying out in the next breath that the work of Romanism in the effacement of the Sabbath day shall be perpetuated as an "institution," and submission thereto be made compulsory on all by means of penal enactment; and declaring that beside this great issue, all that Luther and Melanchton and Calvin and Wycliffe stood for is dwarfed into insignificance! Surely, there is something anomalous here.
