"MAN," says Macaulay, "is so inconsistent a creature that it is impossible to reason from his belief to his conduct, or from any one portion of his belief to another." This general axiom is so commonly illustrated in the daily life around us that its manifestation occasions no surprise to any observant mind. But I think it is a little remarkable to find men clinging with peculiar and conspicuous tenacity to the one article of their professed belief which gives the lie to all the rest—the insistence on which is utterly inconsistent with all their other professions, and which cuts the very foundation from under the entire fabric of their avowed faith. And this is the psychological phenomenon presented by thousands of Protestants in their position on the Sunday question.
