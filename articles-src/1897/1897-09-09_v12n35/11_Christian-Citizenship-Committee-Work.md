### "Christian Citizenship" Committee Work.

Some idea of the systematic work being done by the "Christian Citizenship" movement for the furtherance of its cause, may be obtained from the following sketch of some of the committees now engaged in active work in the State of Illinois:

1. **Committee on Legislative Departments.**—This includes committee on the board of aldermen, county commissioners, the legislature of Illinois, and the Congress of the United States.

2. **Committee on Executive Department.**—This includes the town officers, assessor, collector, etc., the mayor, with the departments under him, the sheriff, coroner, etc.; the governor, secretary of state, etc.; the president, the army, navy, and other great departments of the General Government.

3. **The Judicial Department.**—This includes justices of the peace, county, State, and United States judges, and judges of the Supreme Court of the United States.

"It is expected that these three committees will learn thoroughly what these different departments are. They will learn who are our representatives in these different departments. They will report from time to time on their actions."

5. **Committee on Sunday Rest.** It is expected that this committee will report as to whether there is any work done on Sunday, except works of necessity or mercy. If the members of the committee find that there is such work done, they will recommend a plan to the full committee for causing such unnecessary Sunday work to cease.

6. **Committee on Obedience to All Laws, by Members of the Full Committee and Their Friends.**—This committee is to carefully digest the local laws and the laws of the State, and see whether there are any laws that have been unnoticed and are thereby being violated, and make a full report of the situation.

8. **Committee on Notification.**—This committee will consist of the secretary and his assistants, and the duties will consist in notifying every member, associate member, or honorary member, of the various caucuses, primaries, and elections to be held. It will also notify the members of the regular and special meetings of the general committee.

9. **Committee on Candidates.**—The duty of this committee will consist in making sketches of all candidates that are to be voted for at the various elections. It is expected that the records of the candidates will be carefully examined and truthfully reported to all the members of the general committee.

10. **Committee on Patriotic Celebrations.**—It will be the duty of this committee to cultivate a higher appreciation of the value and sacred obligations of American citizenship. They will urge the best methods of celebrating Washington's birthday (and Lincoln's birthday, if it seems best), Decoration day, and Fourth of July. They will stimulate not only the holding of meetings, but the decoration of the houses with American flags, etc. It is expected they will work especially among the young people, including the children of the public schools.

This sketch is taken from the August *Christian Endeavorer*. It is probable that in other States the work is similarly organized, and certain that it will be soon, if not so already. It will be seen that every candidate for office under this Government is to be brought to the test of "Christian citizenship," and if he does not pass the test, the whole force of the organization will be brought to bear, so far as it can be, to defeat him.

Of course such an organization will not indorse any candidate who is not in its view a Christian; and thus it will seek to impose a religious test for public office, contrary to the national Constitution.

How much real Christianity there is in this movement may be determined by a comparison of the work outlined above with the work of Jesus of Nazareth when he walked and taught in Judea, and with the gospel commission given by him to his disciples, just prior to his ascension.
