### Can Proper Sabbath Observance Be Enforced by Law?

Let us look at the question a moment. What is the Sabbath?—A day set apart by Jehovah for religious worship. How must it be observed? Christ in John 4:24 says, "God is a Spirit; and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth."

First of all we want to clearly and distinctly understand that no service is acceptable to God that does not come from the heart—that is not done willingly and gladly. Now true Sabbath-keeping is something more than just to refrain from physical labor on that day in strict compliance with the letter of the law. The person who truly observes the Sabbath does so because he loves to do as God commands, and through this cheerful, willing obedience he is led to view Jehovah as he is—the Creator of the heavens and the earth and all that they contain.

But suppose a man should say, "I don't believe in God. I don't believe one day is any better than another, and therefore I see no necessity of esteeming any one day above another?" Has he not a right to this opinion? Surely he has, just as much as any one else has to believe God to be the being the Bible describes him to be.

Now suppose, in compliance with a law of the land, this same man should refrain from work on the Sabbath day—go to church and to all outward appearance act just like those who were true worshipers.

Is that heart worship? No; because he doesn't believe in it. How does the Bible say God regards that kind of service? Read Romans 14:23: "For whatsoever is not of faith is sin." Then Sabbath-keeping by this man, without a change of heart, would be to him sin, and "the wages of sin is death." Such a man would be pretending by his actions to believe a thing in which he had no faith, and such a person we call a hypocrite—one of the most despised of all men.

Therefore it is absolutely impossible for the civil law—which takes cognizance only of outward acts and not the thoughts and intents of the heart—to enforce true Sabbath-keeping, and when it tries to do so it can only make hypocrites.
