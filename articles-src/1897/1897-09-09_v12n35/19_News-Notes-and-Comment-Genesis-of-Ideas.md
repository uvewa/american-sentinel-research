When some man greater than Buckle or any of his imitators shall arise, to exhaustively study and impartially delineate "The Genesis of Ideas," we shall have the most interesting and important book that the race can use. And the most curious and instructive chapter in that work will be the one that deals with the origin of the Sunday notion, and its strength and persistence among the Protestant denominations, who, in everything else, are hysterically hostile to the authority and the practices of the Roman church.
