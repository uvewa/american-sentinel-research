The reverend father is perfectly correct in this statement. It is really not a question of religion at all,—this substitution of Sunday for Saturday as a day of "religious rest." It is a question of history, pure and simple. This history is studied by Protestant divines in embryo, when they are preparing for their life work, just as it is studied by those who are qualifying themselves for the Roman Catholic priesthood. About many matters in human history there are disputes; facts themselves are sometimes contended for and against with much display of learning; how admitted situations came about and who was really responsible for certain things is frequently debated with zeal and bitterness. But there is no doubt and no room for doubt, concerning this Sunday question. Catholic, Protestant and agnostic have only to be sincere, and they will speak with one voice on the subject.
