There is another conclusive reason why the Powers should never select a pope to decide between them. Just as the Bible cannot be used in the public schools except as a sacred book, so the pope can do no public act except as pope. To recognize him as such, by charging him with the performance of a public duty, would be to pave the way for a return to medieval conditions. Custom would, as it so often does, gradually ripen into right. Men's minds would be accustomed to the idea that there was something about the pope which peculiarly qualified him to guide their destinies, and thus the path be opened for usurpation. Let us hope, then, that papal interest in arbitration may remain purely speculative for some time at least.
