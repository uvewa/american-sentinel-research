VERY suggestive is the announcement lately made in our European dispatches that Pope Leo is studying "the arbitration question" with deep interest. The desire to pose as the arbiter of international affairs is no new thing at Rome. The popes have ever been keenly alive to the exaltation of such a position, and the hold it would give them on the minds, if not the affections, of mankind. There was a time when this position was claimed as a matter of right by the successors of St. Peter. Gerohus, a writer in the twelfth century, published a work containing a scheme for universal and perpetual purification, "as feasible certainly," says Mr. Hillam, "as some that have been planned in later times." According to this scheme, all disputes between governments were to be referred to the pope; any sovereign refusing to abide by the decision of a controversy was to be excommunicated and deposed, and every other monarch was to attack the recusant at once, under penalty of the same treatment. Later on, Innocent III, claimed that his spiritual authority included a right to decide all issues that might arise between one nation and another or between rival claimants to a throne.
