THERE IS COMFORT FOR THE TRUE FRIEND OF HUMANITY IN THE PRESENT CONDITION OF EUROPEAN AFFAIRS. No matter whether "the Powers" are afraid of each other, whether each has about as much to manage as it is equal to, whether anarchism makes them shy of war, whether they dread the cost, or mistrust the practical value of the big ships they have built of late at such tremendous expense—whatever the motive, the peace of Europe is to be preserved by common consent. "So mote it be." And there is good reason to believe that this healthy state of mind will endure for some time to come, and differences, as they arise, will be settled by arbitration, instead of by an appeal to arms. But it is not likely that the Pope or Rome will ever be selected to arbitrate an international disagreement.

For only nations or the rulers of nations can be allowed to sit in judgment on the affairs of nations. It is simply unthinkable that such matters should be intrusted to the discretion of a private citizen. And, hard as it is for popes and some other people to realize the fact, the "holy father" is now, has been for many a day, and is likely to remain, a private citizen, and nothing else, so far as this world and this world's business are concerned. It may be true—and, if true, it must be a great comfort to the venerable Leo—that the hold of the papacy on the minds and hearts of its children has been rather strengthened than relaxed by the taking away of the temporal power. Perhaps its influence over personal thought—in the domain of mind—is greater than it was under the conditions of the past. But Rome is not at present a member of the family of nations to arbitrate or terrify.
