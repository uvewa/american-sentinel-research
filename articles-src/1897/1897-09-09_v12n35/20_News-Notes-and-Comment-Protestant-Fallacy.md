For everybody knows that the statements made a few days ago by one of the Protestant divines who has plunged into the midst of the fray in question, to the effect that for the "observance of Sunday," we have "the practice of Christ and his apostles," and "a divine command," are absolutely erroneous. The Catholic father, of course, has decided advantage here, and he is quick enough to seize it. In very vigorous and perfectly sound paragraphs he exposes this fallacy and brands the devotion of Protestants to Sunday as the badge of a servitude which they repudiate to the dominance of his church.
