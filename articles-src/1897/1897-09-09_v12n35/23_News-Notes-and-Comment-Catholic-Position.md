Now the various stages of this process do not bother the good Roman Catholic in the least. He opens his "Labbaeus"—that monument of Jesuit industry which contains in many ponderous volumes the "decrees" of many ecclesiastical councils, some of them long since denounced as mythical by certain inquirers. And, turning to the words "dies dominiens" he gets a long list of references to search out, to discover just how and when there accumulated around Sunday that "sanctity" and "holiness" which in the days of the Master and those who surrounded him pertained to the seventh day alone. It was all the work of "the church"—"the Holy Catholic church."
