We cannot hope to make this department what it should be without the active cooperation of those for whom it is specially intended.

Abraham Lincoln was counted as a learned man, but it was not because he had read many books. The secret lay in the fact that he appropriated, digested and made his own personal knowledge that which he gleaned from the few books he actually perused. So, in this work, if we want to really master the underlying principles of religious liberty, so that we can turn them to account,—know how to apply them to specific cases, it is necessary that we make them a part of our being, and to do this one should read, discuss, ask questions, and then put his thoughts on paper. This will teach clearness of idea and exactness of expression.

Have an idea and then learn to state it clearly so that everybody will understand what you mean when they read your writings.

Some people have a reputation for being "deep writers"—and rather difficult to understand. In the majority of cases this lack of clearness is due to the same cause that makes it impossible to see an inch below the surface of the Missouri river—mud!

We speak thus plainly of this matter, for we want our young friends to understand that "writing for the press" is not such a wonderful thing. It's simply having an idea and then expressing it in a clear and entertaining manner. This comes only by practice, and we therefore urge the readers of this department to lose no time in developing their talents along this line, and no subject is more fruitful with ideas and themes than that of religious liberty.

Let us hear from you. You will find in the SENTINEL a warm friend of every effort to rise from your present surroundings to something higher. W. E. C.
