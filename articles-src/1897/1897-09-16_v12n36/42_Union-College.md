THE advertisement of this institution of learning has appeared in our columns for some little time, because we know whereof we speak when we say that it is in every way worthy of patronage. It affords facilities and opportunities that can be found in but few other schools, and those who contemplate taking a course of study should not fail to investigate its merits. The president, in response to an inquiry as to its prospects for the coming year, writes: "The outlook for Union College is very promising. Many young people are seeking ways to secure the benefits that come through a training such as this institution can give. Not a day passes without receiving letters from young men and women who are making arrangements to be present with us the coming year. Besides the courses of study already arranged for, a new course for teachers has been prepared and is offered for entrance the coming year. This course supplies a need that has long been felt and will meet with general favor. The college is open September 15, and is prepared to receive all who seek an education of the highest order." Any one desiring information should address, N. W. Kauble, president, College View, Nebraska.
