God made men different from one another; he gave to each an individuality. But there is a power working in the world that tries to force men to act as though they were alike,—a power that sets fashions and prescribes customs for men in dressing, eating, thinking, and worshipping,—a power that has a few worldly moulds in which it would have all human thought and action run. All this is directly contrary to the plan of the Creator.
