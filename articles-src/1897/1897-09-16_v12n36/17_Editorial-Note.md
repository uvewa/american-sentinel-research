The press reports contain an account of a recent case in England against the London Times, under the old law of 1781, for advertising a Sunday concert contrary to the act. The judge avoided the issue by a legal subterfuge, ruling that the statute had not been violated inasmuch as "admission" to the concert was free, although it was a fact that the seats had been previously paid for. Such an evident disinclination to enforce these antiquated religious statutes, in the land of their origin, ought to be brought to the attention of Canadian and American judges who are so zealous in the enforcement of these laws which they have derived from England.
