There is law which all Christian people regard as the expression of Deity's will—it is made up of moral precepts, or a law enjoined on the race, and of physical processes, or a law observed and formulated by the men of science. All the operations of nature that we see going on daily around us, Christians refer to the Maker and Director of the universe. They also believe that His will has been expressed for their guidance, as well as in the course of the flying bullet, or the running of the rivers. But neither the moral nor the physical law is within the purview of a lecture course at a law school. And any other religious dogma has as much application and relevancy to the commencement exercises of such an institution as this statement of Bishop Hooker's.
