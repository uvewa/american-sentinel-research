One does not expect uniform scientific accuracy in the utterances of an orator whose main object is to "make a point" for or against some man or thing. Nor is the language of avowed eulogy to be sifted and criticised after the method applicable to the definitions of mathematics. And, finally, a bishop may fairly claim some license in the way of hyperbole, which would be generally denied to a mere layman. But these general propositions, like most other human words, are subject to some limitation.
