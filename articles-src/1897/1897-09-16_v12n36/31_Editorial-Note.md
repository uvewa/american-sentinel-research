On the other hand, applied to the law which lawyers have to deal with, and which the students thus addressed have been investigating, the language of Bishop Hooker is preposterous and wicked. All of this law, from the inception of social development to the highest and most complex system of civilization, is the work of men's hands, and of their hands alone. There is nothing whatsoever sacred, or divine anywhere at all in or about it. It arose from human necessity, just as clothing is adapted to our natural wants. But a suit of clothing may just as fairly and reverentially be said to owe its origin to Deity as any human law, "common" or "statute."
