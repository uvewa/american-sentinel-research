How to make the most of her chances here is the disputed problem with her leaders. Some years ago we had what was called the "Cahensley movement." This resulted from a suggestion by a foreign prelate that immigrants to this country should be always served by a priest of their own nationality—thus preserving, as far as possible for the church, the distinctions of race prejudices and race customs which our naturalized citizens bring with them from their various native lands. The best thought of the Roman church prevailed against this innovation.

But a little while afterwards the cry arose that teachings of a "broad" and liberal sort were undermining the strength of the church in the United States, and weakening the hold of the priesthood on the minds and hearts of their charges. This was the state of affairs which Cardinal Satolli was invested with the duty of inquiring into and reporting upon. One of the results of the cardinal's inquiries was the removal of Bishop Keane from his place at the Washington University and his call to Rome, where, we are told, he was awarded a comfortable position on the "staff" of Pope Leo. It was generally supposed that this was the last to be seen of the too-liberal bishop in our country. Now, Satolli has gone back to Italy, and Bishop Keane returns to us, and is made the incumbent of one of the most important sees in the country. The change probably marks a reversal, or, at any rate, an important modification of the strict policy favored by Satolli. Roman diplomacy is always astute, and nowhere are the signs of the times more carefully studied than in the ancient palace on the banks of the Tiber.. Concessions to the spirit of liberty that prevails in the United States are now in order. These may produce no rupture or schism in the church, but will they really strengthen it? Is there any alchemy of mortal mind or thought that can fuse together the doctrines of liberty and infallibility?
