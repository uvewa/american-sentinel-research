If, then, the two great organizations really exhaust the possibilities of our national political life, why a new party? Is it gotten up to deal with a matter not legitimately within the scope of free American politics? Does it represent an un-American idea which it proposes to carry into effect by un-American methods? There is a hostility to "aliens" discernible in its platform which is strongly suggestive of this notion, and it appears to be held by some who profess to be cognizant of the facts. "The separation of Church and State" is among the things which are called for. But will the new party stand up manfully and sincerely for any such thing? Will it, for instance, denounce the Sunday laws, the employment of public chaplains, the exemption of church property from taxation, the reading of the Bible in the public schools, and all similar outward and visible signs of the inward and intimate union of Church and State which exists in this country to day?
