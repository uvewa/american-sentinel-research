A Romish priest preached on this subject a few sabbaths ago. His method of proof was as follows:—

"The church cannot err in proclaiming doctrines. There can be no new dogmas of any kind whatsoever. The doctrines taught are those given to the church by Christ himself. 'Go therefore, teach ye all nations, teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you; and, behold, I am with you all days, even to the consummation of the world.'" Matt. 28: 19, 20.

"Here we have our Lord giving to his apostles the power given to him from on high. In delegating that power he strengthens it by telling them that he is with them for all time. So there is no danger that they will fail. They will be infallible because God is there with them to help them to accomplish their duty. Therefore, infallibility is a gift of God to St. Peter and his successors."

Christ's address quoted from Matthew was not to Peter, but to the eleven disciples (see verse 16). As it was physically impossible that the eleven should teach all nations, the command was evidently given, not to them only as individuals, but to all who should believe on him through their word. John 17:20. What he commanded them he inspired the evangelists to record. The infallibility is in the Scriptures, which were written for our instruction. But if it was in the apostles, as this man claims, what right has he to take ten from eleven, leaving one as the only infallible apostle, with authority to transmit his exclusive prerogative to a long line of successors, some of whom were notoriously wicked? No wonder that Rome withholds the Scriptures from the people. If they could read that twenty-eighth chapter of Matthew for themselves, they would see that Christ has no idea of giving Peter any exclusive position or authority. If Peter was to be his vicegerent, if the other ten and all the rest of the "five hundred" were to look up to Peter as their sole and infallible leader, that was the time for our Lord to say so, and to emphasize the duty of obedience to the head of the church.
