For several years a controversy has been in progress in London, Eng., over the question of teaching religion in the Board (or public) schools. A large party composed of adherents of the Established church demand that religious instruction be given the young pupils in the schools, and a spokesman for this party has recently laid down the proposition that "no instruction is worthy the name of education unless it rests upon religious faith, influencing character by religious motives, and regulating and restraining conduct by religious sanctions." If the church party wins in the contest, the basis of the religious instruction given is to be, the Bible, the Lord's Prayer, and the Apostles' Creed.

The contest is said to be raging now with great bitterness, and people in this country should take warning from such object lessons and carefully avoid all ground for such unhappy controversy here. Religious teaching cannot be put upon a par with the teaching of arithmetic or geography. All true religion is taught by the Word of God and the Holy Spirit.
