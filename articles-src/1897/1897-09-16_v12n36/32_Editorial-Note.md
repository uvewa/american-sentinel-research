"GOVERNMENT" is a machine, likewise, of human construction alone. It is a means or way devised by men for the enforcement and application of the common will known as "the law." It has no sanctity, nor peculiar claim to unwilling respect, save in so far as it can coerce. No individual is under any obligation to surrender his conscience to its decrees. On the other hand, its action adds nothing whatever to an existing moral obligation. Right and wrong are matters of that law which has its seat in the bosom of Deity. Human law knows nothing, can, from its very nature and its origin, know nothing about either.
