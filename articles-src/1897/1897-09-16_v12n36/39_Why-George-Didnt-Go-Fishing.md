"Hello, George; say, don't you want to go fishing tomorrow?"

George Sellers, the person thus addressed, was a youth whom Father Time had just ushered into the 'teens. At the sound of a familiar voice he looked up from the paper he had been reading, upon the front porch of his home, and saw his young playmate, Fred Atkins, looking at him from the roadway a few rods distant.

"Yes," he said, in reply to the query that had reached him, "I'd like to go well enough, but"—

"Well, come on and go," said Fred. "My brother Will got home from college this morning, and we're going to the lake to-morrow, and I know where there's some fine fishing."

"Well, I'd like to," said George, rather slowly, "but to-morrow's Sunday, you know, and my pa wouldn't let me go."

"Why, is that so? I thought he worked on Sunday himself," was Fred's reply.

"So he does; but he says I've got to keep Sunday, and that he would keep it if it wasn't for losing his job. They had a meeting of some kind in town the other night that pa went to, and he says they're going to have a law passed to make everybody keep Sunday; and then he's going to keep it."

"Can't he keep Sunday if he wants to without having a law to make him do it?" queried Fred, in a tone of surprise.

"Well, he don't think so, I guess," answered George. "He says he can't afford to lose his job, so he can't keep Sunday till they have a law to make everybody stop work Sunday, so that nobody will lose their jobs."

"What makes him think he ought to keep Sunday, anyway? Does he read it out of the Bible?"

"No; I never heard him read anything like that out of the Bible; but he said when he got home from that meeting he went to, that the man who spoke told them that Jesus Christ kept Sunday. He had a saw there like carpenters use, and he held it up and said it was the saw that Christ laid down every Saturday night."

Fred laughed. "That's a likely story; I don't believe he had any saw that Christ used, any more'n he had a piece of Noah's ark."

"Well, I don't know as he said that, exactly, but he made pa think so, and a lot of others, I guess. It was the first time they had ever been to such a meeting."

"How did he know that Christ worked on Saturday?" asked Fred. "Why," he continued, after a moment's pause, "I heard my Sunday-school teacher say that Christ's parents were Jews, and if that's so they must have kept Saturday and Christ must have kept it too."

"Yes, that's so," commented George.

"What else did he say?"

"Oh, I don't know," said George, "I didn't listen to all pa said about it. Oh yes," he added, with a sudden recollection, "pa said he told them he never heard of anybody gettin' poor on account of keepin' Sunday."

"Then I don't see what he wants of a Sunday law, or what the people want of it, if folks who want to keep Sunday can get along all right without it," observed Fred. "If the Lord wants people to keep Sunday can't he take care of them when they do it?"

"I should think so," said George; "ma says the Lord takes care of everybody, and if he takes care of people when they're doing wrong, I should think he'd take care of them when they do as he wants them to."

"If your pa believes this, what makes him afraid to begin keepin' Sunday right now," Fred ventured.

"I don't know," George answered, reflectively, "unless it's because he isn't sure God wants him or anyone to keep Sunday. He was lookin' in the Bible the other evening, turnin' over the leaves and hunting for something that he couldn't find, and after a while he asked ma how the preachers knew that Sunday was the Sabbath, anyway. And ma she said she didn't know, but she guessed it must be so if the preachers said so."

"I've always thought," observed Fred, "that the preachers knew a lot more about some things than they could get out of the Bible. I guess that's one reason why I never cared much about goin' to church. Well," he added, as he turned to go, "I'm sorry you can't go with us to-morrow, and as long as your pa can't find anything in the Bible that says it's wrong, I should think he might let you. I know the Bible says the seventh day is the Sabbath, but that's Saturday and not Sunday, and nobody but Jews keep Saturday."

"Yes," they do," replied George, quickly; "some Christians keep it; ma knows of some that do. There were some people in the town where she used to live that kept it. I don't remember what she called them, but they weren't Jews."

"I wonder how they managed to live and not work on Saturday?" queried Fred, pausing, "Saturday's the busiest day in the whole week."

"That's so; but they got along all right, and they were strict in keepin' it, too, ma says."

"And did they want a law to make other folks quit work on Saturday?"

"No; I guess no one ever heard of such a thing as that. They probably thought if the fourth commandment said to keep the seventh day, that was all they needed. And I should think," added George, "that it would be, if it was the word of the Lord."

"Yes; so should I," said Fred. "Well, good bye, and if I were you I'd tell your pa he must find me a Bible text for keepin' Sunday if he wanted me to keep it."

"I'll do it," answered George. "Good bye."
