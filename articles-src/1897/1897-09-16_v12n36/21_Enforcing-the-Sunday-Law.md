This week we have additional evidence that the Council of Churches is a religio-political organization whose chief aim is to unite Church and State and enforce religious dogmas, chiefly the Sunday institution, on the people by law. The following is from the Sydney Morning Herald, of July 5:—

"As a result of the recent deputation from the Council of Churches to the colonial secretary, the inspector-general of police (Mr. Fosbery) forwarded instructions to heads of the police in the eastern suburbs that the sabbath observance law must be strictly obeyed by all shopkeepers. Yesterday the police were very busy all the morning in notifying the various shopkeepers of the fact. The instructions to the police are that the law is to be rigidly enforced."

Here is proof of what the church leaders are after in their vociferous clamors for what they are pleased to call a "recognition of God in the Constitution." They simply want a constitutional basis for enforcing religious observances on the people by law. They want laws to force upon men the observance of a day which God has never commanded them to observe. This is what they mean by recognizing and honoring God.

Let those who fear God and desire to keep His law, have nothing to do with this movement. It is not Christian. Christ forces no one to serve him, neither has he commanded men to keep Sunday in opposition to the law of God, which commands them to keep holy the seventh day. Christ kept the Father's law and taught others to keep it, and the true followers of Christ will do the same.
