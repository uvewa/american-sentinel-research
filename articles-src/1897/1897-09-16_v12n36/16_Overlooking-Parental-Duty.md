THE Union Signal, of August 26, says that where there is a tendency in the denominational school to leave the spiritual development of the young people under their care entirely to the church, the result is, invariably, that there has sprung up in the college itself a worldly spirit utterly destructive of all spiritual growth. This shows that the moral training of the youth must not be left to the church; and it might just as truthfully have been added, that where the moral training of the youth is left to the schools and colleges, the same spirit destructive of spiritual growth generally takes possession of the pupils.

Parents and guardians must do the first and most important work in religious training. The denominational school and the church can at best do little more than supplement the work that is done in the home.
