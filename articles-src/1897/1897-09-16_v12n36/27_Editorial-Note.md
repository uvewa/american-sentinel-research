The States are the places to begin this work. Create a healthy rational public opinion in the respective States, so that their statutes and their customs may reflect the absolute and unqualified acceptance of the American doctrine of separation between Church and State, and the few instances where this principle is violated in the course of our Federal administration will soon disappear of themselves. A more sublime mission for any man or set of men to embark in could not well be conceived. I wish I could believe that there is a prospect of its being assumed by disinterested patriots in every county and township of the land. But I see no reason for believing that the St. Louis movement indicates anything of the sort.
