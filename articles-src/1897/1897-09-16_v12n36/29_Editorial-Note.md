I am moved to the above remark by the fact that at several law school commencements recently held, the chief speaker has seen fit to quote, with apparent or express approval, the famous assertion of good old Bishop Hooker to the effect that law "has her seat in the bosom of God." Taken in connection with the occasions mentioned, this oft quoted statement is either meaningless, or utterly false, as well as absurd and blasphemous.
