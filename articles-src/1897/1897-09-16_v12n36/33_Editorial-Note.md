These fundamental truths cannot be repeated too often, or insisted upon too strenuously, while Bishop Hooker's words are quoted and indorsed. It is treason to American institutions for any speaker to instill into the minds of our young men the subtle poison of this idea that there is something sacred about human law and human governmental machinery. Thus are they induced to receive the old conception of the divine right of kings in a new form, and one more pernicious and demoralizing than it ever assumed in the worst days of its practical application. For to believe in the divine mission of the community is a mental slavery infinitely more deplorable and hapless than to worship at one man's feet, as the Heavenly-appointed ruler of our lives.
