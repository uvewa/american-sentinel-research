Why is it that the very words "nation" and "war" seem almost to be synonymous terms? No sooner does a feeble State begin to push its puny head up into political air and to struggle for a breathing space and standing room, but it must strive with competitors for a bare existence. There seems to be an idea abroad that there is not room enough for any State, whether it be large or small, to live within its own borders.

A province becomes a duchy, the duchy gathers an army and forthwith expands into a State of power and pretensions. Its ruler audaciously robs a contiguous realm of part of that realm's territory and fights through a term of years for possession of his new acquirement, and thus a powerful kingdom is established, a covetous eye is cast over a mass of adjoining States, they are annexed with their consent more or less forced, and the kingdom has become an empire, and the end is not yet; the empire reaches after more and still more possessions; it has become one of a family of empires, each wanting the earth, and every step of the history of each of those countries has been a war.

This is very like the story of the growth of every important nation in the world; war, war, either threatened or actual, upon any or upon no provocation. Look in any direction we may and each independent State appears like a gigantic individual whose face wears a continuous scowl. The ugly look is sometimes thinly wreathed with smiles, but no one is deceived thereby; the smiles are those of one whose both hands are armed and whose intentions are known to be hostile.

The constant, constant strife and rivalry for power, place, preferment, employment, wages, upon the part of human beings, is seen in magnified proportions and more forbidding aspect in the case of nations. For a nation to entirely disarm is to invite encroachment or revolution.

When an individual refuses to carry weapons, to have hem in the house, or to resent affronts and injuries; when meekness is made an attribute to the character, it seems as if all surroundings become hostile, and octopus tentacles of ill will reach toward the defenceless seemingly from every quarter; and a nation living with peaceful intentions toward its own and other peoples, unarmed and following only the pursuits of peace, with no menace in its looks and naught but friendliness in its life, would perish from the face of the earth before the covetous propensities of the national beasts of prey around it. Such a nation in this world is impossible except it be a scattered people as the Christian nation, the isolated, earth-strewn Israel of God.

The King of such a people, breathing peace to all, could not live upon earth. He was crucified because he was of a loving and a peaceful nature. Peace is not the natural condition here, nor is it permanently desired by the world's people. Nations are armed for battle and desire to show their powers.

But the increase of Christ's government "shall be peace as long as the moon endureth."
