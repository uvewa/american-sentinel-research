THE CHURCH RESIEGING THE COLONIAL PARLIAMENTS.

Having failed to secure from the Federal Convention the religious declaration in the Constitution which they desired, the leaders in this movement now purpose to accomplish through the Colonial Parliaments what they failed to get in the convention. Says Professor Rentoul, of Melbourne:

"Let the churches unite to see that this great blunder is not perpetuated. . . . Let them bombard Parliament."—Melbourne Argus, May 7.

From this it will be seen that this whole movement is a church affair, led on by certain church leaders. That the latter do not take their defeat in the convention with the best grace is evident from a further statement by the same gentleman:

"The convention, by their refusal, have simply forced upon us, needlessly, the labor and expense of having this good thing effected through the respective colonial legislatures."—Melbourne Age, April 26.

But this being the only course left to secure what they demand, they purpose pursuing it. Their plan is to enter the arena of politics, turn the churches into political machines, and "bombard Parliament." That none may think we are overstating matters, we will give a few further proofs.

At a meeting of the commission of the Presbyterian Assembly, of Victoria, held May 6. the "Public Questions Committee" submitted a report in which they say:

"The committee ask the commission's special authority to use all efforts to secure concerted action on the part of the various churches in the respective colonies of Australia and Tasmania, so that the various Parliaments shall be effectively moved to decide in favor of an amendment in the preamble of the Constitution, giving effect to the people's wish that there should be recognition of God as Ruler of nations and Source of righteous law."—The Argus, May 7.

The next day the Assembly passed the following motion:—

"That in view of the coming general elections, ministers be instructed to press upon the people the imperative duty of supporting only such candidates as will vote for Scripture instruction in the State schools, and such as promise to maintain the recognition of God in the Constitution of the proposed Commonwealth."—The Age, May 7.

And the moderator of the same Assembly, in the course of an address delivered at a meeting of the Presbyterian Elders' Association, held in Melbourne, May 5.—

"Reviewed the history and the special influence of the Presbyterian church, and stated that its present great duty was to see that modern democracy was not an unchristian and godless democracy."—The Age, May 6.

The South Australian Anglican Synod is likewise bent on doing the same thing, as the following will show:—

"At the meeting of the Anglican Synod to day, the standing committee was instructed to take any steps necessary to secure the recognition of divine providence and the belief therein as the best foundation of the nation's well-being in the proposed Federal Constitution before its final adoption."—The Argus, May 7.

And the Sydney Council of Churches has passed the following resolution:—

"It is hereby resolved that a petition be prepared and presented to Parliament (to be signed by the chairman on behalf of the Council), urging the insertion of the said clause before the Constitution is adopted by the legislature of this colony."—Adelaide Daily Telegraph, April 30.

These are sufficient to show the plans that are being laid, and the steps that are being taken, to unite religion and the State in Australia.
