But our country has gotten along with substantially the same politics, and same party representatives of politics, for more than a century, and gotten along fairly well. Every candid man acknowledges that the purest patriotism is compatible with either the tendency to minimize Federal authority for which Democracy stands, or the disposition to rely rather on the government of Washington than on the States for the promotion of the general welfare and happiness of the people, which is the inspiring spirit of Republicanism. So long as the battle between these two great conceptions is honestly waged, the citizens are safe. Nor is there any serious danger that the pendulum will swing too far in either direction, while the people are true to themselves. Centralization reached its climax just after the civil war. A country which so triumphantly emerged from the unprecedented conditions of "reconstruction," with its institutions substantially unimpaired, and throttled "Cæsarism" as it did secession, may count with confidence on its ability to take care of itself.
