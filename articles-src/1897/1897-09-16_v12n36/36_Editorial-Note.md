At this writing it seems assured that the New Orleans bishopric of the Roman Catholic church, recently rendered vacant by death, will go to the celebrated Bishop Keane, erstwhile of the Catholic University at Washington. Public attention is thus called anew to the strange controversy which has for some time been going on in the Catholic church of this country between the "liberal" and what would be called in Europe the "ultramontane" wings of the priesthood. The Vatican has long taken a deep interest in her United States affairs. She seems at times to cherish a hope that, should her European influence gradually slip away from her, the loss will be more than compensated by accessions on this side of the water.
