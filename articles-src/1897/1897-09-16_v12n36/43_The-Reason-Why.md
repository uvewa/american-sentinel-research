The Signs of the Times, in its issue of the 2nd inst., thus speaks of the interest of the people in working for the SENTINEL:—

"A brother in Waukon, Iowa, over seventy-five years of age, recently secured eight subscribers for the AMERICAN SENTINEL. Our older brethren are prone to deem themselves on the retired list, while there is still work that they can do. Here is an example for them. The SENTINEL is always full of that information for the want of which the people of the United States are being unwittingly led into the delusive web of Church and State union."

This is only one of more than a score of similar instances where men and women passed their allotted span of life, did valiant service in securing subscriptions for the SENTINEL under our late special offer. Their hearts were bound up in the work, and they couldn't help it.

Mrs. J. M. ABELL, of Elmhurst, Cal., in remitting for her subscription, writes: "I have watched every advancing step the SENTINEL has made from its first number, and more than once has my heart beat faster at its intrepid uplifting of truth and freedom as revealed in the Word."

Mr. L. E. HILDRETH, of Stoughton, Wis., in sending a club of twelve subscriptions to the SENTINEL, says: "The AMERICAN SENTINEL is one of the best antidotes I know of to administer to the average politician who finds himself in the bewildered condition incident to the button-holing Church and State lobbyists who besiege him in the halls of Congress."

ELD, H. F. PHELPS, of St. Paul, Minn., press agent of the International Religious Liberty Association, of that State, and who has done much to disseminate the principles of religious liberty among the people of the Northwest, writes saying: "I want to say for your encouragement that I have read the AMERICAN SENTINEL from its very first issue, and feel that I am in a condition to judge of its merits, when I say that the last is the very best—the best of the wine at the last of the feast. In the beginning I used to wonder if there was enough to the subject it treated to keep it running right along without becoming exhausted, but there seems to be no end. More and more and better and better is the story now. Long may it live and much good may it do."

A warm friend of the SENTINEL, from Nebraska, thus speaks of the Young People's Department lately begun: "I am very sure this is a move in the right direction. Our children ought to know more of the fundamental principles of religious liberty than the most of them do, and the simple manner in which the subject matter is presented cannot fail to awaken an interest never before known; and more, I mistake greatly if those of older years are not among the most interested readers of this department."
