The "American party," as it has just christened itself, has assembled fifty delegates, representing nine States and one territory, in convention at St. Louis, and has permanently organized for open political work. Of course its declaration of faith embodies a strong attack on the Democratic and Republican parties, both of which are denounced as "false to the doctrines and principles of equality and a standing menace to popular government." Language of this sort is usually the accompaniment of the birth of a new political organization. Such a body must give some raison d'etre. If the political future of the United States be safe in the hands of either of the two great parties who now contend for its mastery, the newcomer is an intruder, unnecessary and undesirable.
