As we go to press the newspapers are full of the account of the shooting down of nearly one hundred unarmed Hungarian miners at Hazleton, Pa., by Sheriff Martin and thirty-eight deputies. It seems that the miners were marching along the highway from one mine to another when they were intercepted by the sheriff, who ordered the company to disperse, and upon refusing to do so, and showing signs of ignoring his word, orders were given to fire, which was done with the above results. It is reported that all but five of the dead and wounded were shot in the back, which would indicate that much of the firing was done after they had started to flee away. The particulars are too meager to express an opinion as to the merits of the case.

We believe in upholding the majesty of righteous laws at any cost, but at the same time we are free to say that our sympathies are with the struggling miners who through the greed of soulless corporations are in many cases reduced to starvation's very door. It is occurrences like these, likely to happen any day, that are filling men's hearts with fear, for they can see in them the precursor of a coming storm the like of which the world has never known. It is but a fulfillment of the prophecy of James 5.
