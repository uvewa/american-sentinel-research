God is worthy of the grateful recognition of every intelligence in the universe. We believe, too, that there are proper lines on which we should seek to express and secure such recognition. But we do not believe that the formal recognition of God in civil and political compacts is the proper means for the expression of such recognition.

That is not the kind of recognition God asks. It is not the kind that will honor him. Nor is it the kind that will benefit the nation.

The recognition that God asks of men is personal faith in Him and obedience to His just requirements. To recognize God truly means to recognize the sacred rights He has conferred upon men. The only true governmental recognition of God that can be made is for the government to recognize the teachings of Christ regarding the total separation of Church and State, and to frame such laws as will safeguard the rights and liberties of all its citizens.
