Mr. A. to Mr. B.—How do you regard this subject of religious legislation, or Church and State?

Mr. B.—I have always been opposed to a union of Church and State in America.

Mr. A.—You do not, then, believe in Sunday laws?

Mr. B.—I certainly do. We must legislate for the masses, to secure the laborer against the mercenary employer. If we do not, the working class will have no Sabbath, and will be compelled to work seven days in the week.

Mr. A.—But suppose a firm has in its employ those who keep the seventh and those who observe the first day of the week as the Sabbath, which day shall be selected as the day for rest?

Mr. B.—We must legislate in favor of the greatest number.

Mr. A.—The majority might be those who observe the Sabbath of the fourth commandment.

Mr. B.—It does not make any difference which day we keep. If you count from Monday Sunday will be the seventh.

Mr. A.—Suppose a man has seven sons, and when he dies he makes his will to the effect that his first son shall have $500, and each of the first six sons are to have the same amount, but the seventh son shall have $1,000. Now do you think that the first son could contest the will in court, saying that he was the seventh? They would say, You are not the seventh, but the first-born. But he would say, "That depends on where you begin to count." Again, we read in the Word of God that Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of the second coming of Christ. Would it be possible to make Adam the seventh?

Mr. B.—We must have one day in common, when all can unite in worshiping God. The comfort and wish of the majority must be considered. If we allow each person to select his own day of rest, society would be broken up and there would be no order.

Mr. A.—Then if this nation should go through the experience that France did at one time, and the majority should decree that we should have no Sabbath, I suppose you would submit gracefully.

Mr. B.—We do not ask that those who keep the seventh day shall be compelled to work on that day, but that they shall not work on the first day.

Mr. A.—The poor man has a large family to provide for, and it takes all that he can earn during the six days to secure for them the necessities of life. He conscientiously believes that he should observe the seventh day as the Sabbath; but he must submit to the wish of the majority, and be robbed of one seventh of his income, notwithstanding he has the God-given right to work six days. Do you think that is just?

Mr. B.—This is a Christian nation, and I suppose he would have to abide by the will of the majority, or go where he could keep whatever day he chose.

Mr. A.—We speak of the Christian religion because it is the religion of Christ. But when the people desired to make him a temporal king, he declared plainly, "My kingdom is not of this world." His people are said to be pilgrims and strangers on the earth, chosen out of the world, and that they seek a country. If all were Christians it could only be a nation of Christians. The majority are not Christians. A large portion of those who profess to be Christians, are Catholics, and they tell you that this is a Catholic Christian nation. Of course, it would have to be decided who are Christians, and all who could not pass the examination would have to find some other place or suffer death. This is not at all imaginary. It has already been worked out. Christian, is Christ-like; but do statistics indicate that this is a Christ-like nation?

Mr. B.—If men will not do what is right of themselves they should be compelled by the law. Look at Great Britain. The union of Church and State has been a great blessing to that country, and has made it what it is.

Mr. A.—I suppose you are an American citizen, and as such you believe in the principles underlying the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States.

Mr. B.—Yes, sir.

Mr. A.—Do they not both say, that religion or the duty that we owe to our Creator, and the manner of discharging it, can be directed only by reason and conviction, not by force or violence, and therefore all men are equally entitled to the free exercise of religion, according to the dictates of conscience? George Washington said, "The Government of the United States is not in any sense founded on the Christian religion." And General Grant believed that Church and State should be kept forever separate.

Those who founded this nation came here to secure "a new order of things." The old order was a union of Church and State, which brought about the persecution from which they fled. Still they persecuted one another, and that spirit lingered until "the times of '76." Then the laws of this Republic were based upon principles which would, if faithfully followed, have made further persecution impossible. Prior to this the Baptists and the Quakers experienced the evil results of the unholy alliance of the religious with the civil power. Then how can you believe that the union of Church and State has been a great blessing to Great Britain?

Mr. B.—What is good in one country may not be good in another. The same principle holds good in regard to eating and drinking. What agrees with one may not agree with another at all. We are commanded to obey the powers that be.

Mr. A.—But the powers that be differ greatly in their requirements, and the laws of a country are continually changing. Therefore the logic of your argument leads you to the position that whatever is, is right. But you will not be ready to admit this. The Saviour made this point clear when he said, "Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's." There are certain duties that we owe to God alone. These are moral or religious duties. The duties we owe the civil government are purely civil. The moral law is the sum of all morality, and God alone can enforce it, for it takes cognizance of the thoughts and intents of the heart. The Inquisition was the logical result of man taking the place of God.

Mr. B.—Are we not told to submit to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake?

Mr. A.—Yes. But a little further on in the same chapter we read, "For this is thankworthy, if a man for conscience toward God endure grief, suffering wrongfully." And you will see that we could not endure anything wrongfully for conscience' sake if we submitted to every ordinance that man might consider it his duty to enforce. The experience of those who had Daniel put into the lions' den, and of those who caused the three faithful Hebrews to be cast into the heated furnace, ought to teach us the folly of trying to regulate religion by State law. Moreover, the angel that liberated the imprisoned disciples commanded them to go and do the very thing which the civil authorities had forbidden. To preach Christ a king was contrary to all Roman law, yet when they were again arrested Peter said, "We ought to obey God rather than men."
