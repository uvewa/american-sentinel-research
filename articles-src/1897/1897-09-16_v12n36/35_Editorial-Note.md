Every young attorney should shake off all awe of this human legislation and practice, and recognizing its manifold imperfections and flaws, should make it a part of his life work to reform it as much as he may. The opportunities to know where the evils lie, and to intelligently work for their mitigation, are given to lawyers as they are given to no other men in the land. It is unfortunate that those best qualified to help the progress of the race in this matter should be rather inclined to accept the situation as they find it, than to bestir themselves for the adoption of better things. The aim of the "commencement orator," it seems to me, should be to counteract this tendency as much as possible, and to set the young practitioners hot upon the trail of abuses, with a zealous ambition to reform them.
