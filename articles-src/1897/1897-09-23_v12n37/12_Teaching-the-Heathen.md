The civilized nations of the West are busily instructing the nations of the Orient, but not in the ways of righteousness and peace. Their teaching is almost wholly of that "art" which is the opposite of peace. Says an English journal:—

"The Great Powers are glad to send competent military and naval instructors to Asiatic lesser powers, to drill their men and teach them war. They compete with one another to get the orders for arms and war supplies. There are said to be about two hundred German instructors in China, working to get China into a "fit" condition. When the "Christian" West gets the heathen East well versed in the art of war, it is not difficult to see that both together will fill the earth with such war as never was.

"While thus the nations are fulfilling the numerous scriptures which speak of the state of unrest and strife which is to close the history of the earth, what is the religious world doing to fulfill those scriptures which show that, before the coming of the Lord, the gospel of his kingdom will be preached as a witness to all nations? There is something more important for all Christians than the questions of territorial extensions and political combinations which agitate men's minds. The gospel is for sinners, no matter where they are or who they are, and the order of the Lord to every believer is that his invitation shall be taken to them. Yet Europe alone spends a thousand times as much on war as all Christendom spends on missions."
