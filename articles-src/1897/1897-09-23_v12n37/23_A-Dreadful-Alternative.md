Speaking of the case of the young Cuban girl, Evangelina Cisneros, whose present circumstances and prospective fate have awakened the sympathies of Anglo-Saxons on both sides of the Atlantic, the *Primitive Catholic*, of September 15, says it is now suggested by the Spanish government that in lieu of the sentence of twenty years' imprisonment in an African penal settlement, she be sent to a convent. In the eyes of some people this would be regarded as at least a mitigation of sentence; but to us, it is about the most dreadful alternative that could be imagined. The young woman herself, of course, strenuously objects to such a disposition of her case.

In this connection it may be proper to mention that Mrs. Julia Ward Howe is reported to have written to the pope asking him to exercise his influence in securing justice for Miss Cisneros. "A single word from you," she is reported as saying to him, "will surely induce the Spanish government to abstain from this act of military vengeance, which would greatly discredit it in the eyes of the civilized world."

But the pope has given his blessing upon the Spanish arms in Cuba, and it is in vain to expect that he will pronounce a "single word" to the contrary.

One of the most curious mental phenomena of the times is the persistence of some good church people—men who essay to be ministers and teachers of divine truth—in calling the United States a Christian nation. Who would think of calling an individual a Christian who would spend more money many times over for strong drink, for tobacco, for firearms, for sports and amusements, for jewelry and for unnecessary display, than he would give to the cause of God! Yet this is precisely what is done by this "Christian" nation.
