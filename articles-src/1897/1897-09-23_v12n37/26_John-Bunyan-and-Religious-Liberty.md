There are few people who have not read "Pilgrim's Progress," by John Bunyan. He was a wonderful man in many respects, as those who have read the history of his life know. He was brought up to attend the National Church of England. When he grew to manhood he dissented and united with the Baptists, and became a popular lay preacher. During this time, a civil law was enacted demanding that all, without regard to distinction or religious conviction, should attend the National Church, and this he refused to do, but continued preaching, and for these two reasons was cast into Bedford jail, where he was kept for twelve years.

So good a man as he naturally had many friends who did all they could to liberate him, but as the law had to be obeyed(?), and as he would not comply with its conditions, nothing could be done for him. On one occasion, the justices sent their clerk to admonish him and demand his submission, when the following conversation took place:—

"Clerk.—I came to tell you that it is desired that you would submit yourself to the laws of the land, or during the next session it will go worse with you.

"Bunyan.—I desire to demean myself in the world both as becometh a man and a Christian.

"Clerk.—You must leave off those meetings you were wont to have, for the statute is directly against it.

"Bunyan.—The law by which I am in prison neither reaches me nor my meetings, being directed against those who meet for wicked and treasonable purposes.

"Clerk.—Are you willing to stand in the judgment of the church?

"Bunyan.—Yes, sir, to the approbation of the church of God; the church's judgment is best expressed in Scripture.

"Clerk.—You know that the Scripture saith, 'The powers that be are ordained of God.'

"Bunyan.—Yes; and that I am to submit to the king as supreme, and also to the governors as to them that are sent by him.

"Clerk.—Well, then, the king commands you that you have no private meetings, because it is against his law; and he is ordained of God, therefore you should not have any meetings.

"Bunyan.—Paul owned the powers that were in his day to be of God, and yet he was often in prison under them for all that. And also, though Jesus Christ told Pilate that he had no power against him but of God, yet he died under the same Pilate; and yet I hope you will not say that either Paul or Christ did deny magistracy, and so sinned against God, in slighting the ordinance. Sir, the law provides two ways of obeying; the one to do that which in my conscience I do believe that I am to do actively; and where I cannot obey actively, then I am willing to lie down and suffer what they may do to me."

—Life and Times of John Bunyan.

These answers challenge the admiration of every lover of principle. His last reply contains the whole secret of the course to be pursued by Christians in their relation to civil laws. He says, "The law provides two ways of obeying: the one to do that which in my conscience I do believe that I am to do actively; and where I cannot obey actively; then I am willing to lie down and suffer what they may do to me."
