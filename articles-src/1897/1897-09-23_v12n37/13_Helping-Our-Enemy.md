REVENGE is a poor investment. The best way to "get satisfaction" out of one who has injured us is to help him to be a less injurious sort of person. We cannot do this by scowling at him, turning our backs upon him, or retaliating against him. If he is affected with moral poverty, we must enrich him. If he is a small pattern of a man, we may help him to grow by setting before him a pattern of largeness. But our contempt is not likely to enrich him, nor to cause him to wax larger and nobler. The very best thing that we can do to our enemy is to afford him all the moral help in our power. To make him better is to better all who have anything to do with him.
