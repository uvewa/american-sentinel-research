We have before called attention to the frequent failure of subscribers when requesting a change of address, to give their present post office address. Quite often, too, the parties forget to sign their names. This is called out by two communications, one from H. C. Jones, who requests the SENTINEL changed from his address to another party, in Oklahoma, but fails to tell where the paper is now going. Not knowing the present post office address, it is like "looking for a needle in a haystack" to find it. He should let us know where he now resides. Another from Hudson (State not given) writes: "Inclosed please find $1 for your valuable paper. I can't afford to be without it longer. John Brown." Now, there are twenty-six Hudsons in the United States, and we presume that in each place there is a John Brown, but which one of these paid his dollar it would be hard to determine at this end of the line. A word of caution is perhaps all that is necessary.

Mr. Sumner T. Merrill, of Melrose, Minnesota, a warm friend of the SENTINEL, writes: "I like the Religious Liberty for Young People department in the SENTINEL very much. I am glad to learn that the SENTINEL list increased so materially. I am sorry, however, that it wasn't a hundred times as large. The person who does not read the AMERICAN SENTINEL suffers a loss which cannot be filled with another paper that I know of."

Among the interesting publications that come to our desk, we may mention the Sunday School Times, published weekly at Philadelphia, Pa., price $1.50 per year. Each issue is filled with the brightest thoughts and most practical suggestions from the most successful Sunday-school workers in the land. No one interested directly or indirectly in Sabbath-school work, and especially officers of an organized school, can well afford to be without this journal. Many single issues are worth more than the price of the paper for a year. Write for sample copies, which will be sent free for examination, mentioning the SENTINEL.
