The attention of all eyes in the political circles of the nation is being drawn to the contest now being waged over the possession of the mayorship of "Greater New York." It is a contest which throws some light upon the question of the adaptability of politics for the promotion of the cause of righteousness in the earth.

***

The striking feature of the contest, thus far, is the struggle between "machine" politics and independent politics for supremacy in the Republican party. On the one side is the independent nominee, the Hon. Seth Low, well known as President of Columbia College; and on the other side is "boss Platt" with the State "machine," determined to nominate, and, if possible, elect a candidate who will represent the Republican "organization." And the "boss," it is said, has applied for and secured the influence and authority of the national administration to aid him in the work of subordinating all other interests to that of the success of the "party."

***

Independent politics is the theory upon which political procedure in this country was started out. But it is little more than a theory to-day. "Machine" politics, the politics of the "boss" and the dictator, is the almost universal reality. A person who will not be true to the "organization"—national, State, or local, as the case may be—soon meets the denunciation and opposition that is always accorded to a "traitor." And as in the present instance, his greatest costest is not with the opposite party, but with his own party "organization."

***

It is the dream of those who are looking for moral reform through politics, that some plan of action can and will be devised which, "wisely and vigorously carried on," "will gradually but surely substitute leaders for 'bosses,' statesmen for politicians, and patriots for plunderers." This quotation is from a speech made at the late San Francisco convention of Christian Endeavor. Another speaker said: "We will stand for political intelligence, integrity, independence and industry; and we are rapidly reaching the conclusion that Democracy should stand for decency, Republicanism for respectability, and Populism for purity; or else we must obey the divine injunction by coming out from among them. In plain English, after we have done our best, if we cannot clean our parties out, then we should resolutely undertake to clean them up."

***

That is the trouble with politics to-day; they are sadly in need of "cleaning up." As one speaker at the late Epworth League convention in Toronto portrayed it,—"Why is it that in the northern half of the continent politics is looked upon as unclean and contaminating? The heart of the body politic is shut out from heeding the words of Christ by an accursed partisanship. The Ministerial newspapers would have them believe the Opposition were all knaves and asses, while the Opposition papers would have them believe that the government was hopelessly corrupt." Or as another speaker said: "Politically we have fallen upon evil times. We have fallen upon times when, in certain sections, the ballot-box is corrupted, men are bought like chattels, or coerced into casting their votes for private gain rather than for the public good. . . . There are two distinctive elements at work in the contest for political supremacy. The first represents wealth and corporate power that rushes on with the force of a tornado, yet lacking in the purifying effect of the storm. The other is composed of men of small capacity and less personal character and integrity. Small men are in the saddle riding roughshod over the morals, the intelligence and the integrity of our national life."

***

All this is true enough, and "the half has not been told;" but why is it so? Is it because the right political plan has not been followed? Can it be remedied by a revolution in political procedure? That is the remedy upon which our would-be reformers are confidently depending; that is the remedy which they are determined to adopt.

***

But the remedy will not fit the cause. The cause does not lie in any political defectiveness, but in the moral defectiveness of the people. Get the hearts of the people right, purify them of their corruption, and politics will straighten out of itself. But the reformers are going to reform politics, in order to straighten out the people. It is the old mistake of putting the cart before the horse.

***

The much cherished remedy will not "work." When corruption is in the heart, it must show itself; for "out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh." When men of corrupt hearts engage in politics, there will be corrupt politics. Either they must be shut out of politics, or there will continue to be the same corruption that is so much in evidence to-day.

***

But men of corrupt morals—men who will stand by the "machine" and the organization in opposition to any reform, either of their own free will or under the pressure of political influence—are in the majority; and they are largely in the majority, too. Do the minority count on devising a scheme or system that will "turn down" the large majority, and keep them down, so that we shall henceforth have pure politics? The idea is Utopian, truly.

* * *

The real remedy, if one there be, must be that which will make good men out of the bad men that are in politics; and there is but one known cure for a bad heart; namely, regeneration, through the grace of God. The more this is preached and accepted, the less corruption there will be, in politics or any other sphere of human action. But when the nation undertakes to cast out corruption by vote,—to vote itself into purity and goodness—it will but display the wisdom of the small boy who tries to lift himself by the straps of his boots.

The progress of lynch law in this country was startlingly illustrated the other day by the administration of mob vengeance upon five men in the very respectable State of Indiana. Usually the victims of Judge Lynch have been negroes guilty—or supposed to be guilty—of some revolting crime. In this case the victims were white men, charged with no worse crime than theft.

* * *

At this rate of progress how long will it be before lynch law will come to be regarded as the proper method of dealing with almost all classes of criminals, wherever the circumstances afford an opportunity for putting it into execution. As a cheap and expeditious way of getting rid of persons who have made themselves obnoxious to a community, it seems to be a success; besides which, it apparently satisfies the feelings of the people much more than the administration of justice through the regular course of the law. And these features of the case are all, seemingly, that the people care to take into consideration.

* * *

It is no less true, however, that the progress of lynch law is the progress of anarchy. If we would note whether or not anarchy is making progress in this country, we should look, not at the number and luridness of the speeches of Herr Most and his associates, but at the lynchings and the crimes which call them forth.

* * *

It may be well to inquire, What is anarchy? The word means, the setting aside of the head, or ruler; hence the disregard of all law and authority. And where is this exemplified more fully or in greater degree than in the setting aside of the laws and authority of Jehovah?

* * *

"The Lord hath prepared his throne in the heaven, and his kingdom ruleth over all." His law is the highest law in the universe. The transgression of that law is sin. Sin and anarchy are really synonymous terms. The progress of wickedness in the earth is the progress of anarchy. When men disregard the law of God, it is certain that they will have no great scruples about setting aside the law of man.

* * *

The Spirit of God is in the earth, restraining men from wickedness and seeking to draw them back to God. By persistence in sin, however, men drive away this Spirit, and as it is withdrawn from them, there is a loosening of every bond which restrains them from utter lawlessness. Because of the fearful wickedness of these last days, God is withdrawing his Spirit from the earth, and the result is seen in the increasing riot of human passion in every form. One evidence of this appears in the commission of revolting crimes, and another in the lynchings which so commonly follow. They are both symptoms of the same malady, for which the grace of God is the only cure.
