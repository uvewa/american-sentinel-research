"MAMA, how far off is it to where the sky touches the earth?"

Mrs. Moore smiled at the serious face upturned to hers, in anticipation of a serious reply to such a question. "It's a long way, Willie," she said, "a long way."

"Is it further than I could walk in a whole day, mama?" asked Willie.

"Yes," said Mrs. Moore, "further than you could ever walk in all your life."

"Why, mama," he exclaimed in surprise, "I didn't think it was so far away as that. It doesn't seem to be so very far."

"No, it doesn't seem very far, Willie, but we can't always tell about things from the way they seem. When folks only look at appearances, they often make great mistakes. But there are a great many people older than you who think they can reach the sky without going very far."

"Tell me about it, mama," said Willie; "I don't understand."

"Well," said mama, "what would you do, Willie, if the sky and earth really met a little ways off, where they appear to meet?"

"Why—I would go there and climb up from the earth and go up into the sky, where everything is nice and beautiful, I guess," Willie answered, after a moment's pause.

"Well," said Mrs. Moore, "that is just what many people are trying to do. They think that by a little effort they can get to a place where the earth touches heaven, and then everything will be just right, as it ought to be. It seems so easy to them that sometimes they wonder why they haven't got there before."

"Do you mean, mama, that people go on a journey? or how do they try to get to where the earth and sky come together?" queried Willie.

"No; not a journey, Willie," said Mrs. Moore; "what I mean is that they think they can take themselves to the sky by their own efforts, just as you thought you could walk to it, and it seems to them to be quite an easy thing to do."

"But what kind of efforts, mama, if they don't go on any journey?" said Willie.

"Well, you know, Willie, there were once some people who thought they could get to the sky by building a tower; so they set out to build one that would reach to it from the earth. Do you remember reading about that in the Bible?"

"Yes; I remember," said Willie. "They built it up quite high, but they didn't finish it, and it never amounted to anything, I guess. I wonder how near they got to the sky before they stopped, mama."

"They got just as near as people do nowadays who don't try it in the right way," said Mrs. Moore. "There are other towers of Babel besides the one built in the plains of Shinar. People are building them to day."

"Where are they, mama? I never saw any."

"They are not made of brick and stone, but it doesn't matter what they are made of, so long as they represent some plan of men to get to the sky by their own works."

"But what makes them do it, mama? Don't they know that they can't get to the sky that way?"

"They ought to know; but they don't stop to seriously think of the matter and find out just what the Lord says about it."

"But who are some of these people, mama?"

"Some of them are people who are trying to get to the sky by means of politics," was the reply.

"Ho, ho, how funny!" laughed Willie.

"Yes, it is funny, only it's very serious, too," said Mrs. Moore, "for they are making a dreadful mistake; and there are a great many engaged in it, too; and if they don't find out their mistake, they'll come to ruin in the end."

"What are they doing now, mama?"

"Well, they hold a great many meetings and tell the people that if they will only vote in the right way and elect the right men to public office and make the right kind of laws, it will bring in the millennium and set up the kingdom of God. They are really building a political tower of babel."

"Can people make themselves better, or make other folks better, by voting and passing laws, mama?" queried Willie.

"That's just the point, Willie," said Mrs. Moore; "it can't be done that way. People can't raise themselves one inch above the level of the earth in that way. The trouble is that people are fallen and have wicked hearts, and they can't vote or legislate themselves into a better condition. They can't lift themselves out of themselves."

"What do you mean by that, mama?"

"Did you ever try to lift yourself by the straps of your boots, Willie? That is just the way it is when people try to lift themselves up toward God by their own works. They never succeed, and yet they think they are going to succeed pretty soon. They can see success a little way in the future, just where the sky touches the earth, and they think it will not take them very long to get there, if they can only go ahead as they want to. And so they go on, and on, but they find they never get any nearer the sky than they were before. They don't make any real progress toward setting up the kingdom of God.

"Now, Willie," Mrs. Moore continued, "can you tell me what God's plan is for taking people to the sky?"

Willie wrinkled his brow, but made no answer.

"Think hard now," said Mrs. Moore, "and see if you can't tell me something about it. In the same book of the Bible that tells of the tower of Babel, it tells of something else that did really reach from the earth to the sky. Don't you remember I read to you about it the other evening?"

Willie's face brightened as Mrs. Moore finished speaking. "Jacob's ladder!" he exclaimed.

"Yes, that is it," said Mrs. Moore; and now can you tell me, Willie, what that ladder represents?"

"What does it represent, mama?" he queried, after a moment's pause.

"It represents our Saviour, Jesus Christ, Willie; and it's the only possible connection between the earth and heaven. Jacob's ladder and the tower of Babel represent the two ways,—one God's way and the other man's way—of getting to the sky. Some people are trying to climb up by their good works, and others by penance and suffering; and others are planning to vote and legislate themselves into the skies; but the only way that anybody will ever get there is by Jacob's ladder. But I must go now and look after the dinner. I'll tell you more about this another time."
