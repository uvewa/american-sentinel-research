One of the very first and often the hardest lesson for young people just entering the busy scenes of active life to learn is that life is not what they had pictured it to be; they awake to find that the dream is only a dream; they discover that their pathway is beset with difficulties almost insurmountable, perplexities endless and disappointments without number; their brightest hopes are dashed to the ground; heartstrings are bleeding and torn, and tears unbidden flow freely. Their loftiest aspirations, holiest ambitions and purest desires meet with rebuff when an attempt is made to carry them out, and they are led to reflect, "What is there of life that is worth living?"

But after all, life is much as we make it. Every man and every woman has a mission to perform that no other individual can accomplish for them. It is to develop a character and in this work they are not left in the dark. There is a perfect Pattern for our example—a rule of action to govern all our conduct. All the tendency of life as we mingle with the world is to deviate from this standard, and right here comes in the value of principle—doing right because it is right, no matter what the consequences may be. So many nowadays are policy people,—let others be their conscience, and are thus led from the path of rectitude. Daniel was a man of principle. With him duty stood above position and even life itself.

In these days, as never before, our young just entering on the stage of action should study to know the right, and then fearlessly follow it, though the heavens fall. This cannot be done in the strength of man alone, but He who conquered all has said. "I will strengthen thee with all might." Will we let him? W. E. C.
