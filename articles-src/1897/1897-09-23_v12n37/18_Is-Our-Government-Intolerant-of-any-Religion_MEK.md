The Christian Citizen quotes from Daniel Agnew, LL.D., ex-chief justice of Pennsylvania, the following statement:

"I have shown that this is a Christian nation—that this continent and the provinces were settled by a Christian people—that the States formed from them continued Christian, and set the legal evidence of their belief in their early constitutions—that other religions are exceptional, and were tolerated for individual conscience' sake only—that the Constitution of the United States formed by the same people, contemporary with their State constitutions, and with identical provisions for the toleration of individual freedom of conscience, expressly reserved to them all their ungranted rights, among which are their Christian institutions—that the Constitution itself carries internal evidence of its Christian character, that its continued existence rests on the fabric of the States; and that infidels, pagans, cavilers and Mormons derive from it no support in their warfare against Christianity. I have shown, also, that the safety of this Christian character, peace, order and prosperity demand its citizenship to be protected against promiscuous and loose naturalization."

Of Dr. Agnew the Citizen says: "The opinions of such a man cannot fail to be of great importance to all thinking people. Recently he delivered an address, which has been published, the purpose of which is to establish the Christianity of the Constitution of the United States."

But if the nation is so overwhelmingly Christian, as Dr. Agnew holds, and "the Constitution itself carries internal evidences of its Christian character," what is the need of any further tinkering of the Constitution? If the inside of the Constitution is right, the outside surely ought to be, especially when the nation is Christian anyway!

To the statement of the venerable doctor, that other religions than Christianity are only tolerated in this country, we strongly demur. An Austrian, a Spaniard, or a Russian may properly use the term as expressive of the attitude of those governments toward a Jew, a Mohammedan or an infidel; but an American, never! According to the letter and spirit of the national Constitution and the genius of the American Government, the Christian no more tolerates the Jew than the Jew tolerates him. If one holds another view it is because he has grown up cherishing a false and alien idea of the principles of the United States Government.

It is true that some of the early State constitutions, following in the line of the colonial charters, which were granted in the days when the Church and State were firmly united, did establish religions which were not annulled by the United States Constitution, but an example of liberty was set in that great charter, and those States which had a religion incorporated in their constitutions have either abolished the religious parts of their constitutions or these have become atrophied by long disuse.

But a determined effort is being made to animate those dead constitutional provisions, to change the great Constitution which towers above them all and to make it an engine of tyranny. Religious despotism is embedded and ingrained in the hearts of men or else it could never continuously rise, as it does, to blast and curse the earth. It is as much out of place in our land as a snake in a fair garden, but it is here, and unless it is crushed out it will spoil our fair inheritance.
