THE *Christian Statesman*, well known as the organ of the National Reform party, has been suspended as a weekly paper, and its editor, Dr. David McAllister, removed from editorial charge of the same, by the action of the Reformed Presbyterian Synod, in session at Beaver Falls, Pa., June 2. This action was taken, we learn, because of heretical articles which the editor has been for some time publishing on the subject of church unity. The editor complains of this as being a blow against "the soul of editorial liberty."

From the standpoint of an impartial observer, no one can be surprised that the intolerant spirit which the Reformed Presbyterian church embodies, and which the National Reform movement has so plainly shown, should have made itself felt internally, upon members of that body, as well as upon those without. That it should have found a victim in the person of its foremost advocate and exponent, may be regarded as an illustration of the irony of fate. We do not see that Dr. McAllister has any reason to complain.

The *Statesman* will be continued as a monthly journal, and will continue to be the organ of the National Reform Association. As a religious journal, however, its mission is accomplished. It has communicated the virus of National Reform doctrine to the more numerous and powerful branches of the Protestant church, and whether it is now continued or expended will matter nothing as regards the realization of its long-advocated project of union of Church and State in the United States.
