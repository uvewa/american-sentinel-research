THE Catholic Review closes a discussion of the West Point Catholic chapel incident with the words, "No favoritism for Protestantism! No union of Church and State! No Government religion!"

So slfouts this spokesman of the papacy in a country where Protestants are strongly in the majority. But no such sentiments ever emanate from the hierarchy in Spain and the Catholic countries of South America. Yet the Review ought to know that a union of Church and State, in whatever country, is an indorsement of papal principles and a step which must contribute to the exaltation of the papal church.
