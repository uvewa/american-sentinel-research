The Christian Endeavor Societies of the Methodist Protestant Church, of Michigan, held their sixth annual convention June 11, at Adrian, in that State. It was considered to be the largest and most successful convention of the kind ever held in Michigan by the M. P. Church.

As might be expected, the discussion of the sabbath (Sunday) and of sabbath laws was one of the most important features of the meeting. The views of the society upon Sunday laws are at least free from ambiguity, judging from the following, taken from the Detroit Tribune, of June 12:

"The Sabbath, How Lost, How Restored," formed the subject of an interesting talk by Rev. F. W. McCauley, of Toledo, Ohio. The speaker traced the manner in which various nations had lost their regard for the Sabbath and asserted the United States had lost it by patterning after Europe and introducing ideas that were entirely foreign. The United States compels foreigners to become naturalized before enjoying the privileges of citizenship; so also should the religious ideas introduced be subjected to the same treatment.

"If we have a country worth emigrating to and institutions worth supporting," he said, "we should also support the religion of our land instead of following after foreign ideas. Another cause of this danger is in the lack of spirituality in the Christian churches. If a church lacks this it tends to destroy the Sabbath."

"Sunday papers, excursions, saloons, etc., also came in for a share of the gentleman's attention."

Notice that this minister, who apparently voices the sentiment of his church and this society made up from its younger members, would treat religious ideas just the same as any other foreign thing. Foreign religions cannot be allowed to come here unless those religions become naturalized! He won't even let a foreign religion come here on a tariff; it must be entirely reconstructed and made over according to an American model!

In what words could anyone deny the very foundation principles of the United States Constitution and of the United States Government more clearly and surely than this reverend gentleman has done? He says, in effect, "We have a national religion; if any one wants to come here and will by choice or by constraint, if need be, accept our national religion, all right. He is welcome. If he will not do so, then let him keep away!"

This is the very argument used by the Catholic priesthood of Spain and the South American States against Protestants who presume to go to those countries and teach and practice a religion not sanctioned by their church. For the past few years the people of this country, and the Christian Endeavorers among the rest, have been highly incensed against the Czar of Russia and the Sultan of Turkey because missionaries from this country are not well received and allowed to preach and practice their religions there. But it must be apparent to every candid person that these Christian Endeavorers propose doing here precisely the same that those monarchs are doing in their domains.

How would a Christian minister in Turkey like being compelled to keep the fast of Ramadan as a condition of his stay in that country? Turkish officials could make it appear that the observance of this fast is a civil affair just as easily as the officials here can that a Sunday law is a civil law!

At the same convention, an evangelist who was present made the following very truthful and impressive remarks:

"There never was a time when the Church needed the simple faith of the original church as much as at present. The greatest danger to the church is the so-called advancement that has been made in the past few years. It is absolutely necessary that we be imbued with power from on high if we are to accomplish anything as a church or as individuals. The church, in a large measure, has lost its hold on the masses. The reason for this lies in the fact that the church has lost its hold on God. We must come back to God and then we will be able to regain our hold on the people. We can introduce all the ideas we please, but our religion will not be what God wants it to be. As Christian Endeavorers we should develop not only in numbers, but also in power."

The "original church" did not concern herself about forbidding people ingress into a country because they did not exactly agree with her teaching. The apostles themselves often were accused of introducing customs contrary to those of the countries where they went. Their business was to preach Christ; they believed in the power of Christ, not in the power of human law. If human laws could make men good the world would have been a heaven long ago. But it is not so and will not be until, at the coming of Christ, the wheat and the tares, which here grow in close connection, are separated,—the wheat to be taken to God's great garner, the tares to be destroyed with fire unquenchable.

When ministers of the gospel invoke the power of human law, and try to advance Christ's gospel by the assistance of worldly power, they drag the gospel down to the low level of politics, make it sectional and national, needlessly embitter unbelievers against Christ, whose gospel they misrepresent, and cause the eternal ruin of many souls.

To mingle the gospel of the blessed Christ with human law in order to render it more effective is a most shameful and hazardous proceeding. It may gather members into the church, but not into the kingdom of God. When resisted, it makes martyrs to liberty, and sometimes martyrs to Christ; if accepted, it makes hypocrites, fawning sycophants, who will accept and advocate anything by which their own material prospects are advanced.

When the church heeds the advice of the evangelist as quoted above and comes to back to God," it will find something so much better than human law that it will materially change its plan for the salvation of souls and the promotion of the welfare of the nation.
