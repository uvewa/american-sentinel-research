The steamships *Hecla* and *Mississippi* were recently in collision on a fog-swept portion of the high seas. An eye-witness of the disaster relates that as the *Hecla* was bearing down on the *Mississippi*, he saw a man run forward to the *Hecla*'s prow, and picking up a stick, hold it out to fend off the collision. A fit illustration this of the power of man's puny arm to control the forces of righteousness and evil which are ever in collision upon this earth. Only the arm of God can turn from their course the evil forces whose onslaughts upon society men are now trying to fend off by legislation.
