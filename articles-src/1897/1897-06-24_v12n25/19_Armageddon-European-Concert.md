In a recent number of Blackwood's Magazine (London) a writer says: "To avert the battle of Armageddon is the aim of the European Concert, and we hardly know what else can avert it."

But faith in the ability of the European Concert to accomplish what it aims at should have been materially lessened in thinking minds by the rehabilitation of Turkey as a military power. For years the European Concert has been aiming at the dismemberment of the Sultan's kingdom, and the exact opposite of this seems to be the only thing they have accomplished.

The great battle of Armageddon will surely come; for no human power can avert it. See Rev. 16:14–16. But every individual who now chooses to become a child of God can stand in that day under the protection of the Almighty.
