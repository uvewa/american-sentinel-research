RECENTLY, in an allusion to Queen Victoria's long reign, Dr. Joseph Parker, the well-known London clergyman, said: "We owe much to the queen, but the queen owes much more to us. Let her close her splendid reign by restoring to God the titles 'Head of the Church' and 'Defender of the Faith.'" These words elicited cheers from his audience. But the truth is that the queen has nothing of this kind to restore to God. The title "Head of the Church" is one which Henry VIII. assumed in deference to his own pride when he quarreled with and separated from the pope; and that of "Defender of the Faith" was bestowed on him by the pope before this separation as a compliment to the monarch for having written a book against the reformer, Martin Luther.

The only thing any person can give or restore to the Lord, is himself.
