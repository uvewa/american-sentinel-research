The following "Petition from Shopkeepers," which was printed in a recent issue of the Sydney (Aus.) Daily Telegraph, shows the progress of the Sunday-closing movement in that part of the eastern hemisphere:

"SUNDAY CLOSING OF SHOPS."

"PETITION FROM SHOPKEEPERS."

"ACTION BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CHURCHES."

"'Thou shalt not sell on Sunday,' is as much a commandment, from the standpoint of the Council of the Churches, as 'Thou shalt not steal.' At yesterday's meeting of the Council a petition was laid on the table, signed by 961 shopkeepers in the city and suburbs, asking the government to enforce the law relating to Sunday closing. The movement was initiated by the Council, but the work of getting signatures to the petition has been done by the city missionaries and a number of Christian Endeavors."

Upon the significance of this action, in connection with the attitude of the churches towards the question of giving a religious character to the new Federal Constitution, a writer in the Southern Sentinel and Herald of Liberty (Melbourne) says:

"'The movement was initiated by the Council' of the Churches, this says. That is correct. Every movement for uniting Church and State and enforcing religious dogmas and customs by law has always been initiated by the churches.

"And what is this movement for? What was the end in view in the circulation of this petition?—To ask the government 'to enforce the law relating to Sunday closing.' There you have it in plain words. And who, with this fresh action standing so plainly before him, can doubt why the Council of the Churches desires to have God recognized in the constitution for Federated Australia, or why Cardinal Moran wished that document to be put on a religious basis? Who cannot see that immediately that were done these churches represented would demand religious laws, and then insist on the government enforcing them? That the churches in this movement to put 'God' and 'religion' in the constitution desire to get control of the government for the enforcement of religion, and especially Sunday observance, by law, must be as plain as plain can be to anyone who will take a moment's time to look at the facts."
