In an address at the recent opening of the Naval War College at Newport, Assistant Secretary of the Navy Roosevelt said: "It is idle to talk of such a nation [as the United States] ever being led into a course of wanton aggression or conflict with military powers by the possession of a sufficient navy. The danger is of precisely the opposite character. If we forget that in the last resort we can only secure peace by being ready and willing to fight for it, we may some day have bitter cause to realize that a rich nation which is slothful, timid or unwieldy is an easy prey for any people which still retains those most valuable of all qualities, the soldierly virtues."

The "soldierly virtues" are the fighting ability and instinct; and these the nation must retain or become a prey to other nations that have not ceased to cultivate them. We must, like the nations of the Old World, maintain peace by being ready to fight for it. So we are told. This is the world's way of keeping the peace, but it is not the Christian way. The language of this official of the Government does not confirm the dictum of the Supreme Court, that "this is a Christian nation."
