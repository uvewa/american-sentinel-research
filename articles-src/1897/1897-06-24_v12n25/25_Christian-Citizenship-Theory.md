THE theory upon which rests the gigantic religio-political movement which has made all the world familiar with the terms "Christian Endeavor" and "Christian citizenship," speaks on this wise:—

"In her possibilities of happiness and glory under the influence of Christ, America is but a child. What she may become at maturity when a thousand millions of happy and prosperous people shall throng her cities and broad fields, when the church of five hundred millions of members holds all her affairs vigilantly, wisely, and successfully in hand by legitimate agitation and influence, when all shall be progress and little or no poverty, when the weak shall be brothered by the strong, and the darkest places of the earth enlightened by colonies of enterprising Americans, who has ever dreamed?

"Consecrated patriotism will bring it about, and ought to begin at once with far-reaching plans."

So writes, in the last issue of the *Christian Statesman*, the Rev. Charles Roads, who conducts a Christian Endeavor department in that journal. But this pleasing picture is altogether an illusion,—the theory which calls for "consecrated patriotism" is altogether wrong, because it is altogether contrary to Scripture. "Be sure you right," runs the familiar motto, "and then go ahead." The more far-reaching plains are laid, when the direction taken is the wrong one, the worse it will be in the end.
