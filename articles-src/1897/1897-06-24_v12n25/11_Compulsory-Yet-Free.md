In an article treating on "The First Day of the Week," by Chas. Cuthbert Hall, printed in The Congregationalist and copied in organ of the "New England Sabbath Protective League," we find the following:

"As the day has become one of universal observance in many nations as a rest day, wherein large numbers of people are released from business, it has, of course, been necessary to have the civil government make suitable laws, which we must all obey, for maintaining the order and peace of society; but every Christian should joyfully remember that this institution of the Lord's day sprang out of love, not out of law. It is not a grievous commandment; it is a joyous consecration. It is not compulsory; it is voluntary, and as such we believe it is especially dear to Christ."

But if we "must obey" these "suitable laws" of civil government commanding the observance of the day, of what avail is it to us that in the divine economy the observance was not made compulsory, but voluntary? If we are compelled to observe it, what becomes of the liberty which we were granted in the matter by the Lord?

If the Lord made Sabbath observance free, will He uphold a law making it compulsory? Must He not be against any such law?
