A LEAFLET has been sent us setting forth the following principles as being the foundation of an organization which takes the name of "The United Sentinels of America", with headquarters in Washington, D. C.:—

"1. We declare against any union of Church and State.

"2. We declare against any division of the public school fund.

"3. We declare against any State, municipal or national appropriation of the public moneys for any ecclesiastical institution or school.

"4. We declare war of extermination against the saloon, allowing each man to oppose it in his own way; but we do not obligate any one to any political party. No saloon-keeper can be a member.

"5. We declare against all persons for public office who owe any supreme allegiance to any foreign ruler, secular or spiritual.

"6. We declare in favor of governmental protection and fostering care of the public schools and other institutions of learning.

"7. We declare in favor of more restricted immigration and naturalization laws.

"8. We declare in favor of protection and purity of the ballot box.

"9. We declare in favor of an equal governmental taxation of all property.

"10. We declare in favor of legal public inspection of all public or private institutions, to determine whether any persons are held in duress for penance and punishment under color of law.

"11. We hold and declare that the laws of the government are supreme in all temporal matters.

"12. We hold and declare that the Holy Bible is the fountain source of supreme law of Christian nations, and that all our principles shall be in accord with it."

In regard to these principles, it need simply be said that the last one of them totally contradicts the first: They "declare against any union of Church and State;" but believe in a "Christian nation" which cannot possibly avoid the embodiment of such a union. For that which is "Christian" embraces all that pertains to the Church; and as a nation must embody the State, a "Christian nation" can be nothing else than the embodiment of a combined Church and State.

The "United Sentinels of America" constitute a political party which proposes that all its principles shall be in accord with the Holy Bible. There is only one sense in which it could be true that the principles of a political party were in accord with the Bible, and that would mean that they express antagonism to any union of religion with the civil power; for the total separation of the religious and civil powers is scriptural. But the principles of civil government can touch the doctrines of the Bible only at this one point; anything more than this must savor of a union of Church and State.
