In setting forth the principles that would guide him if he were sent to the Federal Convention, Cardinal Moran said that he would wish to have the preamble to the Federal Constitution declare that:—

"Religion is the basis of our Australian Commonwealth, and of its laws."

In other words, and in plain English, Cardinal Moran would work in the convention to secure the union of Church and State in Australia.

That this is the meaning of his words can easily be shown.

He would make religion the basis of the government. The basis of a thing is its foundation, that on which the thing rests. The connection between the basis of a thing and the thing itself is inseparable.

Therefore, if religion be made the basis of our government, religion and the government will be united. The government will be a religious government, because it is founded on religion. That will be a union of religion and the State.

But a union of religion and the State means a union of Church and State. For religion implies a church. It is the basis of the church. They are inseparably connected. The one great object of the church is the promotion of religion. Where one is found there will the other be found also.

It is perfectly plain, therefore, that to make religion the basis of government is to unite Church and State.

To unite Church and State in every land has been the resolute policy of the church of Rome during its whole history. And to effect this union in Australia is the object the cardinal would have in making the preamble to the constitution declare that religion is the basis of our government and of its laws.
