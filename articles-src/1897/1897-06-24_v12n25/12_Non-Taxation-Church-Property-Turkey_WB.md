In the Washington (D. C.) Post, of June 12, Mr. Wm. Birney, of that city, contributes the following relative to the Eastern Question as affected by the exemption of church property in Turkey from taxation:

"If all the real estate and personal property in Turkey bore in equal proportion the burden of supporting the government it might possibly suffice for a strictly economical administration, but about one half of it pays no tax. The mosques, their contents, and the lands of the mosques are regarded by the Moslems, who are the most religious of the human race, as the property of Allah. To tax it would be akin to sacrilege. The mosques are, many of them, costly edifices, with large grounds. Attached to each mosque is a school building, used for instruction by the clergy. The personal property, much of it silver and gold, in the mosques is valued in millions.

"Since early in the present century taxation has been so oppressive that in order to escape it many rich Musulman families have ceded their landed estates to the mosques, being permitted to continue occupancy of them for a time limited in the grant and often until the ceding families become extinct in the direct line. As soon as the deeds are made to the mosques the lands and property are exempt from taxes. These lands are known in Turkish law as 'vakufs,' and they alone are said to amount now to a third of the landed area of the Turkish empire.

"As these 'vakufs' are created they pass out of the taxable lists and the revenue of the government is diminished. The deficit must be made up by the owners of taxed lands and personality. Christians do not as a general rule deed their lands to the mosques, but there must be some of them who escape heavy taxation in that way. The present Sultan has more than once manifested in a timid way his desire to arrest the undue aggrandizement of the church property, particularly in Constantinople, but he met in every instance with such determined opposition by the clergy that he was compelled to abandon his designs.

"In addition to the claim that all church property belongs to Allah, it is urged by the clergy that they support the government by teaching the people morality and obedience to law and that the more mosques there are the more solid are the foundations of civil government. Meanwhile the creation of 'vakufs' is going on with accelerated rapidity and the taxable lists are becoming too small to yield a sufficient revenue.

"From the above statement it is clear that two measures are imperatively demanded to usher in an era of prosperity for Turkey: First, a judicious revenue tariff act imposing duties on foreign imports, and second, a law abolishing the exemption of mosque property from taxation, confiscating to the use of the State all mosque property, real and personal, except so much as the government may deem absolutely necessary for worship, and prohibiting all conveyances, by gift, will, or deed, by private owners of their landed estates to mosques.

"Who can put these measures into operation? The Sultan cannot. Can the powers do it?

"They might consent to a revenue tariff act, but they will not. The imports into Turkey from Great Britain, Austria, France, Russia, and Italy, amount in round numbers to $80,000,000. . . .

"Would any or all the powers undertake the measure against the mosques? Nay, verily. Behind the mosques stand not only the grades clothed with priestly functions, but dependents of many classes from those engaged in mosque service to common laborers, aggregating not less than one third of the whole population. The Turkish government is theocratic, the Sultan being the Caliph or spiritual head of the church. Any attempt to impose a tax on church property or confiscate any part of it, especially if made by Christian powers, would be regarded as sacrilege committed by the infidels and would be resisted by all good Mussulmans with the same reckless bravery the Jews displayed against Antiochus Epiphanes, when that monarch sacrificed a swine in the Holy of Holies at Jerusalem. The Jehad, a holy war, would be declared. When that flag should be unfurled at Mecca it would rally 150,000,000 Moslems, outside of European Turkey, to its support. England would have a more fearful insurrection on her hands in India than she has ever met. Is such a contingency to be lightly regarded?

"And yet, without the confiscation, total or partial, of the mosque property, no foreign power could raise a revenue from Turkey sufficient for the support of its government and the payment of the interest on its bonded debt. But as confiscation is practically impossible, no foreign power is willing to assume the administration of Turkish affairs."
