WHEN the Great Missionary left his disciples, he commissioned them to go "into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature." That was a gospel of religious liberty—not in its generally accepted sense, but liberty in Christ—freedom from sin. "The Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the broken hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound."

Never in the history of the world was there more need of this gospel being given in its simplicity than to-day. Hungry, burdened, discouraged sin-sick souls are appealing for help; and not alone from our own shores, but from across the ocean, from the darkness of heathendom and from the islands of the sea comes the Macedonian cry, "Come over and help us." These earnest pleas have touched the hearts of thousands of God-fearing, self-sacrificing men and women everywhere who have left their homes and taken their lives in their hands, as it were, to tell the people the good news of a Saviour who can save. The good they are accomplishing, the Judgment alone can reveal.

There are many whose hearts beat in union with this good work, to whom have been intrusted this world's goods, and who would gladly contribute of their means to carry it forward, did they but know where to send their contributions. To all such, and others as well, we take pleasure in calling attention to the announcement in another column of the Foreign Missionary Board of Seventh-day Adventists, located at Philadelphia, Pa. This is headquarters of an aggressive gospel work that is being carried forward in foreign fields, and with remarkable results. Voluntary contributions will be thankfully received, and a cordial invitation is extended to those who desire to make such offerings to send them to the Treasurer of the Board, W. H. Edwards. We can assure our readers that every dollar sent there will be conscientiously expended in this great labor of love.
