The Catholic Citizen, of Milwaukee, consoles itself over the decision of Attorney-General McKenna against a Catholic chapel at West Point, with the reflection that "the disposition to be punctilious in keeping Church and State absolutely separate is going to hurt our separate brethren [Protestants] quite as much as ourselves;" and adds, "Once clearly understood, the policy of separation of Church and State is a policy that we can accommodate ourselves to."

The papacy may accommodate its methods of work to that policy, but never its principles. A change of principles would obviate the necessity of any "accommodation" to the policy upheld in the Attorney-General's decision.
