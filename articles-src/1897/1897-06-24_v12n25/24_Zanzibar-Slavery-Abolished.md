By act of the Sultan of Zanzibar, the legal status of slavery in that island has been abolished. Of the effect of the decree of abolition the United States consul at Zanzibar says: "It was thought by many persons that the effect of freeing the slaves would be to throw many thousand negroes on their own resources, and that great suffering and privation would ensue for three or four years; but from what I can see not one person will suffer in the slightest degree. In my opinion not ten per cent. of the present generation of slaves will leave their masters, and, to outward appearances, the condition of the negro is the same as before emancipation. The Arabs received the news with submission. The town was absolutely quiet, although sailors and marines were prepared to land from the British men-of-war in the harbour. I do not think there is the slightest fear of future trouble."
