WHAT would seem to be one of the most puzzling questions developed within recent times, is that of the significance of the phrase "entering politics" or other equivalent expressions. During the Presidential campaign the preachers in hundreds of pulpits all over the land were preaching politics with all their power, yet we were assured that they had not gone into politics. A minister may exhort his congregation to a certain course of political action, even instructing them how to cast their vote, and yet keep, in his own view at least, outside of politics. The point was well illustrated by this statement made by Cardinal Moran, in accepting an invitation to be nominated as a member of the forthcoming Australian Convention:—

"It is not my intention on the present occasion, or at any future time, to enter the arena of politics."

Upon this an exchange remarks:—

"This is indeed a queer statement for a man to make who has just signified his intention of accepting a nomination to a political position if offered him. A man might as well talk of going to war and not entering the army, of going into a house and not entering it, or of baking and selling bread and not entering the bakers' trade, as to talk of standing for an election by the people to a position in civil government and not entering politics. To declare otherwise is to trifle with language and stultify reason. This statement, however, may serve to explain how some men can demand religious legislation and yet assert that Church and State are not thereby united; and how they can advocate religious intolerance and oppression and at the same time declare they are not in favor of religious persecution."
