Probably no great event of history ever had more causes assigned for it than the fall of the empire of Rome. The latest of these, and probably the most unique, is given in an article published in the New York Journal of March 28, in defense of Sunday, by the pastor of St. Luke's Episcopal church, Brooklyn. "When Cicero and Cataline and their compeers," he says, "came to distrust the general religious doctrines, Rome began to totter. A country run without God will sooner or later be run to destruction."

In other words, the "general religious doctrines," even be they such as prevailed in the empire of Rome, must be profoundly reverenced as the first essential toward the successful running of the country. It must not be run "without god," though the god recognized in its affairs may be the embodiment of no more truth, right, and justice than were the gods of Rome. By this doctrine Sunday observance is easily sustained as essential to the preservation of the Government; and it requires some such doctrine as this to afford Sunday the needed support.
