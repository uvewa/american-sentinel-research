PROF. HUXLEY, in his address at the opening of the Johns Hopkins University some years ago, paraphrased the language of one greater than himself when he observed, "It is undoubtedly true that man shall not live by bread alone, but by ideas." It is equally true that by ideas shall man also perish. The right idea—the words that proceeded out of the mouth of the Son of man—is the salvation of the race; the wrong idea, the disregard of Him and of His teachings, is our damnation here and hereafter. Now, words are nothing in themselves. Their only value is as a means of expressing and *implying* ideas, and if, through implication, the language used by an individual suggests a wrong idea to others, it is no reason for passing it without comment, that the person himself might hesitate to put the idea more explicitly.

* * *

HERE is Mr. McKinley, for instance, in his inaugural address, solemnly pledging himself to keep his "oath of office" in language which, by very strong implication, refers his official responsibility as President of the United States to Deity, instead of to the American people, who elected him to that exalted position. This is very objectionable. It is the old idea of "divine right." Kings and queens and emperors rule "by the grace of God," or, at any rate, claim that they do so in their public acts and on their coins. But the President of the United States rules by the grace of the people thereof. Mr. McKinley ought to know that his inaugural oath adds nothing whatever to the obligation which he owes to the citizens, which is that he shall faithfully execute the laws of their making. He ought to know that his punishment for malfeasance or misfeasance, if he should do anything to deserve it, will be meted out to him without the slightest reference to the question of whether or not such an oath was taken by him. He ought to know that the pledge of his address should be addressed to the people who made the President, and not to Deity, who made the man. But never was a greater blunder made than that of the poet when he said:—

> "Truth crushed to earth shall rise again.
> The eternal years of God are here;
> But error, wounded, writhes in pain.
> And dies amidst her worshipers."

In good growth, the vitality of error, its ability to stand what are apparently deadly wounds over and over again, is one of its most remarkable and discouraging characteristics. That old love of the union of Church and State, that old notion of something sacred about government—as purely a human institution or machine as a locomotive—repudiated and denounced by the Master nearly two thousand years ago, still lurks in men's minds, and ever and anon it finds vent in action or utterance. Mr. McKinley talks of himself as if he were a specially appointed agent of the Creator, filling the Presidency as His representative; and the fiery young Emperor of Germany talks in the same way publicly about himself as ruler of the Fatherlands.

In a neighboring city not long ago, a case arose which strikingly illustrated the inevitable unfairness and injustice of State recognition of religion. In some of the States the appropriation of public money by the legislature or a municipality for the support of sectarian institutions is strictly prohibited by the constitution. But this occurrence happened in a State not blessed with such protection for its people. A little Jewish girl was arrested for peddling, and committed to the custody of a corporation whose affairs are conducted by the partisans of a certain form of Protestant faith, though it is professedly "non-sectarian." *Habeas corpus* proceedings were taken to get the child before a court. The testimony of the "matron" was the feature of the case which is pertinent here. This good lady averred in the most positive manner, again and again, that there was nothing "sectarian" about the institution with which she was connected. It came out, however, on cross-examination, that "prayers" were "held" therein every morning under the auspices and direction of a minister of a particular denomination of Christians; that daily instruction was given in the tenets of the same denomination; that "services" were conducted by ministers of the same every Sunday; that attendance at prayers, and instructions, and at Sunday worship was compulsory upon all inmates of the "Home;" that a Hebrew rabbi had certainly called there some years ago, but none other before or since that solitary visitor appeared had been seen within the building; that the witness "rather thought" a Catholic priest had been in her parlor on one occasion, though when this happened, or what he was doing there, she could not, for the life of her, remember; and finally, that the young girl in the case had been taken in hand as soon as she arrived, and the work of weaning her away from the religion of her fathers and making a proselyte of her had been begun at once.

* * *

THE rank injustice of all this, in view of the fact that the city in which the evidence was brought out as above stated, annually appropriates a large sum of money to the institution where the girl was housed, and that a very considerable portion of this money comes directly out of the pockets of thousands of Hebrew taxpayers who are among the worthiest of the inhabitants—the cruel wrong of this whole proceeding needs no elucidation. There are no people in the world, professedly religious, who care less about proselyting than the Hebrews. On the other hand there are certainly none who are more tenacious of their own faith or more earnestly desirous that their children should ask for the old paths of their ancestry and walk in them. It is nothing less than a high-handed outrage, to take their money and use it as a missionary fund, to pay people to turn their little ones from the faith of their race.

*

AND yet, this same wrong must inevitably be worked on Jews, as well as others, wherever the State undertakes to apportion the people's money among charitable institutions not absolutely and exclusively under its own control. All such establishments are sure to be run on the lines of some particular religious cult. The people in charge of them are always full of zeal, and pretty generally satisfied that their way is not only a right way, but that it is the only right way. The expediency, nay, the duty, of persuading and teaching others to go that way is burned into the very core of their hearts and minds. The temptation to make "converts" among the young and impressible is particularly strong. It is all right enough for religious ardor to manifest itself as long as its possessors pay out of their own pockets as they go. But it is not right that Hebrew money should be used by the State to make even nominal Christians out of Hebrew children, nor that Catholic money should be used by the State for the "conversion" of Catholic into Protestant youth nor vice versa. Some day the people everywhere may be aroused to the evil of this practice, and then the constitutions of all the States will put a stop to it for ever.

IT now appears that, after all, little Greece has been for a long time coveting Crete for herself, and not merely loving the insurgents because, like her own people, they "profess and call themselves Christians," as the Episcopalian prayer-book says. It has been discovered that the Greek Admiral perfidiously failed to communicate the offer which the Powers made through him to the Cretans to guarantee them a practical autonomy, if they would lay down their arms. And one Mr. Stillman, who was United States Consul at Canea during the insurrection on the island which lasted from 1866 to 1869, has just written a letter, in which he declares that when the natives were on the very eve of final success, in the latter year a Greek officer landed without any objection on the part of the Turks, obtained from the confiding rebels the command of their entire force, and immediately surrendered to the enemy without firing a shot! The recent treachery, added to the memory of that historic betrayal of trust, is not likely to strengthen the position of Greece before the civilized world.

*

THE fact is that nations, like men, are prone in these days of degeneration, to the blasphemous use of Christianity's name as a portion of their capital or stock in trade—a means of worldly advancement and aggrandizement, like money, a reputation for skill in some special art, or aptitude for some particular pursuit, or line of activity. Perhaps it is inevitable that this should be the case. Christianity, first of all, vindicates its infallible efficacy as the guide and producer of good conduct. "See how these Christians love one another," exclaim the yet unregenerate pagans. And so, in time, many come to proclaim themselves Christians, who have never really felt its magic touch on heart or mind, because the very name is associated with goodness and desert, and commands general confidence, not only among genuine Christians, but among those who doubt the gospel story. Something of this disposition to trade on the sacred name of our religion seems to have been manifested by the Greek government, if not by the people. It is probable that the attempt will fail. It ought to fail as ought every undertaking, in business or professional life, to "use the Church for a feeder."

BISHOP NEWMAN, whose name has been quite frequently in the papers of late, was formerly a pastor of the Congregational Church, and was an intimate friend of General Grant. Some years ago the bishop—then a Congregational minister—was called upon to deliver a funeral sermon over the body of a distinguished and wealthy Californian's son. The young man was about eighteen when he died. He had been for some time a student at a prominent university in Germany. The bishop pronounced a glowing panegyric upon him. He credited the youth with all the virtues known to humanity, and all the brilliant qualities that mortal man could possibly possess. He waxed more and more enthusiastic and eloquent as he went on, till humanity seemed to him all too small for the mind and soul of that dead boy. And, so, he reached a height of imagination which enabled him to do what he considered justice to his subject. He actually made the claim that there was no historical parallel to the spectacle of that young man sitting under his professors, except the famous interview between a certain Child and his elders in the temple! It was soon after this marvelous oratorical flight that the Rev. Dr. Newman became a Methodist and a bishop almost simultaneously. The rich Californian's family, it is said, still remember him gratefully for his comparison of their boy to the Founder of Christianity.

CANADA wanted "reciprocity" with the United States and sent two "commissioners" to Washington a short while ago to talk the matter over. According to the dispatches her position was that her agricultural products should be admitted free, in return for certain concessions on her part in favor of the products of American factories. It is stated that the commissioners were explicitly assured that the new tariff bill would provide for the "protection" of the farmers of the United States, as well as for that of the manufacturers.

*

WITHOUT undertaking to deal with the profounder problems of free trade and protection, the proposition may be safely laid down that the less the United States has to do with Canada in any way the better it will be for the United States, if for no other reason because religion, which every right-minded American citizen is anxious to keep out of our politics as far as possible—both for the sake of politics and for the sake of religion, be it understood—this religion is the very key-note of Canadian politics, and for a certain reason, cannot be eliminated therefrom without some drastic measure, which will not, in the nature of things, be taken for many years, if, indeed, it ever will be taken.

***

This reason is, that when France was compelled to cede Canada to England, she stipulated in the treaty of cession that the rights and properties of the Catholic Church, as they existed at the time, should never be disturbed. It is a settled principle of what is called "International Law" that sovereign nations will disregard treaty stipulations whenever, in their judgment, their own interests require that they should do so. The only remedy the other parties to the treaty have, is to thrash the violator into a different opinion on this point. There is, therefore, no reason to doubt that England will repudiate her obligations in this regard, should she deem it advisable, in any emergency. But, meantime, there exists in Canada an established church, supported by civil taxation, active at all times in all political movements, now controlling, now influencing, now strenuously opposing governmental action, ordering voters as if they were horses to go in this direction or that, to stop, to move, to back, at its own sweet will.

***

Between a country thus biased in its public course—and whether the bias is for good or for evil is no matter to us—and this free United States of ours, there is a great gulf fixed. The traces of the union of Church and State still left among us are enough for us to fight. Haply, we may never root them out of our institutions, but, at any rate, we want just as little as possible to do with a country wherein religion is a recognized factor in political life, which nobody seems seriously disposed to eliminate.

The Christian Statesman of March 20 makes this reference to the general "celebration" in Washington, D.C., the evening of the inauguration ball:—

"A number of visitors, whose accounts are now being published, tell of terrible scenes of dissipation in many parts of the city. . . Hotels fitted up extra bar-rooms, and doubled and more than doubled their force of bartenders. And as the night wore on, under cover of its darkness the drunken and licentious orgies were of the most infamous character. A number of congressmen were among the worst of those who made the night hideous with their shameful rowdyism. Such occasions prove the depth of our corruption as a nation. How much need is there to throw the salt of Christianity into the polluted mass!"

Why, we thought from the Statesman's standpoint, indicated by repeated assertions, that this nation is a "Christian nation," and has been so for a long time, at least since the Supreme Court decision to that effect in 1892. Does the Statesman mean that it is a corrupt Christian nation, so polluted that it urgently needs the "salt" of Christianity to counteract the process of decay? What kind of "Christianity" is it that needs to be sprinkled with the "salt" of Christianity?

The Scripture says that Christians are the "salt of the earth." Matt. 5:13. And the Scripture is true. As salt is sprinkled in a dish of food—a minute quantity in comparison with the mass that is seasoned—so is Christianity in the earth and in the nation. It is but a sprinkling among the people.
