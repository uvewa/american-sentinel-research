A hearing was given March 16 by a joint committee of the Senate and House of Connecticut, on the Sunday bill recently introduced in the legislature of that State. This bill was drawn up by a committee of Congregational ministers of Connecticut, and greatly widens the application and increases the penalty of the existing law. At the hearing a number of Congregational preachers appeared and championed the measure, and two seventh-day observers and a lawyer spoke against it. The latter said that the history of religious legislation in the State was: "First, 'You must go to my church, or I will imprison you, or hang you, or banish you.' When that had grown unpopular, it was: 'You must go to some church, or I will imprison you or fine you.' And now, it is: 'If you don't go to some church, you shan't go anywhere else or do anything else.'" It was also shown by the opposition that the power of State legislatures could not do more than convert one half of a man, and only the outside half at that; and thus pharisees and hypocrites could be made to corrupt and curse the church, but no true Christians.

The impression of those present at the hearing was that the bill would not be favorably reported.
