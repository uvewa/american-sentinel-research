The following Sunday-rest bill has been introduced in Congress by Mr. McMillan, in the Senate, and by Mr. Harmer, in the House:—

"A BILL

"To further protect the first day of the week as a day of

"rest in the District of Columbia.

"Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That it shall not be lawful for any person to keep open any place of business or maintain a stand for the sale of any article or articles of profit during Sunday, excepting vendors of books or newspapers, and apothecaries for the dispensing of medicines, and undertakers for the purpose of providing for the dead, or others for the purposes of charity or necessity; nor shall any public playing of football or baseball or any other kind of playing, sports, pastimes, or diversions, disturbing the peace and quiet of the day, be practiced by any person or persons within the District of Columbia on Sunday; nor shall any building operations or work upon railroad construction be lawful upon said day; and for any violation of this Act the person offending shall, for each offense, be liable to a fine of not less than five dollars nor more than fifty dollars, and in the case of corporations there shall be a like fine for every person employed in violation of this Act laid upon the corporation offending.

"SECTION 2. That it shall be a sufficient defense to a prosecution for labor on the first day of the week that the defendant uniformly keeps another day of the week as a day of rest, and that the labor complained of was done in such a manner as not to interrupt or disturb other persons in observing the first day of the week as a day of rest. This Act shall not be construed to prevent the sale of refreshments other than malt or spirituous liquors, or to prevent the sale of malt and spirituous liquors as now provided for by law, or tobacco, cigars, railroad and steamboat tickets, or the collection and delivery of baggage."

It cannot be pretended that this is merely a "civil Sunday" bill, designed to release the laboring classes from the bondage of Sunday toil. Washington is not a city in which a case can be made out for a Sunday bill upon this ground. The bill is plainly religious in character. Any doubt upon this point would be removed by observing that the bill prohibits everything that would disturb "the peace and quiet of the day." Rest for the laboring men or for any others, possibly excepting invalids, is not dependent upon "the peace and quiet" of the day, so far as these would be affected by the pursuit of ordinary occupations and pleasures.

The bill asks Congress to legislate to uphold the Church dogma of Sunday sacredness,—to recognize Sunday as the weekly Sabbath. That is its real intent, and if this was plainly stated in its title, it would not in the least change its character.
