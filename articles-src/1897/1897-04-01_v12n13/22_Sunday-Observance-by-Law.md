THE Boston Post maks note in the following of the insufficiency of legislation to secure what is sought by the advocates of compulsory Sunday rest:—

"Without entering upon a discussion of the question whether it is possible to regulate by law the conduct of citizens on Sunday further than it is now regulated, the broader question forces itself upon consideration, whether the freest liberty of the individual does not assure the best and wisest observance of Sunday. The Sabbath, by the command delivered to Moses,—and which on the highest authority was 'made for man,'—is essentially a day of rest. Unnecessary labor is forbidden, in order that the opportunity for rest may not be interfered with. But rest means one thing for some men and altogether another thing for others.

"There is the consideration, of course, of the cultivation of man's spiritual nature. The Sabbath pause in secular occupation has from the first been held to be properly devoted to this purpose. It is the day on which men are free to give thought to things above the sordid occupation of bread winning. But can this be aided by law? The utmost that can be accomplished by authority is to secure to those who are spiritually disposed the free enjoyment of the opportunity afforded by the day of rest, undisturbed by the interference of others.

"This the laws undertake to do. And when this is done, all the rest is the work of individual effort,—the rendering attractive of church services, the collection of children into Sunday schools, the inspiration of higher thoughts by visitation and ministration among the lowly."

And it is pertinent to add that "the free enjoyment of the opportunity afforded by the day of rest, undisturbed by the interference of others," is secured by the laws against disturbing religious meetings, independently of any special legislation for Sunday. It is every man's privilege to rest on Sunday and worship on that day if he chooses, and also to worship at any other time that he may choose; for worship should certainly not be confined to one day in the week. And in this he will be protected from disturbance, whether at the Sunday morning service or at the Wednesday evening prayer-meeting. One law covers both occasions, and it is just as reasonable that a law should be framed especially for the prayer-meeting, as that one should be framed especially for worship on Sunday.

The Christian will worship God on all days and keep the rest day He has instituted, independently of human ordinances or regulations; and the person who will not do this is not a Christian, and cannot be made such by the passage of any law.
