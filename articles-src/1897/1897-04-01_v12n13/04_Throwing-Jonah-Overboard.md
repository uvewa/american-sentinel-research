Says the New York Observer, of March 4:—

"We have been reading the story of Jonah afresh, and are struck with the great reluctance with which the heathen seafaring men dropped their transgressing passenger overboard. They rowed hard to bring the vessel to land, hoping to save his life. When their efforts proved futile, they let him go, but only after beseeching the Lord not to lay innocent blood upon them. But these sailors were heathen and superstitious. To-day the Christian minister can toss Jonah overboard nonchalantly, in full sight of a Christian congregation. Meanwhile, the dexterous manipulation arouses a ripple of amusement as perceptible as that which passed over the deep into which the son of Amittai was originally dropped."

And the worst of it is that this modern ecclesiastical throwing overboard of Jonah is expressive of a policy which is not limited to Jonah, but includes all manifestations of the supernatural.
