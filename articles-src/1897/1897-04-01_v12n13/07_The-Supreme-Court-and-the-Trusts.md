Probably no decision of the United States Supreme Court ever occasioned more agitation in the realm of business in this country than that recently given, known as the Trans-Missouri Freight Association decision, sustaining the validity of the Sherman Anti-Trust law, and applying its restrictions to agreements between railways for the purpose of fixing rates of transportation.

The Anti-Trust law upon which the decision is based specifies the following:

"Every contract combination in the form of a trust or otherwise, or conspiracy in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States or with foreign nations, is hereby declared to be illegal.

"Every person who shall make any such contract or engage in any such combination or conspiracy shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and on conviction thereof shall be punished by fine not exceeding $5,000, or by imprisonment not exceeding one year, or by both said punishments in the discretion of the court."

The Supreme Court holds that these provisions apply to agreements between railways as above described, and renders the parties thereto liable to the penalties of the law.

The importance of this decision is seemingly of great magnitude. This is evident from the fact that the business of railway transportation is the greatest of all American industries.

It must not be hastily concluded, however, that this decision constitutes a victory of the people over the trusts. Whether the railways will not find some way to evade the decision, remains to be seen. Nor can these railway trusts be properly included among those "combinations in restraint of trade," which have so arbitrarily and unjustly extracted money from the public purse. The rates of railway transportation as fixed by these associations cannot be said to have greatly exceeded the demands of equity. In support of such associations it is pointed out that before their organization, competition between the roads had resulted in an interminable series of "rate wars," which produced such a fluctuation in prices that "a merchant was afraid to order goods today for fear a 'cut' in the cost of transportation tomorrow would cheapen the goods and enable a local rival to undersell him." A reversion to this state of things, it is maintained, would be an injury both to the railways and the entire community.

Nevertheless it must be admitted that the principle of independent business standing and of free competition in trade is violated by these railway pools no less certainly than it is by the most oppressive trust. If this pronouncement of the Supreme Court would be construed as forming a precedent for future decisions relative to the legality of methods employed by the trusts, it might properly be regarded as a victory for the interests which stand opposed to trusts. But it remains for the courts to decide how much value, if any, this decision will have in this direction.
