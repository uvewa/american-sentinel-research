A CALL has been issued for a convention of the national "Good Citizen's Association," to meet in Nashville, Tenn., May 18. The call is signed by Neal Dow, Josiah Strong, George C. Lorimer, Theo. L. Cuyler, and other men of religious and political prominence, and is issued to "all lovers of liberty, prosperity, truth, righteousness, and good government." Evidently the convention should be very largely attended.
