Probably no decision of the United States Supreme Court ever occasioned more agitation in the realm of business in this country than that recently given, known as the Trans-Missouri Freight Association decision, sustaining the validity of the Sherman Anti-Trust law, and applying its restrictions to agreements between railways for the purpose of fixing rates of transportation.

The freak epidemic which has so unaccountably broken out in a number of legislatures throughout the country within a few months has brought forth nothing more ultra or uncalled for than the following bill, introduced by Senator Ellsworth at Albany:—

"No person, firm, partnership, corporation, or voluntary association shall print or publish in any newspaper, periodical, magazine, pamphlet or book, any portrait or alleged portrait of any person or individual living in this State without first having obtained his or her written consent to such printing or publication.

"The printing or publishing of the portrait or alleged portrait of such person or individual without such consent in writing shall be a misdemeanor and shall be punishable by a fine not less than $1,000 and by imprisonment for not less than one year.

"This act shall take effect immediately."

This, it will be noted, is a sweeping, indiscriminate prohibition of any pictorial representation of any person in any publication without the written consent of such person. The prohibition is not restricted to private individuals; it applies equally to all public officials and public characters. It is not limited to newspapers; it extends to all classes of publications—weekly papers, monthly magazines, pamphlets and books. The penalty prescribed is as ultra and unheard of as the character of the bill. The minimum is a fine of not less than one thousand dollars in addition to imprisonment of not less than a year.

The reason or pretext offered in justification of this amazing measure is that the printing of personal portraits has been carried by certain papers to the extreme of abuse in violation of private rights. No reputable journal will defend or excuse such abuse or ask license to practice it. None will object to any well-aimed legislation to prevent or punish it. If the Ellsworth bill were of that character there would be no objection to its enactment. But so sweeping is it in scope and so tyrannical in penalty that the evil it would work would be infinitely greater than the abuse at which it is so wildly aimed. It is nothing short of an unbridled raid upon the entire illustrated press of the State and a plain violation of that principle embedded in the Constitution that "no law shall be passed to restrain or abridge the liberty of speech or of the press."

Its intent is, and its effect would be, not discriminate regulation, but indiscriminate prohibition. It would prohibit the publication without written consent of a picture of a candidate for the presidency of the United States, if living in New York, for the governorship or for any other public office in this State. Imagine a law prohibiting the publication of a biography or the personal record, good or bad, of any candidate for official station. Such a man is a public character. The people want to know, and have a right to know, who he is and what he is, and what he looks like. It is not only the constitutional right, but also the function of the press to supply this want. To prohibit pictorial representation in such case would be as clearly beyond the power of the legislature as to prohibit any personal description or comment without written consent.

The constitutional objection to the anti-cartoon feature of the bill is not less obvious, and is even more forcible, since this is aimed at one of the most potent and legitimate journalistic agencies of modern times. The use of satire and humor as moral forces is older even than the satires of Horace or the comedies of Aristophanes. They have figured conspicuously in the literature of every country and every age as lampoons of the oibles and follies, the wrongs and abuses of the times.

The cartoon is but pictured satire and humor and has lent to the modern press which has employed it, a power for public good often surpassing that wielded by the pen.

Pictorial comment on men, measures and issues commanding public attention is, and always has been, as legitimate and secure against unwarranted legislative interference as written criticism. It is a guaranteed right of the freedom of the press. For any abuse of that right a stringent libel law affords an ample remedy. But to declare that no public character shall be cartooned without his written consent would be equivalent to declaring that no public character shall be criticised without his written consent. It would be an invasion of the liberty of the press which popular sentiment would not countenance, the Constitution warrant nor the courts uphold.

If the courts had not shown so much readiness to defend measures which have the sanction neither of justice nor reason, there would not be so much "freak legislation" undertaken by our legislators.
