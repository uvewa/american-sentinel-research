A BILL was introduced in the Michigan legislature, March 4, "To prohibit the opening or keeping open of photographic galleries or studios on the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday, for the purpose of carrying on or engaging in the art or calling of photography, or in any work pertaining to the art or calling of a photographer on said first day of the week, commonly called Sunday." The bill exempts "persons who conscientiously believe the seventh day of the week should be observed as the Sabbath, and who actually refrain from secular business on that day."

Inasmuch as this State already has a statute forbidding secular business on the first day of the week, this proposed legislation seems superfluous from any standpoint that can be taken. And if it is contended that no law of the State now covers the business of photography, the bill is from this view open to the charge of being class legislation, which has recently defeated certain Sunday bills in other States.

Above and beyond these considerations, of course, is the great fact that this and all other human sabbath laws interfere with the Creator's ordinance of Sabbath observance, and therefore can have no binding force upon any individual.
