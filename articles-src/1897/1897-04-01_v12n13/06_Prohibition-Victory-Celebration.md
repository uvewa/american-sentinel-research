A victory for prohibition in the city election at Moundsville, W. Va., March 11, was celebrated by the two Methodist churches in the place by a procession of the most prominent members, headed by a brass band. The procession sang hymns and offered prayers. "The day is coming," says the *Christian Statesman*, "when such victories celebrated in some such way will be common all over the country."

But such methods of celebration will always have a flavor of politics and paganism rather than of Christianity.
