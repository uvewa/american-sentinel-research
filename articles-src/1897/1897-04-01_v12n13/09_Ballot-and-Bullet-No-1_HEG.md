In the *Twentieth Century Review*, No. 1, page 3, this language appears: "Thus it is that human forces are very nearly equally divided and arrayed against each other whenever the long-suffering honest half can endure abuse no longer, and call a halt for battle either by ballot or by bullet. A Christian cannot use the latter means (the bullet), however much he has been wronged, yet oftentimes he neglects the former (the ballot), however much his fellows have been wronged, thereby doing two contrary acts under one professional flag, with the mistaken idea that one whose citizenship is in heaven is at liberty to neglect payment of the peaceable ballot tribute due the 'powers that be' which are 'ordained of God' 'to keep people civil.'"

There are several points here employed which would have been of untold value in this most important of all times had they been treated logically instead of being carelessly thrown together, as in this quotation.

It is stated here that the Christian cannot use the bullet. This is true. The child of God is told first in the sixth commandment, "Thou shalt not kill." Christ shows the depth of this principle by saying that hatred in the heart is murder, Matt. 5:21, 22 and 1 John 3:15 and still further in Matt. 5:44, 45: "Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you; that ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven."

It is true that the Christian cannot employ any means to kill his fellowmen. Rom. 12:19. "Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves . . . for it is written, vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord."

Let us put to the test of logic the coupling of this quoted paragraph: The Christian cannot use the bullet, but is in duty bound to use the peaceable ballot.

We will start with the very genius of the ballot.

Why is it in the hands of the people? Because this is a government by the people. The ballot is the badge of sovereignty, the crown of authority with a free people. All the power is in the hands of the people and is expressed in the peaceful-looking piece of paper called the ballot.

Every particle of power ever exercised in the legitimate performance of duty in the various departments of the Government, is derived from the people by consent. This consent is expressed through the ballot.

It will perhaps seem absurd to some that there is any need of stating such a universally-conceded truth in America. So it would be if it were not largely lost sight of in essence by the people and denied in theory by illogical writers.

Many of the governed may not secure what they desire, but by the use of the ballot they consent to the decision of the majority whether it be in harmony with their desires or not. The original idea, in the minds of those noble men to whom we are most indebted for the form of our grand Government, was that all the power of the sovereign nation lay in the people and was furnished by consent to a general fund which would be employed to make every department of government effective. This power is transferred by consent, and the consent is the acceptance of the ballot.

When any person consents to submit the affairs of government to the free ballot and himself uses the ballot he is in honor bound to abide its decision. By that act he consents not only to be a submissive subject but assumes sovereignty and contracts to furnish so far as possible the power to carry out the expressed will of the people.

Again, he clothes civil officers with authority. Where does the authority originate?—With the people. Can officers exercise any authority or power not given them by those who vote?

When I commission another to act for me and the commission states in what manner he shall act, I am responsible so long as he acts within the limits of the commission. With the ballot men are commissioned to act in fulfillment of the Constitution on pain of impeachment.

The Constitution, as well as the commissioning of men to fulfill it, is but the drawing out of some of the elements in the ballot.

Then all the duties of the various departments of government in any emergency are but the unfolding of the power in the ballot. The entire Government with all its functions is in the ballot from its peaceful folding at the rural precinct through its practical unfolding in the halls of legislation and the courts of justice; and the execution of just decrees, the oath of office, and the booming of the cannon in defense of the whole.
