The success of Satolli as papal delegate to the United States, has encouraged the pope to try the same plan for the settlement of the church difficulties in Canada. Mgr. Del Val has been charged with the task, and has been invested with the fullest ecclesiastical powers, even to the extent of deposing bishops who may refuse to accept his decisions. It is learned that the forty-five Catholic members of the Senate and Commons, including M. Laurier and all the Catholic members of the government, signed a petition to the pope, asking him to send a delegate to settle the Manitoba school question, thus binding themselves to abide by his decision. A prominent Catholic churchman in London, Ont., which city the papal delegate has lately visited, states that Mgr. Del Val will ascertain just how much concession to the Catholics premier Greenway is willing to make, and that he will state to the premier what is the exact, irreducible minimum of the demands of the Church. He hopes that the maximum of the government's concessions will so nearly tally with the minimum of the Church's demands, that a basis will be established for a settlement of the issues between Church and State.
