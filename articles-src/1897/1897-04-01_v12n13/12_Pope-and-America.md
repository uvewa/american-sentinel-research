The Pope continues to feel a deep interest, as he says, in all the people of America, Protestant and Catholic alike. At an audience given March 22, in which he received and expressed himself as much pleased with the worship of one hundred sailors of the U.S. cruiser San Francisco, he said:—

"I am pleased to grant an audience to American sailors, as a testimonial of my paternal esteem and affection for the whole American people, who are always dear to my heart and for whom I have never ceased and never shall cease to pray God, who by providential signs does now manifest and in the future will manifest His good will to America even as does His vicar. Continue your voyage. Treasure as a happy souvenir of it this audience. May God guard you amid the storms of the ocean."
