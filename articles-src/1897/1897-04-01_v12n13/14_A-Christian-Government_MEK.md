A note in the Union Signal, organ of the W. C. T. U., says that "labor leaders, as well as our mission workers, recognize that the great stumbling block in the way of temperance reform in heathen lands, as well as in our own, is the attitude of Christian governments toward the liquor traffic."

What is that attitude? Quite generally it is an attitude of favor and protection. Indeed, this is what the Signal complains of. But is such a course Christian? Is it in harmony with the teachings of Christ and the general tenor of the Scriptures?—No, indeed, it is diametrically opposed to Christianity. Drunkenness is one of the works of the flesh, and those who are devoted to it "shall not inherit the kingdom of God." The heirs of God, and joint heirs with Christ, inherit the kingdom; but drunkards are disqualified by spiritual law from the inheritance. The kingdoms of this world receive drunkards into the highest offices, and also make laws regulating—not preventing—the sale of liquor.

Another note in the same paper refers to "the very stronghold of the rum power—the government itself." The government the stronghold of the rum power, and still a Christian government! When the course pursued by governments in this, as in many other things, is so contrary to Christianity, how can anyone have the effrontery to call them Christian governments? Can a man who dabbles in the liquor traffic be a Christian?—No, indeed. Neither can a government which does the same be a Christian government.

National Reformers, and the W. C. T. U., which affiliates with them, take a special delight in speaking of our Government as though it were a person, had a conscience, and must be regarded as Christian or unchristian according to its public acts in reference to the Christian religion. If this were so, the Government should be judged Christian or unchristian by the same rule by which a man is judged, that is, its works.

Measured by this rule, can it be said that governments are Christian governments, whose actions in regard to a hundred things, including temperance, are so unchristian,—which are really great corporations for selfish purposes, which go to war for selfish ends, and which discriminate in every possible way against the people of other countries for the same selfish purpose? The idea is preposterous.

A government may through its representatives make a profession of religion; yes, of the Christian religion. But unless it were better than any existing government, it would in reality be a better representation of a slightly convicted sinner, or a backslidden professor, than it would be of a real Christian. When a government shall exist in the world for Christian purposes and Christian ends; not seeking its own but the good of others; manifesting in government affairs the same spirit that a Christian is required to manifest in his private business; which, when it is reviled, will not revile again; when it is smitten by some other nation on one government cheek, will turn the other also,—then we will "ten with more patience to the plea that there may be such a thing as a Christian government. But until that time we shall deny that such a thing as a Christian government exists.

Christianity has enough to bear from unchristian Christians, without its being compelled to sustain the shame of Christian governments, so-called, by unthinking religious enthusiasts who forget that nations, as well as men, may steal the livery of the court of heaven that they may better serve self and Satan.
