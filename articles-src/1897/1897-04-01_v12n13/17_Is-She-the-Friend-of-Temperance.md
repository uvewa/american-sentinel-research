The Union Signal of March 25 makes the observation that "the Catholic church and the archdiocese of Boston, by the voice of the clergy, has announced itself the uncompromising friend of temperance." The evidence of this seems to be that "one hundred and seventy priests, headed by the venerable Archbishop Williams, was sent to the legislature of Massachusetts asking that such laws be enacted as will prevent the sale of intoxicating liquors in any public park within the commonwealth."

"It is," says the Signal, "declared by those who know the animus of the movement that the great underlying purpose which these promoters of temperance desire to accentuate by every possible and honorable means in their power, is to manifest the attitude of the Catholic clergy on the liquor question in general, and to disabuse the minds of those who have misunderstood the spirit of the church on this matter."

We are as willing as any others to believe that the Catholic church is the "uncompromising friend of temperance," if such a belief can be based upon good evidence. But the evidence which comes to our view does not point that way. The decree promulgated on the subject by the American Catholic bishops at their last session does not forbid communicants from engaging in the liquor traffic, but warns them to "consider seriously the many and great dangers and occasions for sin with which their business is surrounded," and provides that "Should they not abandon the traffic, they must do all in their power to remove the occasion of sin from themselves as well as from selling liquor to minors, or to those who they see will abuse it." They are to "keep their shops closed on Sundays, and at no time allow on their premises the use of filthy or profane language," etc. Thus they are to be careful not to bring "the cause of religion" "into dishonor."

The saloon business in itself is not therefore viewed by Catholic authorities as being a dishonor to their religion.

And again: If the church is so firmly set against intemperance, what is the significance of the following among the Catholic "regulations for Lent:" "Those who avail themselves of this Indult are not allowed to use flesh meat and fish at the same meal, and they are earnestly exhorted to perform some other act of mortification, such as abstinence from intoxicating liquors." It is our belief that from the standpoint of temperance, "mortification" is properly connected with indulgence in intoxicating liquors, rather than with abstinence from their use.
