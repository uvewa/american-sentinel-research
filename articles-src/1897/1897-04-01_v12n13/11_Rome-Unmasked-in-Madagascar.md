The New York Independent, of March 25, publishes a letter from the Rev. James Sibree, missionary of the London Missionary Society, setting forth the persecutions to which Protestants in Madagascar are now subjected under the papal regime which ensued upon the subjection of the island by the French. Mr. Sibree's letter is written from Antananarivo, the capital city. He says:—

"The Roman Catholic priests here, who are also Jesuits, have for many years past been angry and chagrined at the progress made by Protestant missions, and at the large number of their adherents. They have had perfect liberty to teach and to propagate their religion—in fact they have often obtained more favors from the former native government, in the way of getting land for their buildings, etc., than have been granted to Protestant missionaries; but they have not been able, up to very lately, to coerce the people to enter their communion. The establishment of the French power in Madagascar has, however, now given them the opportunity they have long desired, of persecuting Protestants; and they are now using it most unscrupulously.

"Not many days after the occupation of Antananarivo by the French forces (Sept. 30, 1895), a proclamation was issued by General Duchesne, assuring the Malagasy of perfect religious liberty; and this was repeated by the late Resident-General, M. Laroche, as well as by General Gallieni, the present Commander-in-Chief and acting Resident-General. But, notwithstanding these excellent and fair-sounding statements, they have in scores of villages, since the proclamation of the state of siege, become almost a dead letter. The military commandants in several districts have become facile instruments in the hands of the Jesuits in terrorizing the people. In several instances our Protestant churches have been seized and mass performed in them; the schools have in many cases been handed over en masse to the priests; the congregations have been brow-beaten, threatened and frightened into becoming, nominally, Roman Catholics. In very many cases they have been told by people in authority that if they continue Protestants they will be accounted as rebels. They are told that their English missionaries are enemies of France, and, therefore, all who have anything to do with them will also be reckoned as the enemies of France. Local native governors are told that while there is, of course, religious liberty for the people (!), they, as men in authority, ought to be of the same religion as the French nation; and if they stand fast, they are soon accused of disaffection, and are degraded or fined. The consequence, of course, is that numbers of them, to avert suspicion from themselves, become almost more zealous and unjust than the priests themselves, and use all their influence to coerce the people to leave the religion they have been taught.

"Accusations on the most flimsy pretenses are got up against the best men in some of the districts—pastors, evangelists and others; and they are heavily fined, imprisoned, and some are now loaded with chains, although it is perfectly certain that their Protestantism is their only offense.

"It seems now a settled principle that if the majority of the people in a village can be brought, by any means whatever—such as those just named—to say that they are Roman Catholics, the church in the village, although built exclusively by and for a Protestant congregation, and always aided by grants from the London Missionary Society, can be taken for Roman Catholic worship, and the Protestants expelled. This has been done, and the priests are hoping by this clever contrivance that numbers of our Protestant churches will pass into their hands. And from what has been said as to the means used to terrorize the people, it will be easily seen how easy it is to get the majority of the people in a village—numbers of whom never attended any place of worship—to profess themselves to be Roman Catholics. In some villages the priest has gone from house to house with two books to write down the people's names, telling them that all written as Roman Catholics in the one will be perfectly safe, while those in the other will be exposed to all sorts of danger and suspicion. Are any words needed to explain what effect such a proceeding must have upon a large number of weak and still very ignorant people? The result has been that in large villages where, until quite lately, there has never been a single Roman Catholic, the whole congregation has been forced to say that they have 'quite voluntarily given up Protestantism.'

"Things are even worse in the Southern province of Betsiléo than here in Imérina. Such influences have been brought to bear by the Resident there and the priests that almost all the native officers and governors have been obliged to (f)ome Catholics, while a few have made a compromise by joining the Norwegian Lutheran Mission, which is not so obnoxious to the authorities as that of the English Protestants. Another severe blow at the London Missionary Society there is the summary order given to almost all the Hova evangelists and teachers (as well as many who have nothing to do with this province) to immediately leave the work, which many of them have been engaged in for years, and to come up here to Imérina. After only a very few days' notice, from three to five, they were obliged to sell all their property and houses, at considerable loss, and leave their people. None of the Norwegian or Roman Catholic teachers, however, have been disturbed. One English missionary has been twice turned out of his house on the excuse that it was either required or government service, or that the owner dared not let it to an English missionary. Religious liberty is at present unknown in the Betsiléo province. Did space permit, every one of the statements given above could be abundantly substantiated by detailed facts and written proofs."

"It may be said, in conclusion, that some French commandants have tried loyally to act uprightly and impartially in religious matters, but many others, as already stated, have willingly or unwillingly become the tools of the Jesuits in their strenuous attempts to terrorize the Protestants into becoming Romanists."

And what Rome is in Madagascar, she is in principle, and at heart, in these United States.
