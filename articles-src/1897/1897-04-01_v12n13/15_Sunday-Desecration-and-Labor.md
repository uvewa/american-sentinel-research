A WRITER in the March number of The Defender, organ of the New England Sabbath Protective League, sees in the desecration of Sunday, the coming enslavement of all labor. He says:—

"If men must work that the proprietors of Sunday newspapers, the owners of railroads, the managers of places of amusement, liquor sellers, etc., may get rich, what is to prevent the early and complete enslavement of all labor? As sure as the sun rises in the heavens from day to day, one result of the fearful sweeping away of the anchorage of Sunday sanctity and rest now witnessed will be the compulsory labor of many helpless toilers on Sunday, when the clouds of commercial depression are again lifted."

Nevertheless it is a fact that the hours of labor per day for most employees are much shorter now than they were a generation in the past, and the tendency of the times under the influence of the labor organizations, is toward a still further shortening of the period of daily toil. This is undeniably true, and it is a very distorted view of the situation which fails to recognize it.
