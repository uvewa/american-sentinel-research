### Specific Uncertainties

**Page 7, Line 249:**
- **Transcribed as:** "AMERICAN SENTINEL. 19"
- **Confidence:** LOW - appears to be page number "199" with "9" cut off or printing artifact
- **Context:** Running page header

**Page 15, Article "Notes of the Week":**
- **Author attribution:** "Jas. T. Ringgold" with initials "JTR"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM - name appears clearly but initials format unusual for this publication
- **Note:** First appearance of this contributor in my review

**Page 19, Article by M. E. Kellogg:**
- **Transcribed as:** "ten with more patience" (in paragraph about Christian government)
- **Confidence:** LOW - word "ten" appears to be OCR error, likely should be "listen"
- **Context:** "then we will 'ten with more patience to the plea"
