It is interesting to note the monarchical tendencies among the would-be "higher classes" in the United States.

The manifestations of this monarchical spirit and ambition are not by any means few. It is most marked, of course, among the idle rich; but it is by no means confined to that circle.

The ambition of American girls and women, to give themselves and vast fortunes for European titles and misery, is so notorious as to call for nothing more than mere mention in this connection.

Besides these there are thousands who, having no chance to secure titles, spend fortunes to secure the recognition of the titled ones of Europe. People will spend years and thousands of dollars to gain *entré* to "the Prince of Wales's set," or to a "drawing room" of the Queen of England; this "dignity" to be used in America in holding themselves as far as possible above other people.

And thousands of the people who stay at home, or who, if they go abroad, have not the fortune to attain to such "dignity," are themselves so imbued with the same spirit that they look upon those who have attained to it, as being thereby so far superior to what they ever were before as to be entitled to some sort of worshipful reverence, and they proceed to pay it like any other roadies.

Then those who have in fact attained to such great "dignity" form themselves into exclusive "sets" in their several localities and ape the ways of royalty. And the others who would like to, but can't, will gaze and admire and ape the ways of those who ape the ways of royalty.

It is a fact that there are people who have gone to Europe and spent fortunes in securing a title or the recognition of royalty, in order to obtain entrance to the exclusive sets on this side of the water.

And now there is one of these "sets" that has formed a society, which, instead of having a president, is to have a queen. In presiding she is to sit upon a throne, and have heralds and maids and lackeys and all the other togggery that becomes queens. She is not obliged to wear a crown, but it is specified that she "may or may not," as she pleases—and who will doubt for a moment that she will please to wear one?

Now we are not casting any sort of reflection upon the people of Europe who have dignities, titles and royalties. These things all belong to them, and have belonged to them for more than a thousand years. These dignities fit them and they can wear them becomingly; and in doing so they are entitled to respect. And indeed as so many Americans buy these things and pay immense prices for them, it may be said that these titles, dignities and royal airs belong to them too. Yet for all this they never can wear them becomingly in America; and not one in a thousand can wear them becomingly in Europe. They simply do not fit. And Americans only make themselves ridiculous even in the eyes of Europeans in their efforts to secure them, or to wear them after they have secured them.

Any American who will be simply what he is, just his plain everyday self, can travel all over Europe and be respected everywhere; but those who think they must put on European style and ape European ways, will be endured, if they are not despised, everywhere they go. How could it be otherwise? When people do not respect themselves, how can it be expected that other people will respect them? When people at every turn manifest only littleness and insincerity, how can others do any more than endure them?

It will not do to pass off all this running after foreign titles and dignities and recognitions, as but a little thing. In one sense it is of course a little thing, exceedingly little; but it is not by any means insignificant, especially when an ambassador from the United States becomes so carried away by this spirit, as to compromise his own position and, in the presence of foreigners in a foreign land, criticise his own people as "a people hard to rule" and that "must be held with a steady hand." This from an ambassador of a Government that is "of the people, by the people, and for the people"!

All these things, though appearing very little in themselves, when taken together, are plainly the manifestations of another element working steadily and insidiously onward to the time when "our country shall repudiate every principle of its Constitution as a Republican Government."
