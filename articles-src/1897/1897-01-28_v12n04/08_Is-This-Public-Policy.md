JUSTICE PRYOR, of the New York State Supreme Court, has decided that it is "contrary to the public policy of the State" for a corporate association to hold its annual meeting on Sunday. Upon what basis of fact does this "public policy of the State"—if such it be—rest?

Would a private business meeting of a corporate association disturb the peace and quiet of the day? Is it upon this basis that the State would from public policy forbid such meetings one Sunday in the year and allow the running of street-cars and railway trains on every Sunday?

Does the public policy of the State forbid such a yearly meeting as a desecration of the day, while allowing the public and noisy desecration of the day by street-car and railway corporations every Sunday in the year? It may be said that this desecration ought also to be prohibited; but that is not the question raised by Judge Pryor's dictum. It is a fact that the State has allowed such desecration of Sunday from time immemorial; and it cannot be assumed that the State has gone contrary to its own public policy.

One other ground remains to be noticed, that of the public utility of idleness as compared with honest employment. Does the public policy of the State demand that the people should be idle on Sunday, doing, in very many cases at least, that which the devil finds for idle hands to do, rather than employed in some honest and virtuous occupation? The question needs no answer.

How then does it appear that a yearly Sunday meeting of a corporate body would be contrary to the public policy of the State? What does appear is that Judge Pryor has mistaken his own private policy for the policy of the people.
