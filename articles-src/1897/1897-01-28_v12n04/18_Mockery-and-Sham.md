The scandal caused by the protest of the Rev. S. D. Brownjohn against the confirmation of Bishhop Temple as Archbishop of Canterbury was not so much the scandal of his interruption of the ceremony as it was the scandal and sacrilege of the refusal to hear his protest.

After full public notice "given to all and singular opposers" of the election of Dr. Temple as Archbishop to come to St. Mary-le-Bow Church on December 22nd to make their objections, Mr. Brownjohn appeared. The royal mandate was read in the presence of eight bishops commissioned by the Crown to confirm the election, citing all opposers, if any, to appear. Mr. Brownjohn arose and said that he desired to protest against the confirmation of Dr. Temple's election because of his belief in doctrines which the protester believed to be absolutely "incompatible with fidelity to the teaching of the Book of Common Prayer."

Thereupon he was told he could not be heard and that it had long ago been decided that the court had no power to entertain such objection. The Archbishop of York concurred, and the opposer was silenced. The ceremony went on and the august company was told that the new primate was a prudent and discreet man, eminent for his knowledge of the Scriptures and in every way suitable to the position.

Then the Apparitor-General proceeded slowly down the aisle, crying:—

"Oyez! Oyez! All ye and sundry who have any objection to the confirmation of the Rt. Rev. Frederick Temple as Archbishop of Canterbury, come forward and *ye shall be heard.*"

Thereupon Mr. Brownjohn arose, and again tried to make his protest; but was again silenced, and told by the Archbishop of York that he could not be heard. Then to cap the absurdity of it all, the Vicar-General denounced as contumacious those who had failed to present their objections:—

"I accuse the contumacy of all and singular the persons as aforesaid cited, intimated, publicly called and not appearing, and I pray them to be pronounced contumacious."

Now if there can be a greater mockery and sham, any greater scandal and sacrilege in a sacred ceremony than the public citation of objectors to whom a hearing is refused, we do not know what it is.

"RIGHT is indivisible: we obtain it for ourselves only by claiming it for others."—De Pressensé.
