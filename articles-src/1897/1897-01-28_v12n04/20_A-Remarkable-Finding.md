JUDGE PRYOR'S refusal to incorporate a Hebrew society upon the ground that its aim and purposes were calculated to infringe the civil law of New York regarding Sunday observance, continues to excite attention and ridicule.

The petition, which was made to him, set forth the following as the object: "To promote the strict observance of and adherence to such customs, laws, usages and rites of the orthodox Hebrew religion or faith as are not repugnant to, and inconsistent with, the Constitution and laws of the United States and the laws of the State of New York, to improve the condition of the orthodox Hebrew congregations, and to abolish the now existing religious evils.

Judge Pryor refused to sanction the petition because the annual meetings of the society were to be held "on each and every second Sunday in January in each year." This he declared to be an infraction of the civil law, and as a Justice of the Supreme Court, he could not officially approve a meditated infraction of the law. He set forth his views in a long and labored opinion which would have done justice to Judge Gaynor, who has proved his capacity to more peculiar things within a given time than any judge New York has ever had.

As an illustration of the general character of Judge Pryor's finding, we quote the following paragraph: "Al- though not explicitly stated, it is nevertheless an inference from the face of the certificate before me that the members of the proposed corporation are of a race and religion by which not the first but the seventh day of the week is set apart for religious observances."

It seems incredible that in this nineteenth century the prejudices of a judge can carry him thus far in a matter of this kind. He does not seem to realize that his argument is purely a religious one, and bears very little relation to the law.

Why he should have gone out of his way, as in this instance, to insult this large and influential class of citizens passes all comprehension. The following extract from a Protestant periodical breathes a spirit which Judge Pryor will do well to imbibe: "If this does not stir the latent sense of justice and of loyalty to their ancestral faith on the part of the Jews of New York, they will hardly be worthy of the liberty and the respect that this opinion denies them. Whatever else this opinion may be, it is a shame to its author."
