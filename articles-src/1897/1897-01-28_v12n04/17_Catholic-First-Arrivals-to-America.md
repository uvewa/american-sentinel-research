In a lecture in this city Sunday, January 3, on "America's Debt to the Catholic Church," Mr. Henry Austin Adams said that "The history of the crew which sailed with Columbus in the Santa Maria shows that a man named Patricius McGuirio stood in the bow of the boat that first touched the shore of the New World, and that in the stern, as tillerman, sat one Giovani Moranio. These men were the first to jump from the boat to the shore. Their names, Anglicized, were Patrick McGuire and John Moran.

"And the McGuires and the Morans have been here ever since (applause). And there is nothing to show that they ever conveyed to others their title, as first arrivals, to the country."
