A FEATURE of recent Congressional proceedings at the National Capitol, was an amendment offered by Senator Morgan to the Immigration bill, which would oblige all immigrants to this country, before acquiring citizenship, to be able to read the Ten Commandments. In defending his proposed measure, which he affirmed was introduced "in no spirit of levity," Senator Morgan said he was actuated by "the most serious intention of making every man who comes to the test to acquire American citizenship show before the officer, the Judge who admits him, that he knows the foundations of the Christian religion as they are taught in the Ten Commandments."

He then referred to "the Christian sabbath, which is observed in this country from end to end and enforced by State laws and even by the laws of the United States Government," as an evidence that "we continually recognize in all our . . . political, national and State relations, and relations to the laws of our country, the great underlying foundation" of these commandments. Would the senator oblige immigrants to read Sunday, or first day of the week, into the fourth commandment? When the senator himself is so blind with respect to the Decalogue as to think that it enjoins the observance of Sunday, is he well qualified to lead the blind in the path which it marks out?

When the blind lead the blind, they must both fall into the ditch. When the people of this country allow their legislators to set themselves up as their religious guides, they are not far from disaster.
