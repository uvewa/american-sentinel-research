From our Washington Correspondent.

The people of the city of Washington are fully aware that Wilbur F. Crafts is here with all his methods. On Sunday afternoon, the 18th inst., a so-called mass meeting was held in the Metropolitan M. E. Church. The attendance did not exceed two hundred people. At the close of the meeting the people were requested to vote to Dr. Crafts and his associates the right to petition Congress for the passage of the District Sunday Bill. Some of the people voted and some did not; but the vote was declared unanimous. It was not stated whether Dr. Crafts wanted to represent one hundred or one thousand.

The same scene was enacted in the evening of the same day at another church of the city, where the attendance did not reach one hundred. The vote was taken by a show of hands and many did not vote, but as before the vote was declared unanimous. Since there was no limit placed on the power to petition, it is only fair to surmise that Dr. Crafts will use it to the full extent of his ability.

It is wonderful how these people can pile up petitions by their plan of "representative petitioning." For an example, we have only to call to mind the record of the petitions for the Sunday closing of the World's Fair, when the vote of the churches enabled these men to represent more people in some States than the entire population of the State; so that they represented the increase of population to the present time.

From the beginning already made, we may expect to witness quite as great results as in the past. If the pastors of the different churches where the so-called mass meetings are being held, are only willing to open their church list, the Sunday-school list, the W. C. T. U. list, and the list of names of those that belong to the Young People's societies, regardless of whether they attended the mass meeting or not, the list of petitioners will be a large one, and Congress will be led to suppose that all the people of the District are in favor of the passage of the Sunday Bill.

Dr. H. H. George, representing another wing of the National Reform Party, laboring in the interest of the God-in-the-Constitution resolution, is here also; and Congress will no doubt be treated to more wisdom along the line of last year's contention before the Judiciary Committee of the House, *i. e.*, that there must be a national conscience on all moral questions, and the individual conscience must yield to that of the nation. And while the individual would have to depend on the nation for his conscience, we should still have "no union of Church and State"! Certainly this is as extraordinary as the plan of petitioning in the other wing of the party. The Christian lobbyists are capable of great things.
