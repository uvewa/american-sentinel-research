In refusing to approve the certificate of incorporation of a Hebrew society on the ground that its annual meeting was to be held on Sunday, Justice Pryor has carried the Puritanical spirit of the old Blue Sunday Law of this State even beyond its ridiculous letter.

No objection was made to the character of the society, and there was no pretense that its annual meeting would be disorderly, boisterous, or would in any way interfere with the usual quiet and orderly observance of Sunday. Nor did Judge Pryor find that it would be unlawful for the society to meet on that day. His objection is that the meeting would be "contrary to public policy" and in violation of "the sanctity of the Christian sabbath which is sanctioned and secured by repeated acts of legislation extending from the colonial times to the present year and as well by the impressive deliverances of the Court of Appeals."

That is Blue Sunday Law with a vengeance. Whatever may be said of the rigid Puritanical legislation of colonial times, it is straining the law beyond obvious acts as well as all reason to hold that a harmless meeting of a social organization on one Sunday in a year is contrary to the more sensible public policy and the more liberal popular sentiment that now prevail.
