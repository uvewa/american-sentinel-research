Every Christian, Mohammedan and Jewish denomination has its own definition, its own analysis, how the Sabbath should be observed in accordance with their particular creed; and if the State allows its Sunday legislation to be influenced by the Catholic or Protestant Church, in a State where those denominations are numerically the strongest, why should not another State which has Seventh-day Baptists and Adventists as a majority enforce Saturday as a legal holiday, with all penalties attached to maintain its observance?
