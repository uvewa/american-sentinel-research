The legislator who is induced to vote for a statute by the idea that it embodies a command of Diety, drops his character as a legislator altogether and undertakes to act as the enforcer of the will of the Diety upon other people. This is no part whatever of his duty as a legislator, which is to legislate for the good of the people within constitutional limitations. And, however strongly he may be convinced that there is a divine command for Sunday idleness, and that it would be for the good of the people to have that command embodied in a statute, yet he breaks his oath as a legislator, and is in reality no legislator, but a religious propagandist, when he undertakes by his vote to do the people that good by violating the restraints laid upon his conduct as a legislator by the Constitution. It is to this that he has sworn allegiance as a legislator, to this alone that he owes his existence as such, and to this alone may he rightly turn for the definition and limitation of his duties. And any statute whose provisions by their very nature cause the mind of the legislator, when pondering his vote upon it, to go outside of the Constitution altogether, and to determine his course by his conclusions on the question of whether the statute does or does not embody a command of Diety,—any such statute causes the legislator to break his oath of office. And when it becomes a law by means of legislative votes cast in its favor because of its supposed embodiment of a command of Diety, it sets up the union of Church and State and gives pro tanto a preference to one religion over another.

Let us look at this matter a little closer. Some men decline to admit a Deity; others deny that his will is anywhere recorded; some insist that it is recorded in one place and some recognize it in another. "Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind." For the man himself, of course, when he has found it, the expression of the will of the Deity is enough; he recognizes his obligation to obey, and he thinks other men ought to obey also. But here we must discriminate between the legislator and the man. Admit that the man is right, and that he has found an expression of the will of Deity; admit, further, that the men who compose the membership of the legislature ought to obey that will. What is that will, as expressed in the case in hand? "Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy." Every man in the legislature, and every man outside of it, ought to obey this command of Deity. If the way to obey it is to be idle on Sunday, then legislators and all others ought to be idle on Sunday. But, observe that there is no distinction whatever in this regard between legislators and others. Both obey or disobey the command of Deity in the same manner precisely. And why? Because this command of Deity, like all other such commands, is addressed to the individual, as an individual, without any regard whatever to his official character.

Honesty, purity, fidelity, are demanded by the will of Deity in all men alike and in the same degree, without reference to social or political distinctions. But if no more is demanded of one man than another by that will, it follows that when a man through the human agency of voting becomes a member of the legislature, while he takes upon himself an entirely new set of obligations and duties with reference to the community, from which a non-member is free, yet his duty to Deity remains just what is was before. The man is the creature of Deity; he must obey the will of Deity. The member is the creature of the State; her will is his law. Thus, before a man becomes a member of the legislature, he is under obligation to obey the will of Deity and "remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy;" but after he becomes a member of the legislature, he is under no additional obligation whatever in this regard. And, as the legislator does not assume any new duty toward Deity, as he undertakes no new functions in the domain of religion by reason of his official duties, so he thence acquires no new rights or privileges in that domain. If he had not, as a private citizen, the right to enforce in others obedience to what he considered a divine command, then he does not get that right by virtue of his election.

The special right he thus acquires is of civil creation and of a civil nature altogether, and therefore to be exercised for civil purposes alone. It is the right to force on others to the extent of his vote, obedience to his notions of the dictates of worldly wisdom, for the sake of worldly welfare alone, and even this only within the limits of constitutional restrictions. And, as the legislator, as such, has no religious duties or privileges, of course there are no commands addressed to him as such, in the Book of Christian religion. To take the case now under consideration: It is nowhere commanded, "Thou shalt vote for a law to compel other people to keep holy the Sabbath day." Upon this point the legislator is as free regarding his action from any command of Deity, as he is regarding his action on a tax bill. Of course he is commanded by Deity to discharge his duties as a legislator conscientiously, as he is to discharge all other duties; but the will of Deity is nowhere expressed as to what his duties as a legislator are. Their definition and limitation are a matter of human constitutional law entirely.

The will of Deity as to specific legislation has never been publicly revealed but once, and that was under the "pure theocracy" of the Jews. And even under that system the legislation was not directed to be enacted by human agency, but both the law and its penalties were specifically revealed. It is as arrogant—shall we not say it is as blasphemous?—in a modern legislature to claim divine sanction for one of its enactments as it would be for a railroad company to assert the same inspiration in the selection of a particular route by its board.

Well, then, may we not say that a conscientious legislator, pondering his vote on a proposed Sunday law, with mind undarkened by the clouds of Brownism, and sincerely desiring to fulfill the will of Deity, would in his official action commune with himself somewhat after this fashion? "It is the will of Deity that I shall herein discharge faithfully the duty I owe to the State, which the State has defined for me, and which I have expressly pledged myself to perform. I am not at liberty to judge for myself what that duty is, unless in cases where my employer, the State, has failed to define it for me. Is this such a case? I cannot shut my eyes to the fact that this question of a Sunday law is a religious question. The character of its advocates, the fact that they consist exclusively of professional religionists, male and female, sufficiently demonstrates that: the nature of the arguments these people use in favor of the law, simply confirms what is already clear from their pressure and their zeal. Now, the State has defined my duties, which it is the will of Deity that I should perform, in the constitution. Let me look at that, and see what my duty is, as to legislating upon religious questions. The constitution says, 'No preference shall be given by law to any religion.' This means that my duty as a legislator is to vote against the passage of any law which gives a preference to any religion.

"Now, let me turn from the examination of the constitution, and examine myself for a moment. I know that these professional religionists are here urging the passage of this law for the reason, and for the reason alone, that they believe it will give a preference to the particular religion which they profess over all other religions. Do I not also know perfectly well, in my own mind, that this belief of theirs is entirely correct? Am I not conscious that my inclination to vote for this law is based purely on my knowledge that it will give a preference to their religion, and my desire thus to oblige a number of good citizens?

"But stop, there is another basis for this inclination of mine. Away down in the depths of my heart, there is a strong hereditary sympathy with the kind of religion these people profess. I may not live up to it—as many of them probably do not—in respect to Sunday observance and in several other respects, but I have still a 'preference' for it. As part of this religion, I have been taught to believe that there is a command of Deity that men shall not work on Sunday, and I should like to see all men obey the commands of Deity. Am I not, then, in danger of allowing my own preference in the matter of religion to influence my vote on this bill? On the other hand, if I feel that it is this preference of others which alone inclines me to vote for the bill, then is it not evident that, to my own inner consciousness, the bill does embody a preference of one religion over another? But, if it embodies such a preference, it violates that constitution which I have sworn to support. It is the will of Deity that I shall not break that oath. Now, will it matter in the least in His eyes whether, in the breaking of it, I vote to give a preference by law to the particular religion which I happen to profess, or to some religion professed by other people?"

The correctness of this line of thought cannot be impeached. It discriminates with right morality between the duty of the individual, which is to give a preference to the religion that he believes to embody the will of Deity, and the duty of a legislator, which is to vote against any law that gives a preference to his own religion or any other, as against all laws that violate the Constitution under which alone he acts as a legislator. It distinguishes justly and properly between the man and the member. It is the reasoning of intellectual honesty, as opposed to the guidance of intellectual dishonesty, consciously or unconsciously inducing the legislator to regulate his official conduct by another standard than that to which he has sworn that he will conform.
