In the North Carolina Declaration of Rights, Sec. 1, it is declared that "All men are created equal," and are "endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights" as "life, liberty, the pursuits of happiness, and the enjoyment of the fruits of their own labor." Sec. 26 declares that "all men have a natural and unalienable right to worship God according to the dictates of their own consciences, and no human authority should in any case whatever, control or interfere with the rights of conscience."

This, then, leaves to each person the right to follow his own conscience in his relation to his Creator, and allows the civil government the right to regulate only man's relation to his fellowmen. This is not toleration merely. It asserts as *unalienable* the rights of men to worship, and at the same time to *enjoy* the fruits of their own labor—not of five-sixths only, but of *all* their labor. In other words, it declares that *every* man has an *unalienable right* to work *all* of the time his own conscience permits him, and that "no human authority should, in any case whatever, control or interfere with it."

Now there are in North Carolina, as well as in all other States of this Union, evangelical Christians, as well as Jews, whose consciences lead them to keep as holy time the seventh day of the week—Saturday: and hence to work the other six, including Sunday, the first day of the week. In harmony with the said Declaration of Rights of North Carolina, and in harmony with the Sacred Scriptures, no human authority has any right to interfere with them in this, "in any case whatever." But Sec. 3782 of the Code (Vol. II., p. 573) does interfere and forbid *every man* exercising that right under a penalty of one dollar for each offense. Thus conscientious, law-abiding citizens are left the choice of losing one-sixth of the fruits of their labor, or being considered criminals in the eyes of this law. Are men enjoying the guaranties of the Constitution while being branded as criminals by the *statutes* of the State? In other words, Is the Constitution to be made void by the statutes of the State?

Many of the best people of the State often express with great fervor the sentiment of "equal rights to all men and special favors to none;" yet there stands this law forbidding equal rights to all men and granting special favors to some. There it has stood since 1641, an unrepealed part of the Church and State system of colonial days; and can be used to bring unjust pressure upon one class of citizens to force them to conform to the wishes of another class. It can be used as a tool for persecution, as similar laws have been, and even now are being, used in other States and other countries.

How long shall it stand thus a menace to liberty in our State? It menaces not only the liberties of the man who observes the seventh day, but it restricts the liberty of every other man, by demanding the homage due only to God. It says to *every* man in North Carolina, You have no right to act for yourself in this matter; you must rest on Sunday whether you believe it is right or wrong. You have no right to change your practice even though you in all sincerity change your conscientious convictions.

He who does not now protest against this usurpation of authority, cannot be consistent in protesting, should the authority to make laws fall into the hands of Roman Catholics or infidels or any other class, and they make laws which conflict with his conscience. It is not impossible that such a change may occur.

It is not equal rights to all men to permit one class six or seven days a week in which to earn a livelihood, and say to those of another faith, You can have only five. Again, by the Word of God, the observer of the seventh day knows it wrong to pay the same respect to the first day of the week that he does to the seventh. Hence compulsion here is a restriction of conscience.

Will not the good people of North Carolina, in plain right and simple justice, demand the repeal of this unjust law? Will not the men now assembled in the legislature rise up as one man and wipe forever from the statute books of the State everything contrary to its Constitution and "Bill of Rights" which they are pledged by their oath to maintain? If not, why not?

A CITIZEN.

Raleigh, N. C., Jan. 11, 1897.
