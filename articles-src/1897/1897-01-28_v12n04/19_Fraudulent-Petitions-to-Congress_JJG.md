In the village of Mannsville, N. Y., on Sunday, Dec. 27, 1896, the pastor of the Baptist Church, at the close of the service, read the petition for the "Christian Amendment" to the Constitution, urging its indorsement, stating that if the vote was a majority, the names of the officers of the church would be placed upon it as representing the membership of the church, which consists according to the pastor's statement of one hundred and sixty members.

There was not to exceed fifty of the members present, who were thus called upon to express by vote the wishes of the whole church, to our representatives in Congress. But that is not all; when the vote was taken the writer saw only three who voted in favor of it, although there might have been two or three more whom he did not see. So here we have not to exceed a half dozen persons allowed to declare for one hundred and sixty (for there was no dissenting vote) that they are all in favor of its passage!

Is not this another expression of the doctrine of the priests in the fourth century that it is right to do evil that good may come?
