The Washington correspondent of the New York Independent says that "there is no lack of statesmen to-day, who, on occasion, would turn down the Constitution, as a once eminent member of the House did, when he said he did not know what the Constitution had to do 'between friends.'" Every one who is acquainted with the course of Government affairs, knows that this is true. Yet it is a most dangerous condition of things in a Government which professes to stand upon a written Constitution.
