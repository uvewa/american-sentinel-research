WE are informed that some of the managers of the District of Columbia Sunday bill, are trying to make capital at our expense over what they claim is a stroke in the air in our criticism of the bill.

It will be remembered that we pointed out in the bill a palpable compromise with the liquor traffic. They say that this point is vain because there is practical prohibition by law in the District of Columbia. This claim however is merely technical: because whatever this practically prohibitive law may be, it is not enforceable.

This we know from those very people themselves. The Reform Bureau of Washington, D. C., reported in the *Union Signal*, of January 7, a "Calendar of Reform Bills in Congress," and among them stands this: "Morse Bill (H R. 1888, House Report 1831), to make the liquor law of the District of Columbia enforceable."

Now we do not believe that there is practical prohibition where the law is not enforceable. A law that is not enforceable is not practical and accomplishes nothing practical. And thus the liquor traffic is rife in the District of Columbia. Those folks will have to try again before they can clear their Sunday bill of a palpable wink at the liquor traffic.
