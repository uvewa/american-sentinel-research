Now here is a saying I wish to propound,
That is worthy of study, and pleasant of sound,
A gem of a saying that somebody found,
Worth all you will pay for it, pennies or pound,—
A right is a right all around.

Right fits on a king that sits high on a throne,
Right fits on a peasant who lives all alone,
Right fits on the earth, nor will make a soul groan,
Right fits in high heaven's ethereal zone;
A right is a right all around.

When things go to pinching the weak or the strong,
There's something got in there that does n't belong,
And it does n't fit art, and it does n't fit song,
And it galls every sorrow, and aggravates wrong;
But right is a right all around.

Things get into discords, and peace goes away.
The work done by Labor has too little pay,
And Capital gloats and takes too large a sway,
Yet there's only one pattern to follow, men say,
And it's right that is right all around.

Grim Might takes full presidence over the weak,
Forbids them to act, then forbids them to speak,
Then thought is encumbered, and men may not seek,
Then Might chains itself, when it follows its freak,
But a right is a right all around.

There is law, falsely called so, to imprison the just,
There's a stench from the past with its mold and its must,
There's the shades of the martyrs from graves of their dust,
And the shriek of the lost for betrayal of trust;
But a right is a right all around.

Right gives every soul the full right of the soul,
Its own marvelous destiny still to control,
To follow all holiness on to its goal,—
The right for the one that is right for the whole,
The right that is right all around.

Right places her feet on the solid old ground,
For right is one word, one sweet word I have found
That measures up men, earth, and heaven profound,
And it's "Love," and you know it is pleasant of sound,
And it's right that is right all around.
