In our national hymn we sing,—

> "Our father's God, to thee
> Author of liberty," etc.

The truth which these words affirm—that God is the author of liberty—rests upon the fact that God is the father of the human race.

Liberty means nothing to the individual deprived of all resources. God has all resources at his command, and is therefore the real author and custodian of all liberty.

The strongest and wisest of men are not able to supply themselves with the resources necessary to a single hour of life; and without life, liberty is nothing.

Men are neither omnipotent nor omniscient. They do not provide the air they breathe, nor the water they drink. Yet it is very common for people to imagine that they can get along entirely independent of that Intelligence and Power by which these things were provided; that, indeed, they will not enjoy full liberty in any other way.

We very often see the expression "free thought," which is meant to convey the idea by those using it that no thought is free except that which springs wholly from the exercise of their own human minds.

What is there free about such thought? Thought, like an individual, is free in proportion to the extent of the range through which its powers can carry it. Is the range of "free thought" any greater than that of other thought?

Can the ignorant savage do more to extend his range of thought than the educated white man can do for him? Can finite man do more for himself in the same line than can be done for him by the infinite God?

We are the children of God. In proportion to his knowledge and power, our own abilities are far less than are the wisdom and power of an infant as compared with its parents. If we can enjoy liberty without God, the infant can do the same independently of parental care.

But the infant left to its own resources very quickly comes to grief. It is natural for it to prefer its own way to that of its parents, but its own way would lead only to disaster. Left to itself, it would soon be deprived of all liberty in any form.

But by wise parental care and instruction, the child is brought day by day into a more perfect knowledge and enjoyment of liberty. And when it has received all in this direction that its parents can give it, it can still go on indefinitely under the care of its Father in heaven. And God has fixed no limit to this process.

God would not have his children always bound by the limited powers and faculties which they possess here in this life. He designs that they shall have bodies and minds filled with an imperishable vigor. He purposes for them a continual growth in knowledge that will never end.

And with this continual expansion of the faculties, this continual enlargement of the range of their power, and therefore of their freedom, there will ever be written more clearly upon all minds the mighty truth—God the Author of liberty.
