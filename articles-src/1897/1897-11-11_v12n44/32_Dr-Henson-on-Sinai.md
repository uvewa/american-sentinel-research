Dr. P. S. Henson, of Chicago, a prominent clergyman and zealous advocate of Sunday laws, is quoted as having recently said, in justification of a series of sermons he was to preach on the ten commandments:—

"It is time that Sinai be heard from again. We have urgent need to day to consider the foundation of law, or religion, if you please. There is contempt of law all over the land. The records show an alarming and unprecedented increase of crime all over the land."

Yes; it is indeed time that the world hear again from Mt. Sinai, and nothing shows the necessity for this more than the fact that men like Dr. Henson, who stand as the instructors of the people in religious truth, teach and practice squarely contrary to the law spoken from Sinai in the vitally important matter of observing the Sabbath. For that law says, "The seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God; in it thou shalt not do any work." But the first day, and not the seventh, is the one which receives almost universal homage as the day of rest.

When lawlessness is taught from the pulpit, it is small wonder that it is practiced in the streets.
