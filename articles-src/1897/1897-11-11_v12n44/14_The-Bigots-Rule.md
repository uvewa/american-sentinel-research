THE only excuse any one can offer for employing force in religious matters is that he has a right to do to others that which he would not admit they had a right, under like circumstances, to do to him. But this is bigotry pure and simple. It is the very opposite of the Golden Rule laid down by Christ. Macaulay, in his essay on Sir James Mackintosh, has well stated the case in the following words:—

"The doctrine which, from the very first origin of religious dissensions, has been held by all bigots of all sects, when condensed into few words, and stripped of rhetorical disguise is simply this: I am right, and you are wrong. When you are the stronger, you ought to tolerate me; for it is your duty to tolerate truth. But when I am the stronger, I will persecute you; for it is my duty to persecute error."

This, we are sorry to say, is a doctrine which is quite too commonly held among both Protestants and Catholics.
