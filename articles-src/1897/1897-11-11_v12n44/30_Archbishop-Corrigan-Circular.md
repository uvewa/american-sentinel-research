In a circular which Archbishop Corrigan, the leading Catholic prelate in New York, caused to be read in all the Catholic churches on October 17, he says:—

"The signs of the times show danger signals in the fast rising flood of socialism and anarchy, and thinking men the world over find the greatest bulwark against these dangers in the conservative principles and doctrines of the Catholic Church."

Was it a mere coincidence that this circular was read a few days previous to election, one of the tickets in the field being in support of what are considered as socialist ideas. Hardly, we think, notwithstanding the oft-given assurance from the spokesmen of Rome that "the church" never has anything to do with politics. Perhaps the archbishop thought that this reading of his circular would have a suspicious appearance of being a political "deal," for it was put forth ostensibly as a reply to documents which it avers have been lately circulated teaching opposition to "politico-eclesiasticism," but which it has been ascertained were never heard of by the people before.
