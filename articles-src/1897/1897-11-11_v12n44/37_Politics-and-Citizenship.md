"HELLO, Will," exclaimed Fred Hammond one morning, upon suddenly meeting his young friend, Willie Dean. "Say," he continued, "who are you goin' to vote for? I mean," he added, recollecting that neither of them were yet of voting age, "who would you vote for if you were old enough?"

"Oh, I don't know," answered Willie, with some hesitation; "I never thought very much about politics."

It was the day before election, and political excitement was running high in the city where they lived.

"I know who I'd vote for," said Fred; "I'm a Republican," he added, with the air of one making a very important statement.

"What makes you a Republican?" Willie asked.

"Why," exclaimed Fred, "because that's the right party; my pa's a Republican, and he knows all about what to vote for."

"What does the Republican party believe?" queried Willie.

"Oh, I don't know exactly; something about the tariff, though, I guess," was Fred's answer.

"But how do you know you're a Republican, if you don't know what the party believes?"

"Well, I'm a Republican, anyway; my pa's a Republican, and that's reason enough for me."

"I don't see very much reason in that," observed Willie. "My pa's a Democrat, and he says everybody ought to vote that ticket. For my part," he added, "I never could see much use in going into politics anyway."

"Why," exclaimed Fred, in a tone of surprise, "you're not a good citizen if you don't vote. My school-teacher told us that when we had our brigade drill, the other day. He said that people who didn't vote were no better than traitors."

"Well, I don't see as voting makes much difference with that. I heard two men talking politics on the corner yesterday, and they got to disputing about it, and one of them said everybody who didn't vote the straight party ticket, as I believe he called it, was a traitor. So I guess politics doesn't save anybody from being called a traitor.

"And I should think," added Willie, after a moment's pause, "that if I voted wrong, it would be worse than if I didn't vote at all. Lots of people vote for saloons, and gambling houses, and such things. Wouldn't it be better if such people didn't vote?"

"Oh, I don't know about that," said Fred, rather dubiously. "But anyway," he added, more confidently, "that's just why good people ought to go into politics, so as to prevent the bad people from running things. I heard the minister say that in his sermon last Sunday."

"Well," observed Willie, "my mother says there are a great many more bad people in the country than good people; and I think she's right about it, too. She most always knows about anything that she talks about.

"Of course," he continued, "she didn't mean bad people such as those that murder and steal and have to be sent to jail, but people who are bad enough to vote for things that are bad,—like the saloon, you know. I guess there must be more people who want saloons than there are who don't want them, because they can't shut them up by vote, and even where they do vote to do so, they go on running just about the same."

"My pa don't believe in prohibition," observed Fred. "He says it's nobody's business what people drink."

"Neither does mine," said Willie; "but my mother does; she belongs to the Woman's Christian Temperance Union. She says everybody ought to vote for prohibition."

"I heard pa say yesterday that the prohibition vote wouldn't amount to much. Hardly anybody votes for that now," was Fred's comment.

"That's what I was saying," said Willie; "if people who don't want saloons and such things are so much fewer than the people who do want them, or who are willing to have them, I don't see how they're going to keep the bad people from running things by voting. There's got to be something to make the people better, I guess, before the government can get any better. That's what my uncle said to me the other day, and he said people couldn't be made any better by voting. He said the only way to make people better was to get them converted, and that the preachers ought to be preaching to convert people, instead of preaching to tell people how they ought to vote."

"Maybe that's so," said Fred. "I guess the preachers don't know so much about politics as they think they do; anyway, they can't preach politics out of the Bible, and I agree that they ought to stick to the Bible and let other things alone. But I'm on an errand now, and I guess I'll have to be going. Good-bye."

"Good-bye," answered Willie; "I'll see you again pretty soon," he called after Fred's retreating figure, "and I'm going to find out all I can about what are the duties of citizens. But I believe," he added to himself, "that my uncle was right when he said that people who live good lives and are kind and helpful to everybody around them, are a great deal better citizens than the people who are always talking about saving the country by their votes."
