# NEWS, NOTES AND COMMENT

"Greater New York" has held its first municipal election, and the result is the return of "Tammany" to the seat of power. There are several features of the campaign which are worthy of note.

***

In the first place, it may be observed that the chief issue of the campaign was that of popular government against government by a dictator. It seems that quite a large portion of the citizens, knowing this to be a "government of the people, by the people, and for the people," became possessed of the idea that the government of "Greater New York" ought to be run by the people of the city, instead of by a "boss," who might not even reside in the city at all. They believed, in other words, that under this government it was their natural prerogative to manage their own affairs; and they accordingly set out to do so. By way of gaining the benefits of organization, they formed a "Citizens' Union."

***

But this independent politics found itself opposed by party politics. The people were told that not their own interests, but the interests of the "party," was the first thing to be considered in their election. In other words, the election must be managed primarily for the benefit of the "party," and whether the people were to reap the benefits from it which they desired, was wholly a secondary consideration.

***

Connected with the machinery of the "party"—in this State—was a leading representative of that class, who, under the old Roman government, were known as dictators. These dictators—for whom the nomenclature of the times has supplied the term "boss"—differ from the dictators of ancient Rome in being self-appointed and irresponsible, but not greatly in the extent of their power. Not to dictate the prominent candidates to be voted for by those of his own political "faith," was of course very distasteful to the "boss." He determined that it should be made apparent that the principle of "government of the people, by the people, and for the people" does not apply to local elections. The precedent must be firmly established that no politics will be allowed to be successful which disconnects from the "party" and the party "boss."

***

Accordingly, the dictator put a ticket of his own in the field; not in the hope that any of his candidates would be elected, but solely for the purpose of defeating the audacious effort of the "citizens' union" to institute local self-government; and, incidentally, of letting the people understand that the science of politics, in this part of the country at least, has progressed beyond the point where such an effort can be successful.

***

The result was the triumphant success of the dictator form of government, under the eegis of an opposing political party. It was better that government by dictatorship should triumph, even at the sacrifice of party success, than that there should be a triumph of popular government. Such is the view of the political "boss." The man in possession of autocratic power holds that possession above every other consideration. It is not human nature to do otherwise.

***

The dictator who achieved success in the electoral contest, is a man who but recently returned to this country from a sojourn abroad, which is said to have been largely spent at the English race tracks. It seems to be getting quite the fashion for men who acquire wealth and political distinction here to make the Old World—and especially England—their recreation ground, and to spend only so much of their time in this country as is necessary for a proper attention to "business." Considering the facts which confront us, we may without any great stretch of imagination, contemplate the time when our "rulers" will return from across the water only for the purpose of dictating our politics and setting up their men in office, and having thus attended to "business," will hie them back again to the shores and society which they find more congenial to their tastes.

***

This triumph of dictatorial government was "by the people." By their votes the people deliberately sanctioned and put it into effect. And thus they have themselves proclaimed, in effect, that in this leading city of the Union, we have come in the evolution of politics to the place where "government of the people, by the people," and government by dictatorship mean one and the same thing.

***

To him who can read the signs of the times, there is in all this a plain omen of a transition through which government is rapidly passing in this country, and one which is eliminating the features of republican government and substituting in their place the features of a despotism. It is not difficult to conjecture that when the evils under which the people are suffering, and which the prevailing system of government seems rather to foster than relieve, shall have progressed beyond a certain point, the people will welcome a monarchy in some form which shall promise the needed relief. History testifies that it must be so.

The campaign of Henry George, as the representative of Jeffersonian democracy, was by no means the least striking feature of the contest. His scathing denunciation of the party "bosses" and specific charges of base veniality against well-known judges of the State courts, were in themselves extraordinary incidents. But when we consider them in connection with the extraordinary homage paid him, after his sudden death, by all classes of the people, they become still more significant. Do the people believe these charges to be true? If so, do they care anything about them? or have they ceased to feel any concern over visible corruption in the offices of public trust? If they do not believe them, why do they hold the man who so emphatically uttered them entitled to the homage of a hero-martyr?

* * *

It may not be out of place in this connection to notice some of the statements which the heat of a campaign generally brings out, relative to the duty of voting. For instance, it was urged upon the readers of one of the leading city dailies that, "If you fail to vote, you betray your trust as a citizen." What one's "trust as a citizen" is, was not specified, though it may be presumed it was considered to be too well understood to need specifying. It will be generally admitted, no doubt, that the man who lives a life which contributes to the welfare of his fellow men, contributes his just proportion to the support of the State, and by word and example contributes to the general peace and safety, and to the stability of good government, performs the part of a good citizen: But all this will be done by every true Christian, because he is such, irrespective of the question whether he is a voter or not.

* * *

But the argument put forth by this newspaper, taken in connection with certain facts, suggests one or two queries which might properly be made in reply. In almost immediate connection with it the statement was made that "the only issue [in the campaign] is between government by the people and government by dictators." This was said in view of the certainty that a great many votes would be cast for that which represented government by dictators. Now all those casting such votes were, by the argument in question, true to their trust as citizens. In other words, the fulfilment of their trust as citizens required that they should seek the overthrow of "government by the people," and the setting up of government by a dictator! It is only necessary to add that an argument which proves too much proves nothing at all.

* * *

The argument will have to be qualified so as to say not only that "if you fail to vote," but if you fail to vote the right ticket, "you betray your trust as a citizen." This is really what the statement means. But this only brings us to the question, Which one is the right ticket? Where is the infallible gospel of political salvation, the ten-commandment code of political ethics? There are a great many tickets in the field, and each one claims to represent the cause of right and justice. And as only a small proportion of citizens support any one of them, it may be said upon the authority of this argument that the great majority of citizens are unfaithful to their trust as such. But this, again, proves more than the political arguer is willing to admit.

* * *

There is only one sure way of being always true to one's trust in every sphere of life, whether that of citizenship or any other; and that is to be always a genuine Christian. Being guided by a wisdom and a Spirit infinitely higher than those of fallen humanity, the Christian makes no mistake in the side which he espouses. He is found ever on the side which tends to the elevation of his fellow men,—the side of peace, of justice, and of truth,—whether these be represented by any ticket in the political field or not.
