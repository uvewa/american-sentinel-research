The Rev. Thomas A. Hoyt, a Philadelphia pastor, on a recent Sunday preached to his congregation on the subject of Sunday desecration, and among other things (as reported in the Philadelphia Times) said:—

"If we ask ourselves if we regard this day with true reverence, will we find ourselves guiltless? Will we not find, perhaps, that we have fallen into a loose way of considering it, when Holy Scripture tells us that we should consecrate the entire day to God? Let us consider this carefully, remembering the promise of the Redeemer: 'If you keep this day holy, I will cause you to ride on the high places of the earth.'"

But what use would there be in making amends as regards the loose way of observing the day, while being so loose as regards the day itself? When one is so "loose" in observing the Sabbath commandment as not even to get hold of the right day to be observed, he is only wasting time and effort in considering remedies to be applied to the manner of its observance.
