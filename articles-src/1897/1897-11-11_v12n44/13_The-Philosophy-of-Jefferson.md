*From a Speech by the late Henry George.*

THE philosophy of Jefferson says that every man has the right to eat and drink and speak as he wishes, and this right goes as far as he does not step over upon the same rights of others.

Much harm and wrong have been done by good people who, not understanding the philosophy of Jefferson, have sought to enforce the laws of God by the laws of man. These misguided efforts have always failed. I believe that God, our Father, will take care of his laws, and all who seek to perform what he will himself take care of will get themselves and others into trouble.

The great Declaration says that all men are possessed of certain inalienable rights—the right of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. That is the democracy of Jefferson; and if the government of the people is administered under it, the wrongs and oppressions of which the people complain will flee away. My friends, the democracy of Jefferson is simply the Golden Rule—Do unto others as you would yourself be done by.
