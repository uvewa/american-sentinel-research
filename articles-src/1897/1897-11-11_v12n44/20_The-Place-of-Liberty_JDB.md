"YET know withal
Since thy original lapse, true liberty
Is lost."
—Michael to Adam, "Paradise Lost."

To me the word "liberty" has always been precious.

* The writer of this article, or address (as it was originally presented), was asked to take part upon the program of a literary society and was left to choose his own subject. He naturally chose that in which he was most interested, and has made a feeble effort to set forth a principle which he feels confident is supported both by the divine word and the record of all human experience. The subject embraces so much that an attempt to cover the ground must necessarily be but an attempt, and the reader will have to be content here with a very brief sketch—a mere synopsis. But if he desires to read in full, let him turn to history and to the Word.

It seems to possess a sweetness, a nobility, and an inspiration, that is found in no other. I think there is no heart in which it fails to awaken a response. This sentiment is confined to no country and to no age. It has been felt by men everywhere, even when they were tyrants themselves. Cicero, the orator of an arrogant and imperious class, exclaims, "O Liberty! O sound once delightful to every Roman ear!"

Men have thus shown their desire for that to which they are entitled by divine and inalienable right. Liberty—freedom from unjust restraint—is the right of every individual. No one is so unworthy that he has no claim to it, and no one is so well situated that he can afford to dispense with it.

Law, enforced by civil government, has been the means universally employed by men for the protection of their liberties. They have realized to some extent the truth that liberty is not found in lawlessness, but is the result of conformity to just laws.

Many and various have been the forms of government, and but few have appeared to give satisfaction. After long and bitter experience the world has decided that the rule of one, or of a privileged few, is incompatible with public liberty. Monarchies and aristocracies are generally regarded as synonyms of oppression. It is now the prevailing opinion of mankind that the representative system of government furnishes the true remedy. A democracy, administered by popular suffrage, combined with a reasonable degree of intelligence on the part of the people, is thought to be the conservator of liberty. No inhabitant of this country, even if he does not entertain such an opinion, has had an opportunity to remain ignorant of its existence. We have heard of the triumphs of democracy and the glories of free institutions upon every occasion. It is thought that this system annihilates despotism and strikes terror into the hearts of tyrants.

I wish first to inquire if this position is well taken. Are democracies the guardians of liberty? Do they accomplish that, in the accomplishment of which all other systems have failed? If such is the case, then we need look no further for the abode of liberty.

This system is not an untried one, nor is it one with which history is entirely unacquainted. In order to reach an intelligent conclusion, I shall make a brief examination of the four great democracies of which it speaks,—Greece and Rome, the greatest of antiquity, and France and the United States, the two most prominent of modern times.

Of the states of Greece, Sparta and Athens are most noted for their free institutions. But we find that their liberty was, for the most part, at the mercy of artful and unprincipled demagogues of the Alcibiadean type, who cared for nothing but their own elevation. To accomplish this they produced dissensions among the people, or by their eloquent appeals, persuaded them to subjugate and tyrannize over neighboring peoples. For the same purpose they stirred up a jealousy between these two states, and civil war ensued, finally resulting in the destruction of all the Grecian republics. Weakened by their own jealousies and strifes, they became an easy prey to the ambition of Philip, and soon groveled at the feet of Alexander. The Achen League was the last struggle of freedom, and then Rome declared their independence—the independence of slaves. Thus they were brought to a condition of servitude by their own selfishness and strife, and became a prey to others.

It has been said that the Romans possessed the faculty of self-government beyond any people of whom we have historical knowledge. Certain it is, that the Roman republic, covering a period of nearly five hundred years, affords lessons on the workings of popular governments to be found nowhere else. Never has the power and administration of the government resided more fully in the hands of the people. The unwritten constitution of Rome allowed the people every opportunity for asserting and maintaining their authority. They were the legislators themselves, and in their assembled capacity constituted the court of final resort. If there was ever a time when men might have demonstrated their ability to govern themselves and to establish liberty and equality upon lasting foundations, it was here. But what was the case? As long as freedom meant to them, "not freedom to do what they pleased, but what was right" in their treatment of each other, all went well. But a change came. Equality ceased to give satisfaction. Men desired more; they wished to dominate. When distinctions of birth ceased to secure the desired end, distinctions of wealth were created. "To obtain money and office became the universal passion." "The free forms of the constitution became themselves the instruments of corruption." The elections, the laws, and all the machinery of government were made to minister to the greed and ambition of individuals. Liberty and justice became mockeries. I need not here recount the internal dissensions and strife, the oppression and robbery of provinces, and the final destruction of the republic. It is sufficient to say in the language of Froude, that "a constitutional government the most enduring and the most powerful that ever existed, was put on trial and found wanting." Wanting, because men refused to grant to others what they desired for themselves, and they found the law exactly fulfilled, "With what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again." Upon the ruins of the republic arose one of the strongest and most tyrannical despotisms that ever existed. It is said that the citizens of Rome always detested the name king. But men sometimes detest themselves in others. At any rate the republic appeared to develop no end of Tarquins, who came little behind him in cruelty.

Nowhere has the doctrine of equality and the rights of the people been asserted with greater vehemence and carried to greater lengths in theory than in the French Republic which arose from the ruins of the Bourbon monarchy. Yet, at the same time, in no democracy has there been less freedom for the individual. Under the rule of the sovereign mob "came those days when the most barbarous of all codes was administered by the most barbarous of all tribunals; when no man could greet his neighbor or say his prayers without danger of committing a capital offense." Liberty and license became synonymous, and the most sanguinary of all despotisms reigned under the mild and innocent quaternion, "virtue, fraternity, liberty, and equality." Madame Roland, on ascending the scaffold, exclaimed, "O liberty! what crimes are committed in thy name!"

It did not take long to reach the same result there that came to the states of Greece and the republic of Rome. The golden age of Pericles was succeeded by the absolute sway of Alexander; the free institutions of Rome made way for the oppression of the Caesars; and now the "rights of man" were centered in one man, and Napoleon became dictator of France.

The history of France from the overthrow of the monarchy to the establishment of the first empire, though short, contains the story of every democracy. In the short space of a few years are crowded the lessons of centuries. It affords a complete example of the working of human nature and its inevitable result, which is bound to appear sooner or later in any government, however free be its institutions.
