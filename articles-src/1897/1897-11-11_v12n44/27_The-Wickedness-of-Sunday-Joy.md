"New York Sun."

The law under which a number of Harvard students were arrested for playing golf on Sunday reads as follows: "Whoever is present at a game, sport, play, or public diversion, except a concert of sacred music or an entertainment given by a religious or charitable society, the proceeds of which, if any, are to be devoted exclusively to a religious or charitable purpose, upon the Lord's day, shall be punished by a fine not exceeding $5." It is clear from this that the supreme test of the impropriety lies in this—if the culprit is enjoying himself, he is doing wrong; if he isn't, it is all right.
