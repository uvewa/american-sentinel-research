It has been painfully amusing to witness the tenacity with which the various candidates in the city election just held here grasped at "straws" in the hope of strengthening their chances of election. One of these was the official announcement by one of the leading "reformer" candidates that the people of the city, in case of his election, would be treated to a "liberal Sunday." This was a bid for the foreign element who have in some instances rather lax ideas in regard to Sunday observance.
