"Sabbath Recorder," November 1.

The Christian Endeavor societies of Illinois lately held a convention in Chicago. It represented thirty-four denominations, the "Disciples" leading, as to the number of societies represented. In the matter of resolutions the convention "lamented the vast amount of Sabbath desecration" in Illinois and elsewhere, and yet these same "Disciples" who formed so prominent a factor in the convention are untiring in teaching no-Sabbathism. It is their ever ready weapon against God's law and his Sabbath. Having thus done what they can to ignore God in the matter, they "resolve" to "lament" the desecration of Sunday!! How wise and consistent!
