In the due course of events we seem to have reached the time when it is again in order to announce the discovery of an "authentic" document of supreme historic interest; and accordingly we are informed that there has just been found, in the famous library of the Vatican, the "long-lost report" of Pontius Pilate covering the events relating to the crucifixion, and from which it appears that if Pilate had only secured some much-needed reinforcements one day sooner than he did, the crucifixion would not have happened. It is a very interesting document, beyond a doubt; but perhaps the Vatican would be willing to part with it for a sufficient cash consideration.
