"Bible Echo," Melbourne, Aus.

That there is great moral declension at the present time few will deny. Lying, theft, murder, and adultery are rampant everywhere. But the true cause of this state of things few understand, and the remedy for it is not discerned by many.

Some, as the National Scripture Education League, of Victoria, attribute the growing immorality to the fact that religion is not taught in the state schools. But this is plainly not the cause, for where it is taught in the state schools precisely as they demand it, as in New South Wales, crime is on the increase as well as where it is not so taught.

The real trouble is, religion does not dwell in the hearts of the people, and therefore it is not taught by the parents to their children in their homes. The parents themselves are lawless, and have not the fear of God in their hearts, and their sins and sinful neglect are appearing in their children.

If there was home religion, no one would have any occasion to talk about state religion. Home religion means something. State religion is a sham. Home religion means personal religion. State religion is an attempt to make men religious by wholesale and without any conviction or conversion on the part of the people individually.
