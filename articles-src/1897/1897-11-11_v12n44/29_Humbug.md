"WHENEVER Sabbath-breaking is punished, it is on the ground that Sunday is a day of rest established by the state—not by the church—and that its violation interferes with their day of rest by other citizens."—News and Courier, Charleston, S. C.

The statement is absurd. In ninety-nine cases out of one hundred where arrests are made for violation of the Sunday law there has been no disturbance of any citizen's rest. The rest theory is a pretext for enforcing a law of the church by the machinery of the state. It disturbs no person's rest when a man plows in his field, or sells goods in his store, or goes hunting in the woods, or offers fruit or gimcracks for sale upon the street. . . . A law designed to promote rest would prohibit work and the running of machinery at night, not on Sundays.
