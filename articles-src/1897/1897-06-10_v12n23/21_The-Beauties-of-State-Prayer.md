Press dispatches from Springfield, Ill., under date of June 3, mentioned the following:

"The chaplain of the House, the Rev. David G. Bradford, opened proceedings to-day in the State legislature with the following prayer:

"'Almighty God, we seek thy presence and blessing at the beginning of another day's diligent labor. Help us, we pray thee, in the discharge of this day's duties. Help these men to remember the poor, tax-burdened people of this great State.

"'Contract, we pray thee, the capacious maw of the penal reformatory, charitable and educational institutions of Illinois. May they learn to be content with less money, and may we, who refuse to worship a golden calf, refuse also to worship gold in any other form.

"'Forbid that any foreigner visiting our shores shall ever again have occasion to write:

"'Money, money, is all their cry;

'Money's the total sum.

'Give us money or else we die,

'Oh, let the money come.'

"'And we will ever give thee endless praise. Amen.'

"This prayer was greeted with enthusiastic applause."
