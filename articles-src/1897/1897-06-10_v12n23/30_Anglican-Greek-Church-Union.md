**Having** failed in her effort for reunion with Rome, the Anglican Church has engaged in a movement for union with the Greek Church, in the interests of which the Archbishop of York has recently made a visit to Russia. Of this the Moscow correspondent of the London Standard says:—

"The visit of Dr. Maclagan has aroused among all classes of society in Moscow an interest amounting to enthusiasm. One of the most popular local papers remarks that, rightly understood, the visit means more for the Orthodox Russians than even the Greco-Turkish war.

The union of the Greek and Anglican churches has been the topic of conversation of late, and whatever be the practical result of such a movement, no doubt such a union has been advanced a step by the cordial reception given everywhere to the Archbishop of York."
