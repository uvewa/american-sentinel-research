The N. Y. Christian Advocate, in making mention of the late report of the New York Sabbath Committee, says: "The efforts to maintain the civil Sunday cannot be understood apart from the labors of this committee. It is no exaggeration to state that whatever is preserved to us of order and Sabbath decorum in this city of New York is mainly due, under God, to the wisdom and energy of the New York Sabbath Committee."

It would have been much to the point if the Advocate had pointed out what logical connection there can be between God and a "Sabbath" committee, and the preservation of a "civil" Sunday.
