There is reported to be a great surplus in the ministry of the Protestant church, no less than four hundred applications having been received for one pulpit in New York City. Nevertheless there is no surplus in the number who are preaching the glad tidings of salvation to sinners, or who are ministering to their unfortunate fellow-beings in the name of Jesus Christ.
