We fear that those of us who have been looking for the speedy disarmament of the nations, and the settlement of international difficulties by arbitration, are far in advance of the times. For if the present conduct of Greece, Turkey and Spain teaches any lesson at all, it is that the desire to fight is that which nations will sacrifice most to gratify, and the power to fight the last element of national life which they lose. Here are three nations practically bankrupt, and with every inducement to maintain peace and devote their energies to productive labor. Yet on a provocation to war, which with each could have been avoided by small compromises which would not have greatly affected national pride, they place on their frontiers within a few weeks, or send over sea, armies varying in number from 100,000 to 200,000 men. It is not true to say that this is the work of the governments alone, which regard themselves as trustees, and so must be keenly self-regarding as respects national honor. For the peoples are quite as ready to fight, and at the first summons forsake their avocations and join the colors, though they know that they will have nothing save gratification of the fighting instinct for their pay.
