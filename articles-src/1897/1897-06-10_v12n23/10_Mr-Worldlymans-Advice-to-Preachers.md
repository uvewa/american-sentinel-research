In the *Herald and Presbyter*, of May 26, "Mr. Worldlyman" writes a "Letter to Preachers," which may explain why the Church is getting into such close touch with the world, and is striving so earnestly to get possession of worldly power. The letter runs as follows:

"Don't preach first principles all the time. It may be a good sermon, old-fashioned, not up to the times. It is what the people do not care to hear. This humdrum of faith, repentance and baptism, and add to your faith virtue, and to virtue knowledge, and to knowledge temperance, and to temperance patience, and to patience godliness, and to godliness brotherly kindness, and to brotherly kindness charity,' is old, and sounds like fault-finding. We are none of us perfect, but we do not want to be told of it all the time. We are doing as well as we can, living about as well as most folks, and our church is as good as anybody's for all that I can see, and I don't know that it is any better. We can read about those things in the Bible if we want to. Give us something new and startling that will please and draw the crowd.

"Our preachers must not be, nor teach their congregations that they are to be, a peculiar people; but they must be like other folks. Just to think, the idea of being a peculiar people, a holy nation, a chosen generation, called out of darkness into light; a people of God, having obtained mercy, and abstaining from worldly lusts which war against the soul; speaking and living honestly, endeavoring to glorify God in our bodies and spirits, which are his. How absurd! How far behind the spirit of the age and the aspirations of the present time. How old, foggish it looks and sounds. Why, the preacher of today must have some theatrical get-up about him. He must strike attitudes in his pulpit, instead of sin and spiritual wickedness in high places; use a few high-sounding words and phrases, such as 'We must be in touch all along the line;' 'The Fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man.'

"Tell people something that interests them. If they hear a passage repeated that seems to justify them in something they want to do, it pleases them. 'Does it not say in the Bible there is a time to dance?' Get very much interested in anything that seems to favor them in the way they desire to go. Tell some witty story to cause a laugh, and you will take. Touch very lightly on Bible teachings and Bible principles, especially the teachings of Christ through his apostles. Talk about higher criticism and an educated ministry, and when you were in college; preach about this great universe, sun, moon and stars; come down to earth once in a while and talk about the wonderful inventions of men—what great things they are doing in these days of steam, telegraph, telephone and electricity.

"This is a great world and we are a great people. The Bible is a great book, wonderful, considering the age in which it was gotten up, but is hardly up to the times. Criticise it as the teachings of men, and when you find anything that does not just correspond with your views, just say: 'Paul was an old bachelor, and did not like the women any way, or had dyspepsia, and did not know what was the matter with him. Peter got the blues, and James had the gout.' Make it sound funny.

"What were Peter, Paul, James or John compared with the men who occupy the pulpits at the present day? Can not the people go to Christ to-day without their instruction—Christ and the Spirit, not the gospel? Smite your breast and cry, 'Christ within!' These men are good, no matter whether they have obeyed the gospel or not; they are honest and sincere, and it does not seem right to tell them they have not obeyed the Master. Preach a goody-goody kind of salvation that will please the people; leave the gospel of Christ and his salvation therein taught out of the question, and you may take the world, or at least the world will take you, in this craze of interdenominationalism, singing: 'The world for Christ, and Christ for the world, with the Christ left out.'"
