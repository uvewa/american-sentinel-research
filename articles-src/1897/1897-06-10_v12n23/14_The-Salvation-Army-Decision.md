Commander Booth Tucker, of the Salvation Army, has been convicted in a New York City court of maintaining a public nuisance and of keeping a disorderly house. The "disorderly house" in question is the Salvation Army headquarters in West Fourteenth St., New York City; and the "nuisance" consists of the protracted evening meetings regularly conducted there in the peculiar manner with which the "Army" have made the public familiar.

The "Commander" has issued a statement in which he denounces his conviction as being an invasion of liberty of conscience and an instance of flagrant persecution, without any warrant of law.

That the prosecutors in this case were actuated to some degree at least by malicious motives, seems evident from the nature of the charge which they have succeeded in substantiating in the lower court. The term "disorderly house" has acquired a definite meaning in the public mind which would be most untrue and slanderous as applied to the meeting hall of the Salvation Army.

Doubtless there is less disorder, even in the strictest sense of the term, in a meeting like those complained of than characterizes the all night revels which are frequently to be noted as a feature of life in "high society."
