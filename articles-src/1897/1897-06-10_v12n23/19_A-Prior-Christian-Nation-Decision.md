In a recent issue of the *New York Journal*, Mr. A. H. Lewis points out that the Supreme Court decision of February, 1892, that the United States is a Christian nation, is not the first decision made in a court of law on this subject, but that as far back as 1813 a decision was rendered which affirmed just the opposite of that of 1892. The circumstances are given as follows:

"The time was 1813; the scene a town on the Barbary coast. An American privateer put in with three hapless British ships as prizes. The privateer turned over the three captured Britons to Mordecai Noah, afterward high sheriff of New York, and incidentally a newspaper partner of James Watson Webb—then American agent or consul-general to the Barbaries. The privateer wanted the prizes hawked off at public outcry; the Yankee captain hungered for the money he had fought for.

"But the British minister there stationed objected. He pulled a treaty on the Bey of Tunis, who was about to authorize the sale—the Bey, by the way, was to get 20 per cent. This treaty which had been made between the Bey and Great Britain distinctly recited that in event of a war between England and 'any other Christian nation' neither side should be permitted the Barbary ports as a theatre of sale for prizes.

"Noah admitted the treaty, but contended that the United States was not a 'Christian nation,' and didn't fall within the terms of the treaty. Noah showed the Bey our Constitution—our bill of rights. He invoked his olive-colored admiration to the fact that we had no national church, and that Christian, Jew (Noah was a Jew), and Mohammedan, were alike equally free in the enjoyment of every American privilege.

"Therefore, claimed Noah, the United States could not be called a 'Christian nation,' . . . It took the Bey ten minutes to decide with Noah. The United States was not a 'Christian nation.' The British minister was turned down, the prizes were sold, the wise Bey got his rake-off of 20 per cent. of that auction's proceeds, and the decision itself was never attacked. It stands to this day."

In 1813 the Constitution was better known and appreciated than it is to day.
