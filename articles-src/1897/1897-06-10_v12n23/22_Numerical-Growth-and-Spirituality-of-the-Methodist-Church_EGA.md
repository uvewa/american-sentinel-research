So far as numbers may give evidence there has been an almost steady progress. In 1872 there were 76 annual conferences; in 1897, 124; in 1872, in round numbers, and including those on trial, 9,000 effective ministers; now more than 14,000. In 1872 there were 1,400,000 church members and probationers; now there are 2,800,000; in 1872 less than 1,300,000 Sunday school pupils, now more than 2,600,000; in 1872, 13,000 churches, valued at $57,000,000; now 26,000, valued at $109,000,000, with a parallel increase in parsonages and their value.

Has the spiritual life of the Church kept pace with this increase of its numbers, property and gifts, with this extension of its area, with this multiplication of its agencies?

An easy optimism would fain answer, "Yes," but an easy optimism is not admissible in a time of transition like this, when a strenuous, perhaps a narrow, interpretation of the moral law is giving place in many quarters to a perilous laxity, as, for instance, touching Sabbath observances, amusements and selfish extravagances; when the Bible is undergoing a critical and in many cases an indifferent or hostile questioning.—From address delivered at the 25th anniversary of his ordination. New York Herald, May 24.
