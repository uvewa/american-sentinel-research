On the question of the danger of losing the Sabbath an exchange makes this pertinent comment: "Our Sabbath in danger" is the note of alarm sounded by the clergy. The Sabbath will not be in danger so long as nobody is prohibited from keeping it. As for Sunday, the indications are that it will continue to recur once a week for some time to come."
