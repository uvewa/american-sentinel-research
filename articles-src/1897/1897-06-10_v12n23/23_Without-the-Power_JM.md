It is positively painful to see the substitutes that are being tried to-day for the power of the Holy Ghost. Miserable substitutes are they all! One church is trying this plan, another that, and not one of them has found a new plan that is a permanent success. They are floundering, and some of them are foundering, and no wonder.

It will be no loss to the kingdom of God if churches which ignore the Holy Ghost should founder. Let us get back to Pentecostal methods. The trouble is that the churches have lost their way to that "upper room."—From "The Spirit-Filled Life." Copyrighted by Fleming H. Revell Co.
