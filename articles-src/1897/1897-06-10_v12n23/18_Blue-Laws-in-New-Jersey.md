Laws that are deeply, darkly, but not beautifully blue still guard the coasts of New Jersey. It is not lawful there to try to avert danger to life and limb on the sabbath day, as the Erie Railroad people found out this week when they set a gang of men to work at a level crossing where the ground was found to be unsafe. The Mayor, the Aldermen, the Street Superintendent, and Mr. Dogberry were hurriedly got together, and the watch was directed to arrest all the "vagrom men" who had so outraged the feelings of New Jersey. This was done, and the laborers, having been brought before a justice, were let out on bail. It is entirely lawful to employ men in blue to enforce Blue Laws, but not to endeavor to prevent the town being painted red by some appalling catastrophe on a railway line. These good Jersey people read the Bible, but only, it appears, with one eye open.
