IN Topeka, Kans., after twelve years of freedom from open saloons, the State prohibitory law has been defied by the opening of an attractive saloon in the principal street of the city. A mass meeting of citizens called to consider the situation adopted resolutions calling upon the governor to remove the Topeka police commissioners, and demanding the prosecution of all violators of the law. It is public sentiment that determines whether a law shall be enforced or not; and right public sentiment can come only from the education of the public in the principles of self government.
