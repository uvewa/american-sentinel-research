From a Memorial Day oration delivered in Educational Hall at Point Pleasant, N. J., 19 Mr. H. B. Maurer.

If General Grant, upon an occasion like this, could say, "Leave the matter of religion to the family altar, the church and the private school supported entirely by private contribution; keep the Church and State forever separate," it surely will not be unfit or inappropriate for me to give, in this presence expression to similar sentiments; nor do I with any degree of reluctance go further than did he, when I declare that such an absolute divorce of Church and State, as is the boast of some, is not yet here a reality. As long as there are certain laws upon our statute books, and as long as there are in vogue certain customs, there remains here, so far as those laws and customs savor of it, that unholy alliance which has ever proved, wherever tried, a detriment to religion and a curse to the people.

In justification of them, the advocates of such laws and the champions of such customs, deny that there is here a union of Church and State, and explain the presence of those things among us, of which we, the advocates of religious liberty in its fullest plenitude, complain, as a union of the State and Christianity; but this nation never can be, according to the principles of primitive Christianity, on the one hand, and the principles of the Constitution of the United States on the other, a government of Christians, by Christians and for Christians—the remarkable decision of the U. S. Supreme Court, that this is a Christian nation, notwithstanding—but can only and always be, according to the definition that could emanate only from such a mind as that of the immortal Lincoln, "A government of the people, by the people and for the people." Therefore any law or custom, that infringes upon the rights of conscience of the humblest citizen, is in contravention of the principles of true religion and sound Americanism, be such a citizen an Adventist or atheist, Baptist or Buddhist, Congregationalist or Confucionist, Methodist or Musselman, Papist or Presbyterian, and so on down the alphabet to Unitarian or Universalist.

I am neither an attitudinarian, a platitudinarian, nor a latitudinarian, but a very decided Baptist, and will not hesitate to make my convictions known as such on all proper occasions—such occasions only however where no one is obliged to listen to my sentiments involuntarily. This being my view of the matter under consideration, I am opposed to the use of the Bible in the public schools, prayers in legislative assemblies and religious features of any kind in institutions of all kinds maintained at public expense, defrayed by the compulsory payment of taxes by men of all faiths and no faith. I am most emphatically opposed to that liberty of conscience which those prate about who favor religious liberty for all so long as the other fellow's conscience is what they think a conscience ought to be. I resent all definitions of sectarianism which are confined to Christianity only, for there is sectarianism as to religionists outside of Christianity; for as against the Catholic, all Protestantism's distinctive teachings or interpretations is sectarianism; as against the Jew, the distinctive teachings of both these Christian systems is sectarianism; as against the pagan, all religion, whether revealed in the New or Old Testament or both, is sectarianism; and as against the freethinker, religion from any source is sectarian.

Since Christ's kingdom is not of this world,—since Jesus expressed such sentiments as these: "If any man hear my words and believe not, I judge him not;" "Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's;" since a nation is defined to be "a people or community associated together under one civil government; an aggregation of a people of a common stock,"—I must accord to all, as a member of Christ's kingdom and an individual in a nation, the same religious privileges I enjoy; and if by proper persuasion I cannot win others over to my way of thinking in religion matters, I certainly can never do so by coercion. All history shows that compulsory measures in religion react unfavorably upon those who resort to them; so to say the least, they are as unwise and impolitic as they are unjust and unfair, and therefore unchristian and un American.

Rights of conscience are to-day violated in our country by reason of religious laws, practiced in our land, which must soon demand attention. The question of slavery is settled, thanks to you, old soldiers, and in that Civil War, brought fresh to our memories by these recurring anniversaries, the question of human slavery was settled for the whole world,—since the emancipation of slaves has gone on in every land, save in some portions of Africa. But, in a higher sense, men are not free, and when I say this, I have not Russia, the land of intolerance, in mind; nor Germany and England, with their union of Church and State, but this Union, the dissolution of which you have prevented and rendered for all time indissoluble, let us hope. Here men are not free, and in connection with this assertion, I shall bring to your attention the burning shame of the nineteenth century.

Do you know that within the last three years men have been imprisoned in our southern States for conscience' sake—because they could not conform their conduct to certain laws, conformity to which meant to them violation of conscience? I have the reprint of a photograph taken of a chain-gang at work in Tennessee. Seven of its number—fine, stalwart-looking men, with their long flowing beards, gentle countenances and patriarchal appearance—working in the same gang with despicable criminals! It makes my blood boil to think of it. I tremble with excitement; it is a wonder that the inanimate stones do not cry out against these atrocities; and yet, while preachers vehemently denounce prize-fights, and temperance advocates become frenzied in damning the rum-seller, while with telescopic sympathy our hearts bleed for the famine-stricken of India, the massacred of Armenia, the fool-hardy Greeks, and the struggling Cuban patriots; while to-day we pardonably pride ourselves upon having freed 4,000,000 of slaves,—it is only in a few spasmodic instances that voices are heard in exposure and condemnation of the outrages upon those who have their natural, God-given, inalienable rights to freedom in matters of faith trampled upon.

To the disgrace of my own denomination, I must say it—my denomination, the first always in its advocacy of religious liberty—when there was in session in the State of Georgia a convention of its young people, one of our leading and highly honored preachers and authors attempted to have that body pass resolutions condemning those outrages, and failed. Must every prominent religious body, which once fought for religious rights, when such rights are gained, austerely deny them to others? Great combinations are forming for the perpetuation of the laws and for more legislation that will make such outrages still more possible. The Christian Endeavors, the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, the American Sabbath Union, the National Reform party and kindred organizations are all clamoring for more legislation to enslave the human conscience.

You cannot have a law without a penalty; and the enforcement of any religious law, and the infliction of its penalty when violated, cannot be anything less than religious persecution. The State must inevitably again lapse to those barbaric times, when it was the all-powerful agency at the beck and call of religious fanatics to carry out their hell-conceived schemes.

Keep the Church and State, even to the last degree, forever separate. Baptists should ever be mindful of the words of our leading organ, *The Examiner and National Baptist*, which in its issue of Feb. 15, 1894, said:—

"We wonder that the very stones do not cry out against such travesties of justice, that Christian men do not lift up their voices in protest against this wicked perversion of religion, this insult to the name of Christ. And, in particular, why do not Baptists, whose fathers stood against the world for soul liberty, make themselves heard when these relics of medieval bigotry and persecuting intolerance are found in our free country? Sunday laws like those found in Tennessee and Maryland are a disgrace to a Christian commonwealth in this nineteenth century, and should be repealed at the earliest possible moment."

And they should be mindful of this clarion note of warning of that paragon among our preachers, C. H. Spurgeon:—

"I should be afraid to borrow help from government; it would look to me as if I rested on the arm of flesh, instead of depending on the living God. Let the Lord's day be respected by all means; and may the day soon come when every shop shall be closed on the Sabbath, but let it be by force of conviction and not by force of policemen; let true religion triumph by the power of God in men's hearts and not by the power of fines and punishments."

—Quoted in the Australian Sentinel, March, 1895.
