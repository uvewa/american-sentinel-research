Says the *New York Observer*, of May 20, in speaking of the Turkish triumph over Greece; "It makes one rage to say it, but barbarism has triumphed through the sheer ineptitude of Christian powers. Its victory is marked by the groans of all Christians in southeastern Europe."

The *Observer* is mistaken. There is no more reason why one should "rage" over the triumph of Turkey in the war, than over the triumph of Greece had that been the result of the fighting. The "barbarism" of the affair is in the war itself, and barbarism triumphed when hostilities begun. Going to war is itself a demonstration of the barbarism of any nation that does it. The so-called "Christian powers" are as fair exponents of barbarism in the use of their armies and fleets as is Turkey in her war with Greece.
