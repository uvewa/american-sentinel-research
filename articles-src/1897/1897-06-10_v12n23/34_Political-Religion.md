EX-POSTMASTER-GENERAL WANAMAKER, says the Union Signal, predicts the advent of a new political party, as a result of "the low state to which the political religion of the nation was brought by unscrupulous bosses." It cannot be denied that the "political religion" of the nation is in a "low state;" but the very nature of this "religion" precludes it from attaining to any other plane of activity than a low one; while the "unscrupulous bosses" appear to be a necessary adjunct of every successful political party. A new party can give no permanent relief to the situation, because it is not a remedy that can reach the seat of the difficulty. It is useless to try to lift politics above the level of human nature.
