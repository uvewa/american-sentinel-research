At last the royal dictum of imperial New Jersey has gone forth. It is vicious and immoral to ride a bicycle on Sunday, unless to church.

Justice Collins, of Westfield, has said it.

A Westfield man was riding his wheel Sunday. He was run down and injured by another wheelman and brought suit before Justice Collins. The Justice, looking over his spectacles, shook his head.

"You were violating the State law in riding on Sunday for pleasure," said the Solomon. "You have no right to sue for damages." And the Westfield man went away and wept.
