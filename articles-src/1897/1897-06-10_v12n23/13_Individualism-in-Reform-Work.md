Concerning the necessity of individualism as the basis of true reformatory work, Mr. Charles Booth, of London, who has made a special study of the social and moral condition of the people in that city, testifies that "almost every social and economic question . . . derives its ultimate practical importance from a more widely spread and more human care for the individual," and that the hope of uplifting the fallen lies not in State enterprise or Collectivism, but in "the reform of the individual by the individual."
