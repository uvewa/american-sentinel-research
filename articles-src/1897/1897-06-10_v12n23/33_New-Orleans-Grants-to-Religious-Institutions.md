A RECENT ruling made by Judge Righter, of the District Court of New Orleans, in a case which attacked the right of the city to make grants of public money to denominational institutions, holds that the fact that the grants of money were made to more than one institution renders them non-sectarian. This is on the principle that two wrongs make a right, or that an evil ceases to be an evil by being multiplied.
