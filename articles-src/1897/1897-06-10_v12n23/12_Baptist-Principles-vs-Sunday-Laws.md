From "Baptist Principles of Religious Liberty," by Geo. B. Wheeler.

1. SUNDAY laws had their origin in a union of Church and State.
2. They were enacted to enforce the observance of a church dogma.
3. They have been perpetuated by church influence, and are therefore religious in origin, nature, and object.
4. They are used to persecute conscientious dissenters.
5. They attempt to enforce a religious observance which pertains to the first table, contrary to Baptist principles.
6. They meddle with religion and matters of conscience contrary to the spirit of Christianity.
7. They were opposed by Roger Williams.
8. They discriminate in favor of the doctrine of one church and against the faith of another.
9. They have, between Sept. 29, 1885, and Dec. 31, 1896, imprisoned 41 conscientious Christians for a total of 1722 days.
10. They have driven 12 Christian men in the chain-gang of Tennessee for a total of 445 days.
11. They have been used by persons calling themselves Baptists, to imprison their dissenting Sabbatarian neighbors, and to drive them into the chain-gang.
12. These cruel persecutions have been defended and encouraged by papers bearing the Baptist name.
13. Sunday laws are not based by their advocates on the idea that one day in seven is needed for recreation from continuous toil, since Sunday-law advocates attempt to prohibit all innocent recreation on that day.
14. Sunday laws would be sumptuary laws, even if it could be proved that they were civil instead of religious, since they would attempt to dictate to the citizen when and how he should employ his time for his physical good.
15. Sunday laws and liquor laws are not alike, since the first seeks to protect the "holy day" from "desecration," while liquor laws seek to protect the man against his liquor-maddened fellowman.
16. Sunday laws attempt to compel men to act outwardly as though they believed the day holy, whether they do or not.
17. Sunday laws attempt to compel Seventh-day observers to treat Sunday with the same outward regard that they pay to the Sabbath of the Lord, thus compelling them to break down the distinction which the Lord commands men to make between the Sabbath and other days of the week.
18. Sunday laws therefore conflict with the conscientious convictions of seventh-day observers, just as laws requiring Baptists to sprinkle their children conflicted with the conscientious convictions of Baptists in the early days of New England.
19. Sunday-law advocates to-day declare that seventh-day observers are not persecuted when imprisoned for failure to observe Sunday, just as the persecutors of Baptists once declared that it was not persecution to imprison a Baptist for refusing to have his child sprinkled.
20. Sunday laws prohibit both work and recreation, thus compelling idleness which is productive of crime.
21. God commands cessation from work on the Sabbath, but this command contemplates a "holy" use of a "holy" day, which can only be secured by making the man holy—something which God can do, but which human law cannot accomplish.
22. Sunday laws are papal in principle in that they are a part of that policy which declares that the State should enforce conformity to church doctrines.
23. Baptists have always taught that Christianity was possessed of enough inherent power to stand without the support of human law; yea, even against it.
24. Agitation for Sunday legislation is increasing in the same proportion that the spiritual power of the church is decreasing,—a parallel to the condition of the popular church in the days of Constantine.
