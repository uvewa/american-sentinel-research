When Mr. Blackstone wrote his famous "Commentaries," on English law, the union of Church and State in his country was much closer—much more of a reality, and less of a form—than it is now. The conception of mutual agency as a characteristic of the relation between the two was thoroughly implanted in the minds of the learned, as well as the illiterate. It was, indeed, a postulate of thought, everywhere, something not to be debated, or examined into, but to be accepted, as a matter of course, like the changes of the seasons, or the ebbing and flowing of the tides.

RARE is the mind that rises above the zeitgeist or "time-spirit" of its age. There was once a Man who did this, and they crucified Him. And years afterward, following His teaching and example, there was one Roger Williams, and him they banished into the wilderness, to starve or freeze, as the case might be. Perhaps we should not be too severe on Mr. Justice Blackstone, because to soar into a purer atmosphere of thought and perception than that by which he was immediately surrounded, was a task beyond his powers. None can deny his intellectual brilliancy; but moral strength and independence are by no means the invariable accompaniments of high mental development.

But to attack ideas is not to vilify or depreciate men. These last are in themselves but instruments whereby ideas are propagated, and commended to the favor of humanity. Men come and men go; ideas, once enunciated, never die; they may affect fewer persons as the ages roll along; they are modified, threshed over, put into new shapes, as circumstances change; they are sometimes apparently ignored for a while, or supplanted by their own progeny—by other ideas which they have suggested, and brought into effective being; but their essential attribute is immortality, and they breed forever and ever.

* * *

AND, as men are but the channels through which ideas are conveyed to other men, there is no real common measure of value between the man and the idea. In the great Republic of Thought, all men are equal, as well as free. Truth, which is the only law of the mind's domain, is no respecter of persons. Before her august tribunal, every abstract proposition is tried, and stands or falls according to its merits alone. However able and exalted the advocate, however keen and subtle his argument, however clever the disguise in which a fallacious doctrine may be decked out, the remorseless "Roentgen ray" of right reason is turned on, and casuistry is detected and condemned.

This is not the teaching of Loyola. The great "Saint" Ignatius was fond of his famous theory of "probability." He held that there were many cases in which we might safely accept certain things as true, not because they commended themselves to our individual judgment, but merely because of the source from which the assertions came. "You might, yourself, be inclined to doubt this, if it appeared in a book by an unknown author, or if it was told you by a person whose character for discrimination and sincerity you esteemed to be lower than your own, or at least no higher; but you will be fully justified in accepting it, notwithstanding your private doubts, as a matter which is probably true, if you get it from a person whom you concede to be more learned and more intelligent than you are, and whose candor you regard as unimpeachable"—such is the substance of Ignatius Loyola's doctrine of "probability," if I apprehend it aright.

* * *

Now this doctrine of "probability" pervades our jurisprudence to an amazing extent. It is so rooted in many legal minds that ridicule is the reward of him who questions the conclusions of certain eminent jurists, when he is not visited with the scorn and wrath that "blasphemy" awakens among men of another stripe. "Who are you, to question the verity of a principle indorsed by such a man as Mr. Justice Blackstone? Who are you, that you set yourself up as a critic, and doubter, when Judge Marshall has made his ruling, or the great Story has formulated his theory of the Constitution? Do you suppose it is probable that you are right, and such men as these are wrong? Are you so vain and presumptuous as to imagine that such a thing is even possible?"

I HAVE suffered before now, in my time, from the animus which finds expression in such interrogatories as are here given, and I am afraid I am likely to suffer again. But it cannot be helped. I must insist upon it, that, if the race is to get any profit whatever out of the continuous battle of ideas, it is essential that every proposition shall be analyzed, dissected, weighed, considered, debated, and accepted or rejected per se, and utterly irrespective of the source from which it emanates. There is no quality of intelligence or morals, high or low, about the preacher which affords any final reason for either accepting or rejecting what he says. A scoundrel may evolve a sound moral proposition; a fool may utter a wise thing; a profound philosopher may sometimes chance to drivel.

APPROACHING Mr. Blackstone, then, with all due respect for his extensive learning and his remarkably clear and accurate way of setting out his matter, yet with no awe of his grandeur, and no predisposition whatever to adopt his conclusions simply for the reason that they happen to be his, rather than somebody else's, we can see, readily enough, many fallacies in his work, and can appreciate the infinite harm which he has done to the English-speaking race by giving to those fallacies the sanction of his high authority. The fact that his book is still used and recommended in nearly every law-school in this country renders it practically a modern work, and perpetuates its capacity for misleading and mischief-making.

* * *

It is Mr. Justice Blackstone who talks to our boys about law—*human law*, we must bear in mind—as having "her seat in the bosom of God." This is nonsense, of course; but in the "Commentaries" it is nonsense of a particularly dangerous and objectionable kind. And it is nonsense which is quoted frequently in our time, and is embodied in a certain legal distinction which has received the indorsement of the highest courts of the United States. It is, in fact, the nonsense of the union of Church and State, which finds expression in the classification of human actions, as taken cognizance of by human criminal law, into the *malum prohibitum*, and the *malum in se*. The *malum in se* is the thing which is wrong *in itself*—as, for example, stealing, murder, etc.; the *malum prohibitum* is the thing which is wrong only because the law forbids it—as shooting birds "out of season," bringing goods into one country from another without paying a government "duty," or importation tax, etc. In other words, things of the first class are immoral, as well as illegal; things of the second class are illegal—query, also immoral?

* * *

A vast deal of curious erudition has been accumulated around this classification. For example, it is an established general principle that ignorance of the law excuses nobody. This principle, however, it may appear to conflict with the actual practice of arguing the law, and taking appeals from courts of inferior jurisdiction, is a principle of absolute necessity; for, as we can never ascertain with any degree of certainty what a man knows or does not know, it is impossible to allow the plea of ignorance to be regarded as a defense against a criminal charge. But it has been said that where an act is only an offense against an express statute, and thus *malum prohibitum*, without being, at the same time, *malum in se*, a jury may take into consideration how far actual knowledge of the law ought to be imputed to the offender, and, in this connection, may give their attention to the length of time that the statute had been in force when the offense was committed, and other attendant circumstances of the case.

* * *

The question of *malum* or *bonum in se* as a characteristic of a human action is evidently a moral question—in other words, a question of religion. This is a question which is tried under the law which "hath her seat in the bosom of God." It is investigated and decided by that awful Judge "unto whom all hearts are open, all desires known, and from whom no secrets are hid." It is utterly beyond the reach of mere man, beyond the jurisdiction of the courts of his establishment, beyond the purview of any statutes that he can frame or enact. For him to undertake to deal with such a matter, in his judicial administration, is to blasphemously set up a union of Church and State, to wickedly intrude on his fellows' rights of conscience.

* * *

Mr. Justice Blackstone to the contrary, notwithstanding, human law—at any rate, American human law—knows no such distinction between things as that of *malum prohibitum* and *malum in se*. It knows nothing of an act as either *malum* or *bonum*. The only distinction it recognizes is between that which is *prohibitum* and that which is *non-prohibitum*—in other words, between what it punishes as criminal and what it does not punish, because it does not choose to consider it criminal. It matters not whether an act be forbidden under the "Common Law" of England, where that has been adopted by an American State, or whether it is forbidden by a State statute. The Criminal Court judge simply inquires whether or not the person who is arraigned before him on a certain charge has done something which the "law of the land" says he shall not do, or has left undone something which the same law says he shall do. With the point of *malum* or *bonum*—the morality or immorality of either the act or the omission, such a judge has nothing whatever to do.
