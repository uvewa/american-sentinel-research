Clerical despotism, combined with certain liberalizing influences which that despotism cannot shut out, is driving the people of Lower Canada into open religious revolt. What the poor people of that district have to submit to under the ecclesiastical regime which the Catholic Church has established, may be seen from the following quotation from the London (Ont.) Guardian:—

"It may not be known that according to Quebec law tithes are levied and collected in the same manner as the municipal tax. It often happens that in a given district the bishop decides that a new parish ought to be formed and a church built. He selects the plans and decides what the cost shall be. A rate is then struck, and men have been forced to mortgage their larms in order to meet their payments. The only way to escape is to abjure the church—a course which to the devout Romanist is mortal sin. He exposes his family to the persecution of his former coreligionists, and, of course, is deprived of the means of grace."

Such is the natural fruit of Rome's substitute for "the liberty wherewith Christ has made us free." Gal. 5:1.
