THE Russian government having refused to vise the passport of a Jewish citizen of California who wished to enter Russia for the purpose of visiting relatives, and this refusal having come to public notice, Senator Perkins has introduced in Congress the following resolution:—

"Resolved, That this Government request the Imperial Government of Russia to specifically declare whether American citizens are excluded from Russia on account of their religious faith, and if so, that said Imperial Government of Russia be requested to remove such prohibition and to permit Americans of whatever religious faith to visit Russia, if they are not liable to become a charge upon the Empire by reason of poverty or an inability to support themselves by honest labor."
