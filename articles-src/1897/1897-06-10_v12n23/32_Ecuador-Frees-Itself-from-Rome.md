IT would seem that at last even Ecuador is to a considerable degree shaking herself free from the incubus and blight of papal priestcraft and Jesuitism. The Jesuits have been banished from the country by a government edict, and the distribution of Bibles is now freely permitted. As a result many of the inhabitants are calling for the Word of God. The weakening of the last strongholds of anti-biblical religion points to the completion of the work of preaching the gospel in all the world for a witness unto all nations, which the Saviour said should immediately precede his second coming.
