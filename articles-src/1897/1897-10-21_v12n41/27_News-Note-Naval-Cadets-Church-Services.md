THE naval cadets at West Point are this year prohibited from attending church services at Annapolis except on communion days, when they must obtain a special permit from their superiors. This leaves them the alternative of attending service at the Episcopal chapel provided by the government, or at the Roman Catholic church at the Navy Yard. Yet the churches in Annapolis are within ten minutes' walk of the cadets' quarters.
