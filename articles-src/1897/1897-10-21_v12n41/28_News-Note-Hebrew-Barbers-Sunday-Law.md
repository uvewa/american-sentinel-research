RECENTLY some of the "orthodox" Hebrews in New York City, in the personal preparation which they deemed necessary for the proper celebration of the Jewish "new-year" holidays, which began at six o'clock on Sunday evening, September 25, required the services of a tonsorial "artist," and accordingly several Jews whose business was of that nature opened their shops and proceeded to shave customers as usual on other days. Six of them were arrested for doing business on Sunday; and although they pleaded that the work was necessary for the proper observance of the "new year," the city magistrate who heard the cases imposed a fine upon each for violation of the law. It appears, however, that the arrested barbers belonged to the Barbers' Union, which had petitioned for the very law under which these individuals were fined. Hence, the latter could not consistently complain.

It is said by the American Hebrew that Mayor Strong had recommended that the city authorities should allow the sale of food on Sunday afternoon to the Hebrews on the East Side, as the latter would not be at liberty to purchase food on the ensuing Monday and Tuesday; but that a Christian Endeavor committee, on learning of this, took the mayor to task for thus favoring the Hebrews at the expense of Sunday. Such "Christian endeavor" is of the nature of those endeavors in the business world which result in the formation of monopolies and "trusts." Every Sunday law is, in fact, a law designed to establish a religious monopoly.
