'Tis wrong that raves with frantic cry
To hush right's voice so sweet and still.

'Tis falsehood that must terrify,
When truth goes calmly by at will.

'Tis error that must take the sword,
And seek to stop the Christ-like course.

'Tis love that wins men by a word,
And hate that fails through using force.

Right can be still and calm and strong,
Moving as stars do in their course,
Alone amid the hosts of wrong,
That run and shriek their voices hoarse.

Truth holds God's scepter for her own,
And wears a crown beneath men's thorn.

Falsehood upon a man made throne
Feels all his weakness, devil-born.

Right has a strength invulnerable,
A union with Almighty power.

Wrong bolstered up by men and hell
Must fortify from hour to hour.

Truth leads a white-robed army out
From heaven's battlements of light;
But falsehood's hosts of weakling doubt
Hurl puny shafts of carnal might.

Falsehood shall wither and decay,
Wrong be as ashes and as dust.

Error as shadow slink away,
Force be corroded as with rust.

Right shall be victor crowned at last,
Truth shall be robed in stars of light;
Love shall hold all things safe and fast,
As happy planets in their flight.

So only let us stand with right,
So only let us walk with truth,
So only live with love and light,
And feel no fear of woe or ruth.

Calm, happy, strong, and undismayed,
Let evil rage, we'll keep our course,
And find our every pathway stayed
By love's Almighty, heavenly force.
