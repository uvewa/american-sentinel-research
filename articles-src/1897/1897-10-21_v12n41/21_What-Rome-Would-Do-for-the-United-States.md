Not very long ago a prominent prelate of Rome made the statement in public that what Rome had done for other nations where she had had control, she would do also for the United States. In view of this assertion, which is undoubtedly true, it becomes of interest to Americans to note what Rome has done for those other countries. In brief, this could not perhaps be better set forth than is done in the following words of the illustrious French author, Victor Hugo:—

"Ah, we know you! We know the clerical party; it is an old party. This it is which has found for the truth those two marvelous supporters—ignorance and error. This it is which forbids to science and genius the going beyond the Missal, and which wishes to cloister thought in dogmas. Every step which the intelligence of Europe has taken has been in spite of it. Its history is written in the history of human progress, but it is written on the back of the leaf. It is opposed to it all. . . . For a long time the human conscience has revolted against you, and now demands of you, 'What is it that you wish of me?' For a long time already you have tried to put a gag upon the human intellect; you wish to be the masters of education, and there is not a poet, not an author, not a thinker, not a philosopher that you accept. All that has been written, found, dreamed, deduced, inspired, imagined, invented by genius, the treasure of civilization, the venerable inheritance of generations, the common patrimony of knowledge, you reject. There is a book—a book that is from one end to the other an emanation from above; a book which is for the whole world what the Koran is for Islamism, what the Vedas are for India, a book which contains all human wisdom illuminated by all divine wisdom—a book which the veneration of the people calls The Book—The Bible! Well, your censure has reached even that—unheard-of thing! Popes have proscribed the Bible. How astonishing to wise spirits; how overpowering to simple hearts to see the finger of Rome placed upon the Book of God! And you claim the liberty of teaching. Stop; be sincere; let us understand the liberty which you claim.

## "IT IS THE LIBERTY OF NOT TEACHING.

"You wish us to give you the people to instruct. Very well. Let us see your pupils. Let us see those you have produced. What have you done for Italy? What have you done for Spain? For centuries you have kept in your hands, at your discretion, at your school, these two great nations, illustrious among the illustrious. What have you done for them? I shall tell you. Thanks to you, Italy, whose name no man who thinks can any longer pronounce without inexpressible filial emotions—Italy, mother of genius and of nations, which has spread over all the universe all the most brilliant marvels of poetry and the arts—Italy, which has taught mankind to read—now knows not how to read! Yes, Italy is, of all the states of Europe, that where the smallest number know how to read. Spain, magnificently endowed Spain, which received from the Romans her first civilization; from Providence, and in spite of you, a world, America—Spain, thanks to you, wears a yoke of stupor, a yoke of degradation and decay; Spain has lost this secret power which it had from the Romans; this genius of Art which it had from the Arabs; this world which it had from God, and, in exchange for all that you have made it lose, it has received from you—

## THE INQUISITION!

—the Inquisition, which certain men of the party try today to reestablish; which has burned on the funeral pile millions of men; the Inquisition which disinterred the dead to burn them as heretics; which declared the children of heretics infamous and incapable of any public honors, excepting only those who shall have denounced their fathers; the Inquisition, which, while I speak, still holds in the papal library the manuscripts of Galileo sealed under the papal signet. These are your masterpieces. This fire, which we call Italy, you have extinguished. This Collossus that we call Spain you have undermined—the one in ashes, the other in ruins. This is what you have done for two great nations. What do you wish to do for France? Stop! you have just come from Rome! I congratulate you; you have had fine success there. You come from gagging the Roman people, and now you wish to gag the French people. I understand. This attempt is still more fine, but take care, it is dangerous. France is a lion, and is still alive!"

But what Rome had already done for France was written in the blood of the French Revolution.
