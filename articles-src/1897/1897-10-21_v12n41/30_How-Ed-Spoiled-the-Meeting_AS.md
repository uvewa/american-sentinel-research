"HELLO, Jimmy, where are you going?"

"O, I am going over to uncle Will's. Father wants me to ask him whether he will be at home to-morrow."

"Why, what's up; is there going to be a meeting somewhere?"

"Oh no, but pa wants to see him about buying a horse."

"What! on Sunday? I thought your father and your uncle Will were church members."

"So they are, and ma, and aunt Lucy, too; but uncle Will goes down to his pinery most every Sunday, and looks over his timber; and, I suppose, calculates about the lumber it will make. He says his health is poor, and that a walk in the fragrant pinery does him lots of good. Pa was afraid he would have to walk out to his pinery again, to-morrow, for his health; but thought, may be, he would stay at home if he expected him there."

"Wouldn't a walk in some other pinery do your uncle Will as much good as a stroll in his own?"

"I have thought about that a good deal, and wondered whether God would be pleased with such Sabbath-keeping. I suppose they will talk horse trade just for health, and because pa wants the horse to drive to meeting on Sunday; but if the children should laugh, or talk too loud, tap, tap, will go uncle Will's booted foot on the floor, and all will have to be as still as mice."

"It's just so at our house, too. Sometimes I look out through the open window and wish I was a free bird, or squirrel, or fish; and it makes me just hate Sunday, and almost makes me hate the Bible, too. O, say, Jimmy, did you ever hear about how Ed Day almost spoiled a meeting that was held at his father's house last spring?"

"No; tell me how he did it."

"Well, they didn't have meetings over in Maple Hollow very often, and when they did they were most always held at Mr. Day's house. He and his wife are both members of the church, you know. One Sunday, in sugar time, the people were gathered from all round, the minister was there, and all were waiting for Mr. Day to come in (from his sugar bush where he had gone for his health, I suppose). Presently he opened the door and walked in, when Ed (he was a little fellow) spoke right out loud so all could hear: 'Pa, did you leave the sap boiling?' You ought to have seen the people grinning, and Mr. Day looking as if he wanted to give Ed a shaking. I guess he got it after meeting."

"You know Lock's folks, don't you, Johnny? Well, I was over there one day, and Mrs. Lock was showing me a nice box that her husband had made for her, when her boy Johnnie spoke up and said: 'My pa made that box on Sunday.' 'Why, Johnnie Lock!' said his mother, 'he did not make the box on Sunday, you naughty boy.' 'Why, yes, ma, don't you remember; it was when you was tacking down the carpet in the hall.' Mrs. Lock admitted that she put down the carpet on Sunday, because she expected the minister to take dinner with them; and that Mr. Lock did do a little finishing work on the box at the same time.

"Well, these good Christian(?) church members held a meeting over at uncle Jake's, where they all talked in favor of having a Sunday law passed to make everybody keep the Sabbath. What do you think about that, Johnnie?"

"Well, it looks as though they thought God's Sabbath law was not strong enough, or perfect enough, or something; and that men knew better than God did how to make a law that would help everybody to keep the Sabbath. It doesn't look just right to me, though. If these church members want other folks to keep the Sabbath, why don't they keep it themselves as Christians ought to?"

"But, Johnnie, the commandment of God doesn't say anything about keeping Sunday, but the seventh day, which is Saturday."

"Al Wilson showed me how it reads in the Bible. You know his folks keep Saturday for Sunday."

"Well, if the Bible reads that way, I say we ought to do as God tells us to do; and I'm sure the Bible must tell us *how* to keep it, too; and I don't believe he wants us to be shut up, prison like, all day, while he lets the birds fly about and sing as if they were praising the Lord for joy.

"Al Wilson told me they were always glad at his house when Sabbath came. I don't believe Mr. Wilson sleeps and snores half the day on the lounge, and spends the rest of the time in eating and going to meeting; and then if the children make a little noise, speaks out, cross-like: 'Joseph!' 'Mary!' as my father does. Let's find out how the Wilsons keep the Sabbath."

"All right. Good bye!"
