The Christian Statesman of October 15, contains some editorial comments on the views of a contributor concerning the new Connecticut Sunday law, in which occurs the following expression:—

"The people who desire a Sabbath at all, desire it for moral and religious ends. They believe it to be a God-given right."

It would be folly to dispute the correctness of this statement; and if the National Reformers, of whose cause the Statesman is an ardent supporter, would only stand by it, they would soon find that their labor, in advocating Sunday laws, is altogether superfluous. The almighty Ruler of the universe, who ruleth "in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will" (Dan. 4: 17,25,32), has long ago given a Sabbath law for the very purpose expressed in the foregoing quotation. It is of universal application; for "the Sabbath was made for man" (Mark 2:27) in the very beginning of the history of his race (Gen. 2:1-3).

Not only is this Sabbath law universal in its application, but it is perpetual in its purpose. It is an essential section of that law of which Christ said not "one jot or one tittle" should fail while heaven and earth should stand. Matt. 5:18; Luke 16:17. It is not to pass away even when this sin-cursed earth shall have been "dissolved," and the works that are therein "burned up;" but it will be in force in the "new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness." 2 Peter 3:10-13; Isa. 66:22,23.

Then, for what purpose is any further law on the subject? "The law of the Lord is perfect" (Ps. 19:7) and perpetual. What, then, can man add to it, either of righteousness or power? "Shall mortal man be more just than God? Shall a man be more pure than his Maker?" Job 4:17.

But neither the Statesman, nor the National Reform combination which it represents, will stand by the utterance to which we have thus briefly alluded. It immediately adds:—

"An adequate law on the subject must therefore protect the Sabbath as a divine institution, and as a right bestowed by God. It must protect the Sabbath in the sense in which Christian people regard it."

This is just the trouble with National Reformism; it wants to enforce Sabbath-keeping from the standpoint of human regard. It practically ignores the "sense" in which God regards it. The law of the Lord being "perfect," as before noted, any change, or addition to it, must render it imperfect. Then a Sabbath law, in anywise different from the law of God, could not be an "adequate law." Therefore man cannot enact an adequate Sabbath law.

If any legislative body were to enact the fourth commandment in the very words in which the Lord gave it to man, it would be an act of blasphemous assumption. It would be presuming to add to the wisdom and power of God in the matter of enforcing his law. It would be saying to the Almighty, We have devised a better way than yours to secure proper Sabbath observance. It would be degrading the universal, perpetual law of God to the level of a local, temporary ordinance of fallible man. It would be reducing the commandment from the high character of a law which can be obeyed only by the impulse of faith and love, to the low plane of a human statute whose ultimate power of execution is the sword.

Human legislation upon the Sabbath question, or upon any other religious doctrine, is virtually an attempt to withdraw moral judgment from the court of heaven and place it under the jurisdiction of the court below.

The idea of protecting divine institutions by human device is altogether presumptive. When Israel undertook, after placing it in an unwarranted position, to protect the ark of God by their own power, it fell into the hands of the Philistines. Then God showed his power to protect it in his own way, and it was soon restored without the aid of the professed people of God who had assumed to work upon the National Reform plan.

When Uzzah essayed to "protect" the ark and keep it from falling, when it was being carried by Israel on a cart—a means devised by the heathen—instead of on the shoulders of the priests, as commanded by the Lord, he was promptly stricken with death. But when the commandment of the Lord was obeyed (not enforced by some incompetent human authority), there was no more trouble about protecting the ark.

All that God requires of men is to obey his commandments (Eccl. 12:13), not to enforce them upon one another. As the Lord himself did not compel men to obedience (John 12:47), any attempt of man, even of the most devoted apostle, to do so is contrary to Jehovah's plan. Such presumption is enmity against God; the power, so assuming, sets itself above God. Any attempt to enforce the Sabbath law by human power is a gross violation of the Sabbath—it is Sabbath-breaking in the highest degree.

If Sabbath-keeping is "a right bestowed by God," as the Statesman admits, it cannot be an obligation to the State which the civil power should enforce. For the State to attempt to compel an obedience to God which can come only from the heart in order to be acceptable to him, is in no sense a protection, either to the institution so sought to be honored or to the parties so compelled. Any so-called Sabbath-keeping enforced by human legislation, or observed in any way except by heartfelt desire, is sheer hypocrisy. All effort at public enforcement of Sabbath observance, no matter what day may be designated, can only result in a desecration of the Sabbath institution.

No better illustration of this latter proposition could be found than the Sabbath traditions of the Jews. When Christ came to visit his people and to fulfil the prophecies referring to himself, he found the Jews great sticklers for the Sabbath, or rather for their traditions concerning the Sabbath. These traditions were simply human ordinances, but they were begotten of great zeal for the protection of the "divine institution." They were compulsory in the extreme, and condemnatory of all who disregarded them, as far as the power of their supporters extended; and their expectation of the Messiah was that he would make them universal.

They verily thought that an "adequate law on the subject" "must protect the Sabbath in the sense in which" they regarded it. A prominent complaint against the Saviour was his alleged Sabbath-breaking, yet it was only their human traditions that he disregarded and rebuked. As a matter of course, their traditions extended to all of the law, insomuch that Jesus declared that they had "made the commandment of God of none effect" by their traditions. "This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoreth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me. But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrine the commandments of men." Matt. 18:6-9.

Just so it is with people of to-day who enact or sustain the presumptive laws of men for the protection or the compulsory observance of divine institutions or ordinances. The only way in which men can honor God is to obey his law. To assume to alter, or amend, or add thereto, is highly dishonoring to his name and requirements.
