A Western judge, sitting, as we say, in our jargon, at *nisi prius*, or as a court of "first resort," the other day, had a Sunday-law case to decide. The law with which he had to deal, like others of that ilk, contained a "saving clause." It forbade the people of the State to do any work on "the Sabbath day, commonly called Sunday," unless the same was a work of "necessity or charity." This "saving clause" exceedingly bothered the conscientious judge.

***

The defense rested exclusively on this clause. The accused party, it appeared, had a contract to furnish another person with an article, which he was to manufacture by hand; and his contract provided that if the article were not furnished by a certain date, it need not be accepted, unless the person who had ordered it chose to take it when proffered.

The prisoner was an expert handicraftsman, and the only one of his kind in the neighborhood. Shortly after he began on his job, he had an accident to one of his hands, which rendered him unable to use it for some time. In order that he might finish his undertaking within the time provided, he was compelled to labor on "the Sabbath day, commonly called Sunday." He proved this; also that there was no one else to whom the particular work could be delegated: and further, that he and his wife and three small children were dependent on the product of his handiwork for daily bread, lodging, and clothing. Then his attorneys "rested" and proceeded to argue that they had fully established a case of "necessity" within the statute's "saving clause."

***

At my last advices, the worthy magistrate had adjourned court, and gone to the bosom of his family, with the intention, as he stated, of "thinking it over and talking to his wife about it." His dilemma is as good a text as any for a little sermon on this subject of "Sunday laws," so old, and yet so always new.

***

It is to be noted that this exception of works of "charity or necessity" is an invention of Puritanism, in the course of a violent effort to wrench the fourth commandment away from Saturday to which it rightfully belongs, and connect it with Sunday to which it has no just application. There is no qualification of necessity and charity in the ancient commandment for Saturday observance. "In it thou shalt do no manner of work."

***

And this invention has returned to plague the inventors—a matter over which I, for one, should not be disposed to worry much, if it only stopped there. But, unfortunately it does not and cannot stop there, so long as the atmosphere of Puritanism must be breathed by people who detest it. We are all plagued, judges and laity alike, by the absurd Sunday law; with its preposterous "saving clause."

***

It is said that "misery loves company," and if this be true, the Western dispenser of law and equity will be somewhat comforted, should these lines ever reach his eye, by the information that he is not alone in his perplexity over this subject. On the contrary, he has not only a numerous company, but a company distinguished by the presence of very eminent and enlightened men to share his woes.

***

Indeed, there is no general consensus of opinion as to the character of the question, What is necessity or charity? Some learned jurists tell us that it is a question of law, others that it is a question of fact, others again, that it is a mixed question of law and fact; so that, in one State, it is for the court exclusively, in another it is altogether within the purview of the jury, and in a third, it is a question "to be decided by the jury under the instructions of the court." Taking this preliminary point in either one of these three ways,—or taking it in all three contradictory ways at once, an intellectual feat to which some courts have appeared equal,—we advance one step further.

***

For admitting that we have settled whose business it is to decide the question of what is necessity or what is charity, as the case may be, we have now to determine how they are to go about it—since it is useless to assign the task of applying a law to any man or set of men, unless there be provided a system of rules and principles whereby the decision of the case is to be guided and controlled. What rules or principles have we to guide and control the judgment which must be rendered in a trial under a Sunday law where the defense is necessity or charity?

***

It has several times been most ably and strenuously contended that a party's "honest belief" in the necessity or charity of his Sunday work is all-sufficient and conclusive. Certainly, there is plenty of authority for the position that, in order to constitute a violation of a penal statute, two elements must concur—the overt act, and the inner intent. But the judges very soon brushed this argument away, so far as Sunday laws are concerned. They pointed out that it amounted, practically, to claiming for every individual the right of determining the legal significance of the terms "necessity" and "charity," which would make the standard vary, as "many men of many minds" might chance to differ in their views, so that what would be a crime in one man would not be such in others. We may confidently claim, then, that at least one point is clearly established and irrevocably fixed in regard to Sunday charity and necessity—namely, that they are things which no fellow can find out for himself.

Upon a subject so inherently obscure, and so beclouded by conflicting rulings, and well-intended efforts at its elucidation, it is a comfort to have one point clear and strong, albeit it is merely a negative one. But our comfort is not enhanced when, thus assured that we are unable to help ourselves in the premises, we come to consider how those who are charged with the responsible duty of our enlightenment have performed their task.

It is allowed on all hands that necessity and charity are matters of circumstance, of time and place; or, in the language of evolution, "environment." The justifying circumstance may be the character of the work itself. Thus, work which is in its nature continuous, as the operation of a beer brewery, is appropriate to Sunday (per Allen G. Thurman, C. J.). This is because of the damage which would result from stopping the work and starting it all over again. Apparently, this illustration shows that the certainty of damage is an element of necessity. But many other cases hold that even a total loss cannot be considered herein—as, where a party had to gather seaweed for fuel on Sunday, or let it be washed away altogether by the tide. The degree of damage involved in abstinence from Sunday work is of recognized importance. But how this degree is fixed no living man has yet told us, and none is likely ever to tell us.

We have seen that necessity is not to be determined by the individual. Has it any special relation to the individual? In other words, is necessity on Sunday one thing for $\Lambda$, and something entirely different for B? We know that, as a plain matter of fact, the necessities of no two persons are precisely the same. But we are now dealing with a matter of law. Is tobacco a necessity for its users? Is liquor a necessity for drinking men? Is meat a necessity for a flesh eater, while otherwise in the case of a vegetarian?

And this brings us to another and most vital issue: Whose necessity is it that makes work or business on Sunday harmless in the eye of the law? If I need my coat badly on Sunday, will that justify my tailor in completing it during the "sacred" hours? Is the purchaser's necessity, if established, a defense for the seller? No mortal man can give an answer to this question that is worth a button.

But there is one case which affords the only instance wherein it has been formally declared that a poor man has a privilege at law which is not accorded to a rich one—that is, the only instance which has ever come under my observation. In this case, wrestling gallantly with the invincible problem of Sunday necessity, a learned judge declared, in effect, that a man who had only one house might be justified in saving it from destruction by fire on Sunday, when such labor would expose the owner of, say, a dozen houses, to condign punishment! How about him who had eleven of them? "Further this deponent saith not."

And Sunday charity is no more comprehensible than Sunday necessity. Sunday charity is "active goodness," according to our authorities. Passive goodness, I suppose, must be treated as finable under the statute. Of course, putting money in the collection box is all right. So are contracts to pay for improvements to a church building, if made by a member of the congregation with an incorporated vestry; but it is clear that a contract by the vestry, on the strength of such pledges, to buy stone for the improvements from a quarryman would be void, as violating a prohibition of "worldly business." And so we go.

Now the moral of all this is simply that the Sunday law, with its savings, is a law such as no human intelligence can understand, or interpret, or apply, with any reason, consistency, or justice. Ordinarily, as soon as this characteristic is fastened on any legislative provision, the courts immediately set it aside, and refuse to give it the slightest consideration. There can be no manner of doubt that this fate, which has befallen scores of American statutes, would have long since overtaken every Sunday law in the land, were it not for the fact that the Sunday of compulsory idleness and gloom which has been dignified with the title of "Our American Sabbath" is an "institution" which the courts have somehow persuaded themselves that it is their duty to "maintain" even at the sacrifice of common sense; at the cost of self-stultification; and with the result of gross inequality and cruelty in the work of administrative jurisprudence.

Goverment, like charity, begins at home.
