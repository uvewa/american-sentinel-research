RECENTLY there assembled in State convention at Paterson, N. J., the Society of Christian Endeavor. This organization ought to be a mighty power for good in the world, if it is true, as they claim, through their State president, Dr. French, that their "strength is in the indwelling of Christ."

With Christ dwelling in them they have at their command a power greater than that of all the governments of earth combined, for the Bible says that "Christ is the power of God." 1 Cor. 1:24. And there is no power greater than God's power.

Christ being the power of God, he who has Christ dwelling within, will have sufficient power to enable him to comply with all the requirements of the gospel.

But from some of the utterances at this convention, and from certain actions on their part, it looks as though their strength, after all, is not through the "indwelling of Christ."

At this convention it was decided to add another department—that of "Sabbath observance"—to their work.

In a plea for the Sabbath (Sunday) Rev. Dr. Burrell gave expression to the following remarkable utterance: "My right to Sabbath observance depends upon a law for Sabbath observance for all." The readers of the SENTINEL will recognize this as genuine National Reform doctrine. But the good doctor continues, and logically too: "If others do not keep it, I can't."

That is to say that so long as there is no law compelling everybody to keep the Sabbath, it is impossible for him to keep it.

If this doctrine has been accepted and indorsed by the Christian Endeavorers, they will have to repudiate the statement made by Dr. French, that their "strength is in the indwelling of Christ." In fact, it will be a virtual admission, on their part, that not only is the "indwelling of Christ" not their strength, but that they are not even Christians, and consequently any endeavor that they may make on behalf of Christianity is not Christian.

That this is a just conclusion from their own premises will be evident.

The Sunday advocates claim that this day is the test of all religion. This was declared at the Elgin (Illinois) convention a few years ago. Now it must be true that if Sunday is the test of all religion, those who do not keep Sunday have no religion.

It is perfectly clear that all people do not keep Sunday.

That being so, Dr. Burrell and all who indorse him in the statement that he cannot keep the Sabbath because others do not keep it, do not keep Sunday. And as those who do not keep Sunday have no religion, it is also perfectly clear that Dr. Burrell and his endeavors have no religion.

Furthermore it is claimed that "he who does not keep the Sabbath does not worship God; and he who does not worship God is lost."

If therefore Dr. Burrell and those who indorse him are right in saying that nobody can keep the Sabbath unless all do, it follows from the above quotation that nobody can worship God unless all worship him, and as those who do not worship God are lost, it follows that the poor doctor and his friends too are lost.

What then becomes of the boast that their strength lies in "the indwelling of Christ"? On their own showing, it is nothing of the kind.

Their only hope of salvation is in getting a law to compel everybody to keep Sunday. The State therefore and not Christ is their strength and their Saviour.

Thus the insidious work is going on, which is exalting man above God, and which is to plunge mankind into the final apostasy.
