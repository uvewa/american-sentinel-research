"WELL, here I am again, mama," said Charlie Ross. "I've brought the Bible, and am full of questions. I hunted up the word 'fire,' as you told me to, but could only find one place where it says anything that would make me think a government would bring down fire on the earth, and I hardly know whether it is a government or not, for it says it is a beast that doeth great wonders, and deceiveth them that dwell on the earth.

"I know I am a great bother," continued Charlie, as Mrs. Ross laid down her work. "I suppose there are not many boys who have mothers who are willing to give up their work to help them understand these questions; no, nor many mothers who could help as you do."

"No, nor many sons who are interested in Bible questions, or who would think their mother so valuable an instructor. My dear boy, my first work is,—well, come, you may tell me yourself."

"Ah, mama, I know you think it is the making of me into a true, intelligent man," said Charlie, with a pleased look in his eyes.

"You are right. Many a time as you come to me with your questions, I think of David, who had it in his heart to build the temple of the Lord. He was not permitted to do it; but he was permitted to turn over what he had gathered to his son, and Solomon built the temple. Mama has never been permitted to do any great thing for the Lord, but may be you will have a chance to spread the principles of truth in wider circles.

"Now for some of your questions, Charlie."

"Well, mama, I never paid much attention to the strange beasts we read about in the Bible before; but since you gave me that hint the other day about the beasts representing governments, I have read of them with great interest. The first question is, How do you know that governments are so represented?"

"Governments or earthly kingdoms are represented under several different symbols. In the second chapter of Daniel they were represented to Nebuchadnezzar, who you know was a worshiper of images, under the form of an image whose head was of gold, whose breast was of silver, thighs of brass, legs of iron, and feet part of iron and part of clay. However, we will not stop to study this symbol at present; for in the seventh chapter when the Lord presented the same line of prophecy to his own servant, he represented the different kingdoms under the symbols of beasts of prey. I do not want to go too fast, dear, over this point, for the choice of these symbols to represent the intrinsic nature of earthly kingdoms reveals an infinite understanding of the character and methods of the governments of men, and presents a vast contrast to the nature and methods of the government of God. Just to bring out the difference in the nature and methods of earthly kingdoms, I will ask you a few questions.

"How do beasts of prey obtain and preserve their dominion?"

"Why, by force," answered Charlie.

"Right. Now tell me how God's kingdom is gaining and controlling its subjects on earth?"

"By winning their hearts."

"Yes; it is the goodness of God that leads men to repentance. The heavenly government extends to the very thoughts and affections of the heart; but earthly governments have dominion only over the outward actions. You asked me how I knew that these beasts represented earthly governments. That's a very wise question. Many persons have said that you could make the Bible mean whatever you liked by interpreting it yourself to suit your own ideas. But God has not left us to the mercy of men's interpretations. He himself has told us what these symbols indicate. Turn to Daniel 7:17, and read what he says the four beasts represent."

"These great beasts which are four, are four kings which shall arise out of the earth," read Charlie.

"Now read the 24th verse and you will see clearly that the beasts are symbols of four great kingdoms."

"Thus he said: the fourth beast is the fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be diverse from all kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces."

"The fourth kingdom upon earth is represented by 'a great and terrible beast,' and the third, second, and first, by beasts whose likeness we find in nature. But first, what seems to be the only object for which beasts of prey strive?"

"For their own gratification," suggested Charlie.

"Yes, to hold their own dominion, to obtain such things as will minister to their appetites. In fact, they live, as it would seem, simply for self. Anything that interferes must be put down and out. They live for time, for the present, for the fulfilling of the desires of the flesh, or of the animal nature only.

"Have you ever seen men and women who live in the same way?"

"O yes, mama. It seems as if they did at any rate; for there is the drunkard on Fleet Street, and—O, lots of people who never seem to care for anything but a comfortable time for themselves. In fact, mama, it seems to me that it is natural for most people, perhaps for everybody, to be very selfish, and to want to get rid of everything that interferes with them."

"You remember in our first talk on the difference between the government of God and the government that originates from selfishness, we spoke of the fall of the great angel Lucifer, who said he would exalt his throne above the stars of God, and be like the Most High in position. The principle that actuated him was that of self-exaltation, that would lead to the putting down of all others, or to the making of a final tyranny. His was a beast-like spirit, the spirit that has actuated every earthly government that has departed from the principles of liberty. It is his spirit that makes earthly governments develop the beast-like characteristics. Satan is called the dragon, the 'old serpent' that decriveth the whole earth. But selfishness is beast-like and satanic; and when governments are permitted to work out what is in them, they work out the spirit of the dragon and of the beast. The history of the nations of the past, and even of the present, will furnish us with plenty of illustrations of this fact. But as nations are made up of individuals, and the State is only the sum total of its majorities, this question has a bearing on every individual, and each one has a part to act either in giving power to the beast, or in building up the kingdom of God which is in righteousness and peace and joy in the earth. In a short time we shall come to the beast who is to imitate the miracle of Elijah in bringing fire down on the earth; but our next talk will be on the first beast of this chapter, and I want you to look up all you can on the characteristics of the lion. Meanwhile, my dear boy, ask the God of love to continually fill us with the spirit of love, that has been symbolized by the dove that is so harmless and guileless; for if we possess not the spirit of the beast, but of the dove, we shall belong to the eternal kingdom.

God rules by love, and not by force;
His throne's upheld above,
Not by the might that would coerce,
But by the might of love.

F. B.
