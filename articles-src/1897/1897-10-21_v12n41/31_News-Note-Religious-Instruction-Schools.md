The London (Eng.) *Christian World* mentions the following incident as showing "the notion some church people have of 'religious instruction.'" It illustrates the practical working of the principle of State teaching of religion in the public schools:—

"A diocesan inspector visited a certain school in one of the Eastern counties, a school in which there was a good number of children of Nonconformists, and in testing their religious knowledge he asked the question: 'By what was Noah saved?' Up went a forest of hands. 'Well?' said the inspector. 'The ark,' was the answer from the whole school. 'No,' said the inspector; 'you are all wrong; Noah was saved by the water; and so God taught us that we were to be saved by the waters of baptism. Never forget that.' Another question was asked, but not a hand was held up. Another was tried. The same result. The inspector expressed his surprise that the children could not answer his questions. Next day the mistress of the school scolded the children for not answering, when she was quite sure they could have answered correctly. One of them said: 'We wouldn't answer any more questions, because he didn't know anything about Noah. Why, the people were drowned by the water, and he said Noah was saved by it.'"
