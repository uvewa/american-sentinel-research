The American Medical Missionary College.

The third session of the American Medical Missionary College will open November 3. New and enlarged quarters have been secured in Chicago, and a new surgical dispensary is being fitted up there, and several additional teachers have been added to the corps of instructors. Nearly fifty applications for entrance have already been received. There is still room for a few well qualified young ladies. The openings for young women with the right qualifications are exceptionally excellent at the present time. Those interested should correspond immediately with the undersigned.
