There is one sure remedy and only one, for the ever-present conflict of capital and labor: and that is stated in the following, taken from one of our religious exchanges:—

"'And, behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said to the reapers, The Lord be with you. And they answered him, The Lord bless thee.' Ruth 2:4. There was no conflict there between capital and labor; nor will there ever be when such expressions can be used between employer and employés, not as a matter of form, but from the heart. When masters remember that they have a Master in heaven, who is no respecter of persons, and servants remember that they serve the Lord Christ, there can be no clashing. But only the Spirit of God in the heart can bring this about. Strikes, wars, and fightings will go on as long as evil desires reign in the human heart."
