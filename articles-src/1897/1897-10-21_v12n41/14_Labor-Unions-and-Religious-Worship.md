SHOULD "union" worshipers attend a church built by "non-union" workmen? This is the question recently addressed to Bishop Potter by the Hod-hoisting Engineers' Union, the question being called out by the fact that non-union men are employed in the building of the new Protestant Episcopal cathedral in New York City. We have not yet learned the nature of the bishop's reply.

Does this question imply that membership in the "union" has now attained a position of such overwhelming importance in the life of the workingman that it overshadows even the question of his relation to God? Is this more than can fairly be inferred from it?

Just why the Union should refer this matter to Bishop Potter, instead of settling the question by its own decision, is not clear. Probably it was hoped that it might influence him to secure the dismissal of the non-union men, or their allegiance to the union. It is not often that a labor union feels incompetent to decide upon the proper conduct of its members in any matter affecting its interests.

Is an attendant at church service from the workingmen's ranks to be known as a "union" worshiper or a "non-union" worshiper? and are the measures of the strike and lockout to be carried into the sphere of church relationship? Will the "union" members of the Rev. Mr. A's congregation go on a "strike" as regards church services because "non-union" men are employed on the church of Rev. Mr. B? or refuse to attend any church built by "non-union" men? Will the union undertake to say what its members shall do in the matter of church attendance, if it should regard such a measure as necessary to the protection of its interests?

And if Bishop Potter replies to the question, will the union abide by his decision? This, at the best, would be to make a pope of Bishop Potter.

To say the least, the question is plainly suggestive of a readiness on the part of labor unions to make themselves the instruments of religious tyranny.
