One of the resolutions passed at the recent labor convention in St. Louis, is the following:—

"Resolved, That no nation in which the people are totally disarmed can long remain a free nation, and therefore we urge upon all liberty-loving citizens to remember and obey Article II of the Constitution of the United States, which reads as follows: 'The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.'"

The significance of this resolution, in a convention of the nature of that which assembled at St. Louis, cannot be misunderstood. In one of the speeches which preceded it, and which struck a responsive chord throughout the assembly, it was said that "civil liberty is dead in America," that it was useless to appeal to the courts, and that the only appeal left was to the country; and that "we no longer have a republic; there is not a vestige of it left."

Will the "return of prosperity" make the antagonistic forces of labor and capital feel any better disposed toward each other? If not, then it will do little to stay the progress of coming revolution.
