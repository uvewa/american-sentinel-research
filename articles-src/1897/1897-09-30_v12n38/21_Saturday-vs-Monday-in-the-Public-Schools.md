The policy of the Public School Board of Litchfield, Minn., recently came in conflict with the religious views of some of the residents in that vicinity, in what appears to be a rather curious case. It seems that a portion of the community became of the opinion that it would be well to make Monday a holiday in the schools in the place of Saturday, and just before the opening of the schools the Board voted that this should be done. As a reason for this action it was said that the pupils rarely had good lessons on Monday, as Sunday was devoted to recreation and religion rather than to study; and that when pupils did study on Sunday, they were scolded for it by the teachers whenever the fact came to the latters' knowledge. Hence it was concluded to try the experiment of transferring the usual Saturday holiday to Monday.

This action by the Board called out the following petition, which was circulated and received numerous signatures in the vicinity:

## To the Litchfield School Board of Education—

"WHEREAS, Your honorable body propose to change from the established custom of holding school on Monday, and holding it on Saturday instead, and—

"WHEREAS, We would prefer the old plan, believing it to be the better for various reasons, and—

"WHEREAS, It works injustice to some of our citizens who conscientiously observe Saturday as the Sabbath, thus depriving them of one day of school and also of the privilege of teaching in the public schools, and—

"WHEREAS, We believe that a law that works an injustice to even a few, depriving them of their rights and liberties, is wrong and should be abolished; we humbly petition your honorable body to discontinue the proposed plan and hold school as formerly."

The result was that at their next meeting the school board reconsidered their previous action in the matter, and the Monday holiday innovation was dropped.
