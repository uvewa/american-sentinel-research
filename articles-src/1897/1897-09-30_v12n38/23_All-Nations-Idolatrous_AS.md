BY A. SMITH.

The four great leading nations of the world that have come in touch with the interests of the people of God (Babylon, Medo-Persia, Grecia, and Rome), in their unity and in their divisions, are represented in the Bible by a great image. See Daniel 2. This image symbolizes the idolatrous element that runs down through them all to the end of time, or until Christ will have destroyed them at his second coming.

It is usual to class those only as idolaters who render formal worship to images or objects in nature. But, according to the tenor of Bible testimony, any interest in social or private life that is of greater importance to any one than God's will in the matter, thereby becomes an idol; and such interest expressed in deeds becomes idolatry.

Jesus said, "No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon." Matt. 6:24.

Paul says, "Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry." Col. 3:5.

According to the Saviour's declaration and Paul's inspired exhortation, there is not a single nation of this world into whose constituents there enters an indulgence of any one of the sins enumerated but is thereby rendered an idolatrous nation in the sight of God; and no amount of legislative tinkering can transform such a government into a Christian nation.
