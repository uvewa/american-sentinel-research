A LONDON (Eng.) journal makes the following pertinent comment upon the treatment accorded the Sultan's recent official expression of thanks to God for victory in the war with Greece:—

"The Sultan's official letter, expressing in terms pious and devout his thanks to God and the Prophet Mohammed for his victory in Thessaly, was treated by the press as an amusing document. It seems strange to the West to hear a Mohammedan talking so piously about his success in war. But the letter, with Mohammed's name struck out, might very readily have come from any European ruler after a successful campaign. Do not professedly Christian governments thank God for success in killing their enemies? The Sultan does so at least consistently, as his prophet's religion is Islam and the Sword; but Christians acknowledge the Prophet who said, 'Put up thy sword,' and 'Resist not evil.' Yet in the name of the religion of Jesus guns are dedicated and victories over men wholly unprepared to die are celebrated with religious rejoicings."
