In Salt Lake county, Utah, a man named Monk was recently confined by the sheriff in a dungeon and fed on bread and water, for refusing to attend religious services. Mr. Monk had previously been lodged in the jail for a technical offense, and the religious services were those provided for the inmates by the State. When the facts in the case became public, the Board of County Commissioners took action which resulted in Mr. Monk's release from the dungeon and the revocation of the order enforcing attendance upon religious worship.

Even criminals possess unalienable rights; and while they may by their crime forfeit the rights of liberty and even of life, there are no circumstances under which a person may forfeit his right to worship according to the dictates of his conscience.
