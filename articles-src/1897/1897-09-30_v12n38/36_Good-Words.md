This department was begun in the earnest belief that it would be appreciated by the young friends of the SENTINEL family. We have not been disappointed, for hardly a day goes by that good words for it are not received.

One says: "I am very glad you have decided to place a department for the young people in the SENTINEL. I know it is appreciated by the young people in our church, for they have subscribed for a club of thirty to use in their meetings."

Another friend writes: "The addition of the department for young people will be appreciated by a large class, old as well as young, and this to my mind will make the SENTINEL even a more welcome visitor than ever."

A subscriber in Canada has this to say: "The new department for young people will be a great help. It is a move in the right direction."

Now, what we want, to make this department all that could be desired, is contributions from our young friends. Don't be afraid to express your thoughts on paper. Perhaps they may be crude at first—what matters that? Who ever heard of a finished picture from a single stroke of the brush? There is an immense amount of valuable latent literary talent going to waste all around us, and here is an opportunity to develop it. Who will embrace the opportunity?
