BY L. W. FELTER.

A great many, and perhaps we might say, the majority of the people, realize that this nation is rapidly approaching a crisis on the question of capital and labor; that this is becoming a leading issue is manifested by conversations, by speeches, and by writings, and by tragic events.

"The Most High" who "ruleth in the kingdoms of men," has not only told us beforehand that the present industrial situation would come; but when it would come, and what it would mean when it should come. Thus, we read in the fifth chapter of James, beginning with the first verse: "Go to now, ye rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon you. Your riches are corrupted and your garments are moth eaten. Your gold and silver is cankered; . . . ye have heaped treasures together in the last days." R. V.

This scripture has been literally fulfilled in the last third of a century, during which time the wealth of the nations has been concentrating into the hands of a favored few who have "heaped" to themselves the most stupendous fortunes on record. Therefore in what days are we living?—They must be the last.

As the wealth is being "heaped together" by the "trusts" and other combines, what will be the financial condition of the masses?—They will be growing poorer. Then might they be expected to complain of the "hard times," and combine to resist the exactions of the money power as they are doing at the present time?—Yes. And that is just what the next verse says: "Behold, the hire of the laborers who have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth." Yes; and the cry is heard on every hand, and many are asking themselves the question, "What will the outcome of it all be?" See the prophecy of Habbakuk, chapter 2, verses 5–8.

The first part of these prophecies is seen by everybody, but instead of believing the word of the Lord in reference to the last part, men are groping around in the dark, seeking for a solution of the question through the wisdom of man.

There is a book going the rounds entitled, "President John Smith," in which an imaginary story of a "peaceful revolution" is told in glowing terms. But when puny man seeks to exalt his wisdom above the plain "Thus saith the Lord," the fallacy of his reasoning is apparent. Thus he says:—

"I have an abiding faith in government, in the will of the majority, in wise paternalism, in scientific nationalism. I believe in the people. I believe that the great heart of the people is kind, loving, and unselfish. . . . I distrust the individual. He is selfish. He is often dishonest and corruptible. He is easily misled and influenced."

But what is the "people" but an aggregation of individuals? Then if the individual is "selfish," often "dishonest" and "corruptible," "easily misled and influenced," what can a body politic be composed of such individuals? And is it not a fact that "selfishness" is the root of the whole evil?

Therefore the only peaceful and abiding solution of the problem is in the coming of Him the scepter of whose kingdom is a scepter of righteousness; from the hearts of whose subjects the principle of selfishness has been completely and forever eradicated.

Peter says, "We have the word of prophecy made more sure; whereunto ye do well to take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place." R. V. Then why not walk in light instead of groping about in the dark; in a vain endeavor to discover something that does not exist?
