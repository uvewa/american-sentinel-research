# NEWS, NOTES AND COMMENT

The only fat villain in standard fiction is the "Count Fosco," whom Mr. Wilkie Collins introduced in his fine novel, "The Woman in White." Mr. Collins, it is said, was proud of this creation because all the imaginary villains of previous authors were of lean build. But the Count has another title to pre-eminence and immortality besides his physical stoutness. He was a chemist of thorough education, and a thinker of no slight ability. His philosophy, like the philosophy of other villains, was of the materialistic school—that being, indeed, the only school of philosophy in which your true and complete villain can find any solid comfort for his soul.

* * *

On one occasion, expounding the tenets of his faith, the Count observed, "Mind, they say, rules the world; but what rules the mind?—The body." And he goes on to claim that if he could order the breakfast of Sir Isaac Newton, he would guarantee that, when, an hour or so after he had finished the meal, the great scientist went out into his orchard and saw the apple fall, instead of proceeding to formulate the law of gravitation, he would simply eat the fruit. Give him, he further asserted, a like jurisdiction in the case of Alexander the Great, and he would cause that monarch to run away at the first sight of the Persian enemy. This little speech of the Count's is about as good a summary of the theory of materialism as has ever been presented.

* * *

But the trouble about materialism is that it misses the point. The connection between the mind and the body is profoundly interesting, and is now, and must forever remain, apart from revelation, an unsolvable mystery. Nothing is more wonderful than the change which we may effect in the character of a human being, in his views of circumstances, in his desires, his impulses, aye, even his moral sense, merely by putting substances into his stomach. We may easily, by this means, not only render him unable to think or act at all, but, if we please, may cause him to think and act in a manner altogether different from that in which he normally thinks and acts. No man is precisely the same when he is starving as he is after a good meal. Ordinary foods, as well as potent drugs, have a wonderful deal to do with one's opinions and disposition.

* * *

But here materialistic forces reach the limit of their operation, and the spiritual advances to the fore. However, a man comes to evolve an idea, once that idea is communicated to others, its operation is not only independent of physical laws, but rises superior to them. The results of its promulgation and discussion are neither to be weighed, or measured, or estimated by any human means or instrumentality. Its power may be greater than that of any number of "stubborn facts." Ideas bend the external world to their will. Napoleon to the contrary notwithstanding, Providence is not always on the side of the heaviest artillery. Men full of patriotic enthusiasm, or religious fervor, or inspired by a dominating sense of duty in any cause, will carry by storm the most powerful batteries defended by soldiers whose hearts are not in the fight.

* * *

"Man shall not live by bread alone, but by ideas." And by these shall he also perish. "The lethal side of mankind," as Mr. Stevenson calls it, is the side of evil ideas, or of wrong ideas; to submit one's life to the influence and guidance of such ideas is to invite destruction. Many ideas are to the mind what indigestible food is to the stomach. Right ideas are like good, strong, wholesome, nourishing food; their tendency is to preserve, to increase strength, and promote development.

* * *

Hence the tremendous, the transcendent importance to the race of correct thinking. Hence the exalted and exacting mission of those who battle for this thing. As the mind is more important than the body, so is the function of him who undertakes to commend or discredit ideas among men far above the business of one who sells his fellows flour or meats or vegetables.

* * *

The present young emperor of Germany appreciates very keenly this importance of ideas. On a recent occasion he quite outdid himself in his effort to emphasize and impress on the minds of his people his favorite idea of "divine right" as the source of his position and authority. In so many words, he announced that he had received his crown from Deity direct, and acknowledged no responsibility to any other quarter for the manner in which it might please him to administer the office which had thus been bestowed upon him. The people of Germany have heard their young master talk this way before, and no particular attention was attracted by this last manifesto, extreme as it was.

* * *

But one of the corner stones of our American polity is the fixed belief that the idea of having people to rule over us by divine right is a wrong idea, and ought to be rejected. We believe that the application of this idea tends to enslave the souls of men, to suppress humanity, to check its loftier aspirations, to block its progress toward a higher life. With us, there is no emperor to pose as its representative and exponent. Yet, before we pity or sneer at the Germans who listen in patience to such a claim as Emperor William boldly advances, it is worth while to consider whether this wrong idea of a "divine right" is not somewhat at work in the United States.

* * *

Whatever the people at large may think, there are among us plenty of clerical advocates of "divine right." Inasmuch as the purpose of these people is to have certain religious dogmas of theirs enacted into laws, and outward compliance with their injunctions enforced by the civil power on other people, who do not believe in them, and thus maintain, pro tanto, a union between their church and the State, they are really obliged to adopt this European notion in their discussions. They are themselves aware of the incongruity between things wholly secular, and a business which is of this world exclusively on the one hand, and a thing which is wholly religious, and a business that is concerned with the "hereafter" on the other. Hence, before they begin to plead for a union of Church and State—or a union of religion and State, according to the latest cant—they seek to throw some mantle of sanctity over the State, and to connect the civil authority with the sanction of divinity.

* * *

Thus, with men of this kind, we find that "the consent of the governed," supposedly the source of all American governments, disappears completely, and the European, instead of the American idea, is more or less openly insisted upon by them.

* * *

Ideas are not only too strong for facts; they are also too strong for men. When two ideas are so intimately associated that the acceptance of one of them necessarily involves the acceptance of the other, men who adopt either will find themselves willy nilly advocates of the other. Ask the clerical advocate of a "Sunday law," for example, if he believes that "the consent of the governed is the foundation of all our systems of civil administration," and he will very likely say, "Yes." But set him down to write an article on his favorite theme, and, sooner or later, you will find him trying to locate our statutes and ordinances "in the bosom of God."

* * *

There is great responsibility resting on the educators of youth in this regard. Our young men ought to have enjoined upon them a respect for the State, and for the law, as institutions which the experience of mankind has demonstrated are necessary, in order to the gratification of the social instinct which the Creator has implanted in the human soul. But nothing is gained by appealing to the European superstition of divine right, even if we substitute the State or the law for the emperor. On the contrary, an essentially false view of the whole fabric of government and of society is in this manner presented—I mean, of course, false from the real American standpoint.

* * *

In the domain of the mind, the great struggle is still going on which began centuries ago, between the irreconcilable and antagonistic principles of divine right and consent of the governed. The great glory of our country is that she stands the leader of the fray on the right side. There is no possibility of mixing our polity with any portion of that system to which Europe clings. The slightest taint of connection between the two is evil, and "lethal" for us.

* * *

Our "rulers" are of our own creation, and they are our servants or agents, who, for reasons of our own, we choose to temporarily employ about certain things. They are accountable to us, their masters, not only for what they do in their official positions, but for the way in which they do it. They may or may not possess some peculiar virtues in their personal capacities, but about their public labors we recognize no trace whatever of divine authority. By our sovereign will we call them to account for every delinquency. We reserve to ourselves the right and the power to undo any of their work which happens not to be done according to our liking.

* * *

This is the American idea. He who seeks to propagate any other is attempting to undermine American liberty, and to nullify the glorious mission of the United States as the apostle and upholder of freedom among men. Only a hopeless fanatic would regard the rigid enforcement of a Sunday law as sufficient gain to offset the formal establishment of "divine right" in the States. But this is just what all clamorers for "the American Sabbath" are doing their best to effectuate.
