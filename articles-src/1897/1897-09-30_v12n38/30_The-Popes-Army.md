## IT CONSISTS OF 600 SOLDIERS WHO GUARD THE VATICAN AND GROUNDS.

"Catholic Mirror," Sept. 11.

POPE LEO recently made a speech to a number of former officers of the papal army and it was misquoted all over the world. The Official Gazette of the Vatican promptly corrected the published statements and at the same time gave some interesting data of the papal army of to-day, which is not so insignificant by far as is generally believed.

As the prisoner in the Vatican, Leo XIII employs 600 men to guard the little strip of land and the buildings over which he is still the material as well as the spiritual lord. This army is divided into five corps, the Noble Guards taking the first place. They are recruited from Rome's "black aristocracy," that is, from those "high born" ancient families which remain true to the church despite political changes and ill luck. This troop is about fifty head strong and the Altieri is its commander.

The Swiss form the second corps, which is 100 men strong. They are all picked men, large of stature and heroic in appearance. The secretary of state himself engages them, taking his choice from thousands of candidates who send photographs and descriptions of themselves. Only citizens of the ancient "cantons" of Switzerland are admitted. These Swiss, finely uniformed and armed with Remington rifles, do service in front and about the Vatican as sentinels and guards.

The third troops are recruited from Roman citizens, and is called the Police Guard. On ordinary occasions only their officers do duty, but at State functions, such as visits of royalty and great church festivals, all are under arms. The Police Guard is officered by one general, Commander Crostarosa, two majors, four captains, and eight lieutenants. A corps of gendarmes, 100 in all, constitute the Vatican police. The members of this troop must all be horsemen, though at present they are unmounted.

All these troops are responsible to the papal ministry of arms, which is organized, though on a small scale, like the ministry of war in any of the continental monarchies, having even a special organ, a military weekly, called La Fedeltto Cattolic.
