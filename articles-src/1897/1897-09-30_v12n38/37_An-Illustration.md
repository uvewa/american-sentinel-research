THE Religious Liberty Association recently received a kind letter from a valued friend accompanied by an offering for the work to which this Association is devoted. Speaking of his remittance he says, "As I see the account of the brethren who have been arrested lately, I am impressed that I should send it in."

This seems to us to be a practical manifestation of heart religion. We submit it to the reader's candid consideration as an effective method of fulfilling the Scripture injunction: "Remember them that are in bonds as bound with them." Who among the members of the International Religious Liberty Association will imitate this worthy example?

Some time ago through the columns of the SENTINEL we invited our friends to forward their annual dues. While a goodly number responded, many have thus far failed to do so. May we not hear from such at an early date? Religious liberty literature should be circulated freely in Manitoba where a keen interest has been awakened by the recent arrest of Sabbath-keepers. This unusual opportunity should be utilized.

Soon the legislatures will convene, and another open door will be set before us. We are just informed to-day of the prosecution of a brother in Alabama, and no one can tell how frequent such cases may be. All these things call for labor and the disbursement of funds. Who will cooperate with us in this work while the privilege is still ours to enjoy?

Address International Religious Liberty Association, 39 Bond St., New York.
