You ask in a recent issue who was the author of the words, "Let us reject this decree; in matters of conscience the majority has no power." The expression is what is known as the "Protest of the Princes," and was uttered by the German Christian princes in the year 1529, before the Diet or Council of Spires.

History says that when the Reformation under Martin Luther made headway, it excited the hatred of those against whom the effort was being waged, and at one of the councils Luther was branded as an "outlaw." Although many efforts were made to crush the movement, they were apparently stayed, until in 1526 the Diet of Spires gave each State full liberty in matters of religion until a general council should be called. This was done in 1529, when it was determined to crush out all heresy.

These princes it was hoped could be induced to side against the reformers, but if not, resort would be had to the sword. Reports were circulated that the religious liberty that had been granted was giving rise to numerous disorders, and must be suppressed.

Those who had tasted something of the sweets of religious liberty were not to yield it up without a vigorous protest. A compromise was proposed that permitted preaching to be done, and services to be conducted where the work was already established, but there was to be no aggressive work. This virtually stopped the advancement of the Reformation. To the Diet this compromise appeared as a legal measure, and was passed. To disobey it, meant a struggle, loss of property, title, and possibly death; to accept it meant peace, but with it was the acknowledgment that Rome could coerce conscience and forbid free inquiry.

These noble men cared not for their lives, but for the principle involved; and with a resoluteness born only of faith in a righteous cause, they with one accord exclaimed, "Let us reject this decree; in matters of conscience the majority has no power," and it is from this that we derive the term Protestants—applied to all professed Christians outside of the Catholic Church.

W. ELLSWORTH.
