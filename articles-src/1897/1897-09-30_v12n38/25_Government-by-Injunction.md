The danger to American liberty which lies in the evidently growing use of the court injunction—usually in cases of conflicts between capital and labor—is thus stated by that very conservative journal, the Springfield Republican:—

"Thus the judge of his own motion becomes prosecutor, jury, and judge, and all the usual machinery and safeguards of justice are swept away. What would be said of an equity judge who should enjoin all people from committing any unlawful acts? Then unlawful acts would first become contempts of court, and the victims would be subject to prosecution, trial, and punishment by the judge alone. The enormity of such a proceeding is palpable."
