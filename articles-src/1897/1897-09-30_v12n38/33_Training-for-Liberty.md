RELIGIOUS liberty is just as essential for young people as it is for the "old folks." Youth is the proper time in life to learn what religious liberty means. How many of the youthful members of families into which the SENTINEL comes, I wonder, can tell what religious liberty is and why it is valuable?

If people do not learn this in their youth, they are very apt not to know it when they grow up, or to lose it because they do not appreciate its value.

Youth is the time in which the real preparation is made for after life. What is thoroughly learned in youth, generally sticks to the individual as long as he lives.

All the life that we live in this world is but a preparation for liberty in the life to come. Why do we need this preparation?—It is because we could not be trusted with liberty without it.

Without liberty, life would not be worth living. And God, who has created us all, designs that we shall have a life that is worth living. So he intends that we shall have perfect liberty.

In youth, we must be trained so that we can be entrusted with liberty. A baby cannot be given its liberty. It must be watched almost constantly to prevent harm from coming to it. A little child must be watched almost as carefully.

But no individual can be watched in everything which concerns his welfare, all through life. The time comes when he must be left to decide things for himself; and even if this were not so, to be under the constant supervision of another in everything would make existence most unpleasant.

So as the child grows up, it should be taught how to enjoy liberty without receiving harm. And in this the chief harm to be guarded against is of course that which can reach it through the avenue of the mind.

The one and only safeguard against such harm is the love of right principles. No harm can be received while these control the mind. Right principles are God's principles, and he has set them forth for all the world in the precepts of his law. This law is called in the Bible the "law of liberty." Only in the pathway of this law can real and perfect liberty be enjoyed. The expression is, therefore, most appropriate.

The right training and education for the child is that which writes this law upon his heart.

In order to receive this training, the child must be taught to exercise his own judgment and conscience. He must be shown the right way, and then left free to choose to walk in it. If he does not, he must, of course, be corrected. But to take away his freedom of choice at the start, would be no benefit to him, but an injury.

Religious liberty means that an individual shall be left free to exercise his own will and conscience in all matters which concern his relation to God. He must have this freedom if his will and conscience are to be developed; and these must be developed, and the development must begin in childhood. It is these that give character to the individual; and childhood is the easiest time to form right character.

So don't think, dear young reader, that religious liberty is something that doesn't concern you, but is only for grown-up people who live where the law forbids them to work on Sunday. Whatever our circumstances in life, we are all forming character by the exercise of the same God-given rights. And at no time are we forming character faster than in youth.
