There is no relaxation of the persecution of dissenters from the State church in Russia. It is now reported that "a congress of high Russian ecclesiastics of the Greek Catholic denomination is considering measures to 'stop the spread of sectarianism,' by which is meant the teaching of any other than the orthodox religion. The ecclesiastics have decided to ask the government to restrain the adherents of Tolstoi as 'dangerous to the Church and State.' They also propose to take away the children of the unorthodox and educate them as Catholics. One bishop went so far as to suggest that the property of dissenters be confiscated."
