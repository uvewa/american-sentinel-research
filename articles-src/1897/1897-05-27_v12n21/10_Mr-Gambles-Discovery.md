THE Rev. W. F. Crafts wades in the May Christian Endeaverer of "The Saturde Jans' Waterloo," which he says has been occasioned by Mr. Gamble's "great discovery" about the Sabbath. But the cause of the seventh day Sabbath has met a good many "Waterloos" of this kind and is still moving on without any mark of having ever been defeated.
