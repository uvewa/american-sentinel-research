JOSEPH FINK, of Nanuet, was on his way to church last Sunday, when he saw Farmer Farrell ploughing in his field.

"Why, Brother Farrell," he said, "working on the sabbath?"

"Yes," said the worker, "been delayed by the pesky rains, and got to get things under ground, you know."

Brother Fink forgot about church, and ran off to Justice Haerle's to get a warrant. Justice Haerle issued it and Constable Snyder served it, all on the sabbath.

Brother Farrell was fined $5 for breaking Section 263 of the Penal Code, and Brother Fink felt as good as if he had heard a bushel of sermons.
