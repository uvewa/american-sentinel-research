The three cent car fare law which was put into operation in Indianapolis two weeks ago has been declared null and void by a federal judge from Chicago. The judge says it is a piece of special legislation, but whatever it may be there is no evading the fact that the Constitution of the United States never contemplated any such interference with the rights of a sovereign State as this decision forms. It is a most flagrant usurpation. Judge Showalter, who rendered the judgment in this highly important case, denied that the Supreme Court of Indiana has any right to pass upon the matter in controversy. It is a great disappointment to find that the three cent car fare can be abrogated in defiance of the will of the people.

The corporation magnates are naturally highly delighted at the victory they have won. A curious feature is the wholesale series of injunctions issued by Judge Showalter. In the first place he enjoins the State prosecutor from enforcing the law. He enjoins the governor of the State from executing it. He enjoins the city officials in Indianapolis from recognizing the law, and he enjoins the street railway company from receiving a three-cent car fare. It seems very strange that a Chicago official can thus govern the whole State of Indiana. Government by injunction is evidently capable of infinite expansion and application.

We should not now hear any more nonsense about the will of the people being the supreme law.
