If men believed the scriptural truth that in the last days "wicked men and seducers shall wax worse and worse" until the Son of man returns to destroy sin and sinners, it would revolutionize church methods. Men would cease trying to save a ship-wrecked world and redouble their efforts to save sinners out of the world. They would drop all National Reform and Christian citizenship schemes of saving the State and go to saving sinners. Knowing this to be true, we print below two articles from prominent evangelists on the subject of the second coming of Christ.
