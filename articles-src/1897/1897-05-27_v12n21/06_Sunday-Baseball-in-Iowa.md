It is reported that the Iowa legislature has undertaken to suppress Sunday baseball in that State, by a bill which prohibits all persons from engaging in that game on Sunday, with the exception of observers of the seventh day.

We do not think the latter will be likely to take any advantage of this exemption, for they are not noted as players of baseball, either on Sundays or other days. But the fact that the exemption is made on religious grounds,—that is, the observance of another day as the Sabbath—gives the law itself a religious stamp.

It would certainly be most inconsistent to allow a game of baseball on Sunday by observers of the seventh day, and at the same time prohibit the like exhibition on the part of other classes of people. As an exchange remarks, "A Seventh-day Baptist 'inshoot,' or an Adventist 'home run,' must be just as disturbing to the peace as any other kind. There is no denomination in baseball." It would certainly be hard to give an explanation that would satisfy an average community to the contrary.

That legislators should feel bound to make such a discrimination, in order to escape restricting freedom of conscience, shows that something must be wrong with the Sunday law itself. It is so manifestly unjust to prohibit those who conscientiously observe another day from doing work on Sunday that almost every State in the Union exempts them from the penalties for such work; and on the other hand it is manifestly absurd to say that there is any difference between plowing, carpentering, or baseball playing on Sunday by persons of one denomination, and the same by individuals of any other denomination. There is nothing denominational about work or recreation.

Hence we are driven by both reason and justice back to the starting point of all Sunday legislation, and find that we become involved in wrong the moment such legislation is undertaken.
