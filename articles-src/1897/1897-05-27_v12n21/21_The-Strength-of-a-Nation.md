THE true strength of a nation, or of a society, is never determinable by rough mass measurements, or long insurable against lapse and loss if, after the manner of Asiatic despotisms, the few are allowed to treat the many as though they were their natural born or accidentally subjugated serfs. Power in the last analysis is personal rather than popular. That nation alone can survive in history where the individual factor stands out sharp and clear. . . . Virtue in bulk, and piety by proxy, will not do. Not any number of serfs, howsoever many they be, make nations, make fames, make histories, but only intelligent, self-assertive freemen. We cannot calculate from any amount of corraled cattle. The real unit is the man, not the mass. Historic totals are footed up beginning with the lowest-written integers, and if any ciphers are admitted to Time's enduring columns, it is not the ciphers which take precedence of, but those which follow after the human units. The man is the measure of mankind.
