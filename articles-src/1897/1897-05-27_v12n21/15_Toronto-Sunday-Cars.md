The vote taken in Toronto, May 15, on the question of running street cars on Sunday, resulted in a victory for those demanding Sunday cars, by a small majority. Toronto can now no longer be spoken of as the model "Sabbath-keeping" city. It is doubtless a great disappointment to the defeated side not to be able longer to compel people to walk on Sunday who would prefer riding, but they can console themselves with the reflection that they and all others are just as free to walk as they were before.
