Miss B., a bright young lady of ——ville, had become convinced that Scripture requires the observance of the seventh day of the week, instead of the first day, as the Sabbath; but the Rev. Mr. C., pastor of the Church of the Venerable Tradition, very lucidly showed her that not any specific day, but only a seventh part of time,—any one day in seven—was all the commandment requires to be observed. Meeting her one day shortly after, he said:—

"Good morning, Mary; I hear you are married now."

"Yes; I married one of Mr. Brown's sons," was the reply.

"Mr. Brown has a fine family of sons—seven of them, I believe. Which one did you marry?"

"Oh, no one in particular; I just married one seventh of them," said Mary, while her eyes twinkled.

"Oh—ah—yes—I see, I see," gasped the discomfited pastor, as he resumed his walk.
