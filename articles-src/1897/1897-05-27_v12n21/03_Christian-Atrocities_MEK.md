The above heading may strike our readers as a misnomer, and in one sense it is. No real Christian can do an atrocious act, and hence such a thing as a Christian atrocity cannot be. But we have used the term "Christian" here in the accommodated sense, the same as it is used in the expression "Christian nation."

Christians do not fight; Christian nations do; Christians do not take property from other Christians by violence; Christian nations do; Christians with lowliness of mind esteem others better than themselves; a Christian nation looks with a high disdain upon other Christian nations and thinks itself and its institutions and ways the best.

So there is a very great difference between the spirit of a Christian and the spirit of a Christian nation—so much so that we shall have to conclude, either that a Christian is not a Christian, or that a Christian nation has no right to such a high-sounding profession.

If we apply the rule laid down by an inspired apostle, "He that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he [Christ] is righteous," and "He that committeth sin is of the devil," to men and to nations, we shall be forced to the conclusion that Christians who have attained to a righteous and peaceful life by faith in Christ are righteous, are Christians, and may properly be called so; but that nations which have not so attained but which practise selfishness, fraud, robbery, and even murder—mis-called war—are not Christian at all. And that they are not Christians, though often called so, we refer again to the idea of Christian atrocities.

Adopting the spirit and nomenclature of the times we note that the Moslems and Christians are fighting in Thessaly and in the island of Crete. The war broke out in Crete by a rebellion of the Christians against the Moslems.

The great Christian nations of Europe think that they have attained to the high ideal of fighting in a thoroughly Christian manner because they do not kill their prisoners nor the women and children of the opposing party. But the Cretan Christians who are now receiving so much sympathy have not yet attained that exalted state of Christianity where they kill only men! The seaport towns of Crete are filled with Moslem women and children who bear in their bodies the marks of the Christian, but they are not like the marks of the Lord Jesus that Paul bore. No. Women with their breasts cut off, children mutilated in every manner, may be seen in the hospitals. Such atrocious actions might be expected of the wild Kurds of the Armenian mountains who profess the religion of Mohammed; but what about the Greek Christian, boasting of his civilization, of his religion, and posing before Europe as a hero, doing such things!

Christian atrocities! Let the world ponder it and learn that as true as the saying that "All is not gold that glitters," so all is not Christian which passes under that name; and in nothing is the name Christian so abused and disgraced as in the very common expression, "Christian nation."
