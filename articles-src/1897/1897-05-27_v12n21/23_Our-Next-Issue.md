Our issue of May 3 will not be a "special," but it will be of special interest to all our readers. Inasmuch as it is issued near the time when the thoughts of the people are directed to the fruits of war,—when they decorate the graves of those who fell in the late struggle, the SENTINEL will devote considerable space to militarism. Excellent cuts will illustrate the preparations for war. Extra copies can be had at the usual price.
