To know God and Jesus Christ is to keep the commandments. That this is true will be evident by reading John 17:3: "And this is life eternal that they might know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent;" and Matt. 19:16, 17: "And, behold, one came and said unto him, Good Master, what good thing shall I do that I may have eternal life? And he said unto him . . . If thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments."

Not only is this true, but the keeping of the commandments is evidence that one knows God. Proof. 1 John 2:3: "And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments." Not that one knows God as the result of keeping the commandments, but that he keep the commandments as the result of knowing God.

It is the bounden duty, apart from the idea of its being a blessed privilege, of every man to "fear God, and keep his commandments." It is because of failure to do this that sin and iniquity abound on every hand and in every conceivable form.

Jesus Christ came into this world with the boundless love of God in his heart, to so reveal the Father that He might bring people to recognize Him and render a willing obedience to His will.

Every word and act on the part of Jesus was with this supreme end in view. In doing this he went forth relying wholly upon God, and trusting in the arm of the Infinite.

In the hearts of all who should yield themselves to Christ there would be implanted that which would not only enable them to love God with all their heart, but also love their neighbors as themselves. This would not only make them good Christians, but would also make them good citizens, rendering honor to whom honor is due, tribute to whom tribute, always remembering that the "powers that be are ordained of God."

Christ worked always and only in harmony with principles, the recognition of which would contribute to the stability of any government—even the principles of the government of God.

It is because these principles are not recognized that the governments of earth are not enduring,—or rather, had these principles alway been recognized, there never would have been but one government—that of God, extending throughout all creation.

As the principles taught and preached by Jesus Christ are not recognized by the governments of earth, and only through these can the stability of any government be maintained, it follows that the time will inevitably come when earthly governments will cease to be, to give place however to the everlasting kingdom of Christ.

When our Lord left this earth he gave to his disciples the great commission of preaching the gospel to every creature, equipping them for that work by endowing them with power from on high—by giving them the gift of the Holy Spirit. They were to be as he was, and just as the Father had sent him into the world, even so sent he them—armed with the same mind.

But it is evident that some of the professed followers of Christ have sought to improve upon his methods. The chief thing that Christ kept in view has—if not altogether ignored—been made secondary, while they have set about reforming the State, making that their chief business. To accomplish this they have sought to secure legislation compelling the observance of God's law. This the Saviour never did, for the simple reason that he knew that that method would not, because it could not, accomplish the desired result.

The great evil, so they think, at which they aim in their work of reform(?) is that of Sunday desecration. This, they say, is a violation of the law of God, supposing Sunday to be the Sabbath. Just what connection Sunday sustains to the Sabbath of the Decalogue has never been shown. Even a cursory glance at the fourth commandment will reveal the fact that Sunday is not the Sabbath, for that reads "the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God," while every body knows that Sunday is not the seventh day, but the first.

As a matter of fact the first day, as such, is not mentioned in the commandment, and only has a place there by virtue of its being one of the six days in which God made the heavens and the earth, and because of which He says to His creatures, Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work. According to the commandment, therefore, Sunday is only a common working day.

Not only does the fourth commandment show that Sunday is not the Sabbath, but the whole Bible will show the same thing.

This being so, it will be seen that even though their methods of securing obedience to the law of God were correct, all their efforts must end in complete failure, for they are expended in behalf of the wrong day.

This will explain why it is they are seeking human help, instead of relying upon God's power, for Sunday as a Sabbath is only a human institution. But on the other hand, if Sunday were the right day, their methods are wrong.

The violation of the Sabbath, like that of all the other commandments, has its source in the heart. Make the heart right, therefore, and there will be no trouble on the score of Sabbath desecration, or any other evil.

No human law ever enacted could do more than bring about a pretended observance of the day, while it would be adding another to the victim's long list of sins—the sin of hypocrisy.

No human law ever enacted, or that shall ever be enacted, or all of them put together, can ever make a man know the Lord. And as no man can ever really obey any one of God's commandments without his knowing God it follows that the only way in which this work can be done is to simply do as Jesus did—preach the gospel of the grace of God, relying upon the arm of the Infinite One for success.
