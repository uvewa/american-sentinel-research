It appears that the Catholics are not, after all, to get their Government chapel at West Point. Attorney-General McKenna has delivered an opinion in the matter, denying the power of Secretary Alger to grant a lease of Government ground at West Point for a longer term than five years, and this limited concession will not answer the purpose which the Catholic authorities have in view.

The facts which led up to the present situation are these: Secretary Lamont, during the administration of Mr. Cleveland, granted "Father" O'Keefe, the Catholic priest at West Point, the privilege of erecting a chapel on ground designated by the commandant, the license for which was to be revoked by the Secretary of War on sixty days' notice. Secretary Alger extended the time of notice to six months. "Father" O'Keefe then proposed that he would erect a stone chapel, costing $20,000, which, on completion, he would present to the United States on condition that it should be used in perpetuity for the celebration of Catholic religious services. The matter came before the Attorney-General, and in his decision he says:

"This case came before me, and after carefully reviewing all the statutes I decided that the Secretary of War had no color of law to accept a gift such as Father O'Keefe contemplated. I reviewed every statute covering any phase of the matter as to the Secretary's right to grant such a license as was given by both Secretaries Lamont and Alger. On these I decided that it would be impossible to grant such a license without further legislation, and remitted the proposition to Congress.

"There is one statute giving the Secretary of War the power to lease any Government property in his care, not in use, for a period of five years. I could not satisfy myself that the erection of a stone church of the cost and dimensions determined came within the provisions of the law. The fact that the United States reserved to itself the right to revoke the lease or license did not cover the ground, because the mere fact of the erection of such a building contemplated a perpetuity. Such an expense would not be incurred unless the parties tacitly understood that the United States would refrain from exercising its rights.

"This would confront the Government with enduring a perpetuity not contemplated by law, or at some time or in some emergency exercising a right in a manner that might seem invidious. Therefore, because of the absence of sufficient statutes and also on the ground of good public policy, I decided that the Secretary had not power to grant the license sought by Father O'Keefe. My decision is very full and covers all the points. Religious sentiments did not enter into it."

We must not omit to notice the fact that Attorney-General McKenna is a Roman Catholic. It might be thought that he would have decided the matter in a different way, but he says that "religious sentiments did not enter into it," and we are glad to give him the credit of acting in an unbiased, honorable manner. All honor to upright men, whether Roman Catholics or otherwise. The SENTINEL has nothing against Roman Catholics. It has nothing against men of any shade or unbelief. It opposes only what it believes to be evil principles.
