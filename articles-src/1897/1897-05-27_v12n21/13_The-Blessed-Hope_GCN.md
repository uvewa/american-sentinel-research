"Looking for the blessed hope and appearing of the glory of our great God and Saviour Jesus Christ."

A blessed hope means a happy one. The word refers to inward enjoyment apart from external environment. The expectations implied in such a hope make all present circumstances of trial or depression "not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed to usward. For the earnest expectation of the creation waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God."

### IT IS A PURIFYING HOPE.

"And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure."

As linen bleaches under the sun, the light of this hope cleanses the life from world stains. It loosens the grasp from the things of earth.

The man who has a magnificent mansion in some beautiful locality, and is only tarrying in a city hotel for a few days till he can journey home, will not care to spend his time and money in elaborately decorating his temporary loging in the strange city. If he purchases bric-abrac or pictures, the thought in his mind is, "I will take them home." So the Christian, who reckons himself a "pilgrim and a stranger" here, will have little heart to spend his energies on things pertaining merely to the earthly. His city and his home lie beyond. His great concern will be to "lay up treasures in heaven."

### IT IS A PACIFYING HOPE.

"Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who will both bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts; and then shall every man have praise of God." "Be patient, therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord. Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath long patience for it, until he receive the early and the latter rain. Be ye also patient; stablish your hearts; for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh."

In the power of this hope all questions of provocation can be patiently laid aside for the Lord to settle on his arrival. The child of God who is pervaded with this hope will be willing to waive all rights of self-vindication, knowing that his "labor of love and patience of hope" will not go unrewarded.

### IT IS A COMFORTING HOPE.

"But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not even as others which have no hope."

The lustre of this hope shines most conspicuously in the consolation it brings to those who are called to part with their loved ones by death. The unbelieving bury their dead without any certain or definite expectation of re-union. For in no human scheme of philosophy is the truth of a resurrection even hinted at. But the Scriptures definitely promise this. "For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him." The Apostle Paul, after explaining all this to the Thessalonian Christians, and showing them the immense advantage they had over the heathen who knew nothing about the advent in majesty of Jesus Christ, or of the resurrection, adds finally, "Wherefore comfort one another with these words."

### IT IS A GLORIOUS HOPE.

"For our citizenship is in heaven; from whence also we wait for a Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ; who shall fashion anew the body of our humiliation that it may be conformed to the body of his glory, according to the working whereby he is able even to subject all things unto himself." "By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac; and he that received the promises offered up his only begotten son, of whom it was said, that in Isaac shall thy seed be called; accounting that God was able to raise him up, even from the dead; from whence also he received him in a figure. . . . Women received their dead raised to life again; and others were tortured, not accepting deliverance; that they might obtain a better resurrection."

This hope would be meaningless apart from the locality and the circumstances where it anchors itself. It leaps over time and space to the period when Jesus Christ shall himself be glorified as King of kings according to the eternal purpose of the Father.

### PROMISES.

This blessed hope embraces several promised glories:

1. We shall be with Christ. Not as in death, when we are said to be "unclothed" and "waiting to be clothed upon with our house from heaven." In an actual sense we shall "see Him as He is," and be ourselves like him, personally and morally.

2. We shall be beyond sinning. Now we groan for deliverance. Pain and the curse encompass us. The consummation of that hope will bring full redemption to the body.

3. We shall know as we are known. "Now we see through a glass darkly; but then face to face; now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known."
