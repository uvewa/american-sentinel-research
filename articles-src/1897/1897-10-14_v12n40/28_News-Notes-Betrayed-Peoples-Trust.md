OCCASIONALLY the new party, or the old party, that has been for some time "out of a job," gets into power, and the people wait for it to put its promises into effect. And after they have waited awhile, and the promised reforms and other benefits do not materialize, they learn with indignation and grief that the party has "shamefully betrayed the people's trust" (or words to that effect) and there must be another "turning out" of the "rascals" before good government can be attained. This has been the record of every party that has been in power in American politics for many years.
