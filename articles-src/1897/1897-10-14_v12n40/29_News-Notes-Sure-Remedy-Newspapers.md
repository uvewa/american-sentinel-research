THIS condition of things prevails in spite of the fact that it is very easy to discover a "sure remedy." For you can find such a remedy set forth in the columns of every newspaper. It is amusing to note the air of assurance with which our political journals set forth just what mistakes were made by the people in the last election, just where the successful party has been recreant to its duty, and just what is needed to realize that condition of things for which the country has long been looking. It is related of the Confederate General Lee that having his attention called at one time to the way in which the Southern journals criticised the campaigns of the armies and pointed out the mistakes of his generals and just what ought to be done to insure great victories in the immediate future, he remarked: "I had thought that we had the best men to command our armies that could be chosen for the place; but I now see that we have only second-rate men for the army, and that our ablest generals have been left at home to edit the newspapers." It is not recorded, however, that he found occasion to call for the services of any of these "ablest generals" in the field.
