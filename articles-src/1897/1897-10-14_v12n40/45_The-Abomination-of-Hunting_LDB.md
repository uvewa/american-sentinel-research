A traveler in India made the acquaintance of a heathen monk. This man, however beclouded his mind may have been in matters of religion, had a tender heart and his words may well be weighed by those who are blessed with greater light.

The young traveler often conversed with the kind-hearted monk, who was ever ready to instruct him on many points in connection with his heathenish religion. With reference to hunting he gave his young friend sound advice. The monk was entirely opposed to the practice.

Here are the words of the traveler: "As often as I went to the forest, with my gun on the shoulder, he would look at me sorrowfully. One day he said to me earnestly, 'O, young man of good nature, whose parents are blessed, inasmuch as they take no pleasure in wickedness, and abhor cruelty, why do you persecute the poor animals with so much persistence? What harm have they done? Why should the earth, which Nature has given to them, be stained with their blood? How can you, unfeelingly, see these happy and beautifully plumed creatures, who fill the forest with their songs, tumble down at your feet? How can you, without emotion, behold their sufferings and death throes of which you are the cause? Is there any honor in this wanton destruction of life? Where is your manly feeling? Are you devoid of that feeling of pity that elevates a man? Has the Almighty not imparted a sense of feeling to the animals that he has placed under dominion, as well as to you? Would the amputation of a member not cause you intense feeling? Consider how much more must these little creatures, whose fine nerves are ever so much more sensitive, suffer through your murderous weapon. Be merciful! You rejoice when you cause the innocent turtle-dove to tumble precipitately from the tree, and it is sport in your eyes to behold the poor bird wallowing in its blood! And, think of it, even should the unfortunate songster escape your hands, the harmless creature will find its way into some brushwood, where it will miserably perish in agony!"

"His dignified countenance full of sympathy, his pleading, the tears that coursed over his cheeks, all these touched my heart! I felt ashamed that I had been so thoughtless, and that I had not realized how unworthy and contemptible it is to kill a poor harmless animal simply for amusement. I felt convinced that I had done what was unjust, and that I had practiced cruelty and tyranny toward the weak and innocent. What! I who abhor cruelty and tyranny!

"I promised my friend eventually that I would hunt no more, and I kept my promise. From that time I once and for all gave up that inhuman amusement. It lost all its charms, and to this day I abhor it. Never since that time have I ever hurt an animal, not even the very least, far less have I killed any living thing for mere sport or pastime."—L. D. B., in South African Sentinel.
