In one way and another, from time to time, pressure is being brought to bear upon the United States Government to force from it an endorsement of the Sunday sabbath. In the summer of 1892 Congress yielded to this pressure and passed a law for closing the gates of the World's Fair on Sunday. The Sunday-closing of post-offices has for years been authorized by the post-office department at Washington in deference to the demands of the Sunday-observing element; and now an effort is being made by the citizens of Pittsburg, Pa., to induce the government, through the War Department, to commit itself definitely to the enforcement of Sunday observance. The matter is set forth in the following from the Evening Star (Washington, D. C.), of September 23, last:—

"Acting Secretary Meiklejohn, of the War Department, has been called upon to decide a troublesome question in connection with the public observance of Sunday. A few months ago the government purchased the locks, dams, and other improvements of the Monongahela River at a cost of over $3,000,000, and opened the river to free navigation. This action was taken in pursuance of an act of Congress.

"Since then the river has been used to a considerable extent by vessels carrying excursion parties, who usually chose Sundays for their merrymaking for the reason that Sundays were the only days they were not at work. The practice was exceedingly objectionable to the church element of Pittsburg, and a strong movement was started to stop what was termed the 'desecration of the Sabbath.' All other efforts to stop the practice having failed, an appeal was made to the War Department, which has charge of the operation of the locks.

"The appeal came in the form of a petition signed by many thousand persons residing in Pittsburg and vicinity. It represented the demoralizing effects of these Sunday river excursions upon the community in general, and upon the young people in particular, and prayed the secretary of war to stop the practice so far as the Monongahela River is concerned, by refusing to open the locks to excursion boats on Sundays.

"The authorities of the War Department question their right to discriminate against any class of boats desiring to navigate the river on Sunday or any other day, but in order to get full, unprejudiced information on the subject, they have referred the petition to Major Powell, the engineer officer in special charge of the government river and harbor works in that vicinity.

"The religious people of the smoky city are thoroughly in earnest in the matter and are using their best endeavors to induce the War Department to aid them in enforcing a recognition of the Christian sabbath by making Sunday excursions on the Monongahela impossible. In view of the important and delicate character of the question, involving as it does questions of personal and religious rights, it is probable that the acting secretary of war will secure an opinion from the attorney-general before taking final action in the premises. Meanwhile, the department will not interfere with the privileges of excursion parties so long as the river is open to free navigation."

Of course, there is not a shadow of right by which "the religious people" of Pittsburg can call upon the government to "aid them in enforcing a recognition of the Christian sabbath." As surely as it is true that this is a "government of the people, by the people, and for the people," and not government of the people by a class of the people and for that class, so surely is the government bound by every consideration of right and honor not to discriminate between any class of its citizens.

The national Constitution expressly forbids any religious legislation on the part of Congress, and thereby plainly enjoins the government from attempting to help "religious people" in "enforcing a recognition of the Christian sabbath."

But it remains to be seen whether the War Department will ignore these patent truths and defer to the demands of the class who are trying to get the government definitely committed to a policy of Sunday enforcement. But against it all the SENTINEL enters its most emphatic protest.
