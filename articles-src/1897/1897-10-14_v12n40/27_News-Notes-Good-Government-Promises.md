PROBABLY there was never a time when so much was heard about "good government" as is heard to-day. It is the leading cry of each one of the political parties in its appeal for the support of the people. It is the subject of their loudest promises. When once it is in power, says each one, there will be no more of this, that, or the other obnoxious features which have prevailed under the preceding régime. Some force is generally lent to these assertions by the fact that the people are very generally suffering from bad government. In their ardent hope for something better, the people continue to put faith in these promises, as a drowning man clutches at a straw.
