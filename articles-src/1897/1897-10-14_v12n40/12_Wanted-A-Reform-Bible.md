To meet the demands of some of the prominent religious "reform" movements of the day, we need a new Bible, in which there shall be some very material alterations of important texts. For instance, the first verses of Isaiah 61 would need to read like this:—

The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me; because the Lord hath anointed me to preach the gospel of Christian citizenship; he hath sent me to bind the transgressors of the law, to proclaim captivity to Sabbath desecrators, and the closing of the prison doors upon many that are at liberty; to proclaim the turning of all bad men out of political office, and the reformation of the world by the power of civil law.

Of course, those who are engaged in these "Christian" reform movements are moved by the Spirit of the Lord; hence the text must be altered which sets forth what the Spirit of the Lord moves a person to do!

O, how much better it would be if these reformers—who have not a doubt that they are doing Christian work—would alter their conduct to fit the text, instead of trying to find a text to fit their conduct!
