"New York Journal," October 5.

An old New Jersey law was revived yesterday, and should a wheelman in that State ride on Sunday for any other purpose than that of seeking medical aid or going to church, he does so at his own risk, and is not under the protection of the law.

This was exemplified in the court of Justice William H. Harrison, of Hackensack, Bergen County.

The complainants in the case were the Garlick brothers, of Paterson. They were riding a tandem through Rochelle Park on Sunday, September 19, when they were run into by a wagon driven and belonging to Henry Leswing, of Rochelle Park. The result was a suit against Leswing, demanding $100 for the loss of the tandem.

Prosecutor Stagg startled the court by citing the old and almost forgotten law. The judge looked embarrassed, but finally rallied and said:

"The law extends no protection to law-breakers, and riding a bicycle for pleasure on Sunday is against the law of this State."

Justice Harrison thereupon decided the case against the complainants.
