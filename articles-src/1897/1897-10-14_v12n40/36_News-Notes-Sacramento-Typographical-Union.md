The Sacramento (Cal.) Typographical Union has resolved that its members shall not buy any goods on Sunday nor patronize any store that keeps open on that day. In this matter the members of the union surrender their individuality to that of the organization, and in so doing, part with just that much of their God-given manhood. The San Francisco Star approves the resolution.
