WHAT is the matter, anyway? Does the trouble lie in the principles upon which the government is established? Were the statesmen wrong in their political views who wrote the Declaration of Independence and drafted the Constitution?—No; these documents are just as good to-day, in themselves, as they ever were. The failure has not been in them, but in that very fallible thing through which they were to be applied; namely, human nature. And in this the failure has been very great.

It seems to take people a long time to learn—if indeed they ever will learn—that there cannot be good government in a republic without good people. The more good people there are, the better will be the government, because the less government will be needed, and the people can be left more free to be a government directly to themselves. The problem of good government would be very much simplified if we could dispense with our prisons, our liquor saloons, our reformatory institutions, and our courts of justice. And the only reason that this cannot be done is that human nature is so bad that these things are absolutely demanded.
