**THE Pittsburg Catholic, of September 2, says:**—

"If there are circumstances in which the union of Church and State are to the advantage of religion, there are assuredly others in which it is detrimental to spiritual interests. In Portugal, ever since the days of Pombal, there has been a strong disposition in royal and governmental quarters to keep the church in fetters. The Holy See has struggled hard to secure the necessary independence for the church, but it has been only partially successful, and has had, no doubt, to tolerate many encroachments which it would fain have prevented. This is the secret of the state of servitude to which the ecclesiastical authorities have been reduced in Portugal. For instance, all the parishes are under the king's patronage and are given away by the government, the bishop merely assuring himself of the canonical fitness of the candidates. This, it may be imagined, leads at times to the pernicious exercise of political influence by deputies and others. Aspirants to the priesthood must also obtain the consent of the State, to which they are compelled on their ordination to pay a sum of two or three pounds. The system is responsible for numerous defects, if not scandals, and a Center Party has been started with the object of bringing about a reform."

When the Church is under the supervision of the State, as in this instance, "the church" has no difficulty in seeing the evils of Church-and-State union. In the Dark Ages the State was under the control of the Church, and a return to that régime is what the papacy earnestly desires to-day. Then she would have no complaints to make in behalf of "the church," but the result would be no less fatal to pure religion, and even more fatal to individual freedom and the sacred rights of conscience, than is that which follows from the domination of Church interests by the State.
