Mr. John Stoffela, a merchant of Yuma, Ariz., was recently arrested and fined $50 for violation of a Sunday-closing ordinance passed by the common council of Yuma not long since. This ordinance is said to be the first Sunday legislation ever enacted in Arizona. Mr. Stoffela suffers this penalty for choosing to exercise his own judgment in the matter of keeping his store open on Sunday. It is his own store, and he takes the risk of any harm that may come to his trade from so doing; and this is all the risk that any person could reasonably be asked to run under such circumstances.
