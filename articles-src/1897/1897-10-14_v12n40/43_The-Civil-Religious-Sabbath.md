JOHNNIE.—Mama, what is the civil sabbath that the preacher told us about this morning?

MAMA.—He meant, Johnnie, that everybody ought to rest one day in seven.

Johnnie.—Which day, mama?

Mama.—Why, Sunday, I suppose.

Johnnie.—But you and papa have been resting on Sunday all the time, and so have lots of other folks. Were you having a civil sabbath?

Mama.—Oh, no, Johnnie; we rest on Sunday because it is the day when Christ rose from the dead. We call it the Christian sabbath.

Johnnie.—But mama, if Sunday is the Christian sabbath, how can it be a civil sabbath?

Mama.—I suppose the State makes it a civil sabbath, by commanding people to rest on it.

Johnnie.—Then if the Lord made Sunday a religious sabbath, and the State makes it a civil sabbath, which is it?

Mama.—Why—I—I suppose it's a civil sabbath to people who rest because the State commands it, and a religious sabbath to people who rest because they are religious. What makes you ask such questions, anyway?

Johnnie.—Oh, nothing, mama; only I want to get this all straight in my mind, so I'll understand it. I don't see where the difference comes in if I rest one Sunday because the State commands it, and then do just the same thing next Sunday on account of my religion. It would be all the same thing, wouldn't it?

Mama.—Well, Johnnie, I don't know as I can explain it to you, but you know the Bible says that God made the Sabbath, so it's a religious day. But the State says people must have a civil sabbath, too, by resting on the first day of the week.

Johnnie.—Then if the State calls for a civil sabbath, mama, and my religion calls for a religious Sabbath, both on the same day, which call am I to obey?

Mama.—Oh, we don't keep the civil sabbath, Johnnie; our Sabbath is religious; and so it is with all people who are religious.

Johnnie.—But wouldn't the State arrest us, mama, if we should break the civil sabbath by working on Sunday?

Mama.—Why—yes; I suppose we might be arrested for that; some people have been, not very long ago.

Johnnie.—Then if we don't need a civil sabbath, but keep Sunday because we are religious, would the State punish us for not being religious, if we should work next Sunday?

Mama.—I declare, Johnnie, you're getting terribly inquisitive; who put all those questions into your head? You'll have to ask the minister about it the next time he comes here to tea. I can't stop to answer more such questions now.

Johnnie.—All right, mama; but I don't believe he can tell any more about it than you have. The fact is, I don't see any sense in a civil sabbath, and I believe it's all a humbug. If God made the Sabbath, and commands everybody to keep it, that settles it, and I don't see what more people can want. Anyway, that's good enough for me.
