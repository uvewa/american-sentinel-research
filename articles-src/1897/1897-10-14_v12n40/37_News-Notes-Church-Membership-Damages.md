The newspapers report that in Pittsburg, Pa., a man who had been expelled from church membership, entered suit for, and actually obtained $100 damages for "loss of his spiritual life." It is silly enough in all conscience for a man to think that spiritual life consists of church membership; but it is both silliness and perfect blundering blindness for any court in the United States to entertain any such complaint and to put through any such case. However, in these days of the confusion of civil and religious things, the point has been reached where we need not be surprised to see courts doing the most senseless things possible.
