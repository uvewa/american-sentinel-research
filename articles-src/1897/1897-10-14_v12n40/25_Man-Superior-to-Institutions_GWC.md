There is evidently a vast deal of misconception in the minds of many people in regard to the office and importance of the existing institutions of men.

Take, for example, the Sabbath, as instituted by the Lord in Eden. The royal seventh day, placed in the bosom of the royal law amid the thunders of Sinai, coming to man bearing the seal of divinity, is beneficent and glorious when legitimately employed in sweet communion with its Author. But note the general ruin that followed the institution of the papal Sunday that was foisted upon the world under the iron rule of Rome in A. D. 321.

It was never designed by God that any institution should cramp and dwarf and work hardship to mankind. When any institution does this we may be sure it is neither of God nor under the sanction of God. The Lord Jesus said, "The Sabbath was made for man," not man for the Sabbath. It was never the purpose of God to sacrifice any man to an institution; but on the contrary it was his purpose to make all institutions contribute to man's highest happiness and everlasting good.

This noble government of ours was established, evidently, under the guidance of God, that the victims of ecclesiastical tyranny might have the rest and peace which they could enjoy only where religious liberty has the safeguard of the supreme law of the nation. Institutions were made for man, and not man for institutions. This must be the correct interpretation of the Saviour's words as applied more broadly to all the institutions utilized by man.

There is another saying of the Saviour that will, no doubt, apply here, and that is, "Ry their fruits ye shall know them." The truth is, that the institutions of men are all of them more or less established in error; and when once established, there are thousands ready to sustain them as they are rather than with good and honest hearts to amend them the more completely to serve the public good.

Institutions should serve mankind, not enslave them.
