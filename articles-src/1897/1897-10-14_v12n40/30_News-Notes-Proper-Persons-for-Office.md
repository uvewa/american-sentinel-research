THE people are assured that the only thing necessary to the realization of "good government" is the election of the proper persons to office. But it seems very hard to discover the proper persons, or, when discovered, to get them installed into the coveted positions of public trust. It is no longer left to the old parties to select these individuals. "Faith" in the old parties is on the wane, but not faith in the magic power of the ballot. Still believing in the potency of the latter to evolve all the necessary conditions of the long-sought "good government," new parties are entering the arena of political contention, and even the forces of religion are joining in the struggle for the control of the ballot box. It would seem that the more failures are made to secure "reform" and good government by the ballot, the firmer does the "faith" of the people grow in the effectiveness of the ballot for that very end.

FOR instance, we now have the "National Christian Citizenship League" out with a "proclamation," that the league, "having declared a national crusade for the purification of public life, the dethronement of evil and the enthronement of the principles of Jesus Christ in these United States, . . . appeals to the pure-minded, true-hearted men and women of the Republic who believe with Charles Sumner that 'righteousness is preservation,' and calls for a million volunteers to enlist for the war and report at once to the national headquarters." The Christian Endeavor forces are marshaling for a like purpose. They expect to succeed where the old parties have failed, because of the fact that they will do their work on a "Christian" basis!
