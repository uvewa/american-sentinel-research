THE Truth Seeker (infidel organ), of October 2, in noticing the late National Reform Convention at Columbus, Ohio, offers the following pertinent suggestions for "reforms" on the basis of that "reform" which is demanded to-day by a large element in the Protestant churches:—

"In its call for a national convention the Reform party flings its constitution to the breeze. The document opens with the substance of the proposed Amendment to the United States Constitution, and among the reasons for adopting that Amendment, recites the following:—

"'Remembering that this country was settled by Christian men, with Christian ends in view, and that they gave a distinctly Christian character to the institutions which they established,' etc.

"Such an argument would afford excuse for some startling 'reforms.' For example, 'this country was settled by' Englishmen; why not, then, acknowledge Great Britain in our Constitution? It was discovered by a Catholic; why not acknowledge the pope? The first settlers brought liquor with them; why not acknowledge brandy to be the national drink? The case seems to be that the National Reformers imagine they are living in colonial days, and are in ignorance that many evils current in those days were guarded against by the Constitution adopted in 1789."
