The following is taken from an article in the *Independent* (N. Y.), of September 23, by a writer who signs himself "One Who Knows:"

"In the discussions, in the *Independent*, on the appointment of chaplains at West Point and in the army these statements have appeared:

"'The present chaplain at West Point was nominated in the usual way, on the recommendation of the Academic Board and the Board of Visitors.'

"'The same rule applied in other cases results in the choice of a Catholic, or a Baptist, or a Methodist, a Presbyterian or other denominationalist. The general preference governs, we suppose.'

"'We had supposed, and we still suppose, that these selections are made in obedience to denominational preferences of officers and men.'

"These statements indicate a lack of reliable information. 'The general preference,' 'the denominational preferences of officers and men,' at local army posts or commands, never govern these selections. In two cases, known to the writer of this, the dominant Protestant Episcopal official element at two army posts secured the appointment of two men of their own faith, and here there was no expression of the 'general preference,' and the 'denominational preferences' of the 'men' were not considered for a moment. In every other instance, for many years past, from personal knowledge, it is believed that army posts and army people have had scarce anything to do with these appointments. They are made just as other appointments to government offices are made—either as a matter of personal favoritism or through political influence.

"And this is one of the sorriest features of this whole business. Whenever a vacancy occurs there are a multitude of applicants for the position, say two or three hundred of them. I could give you the history of a number of these appointments, in which, in several instances, through personal favoritism, incompetent, and even unworthy men have been foisted into this office, who disgraced themselves and the service. In a recent instance a man, who had been an active and influential politician, was appointed chaplain to gratify a warm personal friend and former political associate, who was a member of the president's cabinet, though he was so old when he accepted the position that he had less than five years to serve before retirement on the score of age. Of course no man at that age should be appointed to this position. In another instance a man was appointed who was a local politician, and at the time of his appointment was running a paper in a small town, and who as a minister had no record of success or acceptability entitling him to be considered for such a place; and his appointment was made at the individual request of a relative, who at the time was the most influential member of the president's cabinet, and who desired to provide his sister an assured livelihood. Another was appointed, a worthy man with a good record, in part at least, because he happened to be the pastor of the family of the secretary of war. Another owed his appointment to the fact that he had a brother-in-law prominent in political life, a warm friend of the president's and from the same State. Another, when appointed, had the good fortune to be the son of a congressman, who stood very near the president in his personal and political affiliations. Another had his appointment brought about by the written request of the entire congressional delegation of his State. In another instance the president informed a minister whom he knew well, that he intended to appoint a man of his denomination, and requested him to recommend a man, which he did; and the man was appointed. Another was appointed because he had been chaplain of a regiment during the war, of which the president had been an officer.

"When another was appointed the papers stated that his appointment was due to the fact that he was a boyhood friend of the wife of the president. This man's career was a disgrace for years. He was repeatedly drunk, and was compelled finally to resign or be tried for drunkenness, gambling, and other misconduct. Still another, at the time of his appointment, was a pastor of one of the most aristocratic and fashionable churches. He was a man of polish and a good speaker; but, notwithstanding his church was not at all opposed to the drink customs of fashionable society, this man had become a drunkard of such a character that his church wanted to get rid of him. The president knew him well personally, and his habits and character, and to let him down easily and give his family a livelihood he appointed him a chaplain in the army! As a natural result his conduct was a constant disgrace to the position, and after a brief service he was retired wholly, i. e., dismissed from the service with one year's pay. And, strange as it may seem and hard to be believed, the final, controlling consideration that influenced this man's appointment was the fact that he was a drunkard! Another, whose fitness for the position seems by no means marked, owed his appointment, according to the statement of the papers at the time, to the fact that he was a boyhood friend of the president. The appointment of another was in part influenced by the fact that he gave an address of welcome to President Grant at one time when he visited the city where this man was pastor. Several of the chaplains owe their appointments largely to the fact that they rendered faithful, good service in various positions in the army during the war. Another was the brother of a man very prominent in Washington and who had large influence with the president.

"These instances sufficiently illustrate the manner in which these appointments are made. Others have been made in the recommendation if not, the solicitation of prominent church dignitaries. In addition to cases mentioned above, within a few years past, one other army chaplain has been retired wholly, with drunkenness behind it, another has been compelled to resign because of drunkenness, and another was courtmartialed and convicted for duplicating his pay accounts, with drunkenness behind it all—a sad comment on the manner in which some of these appointments are made. Names and details in all these cases could be given, but that is not necessary or best. Be it said, also, that in spite of this method of appointment, and the terrible records some of them have made, most of the chaplains have been men of ability and good character and life, and are such to-day; but the system of the past still rules in their appointment."

It will be said, of course, that what is needed is a reform in the manner of making these appointments, which will eliminate the baneful factor of personal influence. But we may expect to see this realized when what is known as "pull" shall be divorced from politics. But when will that be?

The root of the whole evil is the principle of State supervision of religion; or in other words, the union of religion and the State. So long as this principle is followed, so long will the fruit of it appear in facts similar to those here set forth.
