We recently published a conversation that Mr. Bunyan had with the clerk who was sent by the authorities to him demanding that he submit to the law as it existed. The real cause of his imprisonment was his refusal to attend the Established Church, and also conducting meetings himself independent of any church that was recognized as such by the government. When it was found that he was really violating the law of the land, an indictment was prepared against him, and at the time of trial, after his arrest, this was read to him, and the question was asked of him, "What say you to this?" Bunyan replied, and then the following conversation took place between him and the judge who was trying the case, which we know our young friends will read with interest, as it shows the noble, true, and yet firm stand this man of God took on the charge made against him. We sincerely trust that if any of the SENTINEL family are called upon to reply to a similar charge, their answers will be as true and bold as were this man's:—

Bunyan.—"I say as to the matter of attending church, I am a frequenter of the church of God."

Judge.—"But you know what we mean,—to the parish church to hear divine services?"

Bunyan.—"No, I do not."

Judge.—"Why not?"

Bunyan.—"Because I do not find it commanded in the Word of God."

Judge.—"We are commanded to pray."

Bunyan.—"Not by the Common Prayer Book, but with the spirit. As the apostle saith, 'I will pray with the spirit, and with the understanding.'"

Judge.—"What do you count prayer? Do you think it is to say a few words over before the people?"

Bunyan.—"No; for men might have many elegant and excellent words, and yet not pray at all; but when a man prayeth, he doth, through a sense of those things which he wants, which sense is begotten by the Spirit, pour out his heart before God through Christ, though his words be not so many and so excellent as others. But yet, notwithstanding, they that have a mind to use the Prayer Book, they have their liberty; I would not keep it from them, nor them from it; for my part I can pray to God without it. Blessed be his name!"

Judge.—"You have no right to preach."

Bunyan.—"I can prove by the First Epistle of Peter 4:10, 11: 'As every man hath received the gift, even so minister the same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God. If any man speak, let him speak as the oracles of God."

Judge.—"If any man has received a gift of tinkering, as thou hast done, let him follow his tinkering; and so other men their trades, and the divine his calling. You may do it in your family, but not otherwise."

Bunyan.—"If it is a good thing to exhort our families, it is a good thing to exhort others; but if you hold it a sin to meet together to seek the face of God, and exhort one another to follow Christ, I will sin still, for this will I do."

Judge.—"Then you confess your indictment, do you?"

Bunyan.—"This I confess: We have had many meetings together, and that we had the sweet, comforting presence of the Lord among us for our encouragement, I confess myself guilty, not otherwise."

Judge.—"Then you must be had back to prison, and there lie for three months, and at the end of three months, if you do not submit to the church to hear divine service, and leave your preaching, you must be banished from the realm, or stretch by the neck, I tell you plainly."

Bunyan.—"As to that matter, if I was out of prison to-day, I would preach the gospel again to-morrow, by the help of God."
