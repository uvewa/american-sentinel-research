New York "Sun," October 5.

John F. Engler, twenty-two years old, of 237 Barrow St., Jersey City, took his gun on Sunday afternoon and went down to the woods at the foot of Claremont avenue in the Greenville section of the city. Game Wardens John Kerr, of Harrison, and George Kelly, of Essex County, who happened to be in the woods looking for violators of the game law, met Engler and arrested him. They haled him before Justice Roe and charged him with violating section 15 of the game law, which provides, "That it shall be unlawful to hunt with a gun, or with a dog, or with any firearms or weapons, or to carry a gun in the fields or the woods on the sabbath day, commonly called Sunday." Justice Roe imposed a fine of $20. Engler refused to pay it and declared that he would take an appeal. The justice then committed him to the county jail for ninety days. Engler will probably make an application for a writ of habeas corpus.
