"This is a Christian nation."—United States Supreme Court.

Three thousand churches in the United States reported not a single conversion during 1896.—New York Independent.

Does the latter statement indorse the first one as being true?

Do all the individuals who comprise this nation so "abide in Him" that they "walk even as He walked?" Is that the reason why the New York Independent makes the above report?

AGAIN: If this is a "Christian nation," then all its citizens must be Christians.

If all its citizens are Christians, then all the acts of its citizens are Christian acts.

This being true, we may expect that since 1892, the year that this nation was officially declared to be "Christian," its life has been patterned after Him who is the Author of Christianity. But what are the facts?

Before the Supreme Court flat of 1892, the record for one year (1891) in murders was 5,906. Since then for the five years following to Dec. 31, 1896, the awful record shows a total of 44,361 murders. A very flattering record, truly!

AGAIN: If this is already a "Christian nation" (and the United States Supreme Court says it is), then Christ must now be enthroned as the nation's head. And this being true(?), was the Christian Endeavor convention at Boston, in 1895, consistent when it set forth as the purpose of that vast organization, "To enthrone Christ in every town and city; . . . to have every mayor and councilman a Christian, then Christ will rule"?

"What a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for"?
