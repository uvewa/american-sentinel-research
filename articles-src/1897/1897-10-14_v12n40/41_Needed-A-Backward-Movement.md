*"Christian Endeavorer" for September.*

We have come into peculiar times—the "last days" of this age—when the church has to a lamentable extent departed from its God-honored methods of working. Our religious life has degenerated into a life of "movements" and "conventions" and "organizations;" men's meetings and women's meetings; sunrise prayer meetings and Junior Endeavor prayer-meetings and old folks' prayer-meetings, and a list of other names that tax the capacity of our Sunday services. From morning to night we are in one ceaseless round of public meetings. We need to return to the days of personal private devotion.

This lack of home religion is to no small degree responsible for the lack of *true* religion in public. We may be behind the times, but we want to enter a protest against the spectacular performances and sacred(?) concerts that have taken the place of the regular Sunday evening services. We plead for holy living in the homes, and honest, fearless declaration of the will of God in the church. We are wearied with "boy preachers," "singing evangelists," "ex-priests," "converted nuns," "stereopticon lectures," etc., etc., and yearn for the plain preachers of righteousness.

The absence of that which made the early Christians strong has made room for the worldliness that is so predominant in so many churches. The church has entered the arena of attractions, and seeks to gather men together by very poor imitations of that which is not worth imitating, and the result will surely prove that the policy is shortsighted. In exact proportion as people look upon the church as an "amusement bureau," or as a theater from which evil has been expurgated, will they lose interest in the church as a revealer of the will of God. In its earnestness to make itself popular the church has lost sight of the fact that the only mission ever marked out for its ministers is to be found in the commission given to them: "Go ye therefore into all the world, and preach the gospel unto every creature."

We need a "backward movement." Selling strawberries and cream in hot weather and oyster stews in cold weather, and voting on the most popular minister in the town, or the prettiest young lady in the church, may be in harmony with the present order of things, but the question arises, "Is the present order of things in harmony with the will of God?" Let us return to the former order of things. "Ask now of the days that are past." When the church was poor, was it not then rich? Then every man gave as the Lord prospered him, and the whole responsibility of the church's finances was thus thrown up on God.
